GOV. TIM WALZ, D-MINN, VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ:  First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ:  He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself. Violent crime was up under Donald Trump. That's not even counting the crimes he committed. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  That was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the new number-two on the Democratic ticket. That was at an event last night in Philadelphia. Today, Harris and Walz on their way to Wisconsin for some key stops in swing states.
 
With us now, CNN political commentator Paul Begala, and former deputy communications director for the Trump-Pence campaign, Bryan Lanza. 
 
Gentlemen, I'm so glad you're here mostly because I intend to take this segment off and let you two just have an informed, intelligent discussion. 
 
But let me start it off with this, Paul. The rollout, so far, the best and worst parts of it?
 
PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST (via Webex by Cisco):  There hasn't been a worst part yet. Everybody makes mistakes and I'm sure Gov. Walz will, but he hasn't yet. The best part is they rejected this whole myth that your vice presidential pick should be based on electoral help, right? The Democrats haven't lost Minnesota in a presidential year in 50 years, so you didn't (INAUDIBLE) that.
 
Vice President Harris picked Gov. Walz I believe because of who he is and what he represents. What he represents is the best of middle-class middle America. I mean, he's a coach. He's a teacher. He's a soldier. He's -- by the way, he's a hunter, which means guys like me still have a place in the Democratic Party. I love that this race is now -- it couldn't be a better contrast.
 
I've complained for years about the Democrats becoming the party of the faculty lounge instead of the factory floor. This is a -- this is a farm guy. He grew up on a farm in Nebraska. He's comfortable wearing a Carhartt coat and a -- and a blaze orange hat. You know, the only blaze orange you're doing to see Donald Trump in is maybe a prison jumpsuit.
 
BERMAN:  Bryan?
 
BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP-PENCE CAMPAIGN, PARTNER, MERCURY PUBLIC AFFAIRS:  I mean, listen, they chose somebody who sort of pushes Kamala to the left. I mean, they -- I would say the Democratic Party had a good chance and Kamala had a good chance of nominating Shapiro, which would have locked up Pennsylvania, which would have made it very difficult for President Trump to win. But instead, she buckled to liberal progressive pressure and went against -- you know, went against somebody who would have almost guaranteed her presidential victory.
 
That just goes to show you a) who Kamala Harris is, and b) who Tim Walz is. This is somebody who governed from the far left -- not the center. He's not a moderate Democrat. He governed as a far-left person. He didn't see a single whacky liberal Democratic bill that passed the Legislature he didn't sign. 
 
So extreme -- the guy has become so extreme that he actually signed legislation to put tampons in boy's bathrooms in elementary school. That's not mainstream America. That's not Michigan, that's not Pennsylvania, and that's not Wisconsin. 
 
So I think with their pick they decided to go full-on left, sort of double-downing on whacky San Francisco values. And I just don't think that's going to fly with the American people.
 
BERMAN:  All right, Paul. What do you say to that?
 
BEGALA:  The guy went to Chadron State College. This is the heart of the middle class. By the way, I want that. It's a Chadron State Eagle and, of course, a Howard Buffalo running against a Penn Quaker and a Yake -- I guess they're like investment bankers or something. I think that's their --
 
BERMAN:  Bulldog. Bulldog.
 
BEGALA:  -- team mascot. Oh, is that what it is? Bulldog. OK.
 
BERMAN:  Yeah.
 
BEGALA:  I thought it was --
 
LANZA:  Don't forget Ohio State, Paul.
 
BEGALA:  I look -- and Ohio State is to be respected, and I do. They're great. I remember going up there and watching the Texans beat them. So I have always liked Ohio State because they lost. 
 
But getting back -- getting back though to the race, OK? This guy speaks right to the heart of the middle class -- Tim Walz. I think the Republicans don't know what to do. You heard Bryan. They're going to try to make this about ideology. It's just not going to be possible to take a guy who -- yeah, he has radical positions like that no child should go hungry at school. Like that no woman should be denied the right to choose how to control her body. Like that no working person should work full time and still be in poverty. They should get a minimum wage.
 
These -- this is what the Democratic Party was built on and I think Walz is very much a return back to the mainstream -- I'm from the Clinton wing of the party. I'm not from the progressive left. I could not be happier with his pick.
 
BERMAN:  Let me play, Bryan, a little bit of sound from Gov. Walz and how he describes now his running mate and kind of where he sees this campaign -- listen.
 <br>[07:35:03]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALZ:  Thank you for bringing back the joy. Don't ever underestimate the power of this. She does it all with a sense of joy. This leader, this compassionate, careful, joyous leader.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN:  All right, a lot of joy there and people are going to hear me say this over the course of the show today. I think subtlety is going in politics. So the fact that Tim Walz said that three times, Bryan, do you think that he perceives sort of a happy problem for the Republicans right now? Not a lot of joy coming from the Republican ticket.
 
LANZA:  I mean, listen, I would say it's sort of reflective of him sort of dodging the misery that's actually hit the working class, that's actually hit the middle class. I mean, those families are not experiencing joy under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. 
 
Those families are struggling and they're being drowned out by inflation. Those families are watching the border being invaded by 15 million illegal aliens. Those families are watching two wars and thinking when is the third one going to start, and that their own kids -- so their own sons and daughters are going to be serving in another war.
 
Listen, there's a lot of things to be proud of in this country but the disconnect that he thinks there's joy in this economy that's crippled the middle class and working class just goes to show you the disconnect that he has with America and, specifically, the Midwest.
 
BERMAN:  Paul?
 
BEGALA:  Well, Mr. Trump has always been a man of joy. We know that. He's a quintessential happy warrior, isn't he?
 
Like, the notion of combining the word Trump and joy is preposterous. He's driven by grievance, division, and sometimes even hate. That's a strong word. A strong dislike of people who are not exactly like him. And Mr. Vance -- Sen. Vance doubles down on that. 
 
He seems -- both of them are very interested in judging everybody else. Like, judging a woman if she wants to control her own body. Judging people who don't have kids. I've got four, so I guess I get more votes than J.D. Vance because he wants people with children to have more votes. That's preposterous.
 
But, you know, George Washington never had any kids. By the way, Clarence Thomas, who is a great conservative -- he never fathered any children. So what the hell?
 
They just seem to be so angry. And I watched the Republican Convention and they all seemed to have sucked the same lemon, except Hulk Hogan who did seem like he was having a good time. Everybody else -- they're just angry and bitter. 
 
And I love that now the party of patriotism, of celebrating that America is the greatest country in the world -- by the way, we're kicking butt in the Olympics -- that's now the Democratic Party. Because there have been times when the Democrats are a little too sour for my taste. 
 
Believe me, this is a joyful pair. This is a joyful campaign. It's a joyful ticket. And you just -- you don't get that from the Republicans. You just get more hate, more division, more prejudice, and more judgmentalism. 
 
BERMAN:  Paul Begala, Bryan Lanza, great to see both of you. Thanks for playing -- appreciate it -- Sara.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  All right.
 
Despite instability, global markets bounced back overnight. Japanese shares reversed early losses as a central bank official is downplaying chances of an immediate hike in interest rates. And here at home, the Dow, S&amp;P, and Nasdaq each closed up on Tuesday after a terrible fall on Monday. Is the market righting itself or is it still fighting to stabilize?
 
Let's bring in our CNN Business anchor Julia Chatterley. Julia, does the global -- what's happening globally really have an impact on what we're going to see as the opening bell?
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE:  Yes, and yes. Yes, it does, and yes, we're still fighting I think for stability. 
 
It's good to see green on the screen, but these are big moves. I'd be more comfortable if actually, we saw smaller gains and obviously, smaller losses on down days. So we need to see some more sessions of stability rather than big swings, which still makes me cautious.
 
The most important takeaway from this really is if you've got a 401(k), please don't panic on down days. Please don't panic because you miss these upswings.
 
Now, what are we watching? Three main things to keep an eye on.
 
The U.S. economy. We need more clarity on the data to understand how big this slowdown is. We just have to wait for that.
 
The second, tech stocks. Look at this.
 
SIDNER:  Hmm.
 
CHATTERLEY:  These were all up yesterday and then they sold lower into the close. We need to see stability in these big AI tech stocks before we can say that the volatility is over.
 
The third thing, why the heck should we care about Japan here in the United States? Unfortunately, we need to. A lot of people borrowed money in Japan over the last two decades and invested in things like U.S. stocks. Then the Japanese started raising interest rates. That money then sucked out and it shook down our stocks, too, and our economy if it -- if it continues.
 
When the central bank governor in Japan says look, we're not going to do anything else if we've got this stability, that has a calming effect. And that's helping here --
 
SIDNER:  Oh.
 
CHATTERLEY:  -- and it's helping in the United States as well.
 
But we need clarity on all of these things. And we'd like to know the U.S. election result and we'd like the losses of geopolitical risk, yada, yada, yada. Not summer months as well because lots of people are on the beach.
 <br>[07:40:00]
 
SIDNER:  You're asking for a lot, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I -- hey, I love to ask. And then hopefully, we'll calm down a bit. But there's still a lot to watch.
 
SIDNER:  Yeah, there's a lot to watch. As you said, big swings either way can create a problem --
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yeah.
 
SIDNER:  -- even though it looks good when it swings up as opposed to down.
 
CHATTERLEY:  But please don't panic with your 401(k).
 
SIDNER:  Don't panic. 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yeah.
 
SIDNER:  That's the word of the day. Don't panic, John Berman - don't panic.
 
CHATTERLEY:  No p-words. No p-words here. 
 
SIDNER:  John Berman, thank you so much. We didn't say the r-word either.
 
BERMAN:  I'm just (INAUDIBLE) when it swings either way.
 
All right. This morning, South Carolina is bracing for a new hit from Tropical Storm Debby. It is just offshore refueling over the Atlantic. It could make a new landfall tomorrow.
 
In Charleston, some areas saw nearly a foot of water with more than a million people now in the path of possible tornadoes.
 
CNN's Ryan forever Young is in Charleston this morning. What are you seeing there, Ryan?
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I'll tell you this, John. A lot of people are -- they're happy. There's a sigh of relief going on right now because all that water people were talking about -- a lot of it has receded already and people are already out jogging. They're walking their dogs. They believe that most of the storm that they worried about has already passed.
 
If you look this direction, this is Ashley River Walk. And this, a lot of times, has all the water that sort of rushes into the city and makes it hard for people to get around. But as we've been walking and talking to people today, they really believe that the preparation they had really helped them out.
 
In fact, we have one resident right here who's standing with us. You said to us that you really think Charleston missed the bad one here because you were concerned for quite some time.
 
AMANDA FORD, CHARLESTON RESIDENT:  Oh, gosh, yeah -- yeah. The leadup to what might have been was terrifying.
 
YOUNG:  On this street alone, it's flooded before and it's gone pretty high. Is that correct?
 
FORD:  Oh, yeah, that's Wentworth. Oh, absolutely. And Beaufain is where I live and the river just flows right up Beaufain Street, and it's just unbelievable. YOUNG:  And we've talked to other residents and said look, the pumps that the city has installed have really helped knock some of the water out. When you heard that, how did you feel about the idea that preparation was really in place this time?
 
FORD:  Oh, better than ever. I feel our new mayor has done an excellent job in taking care of us with a curfew, and closed streets, and barricades, and really taking this seriously because we needed to. 
 
YOUNG:  Perfect (PH).
 
FORD:  And the garages open for cars to get out of the streets.
 
YOUNG:  Thank you so much. 
 
And that was the other thing, John. A lot of people took their cars from areas that normally flood and put it in garages. That they were free. They could get them up out of the water. 
 
So look, right now, they're talking about they missed one here, and that's good news. So right now, people are smiling. They're wondering what's going to happen next with all the tornado warnings.
 
BERMAN:  Relief on Beaufain Street and respect for the hat that you continue to wear. Ryan Young, great to see you this morning. Thank you very much -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  All right. In just seconds, this went from a spark to full- blown house fire, and it happened because a dog used a lithium battery as a chew toy. Bad dog. The warnings from firefighters about this though this morning that you should heed.
 
And Simone Biles explains what she hopes this viral Olympic moment will mean for millions of young people.
 
Those stories and more ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:47:38]
 
SIDNER:  Donald Trump and his team already on the offensive against Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz. 
 
This was President Trump just moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  And I'm going to be doing that. And what he's doing -- he wants -- if you look at his record with no wall, no security, let everybody in. He's worse than they are. You know, nobody knew how radical left she was but he's a smarter version of her, if you want to know the truth. 
 
He's probably about the same as Bernie Sanders. He's probably more (audio gap). He is more so than Bernie Sanders. That's got to be your guide -- Bernie Sanders -- and it's not a great guide. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  All right. Joining me now, House Majority Whip, Republican Congressman Tom Emmer of Minnesota. Thank you, sir, for coming in this morning. 
 
Just -- you know, my curiosity because you're hearing this from Donald Trump, and these are some of the attack lines that we expect to see. What do you make of Tim Walz's first rally after being chosen as Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate?
 
REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN) (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Tim is a great talker. And by the way, Sara, thanks for having me.
 
Tim's a great talker but you've got to look at his actions. I mean, in fact, this guy who tries to come across as the affable Midwesterner is a left-wing radical who under his failed leadership in just six short years in my state of Minnesota -- we've seen taxes skyrocket. We've seen violent crime at record highs. In Minnesota, families are worse off. Literally, he is incredibly pulling the ticket to the far left. 
 
SIDNER:  You tweeted this about Tim Walz, saying that he turned Minnesota into a liberal wasteland. So I guess the question is why do you think Minnesotans re-elected Tim Walz as their governor for a second term in 2022?
 
EMMER:  Well, the bottom line is this is a guy who taxed -- billed Minnesotans an additional $8 billion in new taxes and fees after blowing through $17.5 billion in surplus. He has now put our state on a path to economic disaster.
 
This is a guy who -- by the way, you guys have got to investigate the feeding our future.
 
SIDNER:  But Congressman -- but, Congressman, can you just answer -- can you do me a favor. Congressman, do me a favor and answer the question. Why do you think Minnesotans re-elected him with all the things that you're saying about him that are -- that are negative and attacking some of the things that he has done policy-wise, not personality wise, because you agree he's got a pretty big and affable personality. But why do you think Minnesotans seem to disagree with you about what he has done in their state?
 <br>[07:50:15]
 
EMMER:  Well, you need to come to Minnesota. Tim Walz is finally going to be exposed.
 
SIDNER:  But we just looked at the election results, though. The election results tell you something, don't they?
 
EMMER:  Tim Walz is a (PH) sweetheart much like Kamala Harris, Sara. The media -- the mainstream media gives these people a pass. They don't call out what they actually stand for. They don't point out that under Tim Walz's leadership the Minneapolis
 
 Police Department is 40 percent down in manpower. That he wanted to move money away from the police. This is the reason you see the violent crime at record highs in Minnesota.
 
The economy has been wracked in Minnesota. He's not going to make it through a third term. It's never going to happen. 
 
Tim Walz is a great pick for the Republicans. It is just to enhance the radical left shift. And the choice is going to be really simple this fall. You can either go with four more years of this 20 percent inflation. You can have a wide-open border. You can have who knows how many wars around the world.
 
Or you can go back to an economy that was prosperous under Donald Trump. You can go back to a border that was sealed and crime was under control under Donald Trump. You can go back to peace and stability around the world. 
 
Quite short, Sara, this is the America First agenda that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are offering versus the America Last agenda that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will be offering.
 
SIDNER:  Congressman Emmer, when you look at the actual statistics, the numbers are actually down for violent crime in Minnesota and across the country for the past -- it's better than the past almost 50 years if you look at the FBI statistics, the Department of Public Safety in Minnesota. Across the country, crime is actually down quite a bit. I think it's 13 percent or 15 percent if you look at the new numbers in the first quarter.
 
So why do you keep saying crime is rampant there when the numbers show differently?
 
EMMER:  It is. Sara, I don't know where you're getting your statistics from.
 
SIDNER:  From the FBI and the Department of Public Safety. 
 
EMMER:  Homicides are up dramatically in Minnesota. No, I'm telling you. You can play whatever games you want with the numbers. Assaults are up. Carjackings are up. Murder is up.
 
And by the way, we've got a vice presidential candidate who the last time he teamed up with Kamala Harris they allowed Minneapolis to burn down. He didn't call out the National Guard even though he'd been asked to by the mayor of Minneapolis. He allowed the city to burn. 
 
And then what did Kamala Harris do? She helped bail these criminals out of jail. Two of them went on to commit murder.
 
So I don't -- you can play whatever games you want with statistics. The fact is crime in Minnesota is at -- violent crime is at record highs.
 
SIDNER:  You believe in law and order, correct? That has been something that you have been -- talked about quite a bit in your term.
 
EMMER:  I think we all should.
 
SIDNER:  And so I do want to ask you about the candidate that you're supporting that calls the January 6 attackers hostages and says he will pardon them. 
 
And I want to give you a taste of what he recently -- the most recent time that he talked about this issue with the January 6 attackers on the Capitol. Here's what he said at the NABJ conference last week. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  My question is on those rioters who assaulted officers.
 
TRUMP:  The people that tried to bring -- excuse me. You have to answer --
 
SCOTT:  Would you pardon those people?
 
TRUMP:  What's going to happen -- oh, absolutely I would. If they're innocent --
 
SCOTT:  You would pardon those --
 
TRUMP:  If they're innocent, I would pardon them.
 
SCOTT:  They've been convicted.
 
TRUMP:  And by the way, the --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  Do you agree with Donald Trump that he should pardon those, as he said absolutely, I'll pardon them -- the people that she specifically pointed out where responsible for attacking 140 officers who were injured there?
 
EMMER:  Yeah. I mean, let's keep in mind that we were told democracy is going to be on the ballot and it absolutely is. But it's not the Republicans that are a threat to democracy; it's actually the other side. 
 
You've got Kamala Harris who didn't get one vote. What a democratic process. And she's going to be the Democrats' candidate going into the fall. This couldn't set up better for November, Sara. 
 
EMMER:  Congressman Tom Emmer, thank you so much for coming on and taking time with us this morning. I appreciate it -- John.
 
BERMAN:  All right. New details this morning about a foiled murder- for-hire plot against U.S. officials and former U.S. officials, including Donald Trump. According to court documents, a 46-year-old man from Pakistan is now in federal custody accused of traveling to New York and working with hitmen to carry out his plan. 
 
CNN national security reporter Zach Cohen is with us with the details here. Zach, what are you learning?
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  Yeah, John, prosecutors say that this Pakistani nation actually had ties to the Iranian government and that he traveled to New York and aimed to hire hitmen to carry out these political assassinations. Now, we're told by a U.S. official that the FBI believes that Donald Trump and several other former and current U.S. officials were believed to be the targets of this foiled murder-for-hire plot.
 <br>[07:55:00]
 
The individual's name is Asif Merchant. He is, as we said, a Pakistani national with ties to Iran. He came to the U.S. earlier this year and contacted someone he believed could help him facilitate or hire people to carry out not only murder but also various other politically motivated and politically targeted operations. 
 
Unfortunately, the person that he was speaking to turned around and told the FBI what Merchant was planning. That individual started acting as a confidential source for the FBI and eventually, that led to Merchant's arrest as we learned yesterday in these unsealed court documents.
 
Now, I want to note that this is separate from the incident and the shooting -- the assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life at the Butler, PA rally, but the timing is seen by the FBI as a coincidence. Still, this Iranian threat has led to an increase in security for Donald Trump.
 
BERMAN:  All right, Zach Cohen. Thanks so much for sharing that reporting. Appreciate it -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  All right.
 
On our radar this morning for you, four hotel workers charged with murder in connection with the death of a Black man outside a Milwaukee hotel. His name was D'Vontaye Mitchell and he was 43 years old. 
 
The encounter was caught on surveillance cameras, and I do want to warn you that the footage is disturbing to watch. We have shown you this before. This is the footage of what happened that day. Court documents say hotel workers held Mitchell down -- you see there -- after they say he entered the building in sort of a frantic state and tried to lock himself inside a women's bathroom and became combative with security.
 
The autopsy revealed Mitchell died from restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. The manner of death was determined to be homicide.
 
His mother said she believes Mitchell was suffering from a mental health episode that day.
 
And Squad member Cori Bush loses her Democratic primary against St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell. This secures another win for the pro-Israel group that also helped oust Rep. Jamal Bowman just weeks ago in New York but were critical of Israel's war against Hamas.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. CORI BUSH (D-MO):  Pulling me away from my position as congresswoman -- all you did was take some of the strings off. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  Bush will, of course, remain in her seat until January of next year.
 
And a good PSA. Watch out what you're leaving around your pets. Uh-oh. The Tulsa Fire Department released this video as a warning for how you should store your lithium ion batteries. It became a chew toy here for that sweet little doggie and things went off the rails from there. 
 
Watch what happens as he's chewing on that lithium ion battery. Oh, boy. A spark and a boom. The dog bed quickly catches fire and it spreads quickly. 
 
All of this caught on the family's home security system. Thankfully, nobody was injured, including that rather guilty looking dog. But remember to keep those batteries away from your pets and your children -- John.
 
BERMAN:  And your friends, Sara. 
 
SIDNER:  And your friends.
 
BERMAN:  All right.
 
This morning, what could possibly top the unforgettable Olympic performance for gymnast Simone Biles? The only thing I can think of is a one-on-one conversation with CNN's Coy Wire -- watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  An iconic moment -- the podium.
 
SIMONE BILES, 7-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST:  Yeah.
 
WIRE:  Bowing down to Rebeca there. 
 
Young girls out there today are getting torn apart left and right -- torn down. How important was it for you to show the world it's OK to adjust each other's crowns?
 
BILES:  No, absolutely. I think it was really important for that moment. Obviously, it was just me and Jordan being me and Jordan, but I know it was really special and it was very impactful for kids to see that. You win with grace; you lose with grace.
 
WIRE:  Yeah. This iconic moment -- this Games, in my opinion, was when you clapped back at some people talking about your appearance. 
 
BILES:  Yeah. WIRE:  And young girls deal with that all the time.
 
BILES:  Yeah.
 
WIRE:  The stress to fit in. 
 
What is your message to those young girls out there who might be --
 
BILES:  Yeah.
 
WIRE:  -- feeling like they're not enough or they're not fitting in?
 
BILES:  You guys are beautiful, confident. You guys are so smart. Stand in your power, believe in yourself, and you guys are going to be just fine. And I'll be here to support you every step of the way. I know it's hard, but you guys are going to do it, and you're going to do big things.
 
WIRE:  Incredible. 
 
All right. Does times top when you're 12 feet in the air flipping through the air? For us mere mortals, can we just close our eyes and walk me through what you're feeling and what you're sensing as you're flipping through one of your wildest maneuvers?
 
BILES:  Honestly, sometimes it feels like time goes really fast. Like, the floor comes sooner than it should. But most of the time it does feel like you're out there for a while and you're just waiting to come back down.
 
WIRE:  OK.
 
BILES:  But it is really exciting.
 
WIRE:  What would you say your spirit animal is or your spirit character that switched the flips when you have to go out there and dominate, and that thing --
 
BILES:  OK.
 
WIRE:  -- that's allowed you to win --
 
BILES:  Yeah.
 
WIRE:  -- 11 Olympic medals?
 
BILES:  OK. So I think mine would actually be a honey badger. Like, honey badger in the gym, a sloth outside.
 
WIRE:  OK. Slothy Simone.
 
BILES:  Yeah.
 
WIRE:  I think you need a new chain now. That one's pretty dope.
 
BILES:  Thanks. WIRE:  All right. Now you've some time to enjoy your family, especially your husband Jonathan Owens. You get to enjoy some football.
 
BILES:  Yes.
 
WIRE:  He's been here supporting you. Are you going to be at his games being the hype woman for him?
 
BILES:  Yes, absolutely. I feel like I'm his biggest supporter besides some of our other family.
