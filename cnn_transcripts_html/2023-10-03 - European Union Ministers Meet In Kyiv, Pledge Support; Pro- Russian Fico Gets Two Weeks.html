ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church.
 
Just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. The E.U. makes an historic show of support for Ukraine, with officials from across the block gathering in Kyiv, pledging more military aid.
 
But here in the U.S. a cloud of uncertainty hangs over America's ongoing support, as funding for Ukraine aid gets caught up in Washington's political infighting.
 
Plus, inside the campaign preserve a much beloved park in Tokyo. Why organizers say the fight is about much more than just one city park?

ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM WITH ROSEMARIE CHURCH.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us.
 
Ukraine is expected to top the agenda, as NATO leaders gather in the coming hours for the annual Warsaw Security Forum. It follows a strong show of support for Ukraine from European Union foreign ministers. They met for the first time in a non-member nation on Monday, gathering in Kyiv.
 
Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell is proposing a $5.25 billion aid package for Ukraine in 2024. He says the block support is long term and does not depend on one day battlefield advances.
 
Ukraine's president addressed the meeting, calling for more sanctions against Russia, and closer cooperation with the European Union.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF, EUROPEAN UNION: Our resolve to support the fight of freedom and independence of Ukraine is firm and will continue.
 
The strongest security commitments that we can give to Ukraine is European Union membership.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: The E.U. foreign ministers paid tribute to Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russian invasion. They laid flowers at a memorial wall in Kyiv and held a moment of silence.
 
Well, meantime, in the U.S., President Joe Biden says he fully expects Congress to approve new funding for Ukraine. Over the weekend, Congress stripped future spending for Ukraine from a bill to fund the government and avert a shutdown.
 
The U.S. State Department calls that unacceptable.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESMAN, UNITED STATES STATE DEPARTMENT: If we allow authoritarians like President Putin to do whatever they want to other sovereign countries, then, the whole U.N. Charter will be shredded, and we are going to live in a world where this kind of aggression can happen anywhere, anytime. That would be far more expensive for the American people and far more dangerous for the American people.
 
We cannot, under any circumstances allow America support for Ukraine to be interrupted. Our allies, our adversaries, and the world will be watching.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Nada. So, what is the significance of Monday's meeting in Kyiv, especially, given the uncertainty of the ongoing U.S. funding for Ukraine?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: You're absolutely right, Rosemary. I mean, the timing of this is significant. And on the symbolic front, this meeting of E.U. foreign ministers within Ukraine is deeply symbolic.
 
This was the first time that the Foreign Affairs Council was held opened in Kyiv, in Ukraine. Of course, that we heard from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday, Dmytro Kuleba, he described this meeting as not necessarily taking place within E.U. borders at this point right now, but, in his words, in future E.U. borders.
 
So, deeply symbolic on that front. And, of course, we heard from the European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, he spoke about this as being an expression of the will and the commitment of E.U. member states to continue supporting Ukraine, particularly, of course, on the heels of that somewhat controversial decision taken by the U.S. Congress to not include provisions for additional funding for Ukraine in that emergency budget.
 
But, of course, we have had renewed and vocal expressions of support from E.U. leaders, particularly when it comes to funding. Take a listen to this statement from the German Foreign Minister speaking yesterday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANNALENA BAERBOCK, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): With this foreign council of E.U. foreign ministers, we are taking the European Union to where the heart of Europe beat strongest at the moment; here and Kyiv, here in Ukraine.
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
Ukraine's future lies in the European Union, in our community of freedom. And it will soon stretch from Lisbon to Luhansk, with every village, with every meter that Ukraine liberates, with every meter where it saves its people. It also paves its way into the European Union.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: Now, of course, there were no official conclusions or agreements made at this meeting was not technically an official meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council given that it did take place outside of E.U. premises. But we have seen some practical movement on discussions around the Ukraine's future accession to the European Union or prospects around Ukraine's future accession.
 
We heard from the Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, saying that there were discussions around this, positive indications he believes that the E.U. and Ukraine are on the same page in terms of those negotiations. And it's hopeful that those negotiations can begin before the end of this year. So, significant developments are on that front.
 
There are, of course, very stringent requirements when it comes to accession to the European Union and Ukraine will be no exception despite the circumstances. We know that recommendations have been put forward for reform by the European Union.
 
Kuleba spoke about these yesterday, and these include measures such as tackling corruption, money laundering, press freedoms, and minority rights in Ukraine. But he is hopeful that those negotiations will begin soon.
 
Of course, Josep Borrell, the E.U. foreign affairs chief, describing Russia's aggression against Ukraine as an existential threat to the European Union as a whole.
 
CHURCH: And Nada, what will likely come out of the NATO defense minister meeting in Poland later today at the Warsaw security conference?
 
BASHIR: Look, this is a two-day summit. We are expecting to see a number of panels discussions talks between foreign ministers and defense ministers from across the European Union. There will be a significant focus, of course, as anticipated on Ukraine. That will be high on the agenda. But also, on strengthening NATO's collective defense capabilities in the face of continued aggression from Russia.
 
So, that will be high on the agenda. Those talks have to continue into tomorrow. And, of course, this comes ahead of an official NATO Summit, which is set to convene in Brussels and next week. So, there will be of course important focus and coordinate talks, leading up to that official summit next week.
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Nada Bashir, joining us live from London. Appreciate it.
 
Well, to turn now to Slovakia, where a pro-Russian leader has won the parliamentary election and has been given two weeks to form a government. The victory is important because, as you see on this map, Ukraine is bordered by Russia to the east and Slovakia to the west.
 
Now, as Robert Fico tries to build a coalition government. There's a new focus on his comments against sending arms to Ukraine.
 
CNN's Nic Robertson has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Robert Fico, Slovakia's pro-Putin populist leader has been here before. 2006, 2010, and 2016, winning the biggest vote share in national elections. 22.9 percent. But not enough for his Smer-SD party to govern alone.
 
As they did, following the elections in 2012, he's challenge now, build a governing coalition. The clock is ticking, he has two weeks.
 
ROBERT FICO, LEADER, SMER PARTY (through translator): I want to say to all Slovakia that we are ready. We are enlightened and we are more experienced in the fight we have taken.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): If he succeeds, it would be his third-term as prime minister, and could have a big impact beyond Slovakia's borders. Fico's no weapons to Ukraine policy would be a massive U-turn, potentially, ending Slovakia's stalwart support for its neighbor.
 
FICO: We are ready to help Ukraine humanitarianly. We are ready to help in the restoration of the states. But our opinion on arming Ukraine does not change.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): For now, no change in Slovakia's Ukraine policy, the current technocrat foreign minister in Kyiv, with his E.U. counterparts pledging continuity.
 
MIROSLAV WLACHOVSKY, SLOVAKIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: We came here to express our full support for sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Reality is, his replacement in a feat so led government may rankle E.U. unity and not just over Ukraine.
 
Ahead of this election, European Commission vice president, Vera Jourova warned Russia's disinformation is rampant in Slovakia.
 
VERA JOUROVA, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR VALUES AND TRANSPARENCY: They speak about dangerous campaigns, which is misleading, which can do harm to the society, which can radicalize the society, and which can radically change the election's result.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): It's too soon to know if Jourova's fears were realized.
 <br>[02:10:02]
 
But pro-Putin sentiment is already strong. Most Slovaks don't blame him for invading Ukraine.
 
If Fico fails to build a coalition as he did in 2010, other parties are confident they can muster the 75 seats, and the 150-member parliament needed -- 
 
MICHAL SIMECKA, LEADER, PROGRESSIVE SLOVAKIA: Realistically there are two options, you know, at the table. One is the government led by Mr. Fico, and the other one is a coalition made up of progressive Slovakian and other partners which would in fact, have over 80 M.P.s.
 
ROBERTS (voice over): For now, though, it's Fico and the driving seat, potentially putting him on a collision course with European leaders, something sure to please Putin.
 
Nic Robertson, CNN, London.

CHURCH: CNN European Affairs commentator, Dominic Thomas, joins me now. Good to have you with us.
 
DOMINIC THOMAS, CNN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Thanks for having me on, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: So, Slovakia's president has asked populist former Prime Minister Robert Fico, to try to form a coalition government after winning early parliamentary election. So, what form might that coalition take do you think? And what could it mean, ultimately, for Slovakia's relations to the rest of Europe?
 
THOMAS: Yes. So, the road to power in Slovakia is 76 seats. No party managed to get that. And none of the top three parties able to move forward without creating, therefore, these kinds of complex coalition.
 
So, Fico has an opportunity here by just joining up with two political parties to be able to move forward. And I think that the likelihood is that he'll move with the party that came third in this election that is known as Voice.
 
That is an outgrowth of his party and with whom they share these very important issues that played out in the election, which is the interruption of military aid and support for conflict in Ukraine, the end to sanctions on Russia, and for arguing for peaceful talks and negotiations. Highly controversial points.
 
And all they would need if those two parties that have been partners before to join up would be at one of the smaller parties, probably the Nationalist Party of Slovakia would join up with them.
 
For the party that came in second, they would need three more coalition parties. Their positions are diametrically opposed in the sense of their allegiance to European Union and to European Union talking points.
 
And I think it would be an uphill struggle for them, Rosemary to be able to move forward and create a stable coalition government.
 
CHURCH: Dominic, as you touched on, Fico pledged to end support for Ukraine. So, what could his coalition government mean if he's able to form it for Russia's war on Ukraine?
 
THOMAS: Yes. Well, this is a very complicated situation, because they are essentially ran a campaign, which in many ways, was sort of taking the pulse on how these issues would play out in a national context.
 
Those particular talking points pertaining to Russia, end of support for Ukraine are diametrically opposed to the positions of the European Union on these questions.
 
The European Union and NATO, I should add, have been very clear on this. In this particular conflict, there is a clear aggressor, it is Russia, and there is a country that has been illegally occupied, and that is Ukraine.
 
Moving to a negotiating table, even though everybody hopes for peace is essentially to argue, without Russia having been withdrawn, that somehow both parties have a legitimate claim.
 
This is a very risky proposition. It sets an awful precedent in terms of invasion. But I think the bigger issue, Rosemary here is that we see a kind of fracture, developing amongst European Union member countries on these particular questions.
 
And we know that the Russian propagandist's machine has been very adept at exploiting these kinds of polarizing issues.
 
CHURCH: And Dominic, what do we need to know about Robert Fico, and of course, his relationship with Russia's President Vladimir Putin?
 
THOMAS: Yes. Well, I mean, these are, like, for example, all ban in Hungary, political leaders that have a track record of walking a very fine line between adherence to European to the European Union from which the country benefits exponentially, financially, while at the same time, not so much being in their sphere of influence of Russia, back working along the principles of a kind of sympathy, and a sort of nostalgia, and for that kind of relationship. And in this particular concept -- context of conflict in which neutrality is simply not an option, those particular positions are problematic when it comes to the broader question of E.U. and NATO, and how they want to go about handling this.
 <br>[02:15:03]
 
And we see this particular figure, therefore, as disrupting the focus of the E.U. and NATO on these particular questions.
 
CHURCH: And what do you think the outcome of this election means in terms of the sentiment across Slovakia?
 
THOMAS: Well, I think that you have a very divided and very polarized country. And I think that you see this in a lot of European elections. The fact that coalitions have been so very difficult to forge, that you have a proliferation of smaller political parties, I think reflects the ways in which these kinds of fractures are there.
 
And as I said earlier, this particular election allowed us to take a pulse on these particular issues, in a context, in which, many other questions are shaping debates in the European Union today, around immigration, cost of living, and inflation. And we can see some of the support for Ukraine for a neighbor and partner in the European Union here dwindling.
 
And I think that moving forward, especially with the shadow of the Polish election coming up in two weeks-time, that there is a lot of uncertainty, therefore, moving forward in the European Union and NATO ranks when it comes to these sorts of questions.
 
CHURCH: Dominic Thomas, always a pleasure to get your analysis. Many thanks.
 
THOMAS: Thank you.
 
CHURCH: More than two years after a presidential assassination plunged the Caribbean nation of Haiti into deadly violence and political chaos, the U.N. has authorized an armed force to try to restore order.
 
Heavily armed gangs controlled much of Haiti, including most of the capital, and 1,000s of Haitians have been killed or displaced. Kenya will now lead about 2,000-armed security forces into the country to help Haiti's police who are outmanned and outgunned.
 
It's not known how the mission will be received. The last time the U.N. put a force in Haiti, it accidentally brought cholera, which killed about 10,000 Haitians.
 
Journalist Stefano Pozzebon, shows us just how difficult the situation in Haiti has become.
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN JOURNALIST: The United Nations Security Council approved on Monday the deployment of a multinational armed force to Haiti, as gang violence and political paralysis continue to affect the Caribbean nation. The forces is expected to be led by Kenya, which has pledged 1,000 policemen to spearhead the mission, although other countries in the Caribbean have also expressed their intention to participate.
 
The vote was passed there on Monday afternoon with the abstention of China and Russia. It follows repeated calls by the Prime Minister Ariel Henry to pledge for international assistance. And it was actually applauded by the government of Henry.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEAN VICTOR GENEUS, HAITIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): On behalf of the government and people of Haiti, I would like to thank all of those who, through their voices, their efforts, their support, and their contribution of all sorts, have finally made today's decision possible.
 
More than just a simple vote, this is in fact an expression of solidarity with a population in distress.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POZZEBON: Henry took power in 2021, following the assassination of late President Jovenel Moise. What estimations question is mandates (PH) the security situation has greatly worsened under his watch.
 
The country's capital Port-au-Prince, for example, is largely controlled by warring gangs. And the United Nations estimated that some 200,000 Haitians have had to flee their homes due to the wave of violence.
 
As of now, it is unclear when this multinational force would actually reach Haiti, nor the exact composition of this expedition.
 
For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota.
 
CHURCH: Still to come. The U.S. claims Serbia is amassing forces at Kosovo's border. But Serbia's president says otherwise.
 
We will take a deep dive into the tensions between the two countries after a short break.
 
And Donald Trump calls the latest civil action against him a scam and a sham. But the fraud trial could be hitting him where it hurts.

 <br>[02:21:35]
 
CHURCH: Armenia's Defense Ministry claims an Armenian soldier was killed and two more injured after an attack from Azerbaijani forces on Monday. Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry calls the reports completely false.
 
It comes amid a mass exodus of refugees after the fall of Nagorno- Karabakh. More than 100,000 refugees have fled Nagorno Karabakh to Armenia amid the crisis, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.
 
Meantime, Armenia is urging the European Union to sanction Azerbaijan for its military operation against the enclave fearing future attacks.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TIGRAN BALAYAN, ARMENIAN AMBASADOR DESIGNATE TO THE EUROPEAN UNION: It's not only the opinion of the Armenian government, but also of many experts, also the some of the E.U. member states that the attack on Armenia's proper is imminent.
 
I do not believe any single word, any single assurance that is coming from the from Aliyev himself, and also his entourage, his envoys.
 
The only thing I believe that Europe has a historic possibility of helping a democracy to resist the brutal dictatorship that wants to invade it in and to ruin a democratic society.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: U.S. officials, say they have been tracking a growing number of Serbian forces gathering at the country's border with Kosovo.
 
A contingent of more than 8,000 soldiers had been at the border following a deadly attack on Kosovo's police force last month. Authorities say one officer and three armed attackers were killed.
 
CNN's Bianca Nobilo and Isa Soares break down the conflict up to this point.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: The issues between Kosovo and Serbia begin with deep seated geographical and historical enmity. Now, the tensions at the moment are flaring in this area here. And the U.S. has warned of an unprecedented, they say, military build-up from Serbia, of troops, artillery, and tanks on this border, which of course, is making Kosovo and their government very nervous. They say it resembles what we saw Russia do prior to its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
 
But where did this current tension come from? For that, we need to go back one week. And this man is now at the center of what was a very violent attack in the northern provinces of Kosovo, which has Serb majority.
 
It came out of nowhere. It surprised people on both sides. Now, the Kosovo government says there were 30 gunmen involved. They stormed a Kosovo police patrol.
 
And this man, Milan Radoicic, says that he was fully responsible for that. That the Serbian government had nothing to do with it.
 
ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: So, he admits it.
 
NOBILO: He said it admits to nothing to do with it. He said it was all his idea. It was his planning. He executed it. And he said that his intention was to try and encourage Serbs in Kosovo to resist the rule of the Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti.
 
Now, this seems strange for a number of reasons, and we'll get to that in just a second.
 
We can see here on the far right, that's Radoicic, supposedly captured on video on the day of these attacks.
 
Now, what is raising question marks for some in Kosovo is the extent of the weaponry that Radoicic had when these 30 supposed Serbian gunmen made this attack in northern Kosovo. There were sophisticated artillery.
 <br>[02:25:01]
 
There were radio kits. Plenty of weapons and grenades, which would seem very strange for a sort of last-minute paramilitary force to put together. So, the question then becomes -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Who could be behind this, is where you're leading?
 
NOBILO: Exactly.
 
SOARES: OK. So, question marks on what is the thinking? and who has the most -- let me put it this way, who has the most to win from this?
 
NOBILO: Well, this is what is so deeply perplexing and why the plot keeps thickening, because both sides have a lot to lose here.
 
Serbia has been in a really difficult position since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, because it has these historical ties to Russia has a Slavic and an orthodox affinity. And they want to keep that relationship. But Serbia does have aspirations to join the European Union. So, it's trying to straddle Russia and the West.
 
So, launching an attack on Kosovo -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Is not certainly -- yes.
 
NOBILO: Which, obviously, G7 countries recognize or potentially even gearing up to some sort of invasion, which is what the Kosovans have said they're worried about, would completely destabilize and eradicate any possibility of that happening.
 
But equally, the idea that they had no knowledge of an attack of paramilitaries with -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Of that size, of that scale.
 
NOBILO: A large amount in weaponry -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
NOBILO: That their intelligence services weren't aware that, that was bubbling away in northern Kosovo and being prepared. Does stretch credulity a little bit.
 
So, as far as both sides are concerned, there has been criticism of those in Kosovo and the government there for not granting the autonomy to Serbs that was promised the Serbians feel like they've reneged on those promises to feel like they're necessarily protected in the north, but as far as Kosovo is concerned, to see this surprise attack, this potential military buildup when trust is at an all-time low, there is just no capital there between the two.
 
SOARES: Indeed.
 
NOBILO: It certainly has the potential as the German ambassador to the U.S. said just a day ago to the Europe's next powder keg.

CHURCH: Serbia's president says the White House report on troop buildup is not fully accurate. Speaking with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, he claims to have reduced troops out the border by nearly half.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEKSANDAR VUCIC, SERBIAN PRESIDENT: A year ago, we used to have 14,000 people at the administrative line with Kosovo. Few days ago, we used to have less than 8.4 thousand. Today, we have it 4.4 thousand, which is a regular number of people.
 
And we always hear and we always listened when our -- when our partners were asking us to deescalate the situation and we did it this time, although, there were no reasons for a big worry, because we didn't need any kind of wars -- 
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: OK.
 
VUCIC: Any kinds of clashes with NATO.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: And be sure to tune in later today. CNN's Christiane Amanpour will be talking to the president of Kosovo. That is at 1:00 p.m. in New York, 6:00 p.m. in London.
 
Just ahead, Donald Trump did not have to appear at his fourth trial on Monday, and yet, chose to be there.
 
We will explain what happened in fourth.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:31:04]
 
CHURCH: Welcome back everyone. Donald Trump was back in court Monday, this time by choice, in a civil fraud case that cuts to the heart of his brand as a successful billionaire. Unlike Trump's criminal indictments, this trial brings no risk of jail time, but it could cost him some prized possessions. The New York Attorney General is seeking $250 million in penalties and wants to prevent the Trump Organization from operating in the state. 
 
That's after a judge ruled last month that Trump and his sons committed fraud by inflating their real estate assets. Outside the courtroom, Trump called the trial a scam and a sham. He insisted that his financial statements were, quote, "Phenomenal." He called the attorney general, Letitia James, corrupt and a racist, and had these harsh words for Judge Arthur Engoron.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER US PRESIDENT: This is a judge that should be disbarred. This is a judge that should be out of office. This is a judge that some people say could be charged criminally for what he's doing. He's interfering with an election, and it's a disgrace.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Those claims of election interference are well worn, with Trump insisting many of those who oppose him in a court of law are trying to keep him out of office. CNN's Brynn Gingrass brings us more of the color from inside and utside the courtroom.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN US NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, pretty eventful day for the first day of the civil fraud trial, brought against Donald Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Opening statements kicked off today with Trump inside the courtroom. And in those opening statements, the state's attorneys laid out what its case will be for the next three months or so that this trial is expected to last. 
 
Talking about how Trump and his sons and Trump or conspired to commit persistent fraud and saying in doing so, banks took on hidden risks. They talked about how they'll be calling several witnesses to the stand, including Trump's sons, and possibly Trump. And even Michael Cohen, who is of course his testimony to congress is the whole reason why this case even got started in the first place. 
 
When it was the defense's turn to bring its opening statements they talked about how Trump made billions off of just good business deals in real estate. Essentially saying that he did everything by the book and pointing out the fact that no fraud was committed. And that there are really no victims in this case. And some, they say, there is no illegality, there was no fraud, and there are no victims. Now as far as what was happening inside that courtroom, Letitia James
 
 was there inside sitting, as well as Eric Trump and Donald Trump was seated with his defense attorneys. Donald Trump did not acknowledge Letitia James several times as he walked past her, except for maybe one time. Eric Trump actually went over to Letitia James and shook her hand twice throughout the duration of the day. 
 
But Trump did take the time outside of the courtroom to lash out not only at Letitia James but about this trial in general, and about the judge who will be deciding really the balls and the stripes of this entire case. So it'll be interesting to see if he shows up later, on Tuesday for court. But as of now it is unclear if he will show up, although he is eager to testify again in a trial that is expected to last three months. I'm Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York.

Still to come, petitioners fight for a say in Tokyo's urban development. Why they're pushing the government to reconsider a project in a rare green space in the heart of the city. Back in just a moment. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Activists in Japan have collected hundreds of thousands of signatures to try to stop a project to redevelop a historic park and sports facilities in the middle of Tokyo. Some of the park's trees are nearly a century old, part of a rare green space in one of the world's largest urban areas. CNN's Will Ripley has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A fight for the future of a much loved Tokyo park. Protesters urging officials, respect history, stop the Jingu Gaien Urban Redevelopment Project.
 
HIROSHI ONE, PROTESTER AND TOKYO RESIDENT (through translator): The Jingu Gaien is ours and our kids' cultural inheritance. It's not fair to push through a redevelopment plan without properly consulting citizens.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): Protesters fear heritage ginkgo trees will be endangered by a new stadium. Hundreds of others axed, making way for tall buildings of concrete and steel. This, they say, is not just a fight over one part, it's a fight for the future of Japan's green spaces, the right to have a say. 
 
Built with public donations in 1926, the Jingu Gaien is seen as a people's park. Home to a famous rugby venue, a historic baseball stadium where Babe Ruth once played. It's center piece, an avenue of one hundred year old ginkgo trees.
 
MIU SAKAMOTO, MUSICIAN: It is like a sanctuary to those living here.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): That peace already broken. Small scale construction underway on a billion dollar redevelopment plan approved by the Tokyo government, led by real estate firm Mitsui Fudosan. Developers say that they will update aging sports facilities, promote more open green space, protect the avenue of ginkgo trees. 
 
Tokyo says it wants to create a world-class sports hub, like the billion dollar Tokyo 2020 Olympic stadium. Roughly 1500 trees were cut down to make way for that controversial Olympics project. Many campaigners don't trust the developers promise to keep the ginkgo avenue safe. 
 
MIKIKO ISHIKAWA, DIRECTOR, ICOMOS JAPAN: Imagine if developers said they'd build the sky scrapers in New York Central Park, and a stadium next to the American Elms at East 97th street. No New Yorker would accept that.
 <br>[02:40:04]
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): More than two hundred thousand people have signed a petition calling for review of the plan. Just this month, the international council on monuments and sights issued a heritage alert, warning of irreversible destruction of cultural heritage. About three thousand trees at risk, it says. 
 
Responding to the anger, the Tokyo government again requested developers summit a concrete plan before cutting down any trees. The plan, to ensure the survival of as many trees as possible. Many fear the older ginkgoes may not make it. In an email to CNN, Mitsui Fudosan said it will preserve the environment and work with arborists to ensure the care of each tree. 
 
Pressure is mounting on Tokyo as more people rise up. Just before he died, famed musician Ryuichi Sakamoto wrote a letter to Tokyo's governor, urging people to speak out for the Earth, a fight his daughter now carries on.
 
SAKAMOTO: I think it's a last letter from him, saying that keep on thinking and keep on raising your voice.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): As calls to reconsider Jingu Gaien's future grow louder, for now these heritage ginkgo trees stand tall. Silent guardians of the ecosystem facing an uncertain future. Will Ripley, CNN, Tokyo.

CHURCH: New Zealand is hoping to draw more overseas visitors to the country with the help of one of its favorite sons. That of course is oscar winning actor and director Taika Waititi starring in a promotional film for New Zealand's new tourism campaign. The country took a hit economically during the Coronavirus pandemic, closing its borders to visitors and enacting strict lockdown rules. 
 
It officially shed the last of its Covid era restrictions in August, and although tourists are returning, this July, the number of visitors was 16 percent lower than in July 2019. New Zealand hopes Waititi's star power will help bring them back in. And thanks so much for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church.
