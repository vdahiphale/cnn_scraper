UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you're going where?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to be going to Pennsylvania.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, all you work at the university there?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I actually do work there.

VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Both of those times he was let off with a warning. We're still waiting to learn more information about those pullovers. And meanwhile here, we are still waiting to see if and when Bryan Kohberger will be in court today. Jim, Erica?
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR:  Veronica Miracle with the very latest for us in Moscow, I appreciate it. Thank you.
 
Joining us now to discuss further, former Boston Commissioner Ed Davis. Commissioner, good to see you this morning.
 
There is a lot of attention being played to those two stops, the fact that they happened so quickly, so close in timing to one another. Indiana State Police said late Tuesday, they put it out a statement saying, look, in terms of the traffic stops at the time, we didn't have information about the suspect or the license plate that would have made a connection here.
 
People on Twitter, boy, there are a lot of experts who are weighing in who feel a little differently. I'm sure you're not surprised. But there is this implication that the stops were perhaps part of a broader tracking from authorities. Is there anything that you would see that would suggest that to you?
 
ED DAVIS, FORMER BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER:  Well, there is a police tactic called a pre-text stop, where police would plan out an investigative stop of someone using a minor motor vehicle infraction to justify the stop. It just doesn't make any sense in this particular case. And this is very unusual to have two motor vehicle stops in such close proximity in the same state, but it could have been a result of just egregious driving that caused it to happen.
 
I just -- it is possible that police planned this but I couldn't fathom the reason for it in this particular case. It just doesn't make any sense from an investigative perspective.
 
HILL:  You've watched this video. What stands out to you in terms of what you're seeing in the behavior of both -- of all three, of the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, his father and also the officer?
 
DAVIS:  Well, I think the officer did a good job. He walked up to the vehicle and asked for paperwork and did the things that an officer usually does, which is where are you coming from, where are you going. And the simple answer to that is, I'm coming from the university and going home for the holidays.
 
When they started talking about the different things that had happened to them and invoked a story about the SWAT team, well, if you wanted to do something that is going to get the police to investigate more heavily, stop talking about stuff like that. You talk about guns, you talk about shootings and SWAT teams, that's going to will pique the curiosity of the police.
 
And you could see the officer start to ask additional questions after that. But at some point in time, I think you just basically set out to a father and son and we'll just -- you know, just let them go. But considering the circumstances, it is beyond bizarre (ph) the way that they spoke to the officer.
 
HILL:  It does raise a lot of red flags in addition to the fact that that license wasn't run. The registration didn't seem to be run. Pulling somebody over on a highway for following closely, you told me that's sort of unusual.
 
Another basic question, and my colleague, Jim Sciutto, brought this up, is it strange at all to you that a person who lived an area where there had been gruesome murders likely knew that people were searching for the exact car that he is driving would, in fact, get in that car and drive cross-country?
 
DAVIS:  It makes no sense, especially something that was done by a person who had a criminal justice background. I mean, he had to know that they were looking for that vehicle. You would normally dump that car and get a rental car or take a plane or do something, anything other than getting into that vehicle. So, it doesn't make sense on so many levels right from the get-go here. It is just a very odd story.
 
HILL:  What are your questions, after watching that video, knowing what we know today, do you have questions about what the follow-up may have been that we may not know about between authorities?
 
DAVIS:  Well, I can't say what the follow-up may have been, but the question that popped in my mind is what was in the mind of the father here. The line of conduct and questioning and answers that he had was strange. He might not have had a confession from his son. He might not have been absolutely certain that the son was involved. But they had to be some suspicion. He's driving the same type of vehicle this terrible incident happened. Is there something in the back of his mind that made him nervous that his son may have been involved? That is sort of the way I would go with this and try to get that father out and question him.
 
HILL:  Yes, so many questions. It will be interesting to see how many of them may or may not be answered when that affidavit is unsealed. Ed Davis, I always appreciate your insight. Thank you.
 
DAVIS:  Thank you, Erica.

JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR:  We do have news just in CNN. Russia is declaring a short ceasefire in its war in Ukraine, not permanent, a matter of days. We'll be back with details as far as the reason behind it. That is coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO:  This just into CNN, Russia has declared a very brief ceasefire in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, this for two days beginning tomorrow.
 
HILL:  CNN's Scott McLean is live in Kyiv for us.
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
So, Scott, the Kremlin's announcement, of course, coincides with orthodox Christmas, correct?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That is right. So, in the orthodox faith, Christmas Eve is tomorrow, Christmas day is the day after January the 7th. Obviously, this is one of the most important religious holidays in that faith. And this originally came as a call from the head of the Russia Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, who called for a temporary ceasefire beginning tomorrow at noon extending through the rest of Christmas Eve and then all of Christmas Day right up until midnight the following day, so 36 hours in total. And it seems that the Kremlin is going to take him up on this proposal.
 
So, they've just put out this statement saying that Russia plans to hold a ceasefire along the entire frontline, the line of contact, as they call it, and they also said this, I'll just read you two lines from this statement. It says, based on the fact that a large number of citizens professing orthodoxy live in the combat areas, we call on the Ukraine side to declare a ceasefire and give them the opportunity to attend services on Christmas Eve, as well as the day of the Nativity of Christ.
 
We don't have an official response from the Ukrainians just yet, but I can imagine that a lot soldiers on the ground are feeling pretty cynical about this kind of offer considering that Russia has made promises and not kept them before. So, we'll have to see whether this temporary ceasefire actually comes to any kind of fruition.
 
But the timing here is quite interesting, and that is because Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been working the phones just today. He spoke with Vladimir Putin earlier today, urged him to unilaterally declare a ceasefire to try to get peace talks back online, something that hasn't happened for months and months. He was hoping for something more ambitious than just a temporary truce. The Russians have said the Kremlin has said about that offer that, look, we're happy to have peace talks but Ukraine needs to recognize that the territorial boundaries have changed and that we're in charge of some of the territory that they used to hold, something that the Ukrainians are obviously not going to accept as a starting point for talks.
 
Erdogan also spoke with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy today, also offered his services to try to broker a peace deal. Turkey has really tried to use its unique position having warm relations with both Kyiv and Moscow to try to be the mediator, having some success with prisoner exchanges and making sure that grain can get out to market as well. And so they're hoping something a little bit more ambitious, but for the moment, Jim and Erica, I think fingers are crossed that the Russians are actually telling the truth and they may actually hold this 36-hour temporary ceasefire.
 
SCIUTTO:  We'll see. And in the broader context, we should note that the patriarch has been very supportive of the Russian invasion up to this point throughout. Scott McLean in Kyiv, thanks so much.
 
Well, back here in the U.S., we've, of course, been following developments in the recovery of Damar Hamlin and some good news now, a statement just from his team, the Buffalo Bills, saying he has shown, quote, remarkable improvement. We're going to have an update for exactly what that means, coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
HILL:  Important breaking news here. The Buffalo Bill releasing a statement which says Damar Hamlin has shown, quote, remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours. He has, of course, been in critical condition since collapsing on the field during Monday night football.
 
SCIUTTO:  Also from that statement, the Bills say he appears to be neurologically intact, hugely important, and his lungs continue to heal.
 
CNN Sports Anchor Coy Wire has been covering this. Coy, this is great news, first of all. We should say that straight up. What more are you learning here, because now there seems to be a chorus of folks saying he's in better shape?
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yes, this is -- could have been the other way, right? I mean, this is really encouraging news for that young 24-year-old man who was out there playing the game he loves and had that tragic injury.
 
We do know that yesterday the Bills had a surprise visitor during a Zoom call. Damar Hamlin's father conferenced in with the entire team, gave them some encouraging news that Damar was progressing. And it appears that this may be the news that he shared.
 
And we can read the statement now. It say, per the physicians caring for Damar Hamlin at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Damar has shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours. While still critically ill, he has demonstrated that he appears to be neurologically intact, his lungs continue to heal and he is making steady progress.
 
Now, Jim and Erica, I zoomed back over here as soon as I could. I was actually in the facilities to see if I could see how the organization was responding and the people that I saw, their spirits were lifted. There was definitely a pep in the step. Any sort of hope and inspiration this team can get, the city right now, the football world at large, everyone who has been following this story around the world. I think this is a very encouraging time and we hope to hear further encouraging news to come.
 
HILL:  Yes, absolutely. It's such an important, remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours, and as Jim pointed out, the importance of what they said about neurological functions, really something.
 
Coy, we'll let you run back into the building and see what more you could get, but thanks again for rushing out to fill us in.
 
Just about an hour from now, the House will reconvene for its third day now of voting. Kevin McCarthy still trying to become speaker but lacking the 218 votes he needs to take that gavel. We'll follow all the action.
 <br>[10:50:01]
 
We're going to bring you straight to Capitol Hill. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO:  Tomorrow, if you could believe it, marks two years since the January 6th insurrection. And one of the central figures pushing the election lies is now facing a slew of legal troubles. Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who became a hero to many in the aftermath of 9/11, could be disbarred in Washington, D.C. He's been interviewed by the DOJ and forced to testify before for a Georgia grand jury. He's also being sued for defamation by Dominion Voting Systems.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
HILL:  A new CNN original series takes a look at what happens to the once iconic politician. Here is a preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These were some angry looking white men.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now you have to see the setting. This is at city hall. City hall is under siege.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you know right in the middle of all of that craziness on September 16th, 1992 is candidate Rudy Giuliani.
 
RUDY GIULIANI, PROSPECTIVE MAYORAL CANDIDATE:  The mayor doesn't know why the morale of the New York City Police Department is so low. He blames it on me. He blames it on you. The reason the morale of the police department of the city of New York is so low is one reason and one reason alone, David Dinkins.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Joining us now is Ken Frydman, former aide to Rudy Giuliani and a consulting producer on this series. You and I were talking briefly in the break about this. There have a lot of theories, there are a lot of factors, but ultimately it boils down to the one question, which I know you get asked a lot, which is what happened to Rudy Giuliani? Is there a simple answer?
 
KEN FRYDMAN, CONSULTING PRODUCER, GIULIANI, WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICA'S MAYOR:  Well, no. There isn't a simple answer or simple answers, but he's self-destructed. Now, as to why, it depends on your interpretation or perspective. Some people say it is alcohol, some people say it is greed. some people say it is zealous need to remain relevant, and that would account for his -- his hooking up with Donald Trump. But, no, there is no simple answer. That's why we produced a four-part series to get to the answer.
 
SCIUTTO:  Ken Frydman, folks ask this question a lot about Trump, does he believe the election lies. I wonder is it your view that Giuliani believes them?
 
FRYDMAN:  I don't think he does. I mean, I was told that someone asked him that and he winked at them, as if to say, you know, this is just an effort to muck up the works and throw a monkey wrench in the process. So, no, I don't think he does. I think he's actually aware of the damage that he and Trump have done to our electoral system.
 
HILL:  When do you think that awareness started for him in terms of not only the damage that has been done today but the damage that was being done?
 
FRYDMAN:  Well, for him, when did he first realize how destructive? I don't think he did because he was zealously defending Trump as a good attorney does. And I actually praised him in The Daily News op-ed at the time about a year before I criticized him in The New York Times. But he became overzealous in his defense. And he clearly lied in his defense, and about Georgia, about the electors. And that is why he's in trouble down there.
 
His greatest fear, I'm told, is being disbarred. Jim mentioned his disbarment. He's been practicing law for 40 years, give or take, and maybe longer. And that would be a real blow to his -- to his ego, to be disbarred in D.C. and New York.
 
SCIUTTO:  Ken, I'm a New Yorker. I grew up with Rudy Giuliani as the D.A., right? I mean, long before 9/11, he busted the mob, right? I mean, he cleaned up the city, crime, a great deal of responsibility for that. Folks have said if he had retired years ago, he would have airports named after him. What is his legacy for New York City now?
 
FRYDMAN:  His -- well his obituary, unfortunately, will have Donald Trump in the lead, whereas it wouldn't have before he became his attorney. It's not the legacy that he should have but he doesn't care about his legacy. He said so to The New Yorker a few years ago. I'll be dead, he said. And that is actually what triggered my publishing of that column. I said, he may not care about his league but I care about my legacy having worked for him and I know that everyone else who worked for him cares about their legacy.
 
HILL:  It is fascinating. Ken Frydman, really good to have you with us this morning and looking forward to seeing it all again. The new CNN original series, Giuliani, What Happened to America's Mayor, premiers Sunday night with back-to-back episodes starting at 9:00 Eastern and Pacific right here on CNN.
 
SCIUTTO:  We just have this into CNN and we have learned that Bryan Kohberger, the man, of course, charged in the stabbing deaths of four Idaho college students, will make his first court appearance at 12:30 Eastern Time. It is going to be a big moment.
 
HILL:  It certainly is. Again four counts of first-degree murder, one count of burglary. CNN, of course, is on the ground in Moscow, idaho. There will be cameras in the courtroom and we will keep you posted on those happenings. So, be sure to stay with us for that coverage as it happens.
 
And, of course, we will also be bringing you the very latest from Capitol Hill as things evolve throughout the day.
 <br>[11:00:02]
 
So, stay with us for that. Thanks for joining us, the last couple of hours. I'm Erica Hill.
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes, the news keeps coming. I'm Jim Sciutto.</pre>
