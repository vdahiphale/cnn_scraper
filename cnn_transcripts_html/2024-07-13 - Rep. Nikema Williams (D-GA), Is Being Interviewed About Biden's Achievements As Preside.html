FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.
 
And we begin this hour with the 2024 presidential race at another critical crossroad. Today, President Biden is taking a break from the campaign trail as he scrambles behind the scenes to convince key members of his own party that he can still win in November.
 
Over the next few hours, Biden will hold telephone calls and conference calls with groups of moderate and progressive members of Congress in an effort to shore up support.
 
And in a rally in Michigan last night, Biden was defiant, vowing to stay in the race. Meantime, his GOP challenger Donald Trump is set to hold a rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania later on today, and it comes just two days before the Republican National Convention gets underway in Milwaukee.
 
And as we wait an announcement about Trump's running mate, we'll get to the Trump rally in a moment. But let's begin with Priscilla Alvarez, who is covering the Biden campaign for us.
 
Priscilla, what can you tell us about Biden's efforts to keep his campaign alive, and what kind of phone calls he is having today?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the President and his campaign remain defiant that he is staying in the race, but the challenge too is getting all of the Democratic Party behind him. That includes in calls with key groups of lawmakers, an extension of what he had been doing over the course of the week.
 
Now, today, he'll have two calls this afternoon. One with the New Democrat Coalition, another with the Congressional Progressive Caucus. But again, this is an outreach campaign that the president has been engaged in for the last several days. And just to go, or just to rewind here a little bit, this ultimately amounted to a meeting between President Biden and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Thursday.
 
That was an opportunity for the House minority leader to express all of the caucus's concerns, and do so, according to sources, in a blunt manner.
 
What the president didn't get in that conversation, though, was an endorsement from the House minority leader, which goes to show how much work is still before the president and his campaign to calm the nerves of those in his party.
 
In fact, just after his solo news conference on Thursday, that was an opportunity for him to show his vigor and aggressiveness, and by all accounts, a lot of people say that it was stronger than his debate performance, he still was contending with lawmakers in a call just yesterday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Representative Michael Levin, with a direct appeal to the president, for him to step aside.
 
Now, in response to that, according to sources, the president said, "It's important, I got to get out and show people." Going on to say, "I'm still in good charge."
 
So, this is a president who has been told by his allies and lawmakers to make sure that he is out on the campaign trail, to show that he is up to the task, not only being the Democratic candidate and nominee, but that also he can serve a second term.
 
Now, the Biden campaign is well aware that there is anxiety on Capitol Hill, that there are still questions that they need to answer, and that is the aim of these phone calls, is for the president to engage with those who have questions about his candidacy directly.
 <br>[13:05:07]
 
Now, whether or not that will truly calm nerves is still remains to be seen. But this, in addition to the president going out on the campaign trail over the next several days, is the campaign really trying to move on to keep the target on Donald Trump, particularly during the Republican National Convention, and get the party in line.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Priscilla Alvarez, thanks so much.
 
So, as President Biden fights for his political survivor -- survival, rather, his challenger, former President Donald Trump is set to hold a rally in battleground Pennsylvania today. All eyes are on Trump as we await his pick for vice president.
 
The most likely candidates right now, senators Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. CNN's Alayna Treene is joining me now from Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump's rally will be taking place.
 
All right, lots of anticipation on who Trump's pick will be. Might it happen while you're there or during the convention? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN CONGRESSIONAL AND PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS REPORTER: Your guess is as good as mine as right now, Fredricka. No. I mean, the anticipation, the suspense of when this announcement will come continues to build, it could happen tonight.
 
When I talked to Donald Trump's campaign advisers as recently as this morning, they said they are still weighing when this is going to come. Now, I will tell you that they view as of now, Monday evening, that is when Donald Trump, for the third time, is going to be officially nominated as the Republican party's presidential nominee. That will happen Monday evening.
 
That is what they view as the deadline for when he needs to make that announcement. So, really, we're looking at just about two or three days here until we will know who his running mate is.
 
Now, you mentioned the top contenders that Donald Trump is considering. They have consistently been at the top of his what I'll call short shortlist for vice president. He addressed this yesterday while speaking to a conservative radio show. Take a listen, Fred.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (via telephone): I watched Tim Scott on television yesterday. He was fierce and great. He was great. I watched Marco over the weekend on television, he was incredible. J.D. has been great.
 
You have a man named Burgum, who is a fantastic governor in North Dakota, and you know, it's a state that's very, very prosperous, very successful, and he's done a good job there. You have -- You have some terrific people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE: Now, Fred, you could hear there Donald Trump referencing him watching all of these contenders on television. When I talk to Trump's closest allies, they say that is how he has been making this decision. His opinion on who he thinks is best to serve alongside him really depends on who he sees best defending him on television, as well as who is in his ear, lobbying these different men to be his V.P.
 
Now, I do -- you know, I just want to point out that here in Butler, this is on the border of Ohio, that is where Senator J.D. Vance is from, and we've also gotten some indications that some of the speaker lineup at the convention next week could show that Vance may be actually the top candidate in the running right now.
 
You have people like Donald Trump Jr., as well as Tucker Carlson, both very fierce defenders of J.D. Vance, who have been pushing Donald Trump to choose him. They will be speaking both Wednesday and Thursday. Wednesday is the night that his vice-presidential nominee is going to deliver remarks on stage in Milwaukee. And on Thursday, you'll have Donald Trump delivering those remarks. And those are the nights that these people are going to speaking as well. So, I think some tea leave reading there for you, Fred. But we're still awaiting to hear when exactly this will come.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. We all await. All right. Alayna Treene, thank you so much.
 
Former President Donald Trump has attempted to court black voters, and recent polling suggest that he has made some inroads, particularly among black men, but it's a segment of the electorate that has historically backed Democrats in the battleground state of Georgia, which Democrats carried last time.
 
CNN's Rene Marsh is talking with black voters on whether they are still all in for Joe Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RENE MARSH, CNN AVIATION AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Battleground state of Georgia for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with black Democratic voters.
 
Our first stop the black-owned Atlanta's Breakfast Club.
 
In between bites of pancakes, chicken, and waffles, voters weighed in on the race for president.
 
JERITA BURDETTE, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: I am voter for democracy. And as of right now, a convicted felon is not it. It's not it. Biden's our guy. That's who I'm riding with.
 
KELVIN BURDETTE, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: I'm a solid, no. Yes, I don't want him to step aside. That there is no other choice at this time.
 
MARSH: After Biden's poor debate performance, some members of his own party have called on him to exit the race over fears he can't win.
 <br>[13:10:04]
 
In 2020, Biden won Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes, while winning black voters in the state by more than 70 points against Donald Trump. This couple supports Biden staying the course, but they worry he won't win.
 
K. BURDETT: In all honesty, it's looking real doubtful. As a black man, I talked to several other black men, and a lot of them are voting for Trump.
 
MARSH (voice over): A few tables away, these young women were more optimistic.
 
MARSH: What comes at the top of your head, Joe Biden?
 
JAYLA KORIYAN, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: Our next president.
 
MARSH (voice over): Would you support a Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket if he did get replaced?
 
ROBYN GIPSON, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: I feel as though, Kamala, the only thing I know her for is, we did it, Joe. Like I don't know her for really anything else.
 
I hasn't proven it's been four years, and I haven't seen anything.
 
KORIYAN: I haven't seen her bring it, not in, like a campaign, not any -- in any initiatives, like just really stepping up.
 
MARSH (voice over): Next, it was lunch with a 44-year-old cardiologist and a 51-year-old political organizer, both with a message for Democrats.
 
ALANNA MORRIS, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: Don't rock the boat unless you have a plan to get me back to shore.
 
RHONDA BRIGGINS, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: What is the plan? I mean, you're saying, step down, but then, what's the ticket?
 
MARSH (voice over): They say this political moment punctuates America's inequities. While they believe Kamala Harris is capable of serving as president, they don't think she should replace Biden at the top of the ticket.
 
MARSH: You said, the America that we're in that you feel as if you have to vote for a frail white man versus a competent black woman.
 
MORRIS: Absolutely. There is a whole bunch of folks in the middle, and I don't believe that they are going to vote for her. And even if you go back to Hillary Clinton as a nominee, America has shown us that it is not ready for a female leader.
 
BRIGGINS: Sexism in America is more prevalent than even racism in America. And so, to be a black woman, you get both hits.
 
MARSH: So, we're headed to our last stop dinner with older voters at a church in Atlanta.
 
GEORGE MITCHELL, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: I'm 78 years old in my right mind, and I will vote for Joe Biden.
 
MARSH (voice over): Here, we found the same support for Biden to remain in the race, coupled with emerging frustration about calls for Biden to step aside.
 
MICHELLE MITCHELL, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: The Democratic Party knew four years ago how old Joe Biden would be in 2024. So, to try to pull a stunt like this at the 11th hour is very disappointing.
 
MARSH (voice over): For these seniors, age is an asset.
 
SAMMY GODWIN, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC VOTER: Joe Biden has been a vice president for eight years. Now he's been a president for four years. That's a lot of experience. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: CNN Rene Marsh reporting. Thank you so much.
 
All right, so far, 20 Democratic lawmakers have called on President Biden to step aside, and in another blow for the president, a group of two dozen former Democratic lawmakers published an open letter, calling for Biden to release his convention delegates, and let others compete for the presidential nomination at next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
 
I'm joined now by Congresswoman Nikema Williams. She is a Democrat from Georgia. Good to see you, Representative. So, how has this within Democratic Party wave for Biden to step aside, hurt the party, hurt your presumptive nominee?
 
REP. NIKEMA WILLIAMS (D-GA): So, there is been so much conversation around us wanting to have the perfect candidate that we have not focused on what's really at stake, Fredricka and selection, and that is the danger that is Trump's Project 2025.
 
We know what's at stake in this election. Georgia voters understand that we vote for people who are going to work on behalf of the voters of not just Georgians, but this country. And that is not who Donald Trump is.
 
When people show you who they are, we should believe them the first time. And if you read through what is in Project 2025, you will understand why all of the voters that you just spoke with in Georgia, down in my district in Atlanta, are telling you that they are sticking with President Biden.
 
President Biden has shown us who he is, especially over the last 3-1/2 years, when he has delivered for the American people. We've passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, and if you drive through the roads of Georgia, you will see over and over the new construction, making our bridges and our roads repaired.
 
And then, you'll also talk to people who understand what it's like to have their student debt forgiven. Even when Donald Trump and his party sued the president and took it all the way to the Supreme Court, President Biden still made a way out of no way, something that black voters are accustomed to doing. And he made sure that he could still relieve student debt. Delivered $16 billion to our HBCUs.
 
So, we are not going to get caught up in the moment of one debate. What we are looking at is who is going to best serve the interest of the people of this country.
 <br>[13:15:04]
 
And that's what you heard from the people in my district that your reporter spoke with, and that's what I'm hearing from people on the ground all across the state.
 
While I represent a deep blue district, I'm the state party chair in Georgia, in a Periwinkle state. We understand only by winning by 11,780 votes that we have to actually work for every vote. We're accustomed to that. We are also accustomed to being counted out time and time again.
 
So, what we're doing is having the conversations with the voters on the issues that matter to them, and we're doing the work between now and November 5th.
 
WHITFIELD: So, the things that you just spelled out what's at stake, those are not the things that you're hearing from these Democrats who perhaps have been the loudest voices, who are offering what they believe is justification as to why Biden should step aside. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): As painful as this is, as much as I respect Joe Biden, as much as I love the work that he's done as a president and as a senator for decades, we need a change. We need a change so that we can win.
 
REP. SCOTT PETERS (D-CA): As a candidate, you know, he is -- I'm not sure he is bringing what we need to the table. We have to have someone who both can explain his record in an articulate way and take it to Donald Trump. And we're already facing a situation where we have big headwinds in the swing states of aside this, this race. I think we would be better off looking to our deep bench of elected leaders.
 
REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Imagine that three months from now, we get another performance like there was in the debate, right before the election. Do you want to take that risk? I don't.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. So, two things here. I mean, what is this internal struggle about? And separately, just exemplified from some of those sentiments, are some Democrats kind of doing the work for Trump, by undercutting the -- their own presumed nominee.
 
WILLIAMS: Well, we're a big tent party in the Democratic Party, and we all come to this with our lived experiences. And so, I hear my colleagues when they talk about their fears, because I also have my fears. I fear for my 8-year-old black son, who is growing up in a country where we have someone who has all of his people that wrote Project 2025. I know what their hope is for my black son, for my family, for my husband.
 
But then, we have a president who is looking to bring our country together, and at the end of the day, all of my colleagues who have called on the president to step down, we still want the same end goal, defeat Donald Trump. So, that's what we're focused on. We have different paths that we think we need to get there.
 
But right now, we have President Biden at the top of our ticket. I watched that rally in Detroit yesterday. He was on fire. He spoke like the person who we need on the campaign trail between now and November 5th to bring it to Donald Trump, call him the liar that he is, a failed former president, and he also laid out his vision for the next term, signing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, making sure that we can codify Roe v. Wade, giving women the protections that we need when Trump has bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade.
 
So, there are real things at stake in this election. We understand that wholeheartedly as a caucus, and we're united on defeating Donald Trump. And after our convention, when we nominate officially President Biden, we'll be united in supporting him as well.
 
WHITFIELD: The Republican National Convention may upstage, you know, any more noise or perhaps even missteps within the party or candidate. Representative Himes said, you know, the next week, and he's on board with Biden stepping aside. He says, you know, the next week is critical to make a change on the ticket.
 
What kind of reset do you believe might happen, whether it be within the next week or potentially before the Democratic Convention, which begins August 19th?
 
WILLIAMS: I think the reset that we saw was when President Biden left the debate stage. He then showed up at a debate watch party in Atlanta and rallied the people in that room with vigor.
 
Then, he flew -- well, first, he made a quick stop at a waffle house. But then, he flew to North Carolina in the middle of the night and had people waiting, where he had yet another rally impromptu. And then, the next day, he showed up in Raleigh and had a full rally where he laid out his case to the American people.
 
He has been on the campaign trail since that debate, proving that he is our candidate, he is our path forward, and he has a vision, not just talking about what he's done in the past, but his vision for the future. And that's the man that I am proud to cast my vote for when I show up at the Democratic Convention.
 
And I will be voting for him in November, because he'll be at the top of our ticket as our president. We are going to reelect him because we. Someone looking out for all Americans.
 <br>[13:20:01]
 
Not someone who has already told us he would be a dictator on day one. We must defeat Donald Trump and Democrats are all united in that one voice, defeating Donald Trump.
 
WHITFIELD: And let me ask you something, a follow up. Unrelated, but election-related to Georgia election workers, a mom and daughter, Ruby Freeman and as Shaye Moss. They won their defamation suit against Rudy Giuliani and were awarded $148 million that was last December.
 
They haven't received a dime. But now, a federal judge throws out Giuliani's bankruptcy case, making it possible to potentially seize his assets, $6 million New York co-op, 3-1/2 million condo in Florida, among other things. In your view, does this mean that anyone is any closer to accountability for the numerous falsehoods in relation to the 2020 election?
 
WILLIAMS: I mean, we're still waiting for the case to play out here in Georgia, and we'll see what happens there. But at the end of the day, whether these cases are decided before the election or after the election, it still remains true that Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
 
Rudy Giuliani was working at the -- at the request of Donald Trump, and so, they need to be held accountable. And if the Courts don't do it, we can do that at the ballot box. We can make sure that we don't give Rudy Giuliani nor Donald Trump any more power than they already have had in this country.
 
Donald Trump does not need to return to the Oval Office, where he is been giving immunity from the Supreme Court to do whatever he wishes to do.
 
And trust me, he will take full advantage of that. As someone who lived in Georgia, I was a real elector when they were trying to defend fake electors. We can see what they done -- what they have done in the past. I see the results of them trying to challenge voter statuses in Georgia and masks.
 
The things that they're doing with the state elections board, changing the rules to vote, making drop that ballot drop boxes less accessible, only available from nine to five.
 
We've had our fair share of rule changes in elections after we won in 2020. So, when people show you, they are Fredricka, we should believe them the first time. They are coming for our votes. They are coming for our democracy. We need to take this serious. It is all laid out in Trump's Project 2025. And we can make the decision in this.
 
We can send them backing, whether the Court held them accountable or not, and we can make sure that they are not reelected. We have the power. The voters have the power, and we'll have the final say in November.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Congresswoman Nikema Williams, thank you so much. Great to see you. Next time, hopefully, in studio, next time you're in town. Thank you so much.
 
All right. Straight ahead, Israel says it targeted Hamas' military chief in an air strike that Palestinian officials say killed at least 70 people. We are following the very latest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:27:01]
 
WHITFIELD: We're continuing to follow "BREAKING NEWS" out of Gaza, where Israel conducted devastating airstrikes in a humanitarian zone in Khan Younis in Gaza. Palestinian officials say at least 71 people were killed. Israel says it targeted Hamas' military chief, who is one of the alleged masterminds of the October 7th attacks. Hamas is denying those claims and is calling this attack a massacre.
 
CNN analysis also shows that at least one U.S.-made munition was used in that attack.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us. Jeremy, Israel says it received intelligence in recent days about this opportunity to hit this Hamas leader. What more is being said right now?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Israeli military has yet to confirm whether or not Mohammed Deif, Hamas's top military commander, the number two Hamas official in Gaza, whether he was actually killed in this strike. But they say that they target him -- targeted him, as well as other Hamas militants who were in that area based on precise intelligence.
 
And I'm told by an Israeli official that, that intelligence began to come together over the course of the last few days. But it wasn't until the last 24 hours before the strike that a clearer window of opportunity actually began to come into focus. Overnight, I'm told that the Israeli minister of defense, as well as the head of the Israeli military general, Herzi Halevi, the top officials at Israel's Internal Security Service known as the Shin Bet, they all huddled overnight multiple times, multiple discussions, to assess that intelligence, and determine whether or not they could proceed with this strike.
 
One of the key considerations was assessing whether or not there were any Israeli hostages potentially in the area. They ultimately assessed that there were no hostages in the area. And early this morning, around 10:30 in the morning, a massive explosion happened in that area.
 
The Israeli military striking that area, killing 71 people, nearly 300 people were injured in this blast. And you can just see, based on the smoke emanating from this area, as well as the size of the crater, that clearly a very large munition appears to have been used in this strike.
 
And beyond any potential Hamas militants who have been killed, there were also clearly civilian casualties. Very near to the site of that crater were the tents of thousands of displaced Palestinians, many of -- some of whom, I should say, were clearly killed and injured in the strike as well.
 
WHITFIELD: And Jeremy, what more do we know are the people who were in that area? How aid and -- is being rendered? How are people being helped?
 
DIAMOND: Well, again, nearby that crater, there were indeed tents of displaced Palestinians. And you can see in that area that the blast radius seems to have been quite significant. We got video of one boy who was a 13-year-old boy who was living in these tents, and he was killed.
 <br>[13:30:01]
 
His sister was injured in this strike, mourning over his body. So, there is no question that there were civilian casualties.
 
The question, I think that will now be posed is, who is responsible for those civilian casualties? Beyond, of course, the Israeli military that carried out this strike.
 
If, indeed, Mohammed Deif, the number-two Hamas commander, was in that area, in what was designated as a safe humanitarian zone by the Israeli military months ago, then he would, without a doubt, have been putting the civilians in that area at a tremendous risk. 
 
But once again, we do not know yet whether or not he was, in fact, there, whether or not he was actually killed in this strike as the Israeli military has yet to confirm that.
 
Hamas, we should note, has denied that he was actually targeted or killed in this strike. And so we are waiting for further assessment from the Israeli military.
 
And we're now learning actually that the Israeli prime minister is set to address the public in about a half an hour. So we will wait to see whether or not he is able to provide more information about this strike. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Jeremy Diamond, in Jerusalem, thanks so much.
 
All right. This is something you need to see to believe. It looks like a plain old vending machine, right? Well, this one sells ammo.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:35:39]
 
WHITFIELD: Americans in three states can add bullets to their grocery lists. Computerized vending machines now make it possible for shoppers in Alabama, Texas and Oklahoma to buy ammunition at the grocery store. 
 
The machine's distributor says it uses AI technology to verify customer identities. But some officials have mixed feelings about the new devices.
 
CNN's Rafael Romo is joining me now with more details on this. 
 
How does the technology work? 
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a little bit like, here in Georgia and other states, they have supermarkets, those machines where you can renew your license plates. it's a little bit like that. If you had the added step of doing a face scan, it's kind of like that. 
 
And let me tell you, reaction to the machines has been mixed. Those who oppose them say that buying ammunition shouldn't be as easy as getting candy from a vending machine. 
 
Others say it adds convenience for people who already have the legal right to buy not only bullets, but also firearms. 
 
The company behind the machines is called American Rounds. And it says it has already installed them at grocery stores in three different states, Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas.
 
The company rolled out its first ammo dispenser last November in Alabama. And Grant Magers, the CEO of American Rounds, addressed the criticism that the machine makes purchasing ammunition for some too easy in a company video published on their Web site. 
 
He says, "Before making a purchase, customers need to identify themselves through a process that uses AI technology."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GRANT MAGERS, CEO, AMERICAN ROUNDS: You can see here, we have a very secure, automated retail machine. We're able to age verify. We scan a driver's license. And then it takes 360 facial recognition for the purchase and matches it to the I.D.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And, Fred, each machine sells ammunition for various firearm calibers, including rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to American Rounds.
 
A local government official in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, says he thought it was a bad joke when he first heard the machines had been installed at a supermarket in his city.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KIP TYNER, TUSCALOOSA CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT: You know, when I first saw it, I thought somebody was punking me on Facebook. You know, like, how are you allowing this in our city, Mr. Tyner.
 
I'm going to like, well, first of all, this is the first I'm hearing about it. Then second, I don't like it at all. We know we've got a problem with guns and people that have guns, I should say. So why make it more convenient to buy ammunition?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: We've also heard from Brady, a gun violence prevention group, that opposes the machines. In a statement, its president, Kris Brown, said the following: 
 
"The gun industry wants to treat guns and ammo like they're candy from the checkout aisle. Even as guns remain the leading killer of kids and teens in this country. It's reprehensible, but it's not surprising. 
 
CNN checked with the federal ATF, which said commercial sales of ammunition must comply with state law. 
 
The Oklahoma attorney general's office tells CNN the machines appear to be lawful. We're still waiting to hear from officials in Alabama and Texas.
 
But definitely, a lot of people talking about this. Very mixed reaction indeed.
 
WHITFIELD: Right. I mean, it's -- it's pretty stunning. This is either an example of free enterprise or something that comes as a result of legislation or laws on the books or openings as a result of.
 
ROMO: That's right. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Rafael Romo, thank you so much. 
 <br>[13:39:01]
 
All right. In battleground Michigan, last night, the crowd at President Biden's rally chanted, "Don't you quit." How the president is working today to bring that same kind of enthusiasm and support to lawmakers in his own party.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you get knocked down, you get back up.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: President Biden is vowing to stay in the 2024 presidential race despite a growing number of Democrats calling for him to step aside. 
 
This comes as former President Trump could announce, at any moment now, his running mate. The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, also, that's getting underway Monday.
 
Joining me right now is Geoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor for the battleground state of Georgia, and a CNN political commentator.
 
Great to see you.
 
All right, so you endorsed President Biden just a few months ago. Are you still on board after the president's press conference on Thursday and his recent campaign rallies? 
 
GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, the Joe Biden, I endorsed a few months ago was not the Joe Biden I saw or the rest of America saw during that debate. That was shocking beyond my greatest imagination.
 
I think most -- even his biggest critics were probably shocked to see at this -- his state of mind. He's fighting hard. He's doing his best to try to earn the credibility back, but that ship has sailed, in my opinion. 
 
I think that --
 
WHITFIELD: What do you mean?
 
DUNCAN: Well, I think, you know, you're watching even the strongest Democratic voices starting to speak up and ask for him to step away from the race for the good of the party and also for the -- for the good of America. 
 
I mean, I really sit in that selfish place as a Republican that I want to beat Donald Trump any possible way I can, legally, because I want my Republican Party back.
 
And to do that, I've decided to partner with the Democrats to try to do all we can do to beat him. And I think the best chance now is somebody other than Joe Biden.
 
You know, because, at the end of the day, we've got this --
 
WHITFIELD: Who would that person be? Because that is the -- that's the really important follow-up, isn't it? I mean, you've got these voices who say, you know, Democrats want to beat Donald Trump. 
 <br>[13:45:01]
 
There's no longer belief among many of them that it's Joe Biden who can. So then who is that person that you believe will defeat Donald Trump, if it is your goal, still, that Donald Trump is defeated. 
 
DUNCAN: Well, I don't claim to be well studied in Democratic politics, right? I just am a Republican and so I don't know exactly what their bench looks like.
 
But what I will tell you is that I think history is going to look at this period of time for Democrats. 
 
And if they just try to play safe and either run, Joe Biden or just kind of run whoever looks like they're next on the list, instead of trying to find somebody that is a once-in-a-generation leader, somebody that can build consensus, win votes on the left, win votes in the middle, even win votes on the right, like me, that just cannot stand Donald Trump. 
 
If they do that, not only will they win this election, but they will win for a significant period of time. Because I think, once America finds a candidate or a leader that they can really trust and believe in, they will -- they will become addicted to that. 
 
WHITFIELD: Are you rescinding your endorsement of Donald Trump? I mean, I'm sorry. Are you resending your endorsement of Joe Biden? 
 
DUNCAN: Well, I don't even think it comes into question. I think it's -- just in my opinion, I think that genie has already left the bottle. I do think they will find a replacement for Joe Biden. 
 
And I'm let the Democrats do what they're going to do right now. They're in a very, very precarious position. They're, just a few weeks away from their convention. They've got a lot of work to do, soul searching.
 
I do think some of the -- some of the weapons used to kind of shape away from removing Joe Biden, of money and name I.D. and whatnot, are really irrelevant at this point. 
 
I don't think money is going to be an issue for if the Democrats find somebody, like an Andy Beshear or somebody else.
 
Or even if Kamala Harris decides to step up to the plate and America gets to understand who she is and she comes back towards the middle, I think there's an opportunity for name I.D. to be through the roof. 
 
I think there's an opportunity for earned media to be through the roof. And I think there's an opportunity for folks like me that care about this country that our conservative to partner with the Democrats to try to figure out how to beat Donald Trump.
 
WHITFIELD: If not Joe Biden, does it have to be a Kamala Harris, the vice president? 
 
DUNCAN: I don't know. I mean, I certainly -- I think that's the big question. Is there enough mechanics inside the convention process to allow them to move forward with somebody else? Is there this notion that there could be some short-lived campaigning period amongst candidates?
 
But I will tell you right now, if Democrats are able to figure out a way to get it the candidate that connects with a majority of Americans, they will not only win this election, but they will win the hearts and minds of Americans for the foreseeable future. 
 
WHITFIELD: Is it a big problem for Democrats who say Joe Biden step aside and not be able to follow up with, if not Biden, then who, just a month away from the Democratic National Convention? Is that problematic? 
 
DUNCAN: Absolutely. And it's interesting to see. The Democrats are where Republicans we're at 12 months ago, when we we're watching this non-deniable you know, trajectory of Donald Trump being a felon, right? 
 
Maybe there's probably a more eloquent way to say it. But he was going to be a convicted felon. And probably additional convictions coming. And we had an opportunity to get it right. We footballed it. We couldn't get out of our own way.
 
And I think Democrats are now in that same point. There's no poll out there of legitimate status that really shows that Joe Biden's debate kept him even or helped him climb ahead or climb from behind.
 
Democrats are going to have to get out of their own way on this one. If they do, they will -- they will be rewarded really, really well.
 
WHITFIELD: If Democrats are saying Joe Biden can't win against Donald Trump, and Democrats who we're saying that can't come up with a name, who they believe can win against Donald Trump, isn't Donald Trump just being handed a win? 
 
DUNCAN: Absolutely. And what we'll see, come November 6th, is Donald Trump will win the election. And then we'll watch him walk into the White House in mid-January in 2025 and continue to do exactly what he did before. 
 
And that's create chaos and anger, not only domestically but internationally. I worry about the economy. I worry about our international relationships. 
 
I worry about all kinds of things. I would just worry about being able to sit down and talk to your neighbor. 
 
Those are the things that I'm worried about long-term as an American and also as a Republican. A GOP 2.0 has never been needed more than right here, right now. 
 
But if we give Donald Trump four more years, he will continue to wreck the car beyond repair. 
 
WHITFIELD: If that happens, will you have felt good about rescinding your endorsement for Joe Biden? 
 
DUNCAN: Look, I don't feel good about any of this. I don't think any American -- that's what the polling shows us. Nobody feels good about the menu that we're being offered here today.
 
This is a unique opportunity for the Democrats to hit the reset button and go find somebody that can win the hearts and minds of 60, 70, 80, 90 million Americans to show up at the polls and vote for somebody that they may not agree with 100 percent on policies, but they agree that they will get us to the next election in four years. 
 
And therefore, Republicans either get our act together or we deserve to lose again.
 
WHITFIELD: Former Georgia lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, good to see you. 
 
DUNCAN: Thanks you.
 
WHITFIELD: Thank you very much.
 <br>[13:49:44]
 
We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
WHITFIELD: For the first time since 2017, Costco is hiking membership prices. A regular membership will go from $60 a year to $65 on September 1st.
 
CNN's Nathaniel Meyersohn is here.
 
So what's behind the change? NATHANIEL MEYERSOHN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, Fred, what's behind the change is that everything else has gotten more expensive. But still, Costco could be a good deal for people, depending on how many $1.50 hot dog-soda combo they're consuming every year.
 
But let's look at the numbers and how Costco compares to some of its competitors. So the Costco membership is going up about 8 percent. That's still much lower than the rate of inflation, up 28 percent over the past, since -- since 2017.
 
But then you look at Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon Prime membership is now $139 a year, gone up 39 percent since 2017. So Costco's still holding the membership price lower than inflation. 
 <br>[13:54:59]
 
If it had kept pace with inflation, it would be about $90 right now. So yes, it's getting more expensive, but still lower than some of its competitors. And hasn't kept up with inflation.
 
WHITFIELD: And so how will Costco, you know, make sure that people still sign up for those memberships? 
 
MEYERSOHN: So, Fred, just because Costco's successful right now and its popular right now, doesn't mean that that's going to continue in the future. 
 
So Costco has to keep innovating, adding new products and services. The last several years, it's added $2,000 gold bars, which had been really popular with shoppers.
 
Its Kirkland signature clothing lines have become really popular as well. And it's added -- more travel bookings. You can book cruises and flights through Costco. 
 
So Costco, you know, it has to keep innovating. Competition in retail, of course, is really, really tough. 
 
And also, it may need to improve online. Costco has lagged some of its competitors like Amazon and Walmart online, kind of late to the game with online shopping. 
 
So it's going to be making more moves to try to get people to buy online. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. All right, Nathaniel Meyersohn, we'll leave it there for now. Thanks so much.
 
All right. Nearly every AT&amp;T wireless customer just had their phone and text records stolen. And wait until you hear what the FBI told the company to keep the hat quiet.
