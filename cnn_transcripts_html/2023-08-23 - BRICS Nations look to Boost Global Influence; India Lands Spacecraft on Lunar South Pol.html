(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST, FIRST MOVE: A warm welcome to "First Move" and to this --
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People are applauding. Let us all wait to hear from the Secretary Department of Space and Chairman ISRO Shri S. Somanath.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Those faces say at all celebrations erupt across India, as they become just the fourth nation to land successfully on the moon. The 
 
 Chandrayaan 3 Spacecraft touching down on the Lunar South Pole in the past hour that they are the first nation ever to achieve that specific feat.
 
The spacecraft captured some stunning visuals during its historic descent. Vedika Sud joins us now from New Delhi. Vedika I can only imagine the 
 
 celebrations that are going to take place tonight just describe what that moment being in that room was like?
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: Well, before that this is the moment after Julia that you can see people here media personnel excitement still even half an 
 
 hour after the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan 3 on the Lunar surface.
 
But back to that moment, close to about 6:04 pm local time here in New Delhi, there was exhilaration, excitement, emotions, both inside the 
 
 Mission Control Room, and in different cities across India.
 
Millions of people would have tuned in just for that one moment. You have the Indian Prime Minister, who's currently in South Africa to attend the 
 
 BRICS Summit login virtually into the ISRO Indian Space Agency live telecast feed to be a part of that historic moment.
 
You've had the Indian Prime Minister hail today, as a historic day for the country, the most populous country in the world with 1.4 billion people. 
 
 What's really, really something that I should point out here is the budget relatively small compared to that of NASA's. India's annual budget for 
 
 space activities is at about $1.5 billion.
 
NASA has a staggering annual budget of $26 billion. And within that budget, India has done what no other country could do. They have made that soft 
 
 landing a successful soft landing on the South Pole region of the Lunar -- of the moon, something that no other country has done.
 
India has also added its names to the book of countries, just three others along with India now that has made it successful soft landing on the lunar 
 
 surface. This course will be quite crucial, especially the last two -- the next two weeks rather, will be very crucial because the Rover, which is 
 
 part of the lander is now going to explore the lunar surface.
 
It has 14 days to do this. Scientists have proved in the last few years, especially in fact, going back to Chandrayaan the first time it made that 
 
 landing on the moon there was -- they had a NASA vehicle also attached to it.
 
And that's when they realized there was water on the moon. And now for the next few weeks the Rover is going to explore that. It is going to try to 
 
 find whether there is frozen ice on the moon? And how does this help Julia?
 
It helps in understanding of that the oxygen, water and fuel for further missions if the moon can be a base for further expedition to be carried out 
 
 in space so very crucial mission here that has been accomplished by India and that has already sent out a message through the Indian Prime Minister 
 
 and through the Indian Space Agency that India today is global space power Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Absolutely, they're right up there with the biggest step up of them all. And as you rightly point out, this is not just about landing a 
 
 spacecraft on the moon. This is also about sending a Rover out. It's about collecting data, doing research.
 
There's a whole set of different angles that India's going to achieve over the coming weeks as a result of this landing and don't share the data I 
 
 think with other space powers, like the United States, like Europe, like the UK like Canada. So it's a huge moment for global space travel as well.
 
The stakes -- as well with that much higher given that we saw the Russians fail with their South Pole landing earlier this week that India itself 
 
 failed in 2019.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
I think we can't underscore enough actually, how far India has come. And actually in terms of competitive powers like Russia, like China, for 
 
 example, this is a huge step forward.
 
SUD: Oh, absolutely. And you pointed out correctly, that on Sunday, we heard the announcement was made by the Russians, that their spacecraft 
 
 their attempt to land on the moon had failed. And of course, this is something that the Indian Space Agency was hoping will happen with their 
 
 lunar crafter and they succeeded.
 
This is a message that goes out to the world. And again, like you rightly pointed out, it is also going to be vital for other nations to understand 
 
 the data that the Rover collects over the next two weeks.
 
I just heard some firecrackers go off in one corner of this area, there are celebrations Julia, and they'll continue for the next few days in fact, 
 
 because this is a moment that the Chandrayaan 3 team has worked so hard for. Four years since the last attempt failed.
 
Four years on today, India is the first nations in the world to get to the South Polar region successfully land make that soft landing on the lunar 
 
 surface. And it's promising to explore the dark crevices of the lunar surface.
 
Now you've had automations get to the lunar surface closer to the equator of the moon. But you haven't had a country go into the dark side as it 
 
 stalled the south polar region of the moon. And that's what India is doing now. Now they're dark crevices there, they're dark holes there.
 
And that's what the Rover will have to do. It will have to be an overdrive to understand the presence of frozen ice and other elements and other 
 
 minerals that can be used in the future for future missions and how that can be tapped into by the world, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Oh my goodness, I could keep you talking all evening. But you've got celebrations to attend. I can see it. There are lots of smiling 
 
 faces and the buzz behind you incredible, congratulations, once again to India and the space teams --
 
SUD: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: -- behind this, especially thank you Vedika Sud there. Now for more contexts, let's talk all about this. Joining us now Namrata Goswami, 
 
 Professor of Space Policy at Arizona State University she also Co-Authored the book, "A scramble for the skies: The great power competition to control 
 
 the resources of outer space".
 
Namrata, fantastic to have you on the show once again, you also grew up in India. So this is a personal achievement for you surely. What does it feel 
 
 like just watching those images and seeing the celebrations in India today?
 
NAMRATA GOSWAMI, PROFESSOR OF SPACE POLICY, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY: Thank you, Julia, for having me. So yes, so you feel emotions, because as you 
 
 said, I grew up in a remote area of Northeast India. And so to see India achieve a very difficult technological feat, landing on the South Pole is 
 
 difficult first of all, because we do not have terrain knowledge.
 
And so you have to get all the sensors and the radar correctly and knowing that space of Japan failed in that particular mission, and also Lunar 25. 
 
 So you feel a sense of achievement because, as you know, this was the first attempt that successfully landed on the South Pole.
 
And also because India had failed earlier in 2019 in the last few seconds, so it feels like we can now think about the missions that are going to come 
 
 for example, as you know, India is part of the Artemis Accord.
 
And so what is interesting from a strategic point of view is that this is also a win for the United States, because you have now the Artemis 
 
 signatories, with a real time, lunar landing, and rover and arbitral capacities. So it's a very interesting strategic moment as well.
 
CHATTERLEY: There you connect because we have to talk about this. This didn't get much coverage when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to the 
 
 United States, he met President Biden. He signed those accords.
 
And that means now that data, information, knowledge, all the things that were garnered in this landing will be shared with 26 other nations 
 
 including the United States, the UK, Canada, we can name a lot of the others.
 
This is hugely important for the future of space travel and understanding this partnership between India and other nations. It's a huge step forward 
 
 not just for India, but for all to your point.
 
GOSWAMI: It is and also because China is sending a mission next year to the South Pole called Chang'e 6 [ph] that's going to land on the South Pole 
 
 attempt to land and collect samples. So as you said so correctly that now with India having this capability it's going to be shared with the 
 
 autonomous signatory nation.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
As well as what is most important is that the Artemis Accords themself talk about understanding the lunar surface space resource utilization missions. 
 
 And so the lunar -- the Chandrayaan 3 has a test or a scientific experiment on the Rover that's going to study the moon's elements, for example, 
 
 titanium, aluminum, iron ore, silicon.
 
And if that is confirmed, that furthers our knowledge in terms of how the moon can be used as a pit stop for deep space mission. So it's extremely 
 
 critical both from a scientific strategic and also for the Artemis signatory nations. So I am excited for what I see.
 
CHATTERLEY: It also says a lot about India. We were just listening to our Reporter Vedika Sud talk about the relative sizes of space budgets between 
 
 India and nations like the United States too. And actually I was looking at the cost, even if this mission, the Chandrayaan 3 and it cost around $75 
 
 million.
 
I mean, it sort of blows my mind that we've managed to bring the cost so low. I know it's a lot of money. But it's astonishing. And it also shows 
 
 sort of indigenously how India has managed to build space systems of its own, be it the Rover that's now going to go out there collection of the 
 
 data and the experiments that they're doing. I mean, in the isolation, it says a great deal for what India's achieved here on a relatively low 
 
 budget.
 
GOSWAMI: It does also because if you look at the NASA budget, for example, just the Space Launch System, it's 4 billion. And the Artemis mission 
 
 overall will cause the U.S. taxpayer about 94 billion. So the fact that India is able to achieve a lunar landing with 75 million means that we now 
 
 have a cost effective, much more sustainable capability to get to the moon.
 
And so if you want to think about long term missions if you want to think about establishing a research base, which the Artemis Accords hopes to 
 
 achieve now in collaboration with the other signatory, the fact that India has this capability, and that it is so cost effective, is going to bring 
 
 down the cost of lunar missions and make it sustainable.
 
And also, very importantly, it offers a capability that is real time. So as I said before, this is something that needs to be emphasized that the only 
 
 nation that had this capability before India succeeded was China, with a real time operational capability and autonomous docking and landing.
 
And so now India has it too in the 21st century. We know the U.S. did it in the 20th century, but hasn't demonstrated such capacity yet. And so to say, 
 
 so the important point is the U.S. commercial lunar payload services, they are behind schedule. I know intuitive mission is going in November. But the 
 
 fact that India as the Artemis Accord Signatory succeeded is actually a big strategic win for United States diplomacy as well.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I couldn't agree more on that. I mean, Modi clearly sees this as a strategic opportunity at this moment. I think he wants to 
 
 increase the private sector share of the launch market by say five-fold, I think over the next decade. Can you see that happening?
 
GOSWAMI: Yes, because if you look at the space policy that India put out this year, the Indian Space Policy 2023, you can see that the Modi 
 
 government, also the Department of Space, and the Indian Space Research Organization, has actually done something extremely unthinkable, given 
 
 India's history of very state funded space programs.
 
They want to make the entire space ecosystem private, and to also use that privatization to build a much deeper relationship with the United States, 
 
 including in its lunar missions. So I think with India's success now what is going to happen is that the privatization push the conceptualization of 
 
 space missions from a commercial perspective, is going to get a huge boost.
 
The Indian Space Research Organization put out a press release last year in which the aim is to contribute about 9 percent to the global economy, which 
 
 is today about $400 billion. But then this will now also include concepts like lunar resources. India is also interested in a resource called Helium 
 
 3.
 
We already water ice is now going to be confirmed. And so that's going to also add to the entire lunar resource economy. So I see India, actually 
 
 privatizing its entire space missions as we go forward in the next 10 years.
 
CHATTERLEY: Wow! I mean, it's interesting when I listened to that, I think it's not just even about hopefully finding water capabilities to build a 
 
 camp on the moon, but also perhaps, resources that could fuel a rocket to go on somewhere else if you can find the right elements and resources on 
 
 the moon itself.
 
It's going to be fascinating to see. As Prime Minister Modi beamed in there from the BRICS Summit, I couldn't help thinking again about the geopolitics 
 
 the fact that Russia obviously had their failure earlier this week, their capabilities in space, perhaps in some way, folding into China's ambitions.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
And you mentioned their hopes for a launch in 2024 specifically. You've got India signing up to the Artemis Accords. We are seeing this spatial 
 
 dividing lines I think emphasized more and more. What does this mean for Russia? And how do you see this sort of divide playing out?
 
GOSWAMI: So for Russia, the Lunar 25 mission had deep strategic implications. One was that it would show to the world that Russia still has 
 
 the space capability that it historically had with the Soviet Union to go to the moon with lunar 24.
 
The second important implication for Russia was for Putin's legitimacy. So the fact that Russia has signed an agreement with China to go to the moon 
 
 together, they called "The International Lunar Research Station". So to showcase that Russia also has the capability to land on the moon increases 
 
 Russia's bargaining position.
 
Now, space is hard, as we know, failures are not uncommon, but having said that, the fact that they could not control the propulsion system and ensure 
 
 that it landed on the right elliptical orbit to land correctly, tells you that China is far ahead of Russia, in terms of lunar landing capability in 
 
 the 21st century.
 
What this does is that now with India landing successfully it showcases that the strategic alignment for which particular regime or system will 
 
 actually create the norms, the governing structures for a lunar resource economy is going to get very much clearer.
 
So if you look at China's ambitions, they want to establish their own legal mechanisms for how the moon is going to be governed. Russia is a part of 
 
 it. Venezuela just joined. Pakistan has said that it is interested in joining the China led lunar capability building.
 
So with India succeeding and part of the Artemis Accord, it becomes clear that a democratic space order is also possible, given the fact that they 
 
 have actually real time operational capability. It also improves India's bargaining position, for example, at BRICS as Prime Minister Modi is there.
 
So India comes across as a space power with capability to land on a celestial body. And so that improves India's position as well. And by -- 
 
 and also fascinatingly, India has actually, in June this year very clearly decided that it wants to collaborate with the U.S. led lunar mission called 
 
 "The Artemis Accord" as I mentioned.
 
And so the alignments are getting very clear. So it's a very interesting time. And finally, I'll say that with India, China border conflict, and the 
 
 fact that there was escalation at the border that's of Indian security personnel.
 
And the fact that Russia at the same time was getting closer and closer to China created the incentive also for India to clearly decide on which side 
 
 it wants to be. So all this is going to now play out in this new rush to the moon that we see.
 
CHATTERLEY: Fantastic to have you on once again. Namrata Goswami thank you so much Professor of Space Policy at Arizona State University. We'll speak 
 
 soon. Stay with "First Move" we'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move", Russian President Vladimir Putin is in criticizing the West during a fiery speech at the BRICS summit in 
 
 Johannesburg. He says the West's desire to maintain its global dominance led to the war in Ukraine, its day two of the summit.
 
And there are two big issues at play, whether to expand BRICS to more countries and how to create a trading system that wouldn't rely so much on 
 
 the U.S. dollar. David McKenzie joins us now from Johannesburg. No shortage of ambition there, I tell you what Prime Minister Modi is going to be 
 
 spending.
 
I think the rest of the summit with a big grin on his face after their space feats that were achieved today, David. But it is part of the broader 
 
 point and a sort of power battle for leadership over these big nations and a differing opinion, I think over how other nations should join, when and 
 
 what conditions should be attached.
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You will they actually mentioned the possible lunar landing before it happened. There was 
 
 a round of applause from the room and smiles from Prime Minister Modi. I think though things are going to come rapidly back to earth here with these 
 
 very difficult discussions that I'm sure are happening in particular between India and China.
 
They are considered the big brothers as it were of this grouping economically. And yes, they are trying to look to expand BRICS beyond its 
 
 core five members you had that screed from the Russian President, at the beginning of that session, obviously beaming it in remotely.
 
And that was quite an ironic moment in a way Russia say that it has this important place in the world. But yet, the President of Russia can't set 
 
 foot on South African soil because of the potential arrest because of his ICC warrant of arrest linked to the war in Ukraine.
 
They will be discussing over the next few hours, a press conference that was scheduled for later today is cancelled any news on expansion of BRICS, 
 
 which different members have different views on will come I think into Thursday, the business community has played a very big part in these 
 
 discussions.
 
And at its core, BRICS is an economic grouping much of the talk, Julia, has been about moving away from Western powers and the World Bank and IMF in 
 
 the view of some of these members. I spoke to the Global Head of the BRICS Business Council and I asked her, is this talk potentially going to 
 
 ostracize critically important trade partners in the EU and the U.S.?
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: The trade with the U.S. in the European Union is vital for many countries in Africa. How is it important? And will it be possible to 
 
 straddle both China's interests and those of the U.S. and Europe?
 
BUSI MABUZA, CHAIRPERSON OF GLOBAL BRICS BUSINESS COUNCIL: Well, that's not the sense that I got from the presentations from the President of China, 
 
 but most certainly, as a South African, I want to protect the trade that we have with the U.S. because we are at the moment trading in high value added 
 
 products with our partners in the U.S. and our partners in the European Union.
 
And those are significant trading partners for South Africa and business has been absolutely clear in informing our government that trade is very 
 
 important to us. It's not a binary equation in my mind. We want the opportunity especially for an economy that's growing at such an anemic rate 
 
 as ours is.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: One of the key takeaways, I think, from a business perspective at the summit has been China openly saying that they are wanting to have the 
 
 less extractive relationship with South Africa and possibly other countries will remain.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
But, Julia that for years China's been criticized of just taking raw materials from the continent and not finished products is an enormous trade 
 
 imbalance between African nations, particularly South Africa and China, whether they can put their money where their mouth is it's a different 
 
 story.
 
But it is fascinating that these very real discussions are happening that could alter the way that the global powers do business in the years to 
 
 come, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I think the response should be actions speak louder than words and perhaps they could start with some of the opacity surrounding the 
 
 debt. We can reconvene in that conversation. David McKenzie, there thank you. Former Trump Attorney Rudy Giuliani is heading to Georgia where he is 
 
 set to surrender to Fulton County authority.
 
He's been charged as a co-conspirator in a sprawling indictment against 19 people, including Former President Donald Trump, for efforts to overturn 
 
 the 2020 election. In the past hour, Giuliani struck a defiant note as he left his home in New York. Take a listen to what he told reporters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I don't know if I plead today. But if I do, I plead not guilty. And I get photographed. Isn't that nice? A mug 
 
 shot for the man who probably put the worst criminals of the 20th century in jail. You find a prosecutor who has a better record of mine in the last 
 
 100 years but you don't or Mayor.
 
And they're going to degrade themselves by doing a mug shot of me, like people won't recognize it. And now of course, they can fingerprint me but 
 
 I've been fingerprinted 150 times. So this will turn out exactly like the FBI search turned out. They're lying. I'm telling the truth.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Katelyn Polantz joins us from outside the courthouse in Fulton County, Georgia, where of course, Rudy Giuliani is headed. Katelyn, I'm 
 
 sure you listen to the whole of that when he spoke he firmly aligned himself with the Former President, no questions asked.
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: He is doing that. Although, Julia, it is going to be a very intense day for Rudy Giuliani, 
 
 where he is essentially by himself with the help of a friend Bernard Kerik, the Former Police Commissioner in New York City is going to be traveling 
 
 with him.
 
He has some others in his entourage and Georgia lawyer to help him through the day, but as one of the 19 defendants here, there are things that each 
 
 of them have to do to respond to this criminal indictment in Georgia. And what Rudy Giuliani has on his dance card for the day is getting in from New 
 
 York to Georgia, to Atlanta, getting into the courthouse complex.
 
And then negotiating with prosecutors on what his bond terms should be. It's already highly unusual that he would be doing that every other 
 
 defendant in this case that has come through more than half of the 19 have come through this process to have their bond agreements set before they 
 
 report to jail.
 
None of them, as far as we can tell, personally showed up at the courthouse to be part of those initial discussions, but he seems to want to be part of 
 
 it here. And then after that takes place, same day instead of spacing this out a little bit, giving himself a breather as a criminal defendant.
 
He wants to go to jail the same day and be arrested, have his mug shot taken been fingerprinted. All of the things that will happen in that jail 
 
 just as there have been six others process here in this case, who spent some time at the jail here in Fulton County already. And so we're watching 
 
 to see all of this play out for Rudy Giuliani.
 
Our understanding is that his intention is he wants to be done in doing all of this process in Georgia before the attention turns to the only person in 
 
 this case more famous than Giuliani is and that would be Donald Trump, who is set to arrive tomorrow.
 
CHATTERLEY: Katelyn, thank you so much for that. And we just learned Kenneth Chesebro another defendant in the case of surrendered at the county 
 
 jail in Fulton County. He was the architect of the fake electors plot are accused of such. Katelyn once again thank you.
 
OK straight ahead, building a bigger BRICS the five member nation block is considering expanding its ranks but will it bigger BRICS be a better BRICS? 
 
 And what's the overarching purpose of the BRICS anyway, expect analysis and the summit continues, just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move". And U.S. stock markets are open for business this Wednesday at a higher start to the trading day despite 
 
 fresh concerns about the health of the U.S. consumer from sneaker giant Foot Locker, the latest retailer to warn on sales softness.
 
Investors, also awaiting important earnings later in the day from AI chip maker Nvidia. In the meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin touting the 
 
 rising influence, quote of the five BRIC nations that their summit in South Africa Wednesday. The geopolitical bloc established back in 2009 was 
 
 expanded in 2010 and created to help advance the interests of nations not traditionally aligned with the West.
 
But agreeing on common policies has been a challenge to say the least especially in light of Russia's war in Ukraine. And speaking with one voice 
 
 will only grow harder if the BRIC expands their ranks. Ideas also been discussed at this year's summit to a common BRICS reserve currency and even 
 
 a BRICS games to rival next year's Paris Olympics lofty goals.
 
What's the reality? Harsh Pant joins us now he's the Vice President of Studies and Foreign Policy at the Observer Research Foundation. He's also a 
 
 Professor of International Relations at the Indian Institute at King's College London, Harsh, fantastic to have you on the show.
 
It's a group that struggled, I think in the past for coherence in terms of what the vision is? How they all piece together, despite their vast size in 
 
 terms of population? What are they at this moment, as they perhaps look to expand?
 
HARSH PANT, VICE PRESIDENT OF FOREIGN POLICY AT OBSERVER RESEARCH FOUNDATION: I think they are still struggling to find a common vision. And 
 
 the challenge for them is that at a time when all these five nations are very different stages of their economic development.
 
How do you get together and frame a global response is a question that almost all these countries are grappling with? And they have very different 
 
 aspirations from the present global water especially the big ones like China, India, Russia, Russia and China wanting to create a relatively empty 
 
 based platform out of BRICS.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
And India and others resisting that orientation so I think the challenge has only mounted as BRICS has perhaps become a brand. That has been much in 
 
 recognition with 40 odd members, for example, as we are told, has applied for its membership. But as the brand has grown, I think if you look at the 
 
 accomplishments, they have been very limited apart from the New Development Bank that was created.
 
And that has done reasonably well. But I think apart from that, there has been nothing much to showcase. And therefore, the challenge going forward 
 
 is only going to grow as these five countries struggle to get around great to get a consensus on a common vision and a common agenda.
 
CHATTERLEY: A perfect illustration, I think of the battle that you're talking about the ideological battle, among many others is the success of 
 
 India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi today with that lunar landing and the failure of Russia earlier this week.
 
And I think the ideological differences perhaps in, who you add at this moment, and who they stand behind in terms of nations? We're at a point, I 
 
 think, where China and India would like to be seen as the leader of the global south and that representation and the direction, I think that takes 
 
 the Global South, but also the world potentially, and the relationships around the world is critical at this moment.
 
PANT: Oh, yes, absolutely. And India, for example, this year also holds the presidency of the G20. So the G20 summit is coming up early next month. And 
 
 India has pivoted around its residency around this idea of Global South and is projecting the agenda of the Global South, on the various global 
 
 platforms.
 
So I think at the moment, what we are witnessing is, India trying to evolve into a global leader into a reader that is perhaps more of a responsible 
 
 stakeholder than, say, China, which is seen as a more of a disrupter. And in that battle, I think you'll see some of the tension that is emerging 
 
 within BRICS.
 
That BRICS which wants to expand, but under whose terms and who is going to decide the parameters. This is what India is asking. And China is very keen 
 
 to expand without defining those parameters. So I think the expansion is likely to happen.
 
But expansion will happen very gradually, unlike what China has often demanded, because of this resistance from not only India, but also 
 
 countries like Brazil and South Africa, which want clear demarcation of the standards and principles for expansion.
 
But also you see this dissonance between the varying economic capacities of different nations within BRICS, you talked about India's lunar landing and 
 
 Russia's failure earlier on that front, again, juxtaposing that there is also a balance of power issue within BRICS, which has yet to be resolved in 
 
 a manner that can make BRICS a more of a cohesive organization.
 
So I think the challenges are there. And the attempt would be at least in this summit, to paper over those differences and come up with a joint 
 
 statement that talks about future, that talks about some of the opportunities that exist as a large part of the world seeks to move beyond 
 
 the binaries of great power politics, but how successful BRICS will be that remains to be seen.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. How gradually? Can you define gradually in terms of the addition of new members? And to your point, is there enough trust among 
 
 these individuals to put further backing behind the New Development Bank to talk about the prospect of utilizing some form of common currency for trade 
 
 relations? Is there enough trust?
 
PANT: That is, I think, the fundamental issue and I think many have argued that first BRICS needs to build internal cohesion, internal trust amongst 
 
 the five members before it can expand and before it can bring in other members into the fold, because unless there is trust in the eye.
 
And we are talking to we live in an age where trust is an essential variable, even when we talk officials like supply chains and economic 
 
 partnerships. Therefore, political trust is becoming very, very important. And for especially between India and China, the trust levels have almost 
 
 disappeared.
 
So it will be very interesting to see how India engages with China on BRICS and how it goes forward. But I think that that remains an essential 
 
 question. And therefore, the expansion of BRICS is going to be very, very gradual, perhaps it few countries will be announced this year, a few.
 
40 have applied apparently, but I think not more than four to five countries are likely to be admitted in the first round. And as this process 
 
 moves forward, it is going to be an even uphill battle for BRICS to create a consensus because this is a consensus based organization.
 
And if you increase the members if you increase partners, then to have consensus in the larger grouping is going to be even more difficult.

So therefore, I think that you know, the country is a good movement to move forward gingerly but really the challenges have only just begun because I 
 
 think that the international environment has changed completely and is evolving in a direction that perhaps many would not have liked a few years 
 
 back.
 
And especially India, which wants to have strong ties with the West to manage China. India finds itself in a particularly difficult situation in 
 
 balancing some of these very difficult claims that we are witnessing global politics, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, well put, I can't have a notice you're coming to us from New Delhi. Are you a space fan, Harsh? Will you be celebrating the space 
 
 achievements?
 
PANT: I think it is one of those moments in India where, you know, almost the entire country stands together and space has been for long frontier, 
 
 which Indians have looked forward, especially young Indians, they look forward to India's achievements in that domain.
 
And I think a lot almost the entire country was eagerly looking at the live telecast of the landing of Chandrayaan on the moon. So I think it's a proud 
 
 moment for India and Indians. But I think it's also a proud moment for a large part of the world that is in collective enterprise moving in a 
 
 direction where we can look at space and look at moon and other actors in this wider domain for the benefit of larger mankind.
 
So I think that's the vision behind India's Chandrayaan and I hope that's the vision behind the other space activities that are going on in other 
 
 parts of the world as well.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, hopefully good for humanity, thank you India for your efforts. Harsh, I hope you'll be celebrating tonight. Lovely, to chat to 
 
 you, sir, thank you. Harsh Pant there, the Vice President of Studies and Foreign Policy at the Observer Research Foundation and Professor of 
 
 International Relations at King's College London, Indian Institute.
 
And finally, what's tall and tan and stands in a leak all of her own. I can tell you the newest addition to bright zoo in Tennessee. A spotless giraffe 
 
 was born at the end of July and made her public debut just a few days ago. She's cute. The calf is actually a reticulated giraffe species native to 
 
 the Horn of Africa.
 
And zoo officials say she might be the only solid colored calf of her kind living anywhere on the planet. The zoo's Founder says the little one is 
 
 putting a much needed spotlight on Giraffe Conservation. They just shows only 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild.
 
Now the spotless superstar just needs a name. The zoo is letting fans vote for their favorite the winning one will be announced next month. It won't 
 
 be spot, be mistaken for a horse actually there, very cute anyway. That's it for the show. "World Sport" is next, I'll see you tomorrow.
