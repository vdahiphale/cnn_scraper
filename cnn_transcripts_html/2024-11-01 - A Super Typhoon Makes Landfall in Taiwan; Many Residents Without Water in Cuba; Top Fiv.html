COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Happy Friday, Fri-yay. I`m Coy Wire, aka the Queen of Hearts. If you want to see the Halloween costume my 
 
 daughters chose for me, you can head to @coywire on Instagram. Oh, boy. 
 
I hope you had an absolutely awesome Halloween and you`re ready to finish this week strong before we rock on into the weekend. We have a ton of news 
 
 today and only 10 minutes to do it, so let`s get to it. 
 
Massive waves crashing over seawalls, trees snapping like twigs, and torrential rain. That`s what`s happening right now in Taiwan. 
 
Typhoon Kong-rey, a powerful storm struck this week. It`s the largest typhoon to hit the island since 1996. If this storm were a car, it`d be 
 
 cruising at 125 miles per hour. That`s how fast the winds are blowing. 
 
What makes Kong-rey special is not just its speed, though. It`s the size. The storm`s strongest winds extend about 200 miles. That`s like having a 
 
 storm that could as wide as almost the entire state of Maine.
 
The impact, well, it`s been significant. Sadly, one person has lost their life and dozens of others have been injured as of the time of the taping of 
 
 this show. Taiwan has called in over 34,000 soldiers to help with rescue efforts and evacuated more than 8,600 people from dangerous areas.
 
More than 500 flights have been canceled, including 300 international ones. Even the famous high-speed rail is running at limited capacity. Taiwan`s 
 
 weather experts warned about extremely torrential rainfall, and that is their highest warning level.
 
Some areas in eastern and north Taiwan could see an additional 20 inches of rain, which could lead to flash flooding and landslides. Scientists say 
 
 that warmer oceans are making the storms like Kong-rey intensify more quickly than they used to. This is actually Taiwan`s third typhoon this 
 
 year.
 
After Taiwan, Kong-rey is not done yet. The storm is headed toward the East China Sea and Japan. You can head to cnn.com for the latest updates on its 
 
 path. 
 
Up next, we`re getting an update on Cuba. Cuba`s infrastructure crisis has deepened as water shortages now affect over one million residents across 
 
 the island, following the devastating three-day power grid failure we reported on earlier this month. 
 
Some neighborhoods have gone more than two weeks without running water, while Cuban officials blame U.S. economic sanctions. They acknowledge the 
 
 crisis stems from aging infrastructure, with the power outages creating a vicious cycle that further disrupts water access. The situation has exposed 
 
 issues with Cuba`s basic utilities. 
 
Here`s our Patrick Oppmann with some more details on this story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Some days in many parts of Cuba, it seems there`s water everywhere but actually 
 
 inside people`s houses, like the power grid that crashed across the island for more than three days. Earlier this month, the island`s aging, poorly 
 
 maintained water system is also barely functioning.
 
Enough water spills in the street in some places to even wash your car. The day we first visit this hardscrabble neighborhood on the outskirts of 
 
 Havana, residents tell us they`ve not had running water in over two weeks.
 
Cuban officials blame U.S. sanctions in part for the failing water system, but acknowledged the crisis has grown to impact nearly 10% of the 
 
 population.
 
The water shortages have led some Cubans to take to the streets in protest, something the government usually does not tolerate. The worsening power 
 
 situation has a direct impact on the water supply.
 
(On camera): Many people, if not most people in Cuba don`t get water every day. You might get water for a few hours, every other day, every third day, 
 
 it`s what`s known as "el dia de agua," Water Day. When there`s a power cut, you don`t get any water that day either. The government says it sends water 
 
 trucks to help with the problem. But there are not enough to go around.

 uniform made by local women that`s designed to grow the students.

WIRE:  Pop quiz, hot shot. Where was the character Hello Kitty created? England, China, Japan, or America?
 
Put up your hand if you said Japan. Hello Kitty was created in 1974 by Yuko Shimizu, an illustrator for the Japanese entertainment company Sanrio. 
 
 Hello Kitty first appeared on a vinyl coin purse in Japan in 1975.
 
Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, an iconic pop culture cat. Today, Hello Kitty is celebrating 50 years of spreading joy and cuteness around 
 
 the world. With her signature red bow, Hello Kitty has become the world`s second-highest-grossing franchise at $80 billion.
 
That is perfectly impressive for what started as a simple coin purse design back in 1974. Here`s our Hanako Montgomery with more details on this possum 
 
 story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In this sea of Hello Kitties, it`s hard for superfan Asako Kanda to pick her 
 
 favorite. 
 
ASAKO KANDA, HELLO KITTY SUPERFAN (through translation): This one talks. She said, "I missed you."
 
MONTGOMERY:  Like many fans before her, Kanda was drawn to Hello Kitty as a child. Her collection`s grown a bit since then.
 
(On camera):  So this Hello Kitty is a special Hello Kitty that`s celebrating her 50th birthday, and she`s wearing a tartan because Hello 
 
 Kitty herself is actually British. 
 
(Voice-over):  She loves them all like family. Getting rid of any is out of the question.
 
With her iconic red bow and mouthless charm, Hello Kitty has captivated generations of fans. In her 50 years, she`s been a United Nations 
 
 ambassador, met global stars, and even picked up some sports, all while taking Japan`s kawaii, or cute, culture from niche to worldwide. And her 
 
 hard work`s paid off.
 
Worth $80 billion, Hello Kitty is the second-highest-grossing franchise in the world, according to TitleMax.

WIRE:  All right, it is shout-out time, and today I want to give a special shout-out to Gildersleeve Middle School in Newport News, Virginia. Thank 
 
 you for being part of the CNN 10 family. 
 
Did you know that Virginia is the birthplace of more U.S. presidents than any other state? Pretty cool. 
 
I also want to give a big hello and shout-out to my old neighbor Ryan, Mr. Griffith`s eighth-grade class, and all our friends at Daniel Island School 
 
 in Charleston, South Carolina. Rise up.
 
Cue that Friday music, nadir. Go on out. Have an awesome weekend. Make someone smile. You are more powerful than you know. I`ll see you right back
