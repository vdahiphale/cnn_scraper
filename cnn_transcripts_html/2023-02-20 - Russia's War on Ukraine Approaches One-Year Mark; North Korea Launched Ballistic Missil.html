BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and all around the world. I'm Bianca Nobilo.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Max Foster joining you live from London. Just ahead on "CNN Newsroom," Poland preparing for the arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine. What has visit signals to Russia?
 
NOBILO:  The U.S. warns China not to cross a red line by providing military aid to Russia. We are live in Beijing with reactions.
 
FOSTER:  And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinker is meeting with Turkish officials to discuss earthquake relief for Turkey and Syria. We are live in (INAUDIBLE) with the latest.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Live from London, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo.
 
FOSTER:  We are now nearing the one-year mark in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and U.S. President Joe Biden plans to mark that grim anniversary in Poland.
 
NOBILO:  He is set to travel to Warsaw later today where he will meet with his Polish counterpart and speak Tuesday at the royal castle of Warsaw. The Polish prime minister explained what he is expecting from the visit.
 
MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, PRIME MINISTER OF POLAND:  I expect that there will be a very strong confirmation of our resilience and our joint efforts to defeat Russia in Ukraine because instead of saying some western European politicians say that Russia cannot win this war and Ukraine cannot be defeated, we have to change the paradigm and we have to say Ukraine must win and Russia must be defeated.
 
I believe that the words of President Biden will reassure all Europe that the United States is with us in this fight for freedom and peace.

NOBILO:  CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has a preview of the president's trip from the White House.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  President Joe Biden is set to visit Poland ahead of the one-year mark of Russia invading Ukraine. He will use this opportunity, White House officials say, to reinforce support for Ukraine and show unity among allies.
 
Now, during his visit, he is expected to meet with the Polish president as well as with a group of eastern flank NATO allies. He is also expected to deliver remarks, and in those remarks again show support and note the humanitarian and security assistance that Ukraine will continue to get as it fights this ongoing war with Russia. Now, White House officials said those remarks are not only intended for the American people but for the world, including Russia.
 
Now, we got a sense from the administration on their tone with Russia when Vice President Kamala Harris, during the Munich Security Conference, said that Russia had committed crimes against humanity. That is a step further from where the administration has been before, saying that they have committed war crimes.
 
Now, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has said that it is resident important for allies to speed up, that they cannot have delay as they fight this war with Russia. Expect President Biden to address all of that during his visit in Poland.
 
Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER:  The House Republicans are calling on U.S. President Joe Biden to increase military support for Ukraine.
 
NOBILO:  House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul and Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner were in Munich this weekend where Ukraine was the central focus. McCaul told CNN that bipartisan support for Ukraine is still very strong in Congress. He also warned against hedging aid which he argues could prolong the conflict.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE MCCAUL, U.S. HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  For the past year, we've been very slow at getting these weapons in in the name of it being too provocative. Whether it be stingers, javelins, short-range artillery, now longer-range artillery, they can take out the Iranian drones in Crimea, and also aviation like F-16.
 
If we put this stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different as we look at the anniversary on February 24th. The longer they drag this out, they play into Putin's hands.
 
He wants this to be a long, protracted war because he knows that potentially, he will lose -- we could lose the will of the American people and, therefore, the Congress. We are seeing the same dynamic in the European parliaments.
 <br>[03:04:55]
 
Strong support now, but they're worried that if this doesn't end with a resolution, you know, sooner rather than later, this will be an issue for us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us here in London with more. All eyes on this trip to Poland. Why Poland and how will it be seen in Moscow, do you think?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Obviously, this is in the lead up to the anniversary, which is on Friday. It comes 11 months after we saw President Biden in Poland giving that major speech where he said, I think, for God's sake, cannot stay in power, which was met with some controversy, of course, in Russia.
 
But this is about the transatlantic alliance, reaffirming the sort of commitment to Ukraine and in particular the U.S. leadership, which is not just about messaging, it is material. We have seen the impact of Germany having to be pressured to send tanks and would only do so when the U.S. did the same.
 
So, the U.S. is by far the biggest donor in absolute terms, continues to be. I think its position there is also a catalyst for other donors. So, that is important to Ukraine right now when it wants more support and it wants it really quickly.
 
I think there is regional issue as well. We've had a lot of talk about Moldova. President Zelenskyy is saying he doesn't think Ukraine will be Russia's last stop.
 
And it is interesting that Biden will also be meeting with the Bucharest Nine, which are the NATO countries along the eastern flank of NATO, along Russia's border, really sort of showing NATO and U.S. commitment to defense -- to the defensive posture there.
 
I think as for Russia, this will be met with more of the same rhetoric that we've seen, that they believe they are now fighting a war against the U.S. and NATO and use this as evidence, as they say, of U.S. involvement.
 
FOSTER:  Clare, thank you very much, indeed.
 
NOBILO:  In the meantime, the U.S. believes that China might provide military support for Russia amid its continued invasion of Ukraine.
 
FOSTER:  During the meeting with China's top diplomat, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he warned Wang Yi of consequences if this should happen. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. echoes those sentiments.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  We also have to be clear that if there are any thoughts and efforts by the Chinese and others to provide lethal support to the Russians in their brutal attack against Ukraine that that is unacceptable. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Well, Blinken also said Chinese companies have already been providing lethal support to Moscow. Wang Yi is expected to visit Moscow, the first visit from a Chinese official to Russia since the start of the war.
 
NOBILO:  CNN's Beijing bureau chief Steven Jiang joins us now with more. Steven, can you explain to us where the Chinese government's heads would be at in terms of the real politic of this, the strategic problems and advantages of providing Russia with more support in its invasion of Ukraine?
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF:  Well, Bianca, first of all, China just formerly and very strongly pushed back on Blinken's public assertion and with the foreign ministry officials saying that China does not accept the U.S. finger-pointing and coercion on this issue because they try to turn the tables on the U.S., saying it is the U.S. that has been sending weapons to the war and throwing fire -- throwing fuel to the fire and trying to profit from the war.
 
Now, the language may sound familiar, but the timing of this back and forth is very notable because, as you mentioned, Wang Yi is visiting Moscow after that Munich trip on the eve of this anniversary, seeing senior Russian officials and likely Putin himself and paving the way, according to Russian media, for a visit by Xi Jinping in Moscow later this year.
 
So, the U.S. is clearly increasingly frustrated with China on its role in this war despite Beijing's public pledge of -- quote, unquote -- "neutrality." What has been happening in the past year or what we have seen is, of course, China and Russia going closer politically but especially economically with bilateral trade, for example, soaring to a new high.
 
That is part of the reason why Blinken said from day one they are having a lot of concern in terms of China helping Russia mitigate or even minimize the impact of western sanctions even before the latest assessment.
 
Now, this assessment, of course, also comes on the heel of the whole spy balloon saga and the fallout from that makes it even more difficult for China to be willing to work with the U.S. on the Ukraine issue.
 
Now, what is interesting is Wang Yi actually met with his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich, obviously publicly saying how China respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but the reality is China state media is still refusing to call the Russian ministry campaign an invasion, not to mention Putin and Xi have talked on the phone and met in person multiple times in the past year, but Xi has yet to talk to Zelenskyy even once.
 
So that is why advocates say despite all the public posturing, Xi Jinping is very much sticking to Putin because of the two men's very much shared resentment and hostility towards the U.S. That is also why China's assertion that it is the only peacemaker in the room just rings very hollow to many people. Bianca?
 
NOBILO:  Steven Jiang in Beijing, thank you so much.
 
FOSTER:  Now, tensions are escalating in the Korean Peninsula as North Korea launched two more ballistic missiles on Monday morning. Japan's defense ministry says officials are still analyzing the data but both missiles fell into the sea off Japan to the east of the Korean Peninsula.
 <br>[03:10:02]
 
NOBILO:  Pyongyang says the tests are in response to joint military drills held by the U.S. in South Korea and Japan's prime minister is calling for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in response to the launch.
 
FOSTER:  For more, let's go to CNN's Paula Hancocks. She joins us live from Seoul, South Korea. What is particularly concerning then about this particular firing?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Max and Bianca, it has been a busy few days here on the Korean Peninsula. The most significant launch from North Korea happened over the weekend. It happened Saturday morning. On Sunday morning, Pyongyang said that it was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now, these are the types that they claim can hit mainland United States, the longer range that are more of a concern to Washington.
 
What we heard also from Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, she gave a statement saying that they were testing and have now mastered the missile reentry technology, which they would need in order to be able to use these ICBMs correctly. Now, of course, it is very difficult to know whether or not that is the case, but this is what Pyongyang is saying.
 
And so, on Sunday, we saw a reaction from the U.S. and South Korean air forces. They had a flyover across the Korean Peninsula with a B-1 bomber, escorted by some South Korean fighter jets, and that irritated Pyongyang. Those B-1 bombers flying near the peninsula are always likely to get a response from North Korea and that is what we saw this morning, this Monday morning, which is what North Korea said was firing of a super large multiple rocket launcher.
 
So, we are seeing somewhat of a tit-for-tat retaliation by both sides from North Korea and then from the U.S. and South Korea. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear as though that is going to be (INAUDIBLE) any time soon because there are more military drills coming between the U.S. and South Korea which always gets a response from Pyongyang. This week at the Pentagon, there is expected to be a nuclear desktop tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korea. Next month, there will be a bigger drill between the U.S. and South Korea militaries, the springtime exercises, which historically have solicited some kind of response from Pyongyang.
 
FOSTER:  Okay, Paula, thank you, joining us from Seoul.
 
NOBILO:  In the U.S., Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is calling for accountability from Norfolk Southern Rail Company and is demanding stronger rail safety measures after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio two weeks ago.
 
FOSTER:  Buttigieg raised his concerns in a letter to the company's CEO on Sunday. Earlier, Norfolk Southern CEO defended his company's decision to carry out controlled destinations of tanks carrying toxic chemicals.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALAN SHAW, CEO, NORFOLK SOUTHERN:  I think we did what we needed to do in order to prevent an uncontrolled explosion in the evening. Private well testing we need to continue to monitor and test the wells and wait for those test results to come back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Meanwhile, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says the air and water in East Palestine are safe but understands residents' concerns.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH):  They are right to be skeptical. The EPA administrator when I was there, both the state and federal EPA, the administrators said that, but when you return to your home -- we think the water is safe, but when you return to your home, it should be safe again for your water and your soil and your air, not to mention those that have their own wells.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Meanwhile, a resident who lives near the crash site shared this video with CNN. Watch this. You can see clouds in the water and bubbles on the surface in the creek near East Palestine.
 
NOBILO:  And Pennsylvania Senator Doug Mastriano filmed his visit to the derailment site to a local creek. Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DOUG MASTRIANO, PENNSYLVANIA STATE SENATE MEMBER:  It looks fine. (INAUDIBLE) watch what happen when I disturb the water a bit (INAUDIBLE) chemicals. Luminous colors. The chemicals (INAUDIBLE) smell to it.
 
(COUGHING) MASTRIANO:  They are heavier than the water molecules. They settle in the stream bed. So, it is going to take a lot of work to truly clear up and clean all these toxins and poisons. There is no fish here. It's dead. You see those colors down there?
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Yes, sir. Thank you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO:  And Ohio's Department of Health has announced that it's opening a health clinic in East Palestine on Tuesday. It will provide medical care to those affected by the derailment.
 
FOSTER:  So many mysteries surrounding that. Still ahead, Antony Blinken is discussing a range of issues with Turkish officials. We will have the latest on his visit to Ankara.
 
NOBILO:  Plus, a small town in Georgia is coming to terms with the news that their beloved former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is in hospice care.
 <br>[03:15:00]
 
We will take you there. The details after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER:  Welcome back. In Brazil, heavy rain and landslides (INAUDIBLE) Sao Paulo State killing at least 36 people. Officials have declared a state of calamity in several coastal cities, some of which are now under water.
 
NOBILO:  All of this happening during carnival, the popular festival that attracts millions of tourists each year. Officials fear that many of those partygoers could be trapped in those flooded areas.
 
In the next hour, the U.S. Secretary of State is expected to meet with the president of Turkey to discuss security and recovery efforts after a powerful earthquake that ravaged the country.
 
FOSTER:  Earlier, Antony Blinken discussed the matter with his Turkish counterpart in Ankara. He also announced an additional $100 million in aid for Turkey as well as hard-hit Syria.
 
NOBILO:  More than 46,000 people in both countries have been confirmed dead two weeks after the earthquake struck. Nada Bashir is there in the southwestern city of Adana, Turkey. Nada, bring us the latest on these rescue efforts, relief efforts, and how the country is coping.
 <br>[03:20:03]
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Bianca, for the last two weeks, it has been remarkable to see that we are still seeing survivors being pulled. Of course, those rescues are growing few and far between.
 
In fact, the Turkish authorities now say that search and rescue operations are only ongoing in two out of 11 affected provinces. This is really shifting now from a rescue operation to more of a focus on the humanitarian response effort for those survivors and all of those people impacted across the southeast region of this country.
 
Thousands and thousands of people are impacted, left homeless, many facing very difficult conditions right now. Of course, we have seen an outpouring of support from the national community and indeed from across Turkey. There have been tents set up for some of those left homeless. We've even seen families being evacuated to other parts of the country.
 
There has been that international support. As you said there, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged further U.S. support for the Turkish response effort, $15 million to support the refugee and migration effort, another $15 million focused on the humanitarian assistance. This comes in addition to an already $85 million pledge to support both Turkey and Northwest Syria.
 
In his press conference along his Turkish counterpart, Blinken is very clear that the U.S. government will be stand behind Turkey as long as it takes. In fact, we saw Blinken visiting some of those U.S. rescue teams who flew into Turkey to support that effort. He was clear in his message to them that this will be a long process, this could take months, if not years, for Turkey to fully recover from the devastation by the earthquake.
 
It has to be said that this is difficult to grasp not only for the country but for the people impacted by this. Many of them have lost absolutely everything in addition to losing their loved ones.
 
The Turkish government for its part has committed to rebuilding those affected areas within a year. This is a huge challenge, a significant feat for the Turkish government. They claim they will begin construction around 30,000 apartments in affected areas by March. This will be the first step in a long, long process.
 
There are more than 100,000 buildings that have been destroyed or collapsed, some deemed unsafe and about to collapse, some requiring demolition process. There are still hundreds of thousands of buildings left to be assessed and evaluated.
 
Of course, there is the question of accountability. There is a sense of frustration, sort of anger among some here in Turkey, questions as to whether the government did enough to prepare for potential earthquake of this scale, whether aid go to those in need quick enough.
 
The government says it is carrying out investigations into the allegations of construction negligence in parts of the country. Some 400 people identified as potential suspects already. According to state media, at least 120 people were already arrested.
 
Again, like all of this, that is going to be a long process. Of course, with elections coming up, there is a sense of backlash against President Erdogan. Secretary Blinken meeting, of course, with the Turkish president later today. There is a whole host of issues on the agenda but, of course, the response effort to the earthquake will be the main focus of today's discussions. Bianca, Max?
 
NOBILO:  Nada Bashir in Adana, Turkey, thank you very much.
 
FOSTER:  Now, an orphaned baby, who started her life amidst the chaos of the earthquake, has a new family. The child known as Aya or miracle was born beneath the rubble of her parents' apartment building. Rescue workers found her still attached by umbilical cord to her mother's lifeless body 10 hours after the quake struck. Now, Aya's aunt and uncle have adopted her and named her Afraa after her late mother.
 
NOBILO:  For more information on how you can help the earthquake victims, go to cnn.com/impact to find a list of organizations working on rescue and relief efforts.
 
FOSTER:  The people of the small town of Plains, Georgia and many others around the world are praying, really, for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter as he receives hospice care at home.
 
NOBILO:  On Sunday, the church where Carter has taught Sunday school for decades prayed for his family. CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Plains, Georgia with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We know from an official that President Biden has been maintaining close contact with the Carter family. He has been informed of Carter's declining health and his decision to undergo hospice care.
 
Now, we're hearing from President Biden directly via tweet. He put out this comment, saying, to our friends Jimmy and Rosalynn and to their family, Jill and I are with you in prayer and send you our love. We admire you for the strength and humility that you have shown in difficult times.
 <br>[03:24:59]
 
May you continue your journey with grace and dignity, and God grant you peace.
 
So, I am standing right now very close to Main Street here in Plains, Georgia, the hometown of Jimmy Carter, where everywhere you look, there's a piece of history, of Carter history here. To my left, beyond what you can see through these trees behind me, his high school where he learned about American history and probably never thinking that one day he would become Mr. 39, the 39th president of the United States.
 
And actually, as we look down this way beyond the train tracks less than a mile away, a couple of blocks, is the home that he built in 1961, the home that he still lives in today with his wife. And over to your left right here, this building that is now museum, that is a presidential campaign headquarter for his 1976 presidential bid. This is the spot where thousands of people would drop by to get a sense of how a peanut farmer wanted to become president of the United States.
 
I also want you to take a look at this video. This hospice news is really coming for and a half months after he celebrated his 98th birthday. This video you're looking at was the weekend before that, where they are at the Plains annual peanut festival, waving at the crowds there. This may have been one of his last public appearances here in Plains.
 
The hospice news of Carter preparing for his end of life, his family preparing, is understandably walking coins (ph).
 
PHILIP KURLAND, OWNER, PLAINS TRADING POST:  This is emotional. The fact that he won't be coming in the store anymore, he won't be here, he won't be at meetings, but to know every little thing I do here, he'll be with me.
 
If I said something to his family, I would say, yes, I know you're mourning and yes, I know you're hurting, but I hope you celebrate his life, too, because what a life, what a world on life.
 
ROSALES:  And Carter has always been known as a man of deep, deep faith. In fact, he taught at Maranatha Baptist Church Sunday school every single week until his health issues really forced him to take a step back away from that. In Sunday service, his congregation, his fellow people in faith were sending out prayers to him and wishing his family comfort.
 
Isabel Rosales, CNN, Plains, Georgia.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NOBILO:  What hospice care mean for Mr. Carter going forward? Here's how one doctor explained it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN:  So, what is hospice? Basically, you're eligible for hospice if your physician thinks that you're in the last six months of your life. You can enter hospice for any other number of reasons: Cancer, dementia, heart failure, or many, many other diagnoses.
 
And what it means when you enter a hospice is that you are going to be focusing on managing your symptoms. Pain, shortness of breath, other physical symptoms, but also focusing on managing your emotional and spiritual needs.
 
What folks find when they enter hospice is that they do have a health care provider who is dedicated to managing medications. They also may have access to physical therapy or occupational therapy to home health aides, people who are dedicated to making sure that they get to spend the last weeks or months of their life the way that they want.
 
One additional detail about hospice that most people don't know is that it is not necessarily permanent. If you decide that you do want to go back and try to get curative treatment, if there are new treatments available or something changes in your personal or family situation, you're not stuck with it forever. But for those who do enter hospice, they find that it makes those final weeks or months so much more pleasant.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Well, the Carter Center said in a statement that the former U.S. president decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family after series of hospital stays.
 
NOBILO:  And still to come, a show of support from the U.S. president as the war in Ukraine nears the one-year mark. We are on Joe Biden's trip to Poland, coming up next. 
 
FOSTER:  And as the U.S. president heads to Poland, we will speak to a teacher living in Kyiv about what life is like now a year after the war began.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
FOSTER:  Welcome back to our viewers joining us in the United States and all around the world. I'm Max Foster. 
 
NOBILO:  And I'm Bianca Nobilo. U.S. President Joe Biden is heading to Poland later today to mark the one year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He's expected to meet with his polish counterpart, President Andrzej Duda, after arriving in Warsaw. 
 
FOSTER:  And he'll also be delivering remarks Tuesday at Royal Castle Warsaw where he is expected to reaffirm U.S. support for Ukraine. Ukraine's president has thanked world leaders for the ongoing support, but how Ukrainian citizens coping as the fighting drags on and on.
 
Joining us live from Kyiv is Olena Chekryzhova, a volunteer English teacher. Thank you so much for joining us. What are your thoughts heading up to this anniversary on Friday?
 
OLENA CHECKRYZHOVA, VOLUNTEER ENGLISH TEACHER:  Well, the date is approaching. And I think that now each Ukrainian is reconsidering the experiences of this war because the day is definitely divided our lives into before and after the war. This year was extremely hard for all Ukrainians, and especially, the last several months, because we had to survive without electricity, without heating, running water, under constant attacks, rocket strikes, and drone attacks.
 
But against all odds, we have gone through this. And nevertheless, this experience boosted our unity and helped us to be more stress resilient, more consolidated, and I think more adaptive. Honestly, Ukrainians now are more realistic about the end of this war. We understand that there is no sight of the end of it. So, we are preparing for different scenarios, different ways, and I think this year taught us a lot in terms of our national identity, and in terms of our Ukrainian unity.
 <br>[03:35:06]
 
NOBILO:  And Olena, what does sustain Ukrainians when they are looking ahead and don't see an end in sight in the immediate term? And when civilians and citizens are discussing possible ways this war might end. What do you heard him talking about?
 
CHECKRYZHOVA:  We understand that -- we know that we're not going to surrender, that we're gonna continue our fight for our independence and our freedom but it is clear that the enemy outnumbers our forces, that Russian troops have the advantage in terms of their personnel, ammunition, equipment.
 
That is why it's clear that we are not going to win the war without support. That is why this visit of U.S. President Joe Biden to Poland to mark the anniversary of this brutal and unprovoked invasion seems to be a very positive and reassuring sign for Ukrainians as we hope that the U.S. and other nations, other allies, will stand with us, will stand with Ukraine, as long as it takes.
 
FOXTER:  Bakhmut is very much on the front lines of that conflict, currently. Your grandmother's from their, isn't she? You're currently looking after her? 
 
CHECKRYZHOVA:  Well, I come from Bakhmut. It's my hometown, and my family lived there for many years, all generations had their family homes there. And unfortunately, my relatives were forced to leave their homes in Bakhmut. And now, they are internally displaced as millions of Ukrainian citizens. And yes, unfortunately every day we are observing how our towns are being ruined and virtually erased. That's why it's on very -- on one hand a very tragic story, which is familiar to almost each Ukrainian. 
 
NOBILO:  And Olena, what would your message be to states that have elected to stay neutral in this or those that would promulgated the narrative that it won't add to the fighting and help Ukrainians and Russians kill each other when we know, looking at all the facts on the ground, that's patently not the case. Obviously, Russia's invading a sovereign nation. But what would your message be to those countries that haven't declared support for Ukraine and aren't actively trying to help?
 
CHECKRYZHOVA:  I think that this war has definitely sharpened and outlined the differences between Russians and Ukrainians. And now, it's obvious who is who and who is fighting for what. Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom and for their independence, for their sovereignty. And now, they're actually the guard of Europe, because all those crimes and all those war crimes, those atrocities, are happening right at the door step of Europe.
 
That's why I think that the U.S. has the key role in creating this coalition in assisting Ukraine and help to Ukraine and all possible ways. I think that democratic countries should create a coalition to support us diplomatically, militarily, legally, economically, that they should maintain sanctions against Russia, that they should continue regular shipments of military hardware, equipment, and newest weapons, modern battle tanks, an aircraft.
 
And not only sure they arm Ukraine but also train Ukrainian troops. This will allow our armed forces to push the invaders back to regain and to reclaim the occupied lands, to maintain our territorial integrity, to keep our freedom and our independence, and eventually, to become a new powerful member of western society. 
 
FOSTER: Olena Checkryzhova, thank you for joining us from Kyiv with your story there.
 
NOBILO:  Just ahead, a New Mexico woman's terrifying your long abduction ordeal comes to a dramatic end and it's all captured on camera.
 <br>[03:40:01]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO:  One person is dead and four others injured after a shooting along New Orleans Mardi Gras parade route.
 
FOSTER:  Police tell us a suspect is in custody but says unclear what led to the shooting, and they're asking for the public's help to determine, if there were others involved.
 
Police are investigating the murder of a Catholic bishop in Los Angeles Auxiliary Bishop David O'Connell was found shot to death at a home in Hacienda Heights, the area on Saturday afternoon.
 
NOBILO:  The local archbishop said that O'Connell had been a priest and bishop in Los Angeles for 45 years and describes him as a peacemaker with a heart for the poor and immigrants. 
 
And a dramatic escape took place at a New Jersey gas station earlier this month. 
 
FOSTER:  That's where New Mexico woman's terrifying yearlong abduction ordeal came to an end with the help of the station's owner.
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL (voice-over):  It was a dramatic to what police described as a nearly yearlong cross-country kidnapping. Woman seen running into this New Jersey service station in early February is escaping her suspected captor who was close behind, a man later identified as James Parrillo, Jr.
 
The yearlong ordeal started in New Mexico where the couple first met last February. The woman said she agreed to give Parrillo ride to Arizona. They eventually made their way to California, where she says the relationship took a violent turn. That's where police say Parrillo physically assaulted the women, taking away her phone and debit cards.
 
Eventually, the pair made their way cross-county in what New Jersey state police described as a yearlong nightmare. Cameras inside the store captured the moment, the barefooted woman dead bolts the door preventing her alleged kidnapper from entering.
