HUNT:  All right, 5:00 a.m. on the East Coast. A live look at Capitol on this Wednesday morning. 
 
Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us.
 
Twenty days left in the race for the White House and another battleground state getting started early. On Tuesday, more than 300,000 voters went to the polls on the first day of early voting in Georgia, setting a single day record for early voting in that state's history.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTHONY COTTON, GEORGIA VOTER:  Last time I waited, the line going around the block around the corner. Now I'm getting my vote in today, right now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  On that first day of early voting, Donald Trump appeared in Georgia trying to get out the vote after he had discouraged early voting among his supporters four years ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  Well, if you have a ballot, return it immediately, if not, go tomorrow or as soon as you can, go to the polls and vote. Then for the next 21 days, get everyone you know, to get out and vote. The people of Georgia are going to end Kamala Harris's reign of failure.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  Trump in Georgia looking for early votes. Kamala Harris continuing to step up her media appearances. She was on a virtual town hall with Charlamagne Tha God on his popular radio show, "The Breakfast Club", as she tries to draw more distinctions with her opponent in this election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS:  And by voting in this election you have two choices or you don't vote, but you have two choices if you do. And it's two very different visions for our nation. One mind that is about taking us forward and progress in investing in the American people, investing in their ambitions, dealing with their challenges. And the other, Donald Trump, is about taking us backward.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  All right, joining us now to talk about campaign in these final three weeks, Nick Johnston, publisher at "Axios". 
 
Nick, good morning. 
 
NICK JOHNSTON, PUBLISHER, AXIOS:  Good morning.
 
HUNT:  Good to see you. 
 
So we had two very different -- I mean, Harris is correct and that there seemed to be two very different visions for the country and on display here. Donald Trump, of course, was -- did a variety of appearances yesterday in which he seemed defensive about January 6, he was defensive about tariffs in an interview with "The Wall Street Journal". Harris, of course, feeling like she needs to get out there more especially, appealing to Black Americans.
 
What are you looking for watching here in the final days of this race? 
 
JOHNSTON:  I mean, like where people are trying to get the final message out. I think what the Kamala Harris campaign has done as began to change a little bit of their messaging strategy heading to a lot more places. There was a lot of criticism and a lot of showed up in the polling that people really know who she was. 
 
There was one thing to be a -- not Joe Biden and not Donald Trump, which needed provide less more of a positive message. What are you for? What are you like? 
 
And I think certainly in the past week, the Harris campaign has changed their strategy on that, showing up with Charlamagne Tha God, would be other podcasts, "60 Minutes" interview. I think she's going on Fox later this week, really trying to get more of a sense of getting into the mix, like even possibly going on Joe Rogan, we've seen some reports of. Like there'd be a big audience of trying to both tell the electorate more about who she is, and then of course finding those people who are going to vote, right? 
 
It's no more an academic exercise here as you've got to top of the hour, like they're voting now, and so, it's not just about reaching people and trying to change their mind, but making sure people well get out to vote and what's really interesting, but the media strategy, its not so much traditional places where you might find voters who are less likely to go to the polls. And I think both sides are very much and to get out the vote operations now, because as people are going to polls. It's time. 
 <br>[05:05:04]
 
HUNT:  One of the biggest differences in this election cycle, it seems to me, Nick, is that in the past, when you talk to strategists on both sides of the aisle, I feel like they're telling the same story, which is that Democrats used to be able to, if they could get what, what -- what they refer to as low propensity voters, right, people who don't normally show up, maybe they only show up in presidential years, but maybe only once in a while, or basically not at all. 
 
It used to be Democrats if they got those people to show up, could, could count on them, mostly voting for the Democrat, whereas now it seems as though Republicans actually may have the advantage of those people.
 
JOHNSTON: A lot of that flipped on the head. I don't even really know where to come down on. That is interesting because Republicans have been very critical about the way Donald Trump talked about drop boxes and early mail voting and that cost them Senate races in Georgia after the election last year. And I think Republicans are struggling right now with how do you get -- I mean, look, Donald Trump flip-flop back on that issue. He says early voting is fake and drop boxes are fake, that you showed the clip just now its like get out and vote early, vote anyway, you possibly can. 
 
So I think both parties are adjusting to this new reality of who are these low propensity voters? It is a key element. Here is something I think the thing I'm watching more now than anything, less about the messaging and more about the get-out-the-vote. Where are the candidates going to try and get these people out to vote? Because I think data to then make the difference, especially in an election, this close, you're not convincing anyone else. I can think it's very unlikely someone else is going to wake up and finally change their minds with the people you've already reached. Get them out the door. 
 
HUNT:  I thought it was interesting with Harris talking there with Charlamagne Tha God, how she said, well, you have two choices if you do vote.
 
JOHNSTON:  Right.
 
HUNT:  The reality is the choice. The more important choice maybe to be between voting and not voting for a lot of people.
 
JOHNSTON:  That's the entire thing now. So, look, Kamala Harris, that campaign raised $1 billion. If we're running out of ad slot but you could purchase for doing that. And I think there's a ton of money flying. It's something Elon Musk which poured a lot of money that the Trump campaign is talking about. 
 
As I saw recently, he's been doing a bunch of events in Pennsylvania, to attend an event with Elon Musk, you have to prove you voted in Pennsylvania, the focus is on get-out-the-vote right now. 
 
HUNT:  Interesting way to look at it. We do have a new poll out this morning, Nick, from Marquette University Law School and -- 
 
JOHNSTON:  Yeah, but it's close. 
 
HUNT:  I know, right. It's like, oh, new polling headline. Look at this 48-47. They did do a likely voter screen. So they included third- party candidates and that which is why they're both below 50. 
 
But this, I mean, I have to say when I talk to my sources, they look at this and they say, this means Trump wins the election. If it is so close in this national, obviously, we're going to talk deep down about each battleground state they all matter. It could go either way. But essentially the argument that's often made to me is that Democrats
 
 need a significant lead in the national polling if they want to see that translate and battlegrounds.
 
JOHNSTON:  Based on those trends, right, you know, a Democrat used to go with 4, 5, 6 points in the national polls because of the way the Electoral College is built. But I don't know what to believe anymore as you've taken in these kind of polls. I don't want to be a nihilist about it, but these polls are also close to movement has been so much, I think Kamala Harris have just the beginning of them saying like we're underdog, you know, but it's a race they can win, but it's not going to be easy. 
 
And when the races are that close, its a matter who gets out a betting those are the polls and that's what polls are focused on.
 
HUNT:  Yeah, for sure.  
 
All right. Nick Johnson for us this morning -- Nick, thank you. I really appreciate it.
 
JOHNSTON:  Yeah.
 
HUNT:  All right. Coming up here on CNN THIS MORNING: an ultimatum for Israel. The U.S. warning they could revoke military aid if the humanitarian situation in Gaza doesn't get better. 
 
Plus, why a judge in Georgia has blocked a new rule about hand- counting election ballots in that state. 
 
Plus, showdown in Texas. Senator Ted Cruz and his challenger, Congressman Colin Allred, debate who's best for that state.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX):  We're doing an awful lot right in the state of Texas. Colin Allred wants to change that. I want to keep Texas Texas. 
 
MODERATOR:  Senator --  
 
REP. COLIN ALLRED (D-TX):  He talks tough, but he never shows up. We have a phrase for this in Texas, all hat and no cattle. That's what Senator Cruz is.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
[05:13:17
 
HUNT:  All right. Welcome back. 
 
New this morning, a source tells CNN that Israel's plan to retaliate against Iran is, quote, ready. Israel had been weighing its response to Iran's October 1st missile attack for some time now. Israeli officials reportedly assured the U.S. that no Iranian oil or nuclear facilities would be hit, only military targets. 
 
In the meantime, the U.S. is putting Israel on notice, improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza in the next 30 days, or face potential restrictions on military aid. The ultimatum delivered in a letter jointly written by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. 
 
Among the demands, the U.S. wants Israel to allow at least 350 trucks each day to enter Gaza and pauses in fighting so that aid and vaccines can be delivered what. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTHEW MILLER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  What we have seen over the past few months is that the level of humanitarian assistance has not been sustained. In fact, it has fallen by over 50 percent from where it was at its peak. So the secretary, along with Secretary Austin, thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again, to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is out today. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  Israel vowing to address those concerns. 
 
Max Foster joins us now with more on this from London. 
 
Max, good morning. Always wonderful to see you at. 
 
Let's start with we again, we don't have a lot of information at this hour about what it is Israel has decided. We're just learning here that they are her ready with plans to retaliate against these missiles, strikes, and obviously the question has been, how far would they go? Would they hit Iranian nuclear facilities? 
 <br>[08:15:01]
 
Some former Israeli officials have been urging them to do that. Would they hit oil facilities that would have an economic impact? It seems like were learning right now. They've decided against that. They're going to try to hit military targets. How do you look at this as we try to learn more about what's next?
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Well, you know, we're going to see whether or not the U.S. have any leverage there because they are the ones saying not to go for oil, not to go for nuclear, and then Israel apparently responding saying is going to be military targets. If it is military targets and its pretty clear the U.S. has had some leverage there, which is important right now, because a lot of the world is looking at America saying you keep warning Israel not to do things, and it's ignoring you. 
 
So this will be a big test of that. Obviously, the scale of the attack will also define the scale of the response from Iran as well. So how much this escalates, all that tension in the Middle East and we've also had this letter that you were mentioning from the U.S. to Israel, another big test of whether or not Israel is listening to the United States right now, where there has the power that he should have really considering how much military aid it gives to Israel, right? 
 
HUNT:  Right. Well, Max, lets talk about that letter for a second. Because here's how "The New York Times" framed it. Because that letter its worth noting, came from the secretary of state and the secretary of defense, not from President Biden. 
 
And "The Times" writes this the decision not to put the letter in Mr. Biden's name, some aides said may provide a level of insulation for Vice President Kamala Harris, who as the Democratic nominee for president, has walked a fine line, declining to issue any threats to Israel while urging the war must end quickly. In part to end the heartbreaking loss of Palestinian lives. 
 
And they also note that this comes just three weeks, of course, before the election, but this has been a tough thing for Harris to navigate on the one hand, the left of her party, very focused on the devastation in Gaza, but on the other hand, she has been trying to move to the center to appeal to swing voters here in the U.S. at tend to support Israel.
 
FOSTER:  Yeah, and the other way that some people are saying this plays into politics as it's a 30-day deadline. So they weren't have to be a response until after the election. Also, you know, a lot of military experts are saying this is going to be academic, ultimately because if you've got a situation where there could be a conflict between Iran and Israel. and America pulled military aid to Israel, that's almost unthinkable. 
 
But clearly, the Americans are very worried about the situation in Gaza, humanitarian aid situation, doing whatever they can to make sure some aid gets in. It's just been dwindling, dwindling and dwindling. And now, we've effectively got a blockade according to the U.N. in northern Gaza, and there's no help getting in at all. People are literally starving and they need vaccinations. And it's getting worse all the time, not better.
 
HUNT:  All right. Max Foster for us this morning. Max, always grateful to have you. Thank you so much for being here. 
 
FOSTER:  All right. Coming up next here on CNN this morning, three weeks since Hurricane Helene, North Carolinas still counting the number of people missing. We'll bring you the latest ahead.

HARRIS:  The reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  Too scripted or on message? Vice President Harris responds to her critics.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:22:42]
 
HUNT:  All right. Twenty-two minutes past the hour. Here's your morning roundup.
 
Georgia counties will not be required to hand-count their ballots this election season. A judge paused the new rule from the state election board, which would have required counties to count by hand the number of ballots cast at a polling place to ensure that number matches the voting machines. The judge said it was approved too close to Election Day and would cause too much administrative chaos. 
 
More than 80 people are still unaccounted for in North Carolina, nearly three weeks after Hurricane Helene ravaged the state. That number could change as self-service and communication lines are restored. Thousands remain without power.
 
Prada is going to space. The Italian luxury brand, unveiling their design for the spacesuit for the Artemis Three lunar mission, in partnership with Axiom, the first woman and the first person of color to walk on the moon, set to wear the suit.
 
All right. Time now for weather. Falls settling in across the Central and Eastern U.S. as temperatures take a dive. 
 
Let's get to meteorologist Allison Chinchar tracking all of it for us. 
 
Allison, good morning. 
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  And good morning. 
 
It's a very chilly morning for some, already seeing some of those temperatures down into the 30s Cincinnati and St. Louis down to 37 right now, barely above freezing in Minneapolis. Yes, things are going to warm up maybe a little bit, but not quite to where I think most people would like to see them. 
 
You've got a lot of frost and freeze alerts out almost 65 million people under some type of that alert on the eastern half of the country because it's going to be a chilly morning today. 
 
But for some, its also going to be a chilly morning yet again, tomorrow, Atlanta dropping down to 40 once again Thursday morning, Nashville not really going to get back into the 40s until we get to Saturday morning. So, a couple more days those very cold lows.
 
The afternoon highs as we talked, yes, they're going to get warmer, but not really where they should be. Atlanta, Memphis, Dallas, all looking at those high temperatures, about ten to 15 degrees below where they normally would be this time of year, even Houston topping out at 74 degrees. That is a stark change from where they have been the last few days. I mean, much of Texas has been looking at record temperatures the last
 
 few days that is now done, we will no longer see the record highs anymore, but things are going to be a little bit little, a little bit below normal for a change. 
 
Now another thing, often to the east, also seeing that drop in temperatures, but the good news is by the time we get to this weekend, temperatures will finally start to rebound.
 <br>[05:25:07]
 
HUNT:  Al right. Allison Chinchar for us this morning -- Allison, thank you very much. 
 
Still going up here after the break, Democrats looking to deep red Texas to try to keep the Senate majority. Could Republican Ted Cruz's seat be in danger?
 
Plus, Donald Trump's version of what happened almost four years ago after the 2020 election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  And it was love and piece. And some people went to the Capitol. A lot of strange things happen there.
