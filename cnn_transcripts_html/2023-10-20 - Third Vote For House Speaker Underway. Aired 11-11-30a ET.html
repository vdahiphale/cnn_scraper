REP. KATHERINE CLARK (D-MA), MINORITY WHIP: For a speaker of integrity, intelligence and inclusion. 212 is our call for a speaker who will protect our children, our veterans, our planet. 212 is our call for a speaker who will grow the middle class, lower costs, create good paying jobs, and make health care affordable. 212 is our call for a speaker who will secure liberty, justice and opportunity for everyone.
 
Well, the unanimous call of 212 House Democrats has been answered by our nominee for speaker, the gentleman from Brooklyn, the leader of our House Democratic Caucus, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries.
 
Leader Jeffries has answered our call, but the majority's nominee is disconnected, disconnected from the American people and their values. MAGA extremism is designed to divide and it has broken the Republican Party. Their nominee's vision is a direct attack on the freedom and the rights of the American people. And he's got the record to prove it.
 
The Republican nominee has voted against health care for children, for veterans, even for 9/11 survivors. He has opposed lowering the cost of insulin repeatedly. He wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. Don't take it from me. It was raised on the other side of the aisle just this week as a selling point to make him speaker.
 
Over his 16 years in the House, the Republican nominee has never supported a Farm Bill. What does that mean? What does that mean? It means he has turned his back on farmers, on rural communities and the 11 million children who go to bed hungry in this country.
 
The Republican nominee wants a national abortion ban with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the health of a mother. We want to make our own health care decisions in consultation with our families, our doctors, our faith, not with Jim Jordan.
 
The Republican nominee plotted to overturn the 2020 election, traffics in misinformation and is a true threat to our democracy and our Constitution.
 
I have had the privilege of working here in the People's House for almost 10 years. And I've gotten to know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. And I know that you hear the same thing that I do. The American people expect us to work together on their behalf. It is not too late for the majority to choose a bipartisan path forward to reopen the House. Take yes for an answer.
 
Every day, every day, the majority chooses to engage in a Republican civil war that is threatening their own members, instead of engaging with us in the work of the American people is a day that weakens this institution and the standing of our country.
 <br>[11:05:24]
 
We need a speaker who will govern through consensus, not conflict. We need a speaker worthy of wielding that gavel, a leader who will defend democracy not degrade it. More than ever, we need proven patriotic people first leadership. And that is why I am proud to nominate Hakeem Jeffries as Speaker of the House.
 
CONGRESS: Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem, Hakeem.

DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR: We're listening to what is now familiar as we are on the third vote for Jim Jordan for speaker, an interesting moment. Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska who had never voted for Jordan, twice earlier voted for McCarthy, this time voted for Patrick McHenry, who is the temporary speaker.
 
And noteworthy that he is somebody who has been very, very bullied by supporters of Jim Jordan. His wife has gotten voicemails, texts from people who are threatening her if didn't switches vote. And he clearly is more dug in against Jim Jordan than ever. We're going to continue to watch and listen to these votes.
 
We should note that Bishop of Georgia the way that this works, Scott Jennings, is that it is a majority of North Carolina those who are present. We know that there are fewer House members present today than there were earlier votes. We believe it's 215 today. That is the magic number because the total number there is lower, but we won't be sure until this is over.
 
What we are going to be looking for no matter what the total is, is just specific members we know voted for Jordan before to see how many flip, how many more votes Jim Jordan loses.
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Right. Does somebody who's been voting for him go away? We also know, you mentioned there were fewer people, won of Jordan's votes, Van Orden, apparently is not there, apparently on a fact finding mission. [11:10:07]
 
BASH: Let's listen in. I want to say it's 214 we believe, 214. Let's listen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Brown?
 
REP. SHONTEL BROWN (D-OH): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Brownley?
 
REP. JULIA BROWNLEY (D-CA): Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Buchanan?
 
REP. VERN BUCHANAN (R-FL): Byron Donalds.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donalds. Buck?
 
REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): Tom Emmer.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Emmer. Bucshon?
 
REP. LARRY BUCSHON (R-IN): Jim Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Budzinski?
 
REP. NIKKI BUDZINSKI (D-IL): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Burchett? Burchett?
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: So that's three votes against Jim Jordan. As of right now he can lose five House Republicans total, given today's a number of House members that are present. And while we continue to watch the vote and look at those that we expect, will not vote for him, we can take a second.
 
And I have to say, John King, I'm still confused as to why we're going through this because it does not appear as though he has the votes. And other than this being an exercise in self-regard. And why would he do this to himself? Why would he do this to the country?
 
KING: It is a fantastic question. Why would he do this to his Republican Party, as we are 380 plus days away from the next election in which the Republicans, they will pick a presidential nominee, they will want to keep the House of Representatives, they will want to, you know, win back the Senate. And they will argue that they can lead.
 
At the moment they can't pick a leader. And to just see Kevin McCarthy who was just humiliated by his fellow Republicans nominate Jim Jordan and present him as a unifier and as a leader, when, forgive me, you know, even most of the Republicans know that has not been Jim Jordan's role in his 16 years in Congress.
 
Anyone can change but that has not been his role. That is not his history. This is -- what is this about? You raised the key question, what is it about?
 
TAPPER: Let me just pause you there because I want to hear what Congresswoman Chavez-DeRemer has to say.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Casten?
 
REP. SEAN CASTEN (D-IL): Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Castor of Florida?
 
REP. KATHY CASTOR (D-FL): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Castro of Texas?
 
REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Chavez-DeRemer?
 
REP. LORI CHAVEZ-DEREMER (R-OR): McHenry.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: McHenry.
 
TAPPER: All right. So that's the fourth vote against Congressman Jordan, this from Congresswoman Chavez-DeRemer. She has voted for Kevin McCarthy twice before. This time, she switched her vote to Patrick McHenry, who is the acting speaker. But again, it is a vote against -- one more vote against Jim Jordan and his hopes for the speakership go down in flames.\
 
But John King, you were just talking about how Kevin McCarthy, in his nominating speech was describing somebody who bore no resemblance to Jim Jordan whatsoever.
 
KING: And Kevin McCarthy's speakership, look, it's a difficult job. He has a tiny majority. It's a rest of the group of Republicans, many of whom don't want to govern. But so but, you know, so give Kevin McCarthy some grace, if you will, but his speakership was a failure. He was unable to get things done, unable to get them together, unable to tell them, look, we need to govern. We need to set aside the difference. We need to reach compromises.
 
He just nominated someone who has much less of a track record of achieving compromises as Kevin McCarthy did. The question here is, is now, you know, Kevin McCarthy failed, lost his speakership, what, almost three weeks ago now, two weeks plus. They've been unable to pick. Israel needs an aid package. Ukraine needs an aid package. The government is on the verge of shutting down.
 
Do Republicans want to govern or do they want to continue this, I don't know what it is, you know, circus is not the right word for it.
 
TAPPER: It's a demonstration. They're incapacity to govern.
 
KING: And so why, he's about to lose. He's short the votes again, the opposition is not melting. And so what is the point. If you cannot win, the logical thing to do is step aside and give somebody else a chance. So what will Jim Jordan do after this vote? There's talk about keeping him out of the weekend. He thinks he can wear them down. There is zero evidence of that. The math is right there on your screen.
 <br>[11:15:09]
 
GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: There was a clear effort this morning to kind of rebrand him, after all these years rebranding him into an effective legislator, and you heard the laughter coming from the assemble there on the floor of the House. But I think, you know, he's got a tougher job than McCarthy did.
 
McCarthy was fighting the rabble rousers on the right wing. He had sort of one group, he was focused on, the Matt Gaetz-led group. Jordan has a lot of -- he's playing whack-a-mole here with a lot of groups. He's got the centrists he's got to worry about. He's got the people who are angry. They've been bullied.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
BORGER: And the Scalise people.
 
TAPPER: Let's listen in because there are a couple of Ds coming up, Congressman D'Esposito and Congressman Diaz-Balart, not to mention Texas's Jake Ellzey. All three have voted against him in the past and I want it here. So let's listen in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. De La Cruz?
 
REP. MONICA DE LA CRUZ (R-TX): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. DeLauro?
 
REP. ROSA DELAURO (D-CT): Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. DelBene?
 
REP. SUZAN DELBENE (D-WA): Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Deluzio?
 
REP. CHRIS DELUZIO (D-PA): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. DeSaulnier?
 
REP. MARK DESAULNIER (D-CA): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. DesJarlais?
 
REP. SCOTT DESJARLAIS (R-TN): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. D'Esposito?
 
REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY): Lee Zeldin.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Zeldin.
 
TAPPER: That could be the magic number right there, five votes against. But let's keep listening.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Diaz-Balart.
 
REP. MARIO DIAZ-BALART (R-FL): Scalise.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scalise. Dingell?
 
REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Doggett?
 
REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Donalds?
 
REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Duarte?
 
REP. JOHN DUARTE (R-CA): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Duncan?
 
REP. JEFF DUNCAN (R-SC): Jim Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Dunn of Florida?
 
REP. NEAL DUNN (R-FL): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Edwards?
 
REP. CHUCK EDWARDS (R-NC): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Ellzey?
 
REP. JAKE ELLZEY (R-TX): Mike Garcia.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mike Garcia.
 
TAPPER: So, that is seven votes against Jim Jordan as of right now. And while the caveat always applies that people change their votes sometimes, you know, before the gavel comes down. And while that has not happened, in this round of speaker votes, it always could happen.
 
But as of right now, according to the vote count at the beginning of this process, Jim Jordan could only afford to lose five votes and now he has lost seven. So again, he will lose as of now, hold on because I want to hear what Drew Ferguson of Georgia has to do? Let's listen in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ferguson?
 
REP. DREW FERGUSON (R-GA): Scalise.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scalise.
 
TAPPER: On track to be a very similar vote, if not the exact same vote as yesterday. Gloria, I interrupted you before, please continue.
 
BORGER: You know, I was just saying that he's got a bunch of groups that he had to placate, and he clearly hasn't done it. You know, the people who were McCarthy fans who were Scalise fans and felt that he was treated badly, the people who've been threatened, the people who are more moderate that he expected it to be more squishy and given to him. And it's been such an uphill battle for him even worse than McCarthy who went 15 rounds.
 
TAPPER: I need to interrupt because we just -- he just lost a vote that he had gotten twice in a row and that is from Brian Fitzpatrick from outside Philly. I know Congressman Fitzpatrick a little bit. We would free eagles together. And he has -- he's from a Biden district, I believe. He's part of the Problem Solvers Caucus. He's a Moderate Republican, one of the few left. And he has been voting along the poverty line all along for McCarthy, for Scalise, for Jordan, and he just voted for Patrick McHenry.
 
And I should note, this is the third vote for Patrick McHenry. We've had two people who voted for McCarthy before, Bacon and I think DeRemer. And now we have Brian Fitzpatrick flipping from Jordan to McHenry.
 <br>[11:20:11]
 
KING: We go back to your conversation with Congressman Crenshaw earlier, they're clearly our members. He has been with Jordan loyally, because he says I'm a Republican. The conference said he's our nominee, so I'm going to vote. That's what Fitzpatrick has also said. You clearly now see members with Crenshaw said he would do it one more vote. He said he would vote for Jordan one more time.
 
TAPPER: Let's listen to Andrew Garbarino. Hold on one second.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Garbarino?
 
REP. ANDREW GARBARINO (R-NY): Zeldin.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Zeldin.
 
TAPPER: Zeldin, that 10 against. Sorry, John.
 
KING: They're trying to send a message we need to stop this. They're trying to send a message to Jim Jordan, you know, Fitzpatrick goes against him this time. Crenshaw said he'd go for it one more time. That's enough, enough. We've been loyal Republicans, the math is not there. We need to govern, especially for somebody like Fitzpatrick, I need to be able to go home and explain this to my constituents. Why we're on the verge of a government shutdown. And instead of dealing with it, we're doing this.
 
TAPPER: We got Gimenez of Florida coming up right now. Listen in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Gimenez?
 
REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): McCarthy. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: McCarthy.
 
TAPPER: Another McCarthy vote from Gimenez. He's a hell no for Jordan. That's 11 against as of right now.
 
BORGER: I think the Henry votes are important, because I think people are sort of saying --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Golden of Maine.
 
BORGER: -- solution here. Let's get out of this.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
JENNINGS: I think that Brian Fitzpatrick move is probably --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Goldman of New York.
 
JENNINGS: -- A, it's a new, it's a switch. B, as you noted, Jake, it's one of the Biden districts. We talked a lot about those 18 Republicans who currently sit in districts that Joe Biden won, only six of them initially.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
JENNINGS: A third had been opposed to Jordan, two thirds before him, the fact that that is growing is politically significant.
 
TAPPER: There we go, 12. So right now he is doing worse than he did last time because of the addition of Fitzpatrick. And by the way, there had been talk of some of these New York Republicans who had voted for Lee Zeldin to flip for Jordan if he had gone along with the salt tax credit. And there had been talking about maybe he would go along with letting these New Yorkers have this tax credit because they pay higher taxes in New York, et cetera, et cetera.
 
I don't know exactly what promises he made, but in any case, it didn't work. They still voted for Lee Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from New York. Here we got another, Kay Granger. Let's listen on her.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Granger? Scalise.
 
TAPPER: That's 13. Again, he's just doing worse, the numbers are not there. Now I recognize that Congressman Jordan is not somebody who necessarily respects election results. But this is just again, turning into an ignominious defeat. And I guess the question is, at one point, at what point does he look at the scoreboard and say, boy, this doesn't look good. You said, this is a signal. But, you know, a bunch of these holdouts, he met with them yesterday, and I was told by a number of them, they went into that meeting to say, it's over. We're never going to vote for you. He obviously -- and then what he did after that was called another vote. He's not hearing the message. He's oblivious to it.
 
KING: That's if -- that's the only logical explanation, or you just think I'm going to, you know, this is -- they all -- they keep coming to him and saying, this is embarrassing, Jim, we can't keep doing this. The American people are looking at this and saying, they can't govern, they can't even lead their own family. And what -- their logical answer to that is, if you want to say one more vote, give me one more try. OK, here it is. Let's see what Jim Jordan says after this vote. But if you keep doing it, then what's the point except ego and you don't care about the party?
 
BORGER: I just want to have one piece of reporting that we've had, which is different people have different agendas. Kevin, I'm told Kevin McCarthy's team has been helping Jim Jordan with his strategy. So this may be that Jim Jordan thinks he can bully people or make some promises. But I also am told that Kevin McCarthy's team has told him to keep going.
 
KING: McCarthy who just lost his speakership --
 
BORGER: But still has the sign.
 
KING: -- is giving advice to the guy who --
 
BORGER: But still as the sign above the door. But remember yesterday, Jordan seemed open at one point to the McHenry route and said let's have a vote on that also. And then he --
 
KING: Faced opposition from his right.
 
BORGER: And went into the conference. And the right said no, because that would be capitulating to Democrats. And we're not going to have any kind of coalition government, then they switched back.
 
KING: They also view McHenry as a pragmatic establishment Republican. And they don't trust him because guess what, he would like to govern and they don't want that.
 
BORGER: By the way, Patrick McHenry also is not an election denier. And the Democrats I spoke to last night were saying, the one thing we will not make a deal on is for someone who's an election denier.
 <br>[11:25:06]
 
KING: This, to that point, I don't want to overstate this but this is also a loss for Donald Trump. Jim Jordan has his complete and total endorsement in Washington. Trump's base is in the House Republican Conference. But, you know, and again, the people who are voting against many of the people voting against Jordan, were not Trump people to begin with. But Donald Trump is still the most dominant figure in the Republican Party, but he is simply less dominant than he was before.
 
BORGER: -- weighing in on this right now is he.
 
KING: Because he knows he's losing.
 
TAPPER: So let's listen in, because we have Congressman John James coming up. He voted -- he's voted against Jordan twice before. Not long after that, we have David Joyce of Ohio, Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, Jen Kiggans of Virginia. We have a few, a few Jordan skeptics coming up. And I want to listen in. And then of course Hakeem Jeffries gets to vote for himself which is always an interesting moment.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jackson of Illinois.
 
REP. JONATHAN JACKSON (D-IL): I'll go with Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Jackson of North Carolina?
 
REP. JEFF JACKSON (D-NC): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Jackson of Texas?
 
REP. RONNY JACKSON (R-TX): Jim Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Jackson Lee?
 
REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX): I'll go with Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Jacobs?
 
REP. SARA JACOBS (D-CA): Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. James?
 
REP. JOHN JAMES (R-MI): -- Byron Donalds.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donalds.
 
TAPPER: That's 14 against Jim Jordan, 14. Again, he's doing worse now than he done at this point.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Jeffries?
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries.
 
TAPPER: That's Hakeem Jeffries for Hakeem Jeffries, the reason for the applause.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Johnson of Georgia?
 
REP. HANK JOHNSON (D-GA): Hakeem Jefferies.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jefferies. Johnson of Louisiana?
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Jim Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Johnson of Ohio?
 
REP. BILL JOHNSON (R-OH): Jim Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Johnson of South Dakota?
 
REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Jordan?
 
REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Joyce of Ohio?
 
REP. DAVE JOYCE (R-OH): Jim Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Joyce of Pennsylvania?
 
REP. JOHN JOYCE (R-PA): Jim Jordan.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. Kamlager-Dove?
 
REP. SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE (D-CA): Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Kaptur?
 
REP. MARCY KAPTUR (D-OH): Hakeem Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Kean of New Jersey?
 
REP. THOMAS KEAN (R-NJ): Kevin McCarthy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: McCarthy.
 
TAPPER: Kean of New Jersey voted for McCarthy. That is another loss, Tom Kean of New Jersey, another Moderate Republican from a Biden district had voted for Jordan twice. And now he is gone. And that is 15 votes against. Now we have Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kelly of Pennsylvania?
 
REP. MIKE KELLY (R-PA): The honorable Steve Scalise.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scalise.
 
TAPPER: And that goes to Scalise, that's 16 against. We also want to hear what Jen Kiggans of Virginia does.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Khanna?
 
REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Jeffries.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeffries. Kiggans of Virginia?
 
REP. JEN KIGGANS (R-VA): McHenry.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: McHenry. Kildee?
 
TAPPER: So that is a net 17 against Jordan and as a throwback to Dana. I'm not sure if that is a net --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jordan. TAPPER: I think that's two new votes against Jordan. He's definitely doing worse than he did yesterday. And I also think it's three or four McHenry votes for the first time. Is it three or four?
 
BORGER: Four.
 
TAPPER: Four votes? Four McHenry votes. But, Dana Bash, those are the two trends I'm discerning right now are it's obviously not a landslide for McHenry but a trend of votes for McHenry from the skeptics and more votes against Jordan today, at least at this point, with the caveat that things could change.
 
So again, another bad day for Jim Jordan as he continues. His strategy of the beatings will continue until morale improves. Dana?
 <br>[11:30:01]
 
BASH: Yes. The trend away from Jordan and toward McHenry is clearly deliberate particularly by the two new.</pre>
