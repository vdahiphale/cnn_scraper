 <br>[14:32:18]
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: A new FAA report says Boeing factory workers felt pressured to put production speed over quality and did not get proper job training. 
 
The agency launched its investigation after that terrifying mid-air emergency when a door plug blew off in Alaska Airlines flight back in January. 
 
We have CNN aviation correspondent, Pete Muntean, here with us. 
 
And there's actually a Senate hearing going on right now. What are you learning? 
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a hearing essentially exposing some really big skeletons in the closet of Boeing that have been under wraps for months. 
 
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations just published, for the first time, the results of an FAA audit of Boeing, along with a company survey of workers at its plant in Renton, Washington. 
 
That is the same factory where a brand new 737 Max-9 was delivered without the critical door plug bolts installed, leading to that terrifying blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. 
 
The subcommittee says Boeing surveyed 2,100 workers on the 737 line and about half said that schedule pressure is still significant, essentially putting speed over quality, which is huge since it was a quality control failure that led to the door plug incident. 
 
One more big finding in the audit, workers said they felt inadequately trained by Boeing to do their jobs. Some said that Boeing was not providing them with the proper tools.
 
The FAA audit found one worker was using a tool he made himself to check the gaps between certain parts of the airplane. The report says the tool is "mechanic made, unauthorized, uncalibrated, unmarked."
 
And when asked how other door mechanics take this measurement, the mechanic stated, "They all do the same thing." 
 
And these findings were released as the subcommittee is about the grill FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker.
 
I want you to listen now to Senator Richard Blumenthal, who just said the FAA has not stayed on top of Boeing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): The findings about actual practices show that Boeing continues to prioritize the speed of production and profits over safety and quality. 
 
And the Department of Justice has taken action, which reflect the potential criminality of those practices. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MUNTEAN: Now, Boeing underscores, to me, that its taken -- Boeing underscores, to me, it has taking big steps do empower workers, but it's a bit of a journey. 
 
Remember, Boeing workers still on strike now in its 13th day. And interestingly, the FAA chief said yesterday in a different hearing on Capitol Hill that Boeing had a new safety plan to roll out to employees, but that rollout has been delayed by the strike that is ongoing right now -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: When you said that they weren't being given the proper tools, I thought you meant metaphorically until you described that, literally, they didn't have the properly calibrated tools.
 <br>[14:35:01]
 
Where were the internal controls on something like that? 
 
MUNTEAN: Well, the big thing here is the internal controls about parts. And this came up again over and over in this report out from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
 
But in some cases, parts that were rejected by Boeing quality control made their way from the production line and then ended up back on the production line, which led to a lot of confusion. 
 
This is something we've heard from whistleblowers about -- over and over again. They say that this is a really big issue. It came up again, it's certainly going to be coming up in this hearing and it's going to be a hot one. 
 
KEILAR: Taking something out of the trash, putting it --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: -- pretty much to the plain, ridiculous. 
 
All right. Thank you so much for the update. We appreciate it, Pete. Jim? 
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: All right, thanks, Brianna and Pete.
 
Now to some of the other headlines we are watching this hour.
 
Pope Francis says he is pained by the recent bombings in Lebanon, calling the violence there on acceptable.
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS (through translation): I'm saddened by the news coming from Lebanon where intense bombings have caused death and destruction in recent days. I hope the international community will make every effort to stop this terrible escalation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Israel has been bombarding Lebanon with heavy strikes this week as it takes aim at what it claims are Hezbollah targets. Lebanon says the strikes have killed hundreds, including many women and children, and left thousands wounded. 
 
Also, police in Arizona are investigating apparent bullet holes discovered at a Democratic Party campaign office in Tempe. No one was inside at the time and there are no injuries reported. 
 
Police said this was the second incident of what's described as criminal damage at the campaign office.
 
And a terrifying moment for rockstar, Tommy Lee, and his wife, a coyote. Look at that right there. Snatched the couple's dog from behind their Los Angeles home. 
 
Thankfully, Brittney Lee managed to rescue Nina. That's the dog. She says she had to yank the dog out of the coyote's mouth. Oh, my goodness. 
 
But the couple is now warning others about coyotes in the area. I bet. I hope the little pup's OK. 
 
And we're -- still ahead, we're hearing from embattled GOP Congressman Anthony D'Esposito. He's under fire for reportedly giving jobs to his lover and his fiancee's daughter. What he's telling our Manu Raju about possible ethics violations, coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:41:56]
 
ACOSTA: With just five days left until a government shutdown, Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to try and pass a short-term spending bill in the House today. And to push it through, he may be relying on some help from the Democrats. CNN's Manu Raju was up on Capitol Hill for us. 
 
So, Manu, how likely is a vote? And how much backlash will the speaker get for recruiting Democrats? That doesn't always go over so well with his conference, does it?
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, it really doesn't. There'll be a lot of Republicans unhappy about it.
 
But they've essentially decided that it's time to end the infighting for now. And instead take it to the campaign trail. In fact, they are planning to vote really in a matter of about an hour or so, vote and just end this work period.
 
And then go home. Actually, not come back until after the election. That the House took it six-week August recess, came back and figured it out they needed to pass something to keep the government open, decided to essentially kick the can down the road up until December 20th. 
 
This bill would keep the -- avoid a government shutdown by months end. But it does not have any of the spending cuts a lot of conservatives wanted, or this provision that Trump himself was demanding, demanding proof of people's citizenship before voting, trying to go after undocumented immigrants who could be participating in the elections. 
 
Of course, it's illegal for undocumented immigrants to vote in federal elections, but that's what Trump wanted this provision. They didn't have the votes. It was because of Republican and Democratic opposition. 
 
They had to drop that provision. Now, this measure that does not have anything that Republicans have wanted will now pass the House with Democratic support. 
 
But the backlash -- we will hear people carping about it, Jim, but they're not going to try to oust him the way they did Kevin McCarthy a year ago, over pretty much the same maneuver.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. They saw how that played out.
 
And, Manu, you also caught up with embattled Congressman Anthony D'Esposito, who is under scrutiny over reportedly hiring his lover and fiancee's daughter to work in his office. What did he have to say? 
 
RAJU: Yes, he has been under scrutiny over the last couple of days in the aftermath of that "New York Times" reported saying he did, in fact, hire those two individuals to work in his House office.
 
Potentially violating House ethics rules, which forbid especially people who are having sexual relationship with anybody they are employing. They're saying that's against House ethics rules. 
 
But I asked him about all of this. He did indicate that these women were hired. He suggested that to work in his office. But he said this is all consistent with what the House allows. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAJU: So you denied that yesterday. (INAUDIBLE). What didn't you tell yourself issue an outright denial? 
 
REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY): The fact is it's a hit piece. I made it very clear that I did not violate any ethics and that's it. 
 
There's -- that -- that's the story.
 
RAJU: (INAUDIBLE)
 
D'ESPOSITO: The point is, that there's no evidence that I have been violated it. Anybody down and there's absolutely (INAUDIBLE)
 
RAJU: Did you hire these two people to work for you? 
 
D'ESPOSITO: They did that he had relationships different plans either relationship.
 <br>[14:45:03]
 
RAJU: Did you check with the attorneys about this or how do you --
 
D'ESPOSITO: I'm - I'm very clear that there's zero ethics filings.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAJU: So one of the things here though, Jim, is that yesterday when I asked D'Esposito about whether he had he had hired his fiancee's daughter and his lover to work in his office, he said absolutely not. 
 
And then when I asked him are you, yesterday -- this is yesterday. I asked him, are you denying everything in that "New York Times" report? He said, quote, "I am."
 
But just as you heard moments ago, he did indicate that they were hired to work in his office. And he just simply said that they did not violate any ethics violations. 
 
So it sounded like a different answer than yesterday. And, Jim, yesterday when he denied it, he didn't initially do that right off the bat. In fact, initially, he didn't deny it at all, just criticize the "New York Times" reporting and all of this. 
 
But as you can see, the congressman is in a difficult -- a difficult spot as he faces his own tricky reelection in a district that Joe Biden carried in 2020. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes, that House majority on the line, and that could be one of the seats that, you know, decides that at the end of all this.
 
Manu Raju, great job being persistent there in the halls of Congress.
 
Brianna, we've seen Manu do it before. He's done it again.
 
KEILAR: Never want to be chased --
 
ACOSTA: Yes. 
 
KEILAR: -- by Manu Raju on the Hill. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes.
 
KEILAR: Well, her daughter's heartbreaking story became a national discussion. And now we're hearing from the mother of Amber Thurman. Amber is the Georgia woman who died when medical care was delayed after she experienced complications from a medication abortion.
 
Amber's mom, Shanetta Williams, describing the final moments that she spent with her daughter, who reportedly waited 20 hours for care at a Georgia hospital. 
 
Here's part of what she told our Laura Coates last night.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHANETTA WILLIAMS, MOTHER OF WOMAN WHO DIED AFTER 20-HOUR DELAY IN CARE: When I got there, she was repeatedly telling me how much pain she was in and I would reassure her that you're going to have that. You're here. They're going to help you. Don't worry. 
 
You're going to get the help that you need. We are in the best hands. You're at the hospital. And she kept telling me, no, ma, you don't understand. I am in pain. It is too much pain.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: President Kamala Harris came to Atlanta after reports of Amber's story to put the spotlight on reproductive rights ahead of Election Day. 
 
And we'll be right back after a quick break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:52:05]
 
KEILAR: All right, we are watching -- this is a live look here at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, hosting Vice President Kamala Harris. She is going to be speaking there in this key battleground state, which is so key, it may be the key for her when it comes to her path to 270 electoral votes.
 
She has been talking more about her economic plans. As polls show, voters are eager to learn details about her policies. And she is going to be speaking about the economy today there in Pennsylvania. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes, we'll be watching for that in just a few moments.
 
And we're back with a closer look at a key part of the electorate in battleground Georgia.
 
CNN's John King has been touring the country. He recently returned to the Peach State for his "ALL OVER THE MAP" series. 
 
He talked with voters of color there, a group that Joe Biden enjoyed strong support from in 2020, but that Kamala Harris must improve upon in order to win that state.
 
Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Ponce City Market, Atlanta's historic Old Fourth Ward, once an old Sears warehouse near the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 
LAKEYSHA HALLMON, GEORGIA VOTER: Everything started here.
 
KING: Now, a community anchor that includes village retail, a showcase for black entrepreneurs. Its motto a message.
 
HALLMON: "Support is a verb" tells people to do something that if you love something, there should be action behind it. "Support is a verb" has told people the way that they can be a part of change.
 
KING: Lakeysha Hallmon started the village in 2016 as a pop-up market. The retail shop opened in 2020, more proof Atlanta is a beacon of black economic and political power. 
 
And now a crucial test of whether Kamala Harris can build a coalition to keep Georgia blue.
 
HALLMON: We need to feel that things can change in our lifetime, that we are not always waiting on this fictional place where things get better in America. How about we start to do that now?
 
KING: Loyalty to President Biden runs deep in the black community, but the switch to Harris flipped the 2024 vibe here.
 
HALLMON: It doesn't feel so doomsday anymore. It actually feels hopeful and there's excitement.
 
KING: Four in 10 Georgia voters in 2020 were people of color and Biden won 80 percent of them en route to his razor-thin win here. 
 
Harris needs to match that, maybe more, beginning with giant black turnout.
 
HALLMON: "Support is a verb." It really takes us to do something. That means if it rains, get out and vote. That means if you have a car and your neighbor doesn't have a car, take them to the polls with you.
 
KING: Chanta Villano-Willis isn't sold, isn't sure the vice president is up to the top job.
 
CHANTA VILLANO-WILLIS, GEORGIA VOTER: I've been a Democrat my entire adult life. This has actually been the first year where I was considering voting Republican.
 
KING: Her mother isn't happy.
 
VILLANO-WILLIS: Never thought she'll see a black person, president in her life. She did. Now, Kamala Harris is for president. My mother says she don't care what she does, let's just get her in there. And I simply don't feel the same.
 <br>[14:55:09]
 
KING: Villano-Willis works a mix of gig jobs so she can care for her mother and her son with special needs. 
 
She likes when Donald Trump promises more oil drilling and to promote crypto currencies, but she sides with Harris on abortion rights and says Trump often talks down to blacks.
 
VILLANO-WILLIS: Oh and his favorite color is black. What a belief. I don't know. We don't have good choices, period. 
 
KING (on camera): Will you vote or are there circumstances where you might skip it?
 
VILLANO-WILLIS: I'm going to vote because that's my civic American duty. Too many people fought for me to vote.
 
KING (voice-over): Suresh Sharma worked at NASA and G.EE before starting his own business to support manufacturing start-ups.
 
SURESH SHARMA, GEORGIA VOTER: Strategically, the long-term economy is in a very good shape.
 
KING: Sharma lives in suburban Cobb County, calls himself a textbook Independent, has a three-step test to pick a president. 
 
Ability to govern is step one. Sharma says Harris is a blank slate and he calls Trump a failure because he didn't keep big promises like replacing Obamacare and shrinking the debt. 
 
Ability to manage large projects is test two. And Sharma says neither candidate has done that. He leans Harris because of test three.
 
SHARMA: Remember, president is a role model, therefore, morals matter. And what you see and what you do has a real-life implication. I can't tell my son that, hey, would you like to be president like him?
 
KING: Rebel Teahouse is in Decatur, part of DeKalb County in the critical Atlanta suburbs. 
 
The Harris literature here is proof of a big change. Owner Christine Nguyen was undecided and unhappy when we first met in April. She sat out 2020 because she had no interest in Biden or Trump and dreaded the idea of a rematch.
 
KING (on camera): Where are you now?
 
CHRISTINE NGUYEN, GEORGIA VOTER: Knowing the background that she came from, knowing the culture that she has to bring, as well as her values and beliefs, I'm proud to say that there is somebody who is able to, like, voice the things that we as a people have been shouting for like, the past four years.
 
KING (voice-over): Nguyen says the Harris small business plan meshes with her goal of opening a second location, and she lists reproductive rights and climate change as top issues.
 
NGUYEN: We deserve more than the two candidates that were there before who didn't understand us.
 
KING: Debates about whether Trump or Harris are better for business are common and close to home.
 
NGUYEN: That comes up very often. I hear a lot, like even in my family of entrepreneurs, it comes up every now and done, right? That Trump just knows business better. 
 
But I think, at the end of the day, it is what you value and like, what your beliefs are in terms of your ethics.
 
KING: Four years after sitting out, Nguyen is excited to vote early, plus she is hosting a voter registration event at the Teahouse just before the Georgia deadline.
 
NGUYEN: My fingers are crossed and I will make sure to do my best to get my whole community to the polls.
 
KING: Excited for the big event, well aware of the numbers, and organization are critical.
 
John King, CNN, Decatur, Georgia.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ACOSTA: All right. Mandatory evacuations and a state of emergency in parts of Florida as Helene quickly intensifies, could become a major hurricane.
 
Another hour of CNN NEWS CENTRAL begins after this short break.
