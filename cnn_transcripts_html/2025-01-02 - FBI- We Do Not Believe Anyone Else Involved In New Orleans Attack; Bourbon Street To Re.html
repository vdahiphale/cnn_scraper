THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[13:30:00] 
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: And get speeds over, my understanding is, 40 miles per hour unimpeded? Because we -- we can't -- we shouldn't pretend like we can't protect ourselves. We certainly can minimize the harm. 
 
And I think one of the things that we should expect from the Las Vegas police is instead of them telling us, well, he could have gone down the street and killed a bunch of people, or we didn't think he'd go on the sidewalk. 
 
The -- it's sort of treating us like -- like were children. We understand you can't make the risk zero. We understand the pressures on police departments.
 
But knowing what they knew, was the positioning of the safety and security on New Years Eve adequate? Did they believe it was adequate? And was it inadequate by 3:00 a.m.? Clearly, yes. And what happened? 
 
And I think that's -- I think that those are fair questions. I don't think we should feel defensive about it, because every city is going to have to learn from this. 
 
This is a horror for New Orleans, but it is a, you know, teaching moment, learning moment for every other city that is going to face events like this. 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Yes, of course, he would go on a sidewalk. We have seen what people inspired by ISIS will do. That is the least of what has been done. 
 
Malcolm, Juliette, thank you so much to both of you. Really, really appreciate your insights. 
 
KAYYEM: Thank you.
 
KEILAR: And still ahead, the New Orleans mayor saying that Bourbon Street will be open for business just hours from now. You're kind of seeing some of the preamble to that. These are live pictures from the scene of where that attacker drove from Canal Street onto Bourbon. 
 
We have CNN's Ryan Young, who just spoke with the city's chief of police -- police about the reopening. We'll have that in just a moment. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:35:44]
 
KEILAR: Bourbon Street is about to reopen. 
 
CNN's senior national correspondent, Ryan Young, is there in New Orleans at the corner of Bourbon and Canal Street. 
 
And, Ryan, just last hour, I know you got the opportunity to speak with the superintendent of police there. What did she tell you? 
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, honestly, she is still trying to process all of this. And even behind me right now, you can see the surge of officers that they've brought into this area. We have also have Homeland Security. 
 
I'm going to step out of the way so you can see this. They've brought to bear a lot of extra officers. And she told me the plan is to have so many officers up and down Bourbon Street, you will feel safe as you walk up and down it. 
 
But she also wants to talk about those two officers who took gunfire, who actually directed their fire toward that suspect as he was running his car down the street. 
 
Take a listen to this chief, who, at the same time, is proud of her officers, is still torn up about what happened here. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOUNG: Chief, you do believe that the officers who were involved in this really saved more lives? 
 
ANNE KIRKPATRICK, CHIEF, NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT: Oh, absolutely. It's not a belief, as I know it to be. 
 
If you look down Bourbon Street here, this perpetrator, this terrorist, went three blocks. That's where our officers engaged him in gunfire. And it was an exchange of gunfire. 
 
And so if that had not occurred by our officers, who we're absolutely heroic, it could have been six blocks. It could have been nine blocks. It could have been all the way down the stretch. 
 
It is because of New Orleans police officers, who literally engaged this terrorist in a gun battle, that more lives, I know, were spared and saved. It's not a takeaway at all from those who lost life.
 
But our officers, were the ones who stopped this terrorist. I'm so proud of them. They are truly men and women of courage. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOUNG: Brianna, we also want to show you video from what they did, a second line down the street. And they did sort of a memorial. 
 
The mayor and the superintendent walked down the street with people from the clergy community in this city, as we show you this video, and they took 14 yellow roses and placed it at different spots because they wanted to make sure that before they open this street, they show a lot of reverence to the victims here. 
 
And on top of all that, I want to show you the barrier they now put in place. There's a barrier that's been erected and, not only do they do that, they block the sidewalk. 
 
But listen to the chief talk about that barrier that's now there to make sure no trucks or cars go down this road. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KIRKPATRICK: So what we're doing right now is we're hardening the target. And that's the term we use, meaning that we are going to make it where any penetration would be almost next to impossible to get here. So that's what you're seeing here. 
 
We're bringing in heavier equipment. And we are also putting what are called archers on the sidewalk, if you can see that. And that will give protection for anyone who would, again, try to access via the sidewalk. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOUNG: So what we know for a fact is the NFL's top security person was also here. They've gone over the plan for the Super Bowl as well. 
 
We know this roadway is going to open up in a short time. But what we're told is the new barriers will also be put in place sometime soon. But when you look down the road here, you can see they've already made a significant change. 
 
And again, hundreds of officers will be surged into this area over the next few hour -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: All right. Seems like it is upon us there. 
 
Ryan Young, thank you for that. 
 
With us now, we have New Orleans city council member, Eugene Green, who represents the area just next door to where the attack happened. 
 
Councilman, thanks for being with us. We know that your city is going through so much. 
 
We heard from the mayor that Bourbon Street here is reopening shortly ahead of the super -- the Sugar Bowl kicking off in just a few hours. Can you tell us a little bit about security measures? Any concerns or assurances that you can give? 
 
EUGENE J. GREEN, NEW ORLEANS CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: Brianna, thank you for this opportunity. And to the nation, I want you to know that New Orleans is standing strong and we're standing strong for our nation. 
 <br>[13:40:04]
 
I want to express my condolences to the family members of those who -- who were deceased as a result of this horrific act, and also to express to those who are injured, we wish for your full and complete and rapid recovery. 
 
I do want to let you know that the city of New Orleans is very, very focused on security. We've learned from this incident. 
 
Of course, it's important to recognize that someone who is hell bent on killing fellow human beings and including himself, it's difficult to track what he's going to do.
 
In this particular instance, it's important to recognize that the person who turned onto Bourbon Street, where he saw people having fun, was going to find a way to kill people. That was his intent. 
 
We, as a city, are responding in a way that addresses any security lapses. As you've seen in your previous video, we're taking security very seriously.
 
But I want everyone to know, especially the nation to know that this is the city that recently hosted a 100,000 person Taylor Swift series of concerts, the Bayou Classic football game. 
 
We've hosted 10 Super Bowls before. We host the Sugar Bowl every year. We host a tremendous Jazz Festival and Essence Festival. We are a place that people can come and be safe. And our events have been safe. 
 
This was an outlier, a lone wolf. The problem with this is we're never going to exactly know what was on his mind to make him drive from another city, take on an Airbnb, if you will, or a short-term rental, make bombs and then go and run over innocent people at 3:15 in the morning. 
 
Well never totally know. But what we know is that there's a lot to learn from this. But that we, as a city, are confident and we are feeling very safe in terms of our future. 
 
We're going to do everything that we can to keep our residents and our visitors safe. 
 
KEILAR: The big headline that came out of this most recent press conference was the FBI now believes Jabbar was, indeed, a lone wolf. That was the initial expectation. 
 
And then when the FBI said, yesterday, they didn't believe he was solely responsible, that was huge news, because that is typical and incredibly alarming. 
 
How have law enforcement been sharing too much information and not combing through it adequately enough before getting it out there? 
 
GREEN: I think that because there were uncertainties and there were videos showing people near IEDs, for example, that law enforcement wanted us to know that there was a possibility that there were multiple parties. 
 
It was better to assume that there were multiple parties other than to come to -- for them to come to a conclusion that someone was a lone wolf. 
 
In this particular instance, we have been getting information, obviously, in the midst of the fact that we recognize that you can only share but so much information. 
 
But I think that the FBI has done a thorough investigation, but they've also worked with local and state police and also law enforcement. But also citizens have been calling in tips, which helped the FBI to get to the conclusion that they got to. 
 
We will never understand someone's mind --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
GREEN: -- who created a --
 
KEILAR: No. 
 
GREEN: -- situation like this.
 
KEILAR: Certainly. But these IEDs that we're detonated that we're separate from the truck that Jabbar was driving, are you -- from what you we're hearing from law enforcement are they definitely -- were they definitely IEDs? 
 
Is it possible they were mistaken for IEDs? Are they things that Jabbar placed there? I mean, what -- what -- what can you say about them at this point? 
 
GREEN: There are still facts that have to be determined. And I don't have the answer as to what was inside the -- the boxes, for example. If the FBI or the local police conducted an explosion as a matter of precaution.
 
I wish that I had that information now, I think that information will come out soon.
 
But I want to let you know that, since then, there has been a sweep of the French Quarter that's been so thorough that you can be assured that there are no devices there that are IEDs, that are going to be a harm to our visitors or our residents. 
 
But I think more information will come out in the near future relative to the reasons for conducting the detonations that they did. 
 
KEILAR: OK. All right. We will look forward to that. 
 
Council Member Green, thank you so much for being -- 
 
(CROSSTALK) GREEN: I do -- I do want --
 
KEILAR: I'm sorry. Go on. 
 
GREEN: I do want to thank -- I do want to thank CNN for your coverage, because you've helped share with the nation at a time of sorrow some facts that are very important to help us to get to the conclusion that we, as a nation, are concerned about this. We're concerned about those who are injured and those who are deceased. 
 
I want to let you know that the city of New Orleans is focused on safety, that our elected officials, along with our community, are working that you can come to the city of New Orleans knowing that everything that's necessary is going to be done to keep our residents and our visitors safer. 
 
KEILAR: Well, sir, thank you so much. And thank you for your time. We appreciate it, Council Member Green. 
 
GREEN: You are welcome. 
 <br>[13:44:57]
 
KEILAR: Federal officials are also investigating this, That Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas. We'll have the latest on that investigation and what law enforcement have uncovered so far, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: The FBI and ATF are now conducting law enforcement activity at a home in Colorado Springs in relation to the explosion that happened at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. 
 
There's surveillance video -- you see it here -- capturing the very moment of the blast right outside the doors of the hotel lobby. 
 
Police say the driver detonated a combination of fireworks, gas tanks and camping fuel. The FBI is still working to figure out if this was a terrorist attack. 
 
CNN national correspondent, Natasha Chen, is with us live now. 
 
Natasha, we're now learning the name of the man who rented the truck. What can you tell us? 
 <br>[13:49:58]
 
NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Brianna. Law enforcement sources have told CNN that the man believed to have rented this Tesla Cybertruck was Matthew Livelsberger. And a statement released by the Army today acknowledged that Livelsberger had died. 
 
Earlier, we had reported that the person who rented the truck was a Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces group. The Army did not specifically say that Livelsberger died in the Vegas explosion. But the Army special -- he was an Army Special Forces Operations sergeant holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, according to four U.S. officials. 
 
And again, we had previously reported that these officials said he was active duty, serving in Germany and on leave at the time that this explosion happened yesterday morning. 
 
I did speak with a couple of guests who were staying in the hotel across the street from us when the explosion happened. They said they were higher up above the 40th floor, and they felt the windows shaking and heard that explosion noise. 
 
They said that shortly after 9:00 a.m., they saw smoke billowing from the stairwells and the elevator doors. Elevator service was shut down for a while, and they had to stay up there. So very terrifying moment for a lot of people who were around the area. 
 
And again, as a reminder, the driver of the truck did die on scene here, and there were seven others with injuries. 
 
And right now, investigators are still working on the motive behind this and any possible connections to other incidents -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: All right. Natasha Chen, live for us there in Las Vegas, thank you. 
 
The organizers of the Sugar Bowl will have more than football on their minds today. Far more. So we'll talk about how security is ramped up ahead of this major sporting event. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:55:58]
 
KEILAR: Right now, the New Orleans Police Department says that hundreds of officers are lining the streets as fans are making their way to the Superdome. You see these pictures here. It is ready for the Sugar Bowl, postponed by one day now. 
 
And with us now is CNN sports anchor, Andy Scholes. 
 
Andy, the game set to kick off just a couple hours from now. Tell us about security and what fans should expect. 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Well, Brianna, Sugar Bowl officials told us earlier today that security is enhanced all around the Superdome. Fans should plan to get there early to get through those extra layers of security. 
 
And as you can see, there is already thousands of fans outside the Superdome that are there early. 
 
Kickoff is at 4:00 p.m. Eastern from the Superdome. 
 
Now, many of those Georgia and Notre Dame fans, as you can see, they're out and about enjoying the day. 
 
And we've heard from some of those fans who say they feel perfectly safe moving around the city. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Families of the victims that weren't involved. You know, we want to make sure that, you know, they're taken care of. And I think New Orleans has done a great job securing the city. 
 
But at the same time, we want to let terrorism disrupt what we're doing in terms of like, public safety. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had no concerns. Um, you know, I figured it's probably the safest place to be right now anywhere around here. Plus, you don't want to let the terrorists win. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: Now, with the game postponed yesterday, Georgia's football team, they did hold a walkthrough at the Superdome last night. 
 
Notre Dame's team, they held meetings at their hotel. And Fighting Irish head coach, Marcus Freeman, he spoke with ESPN about what he told his team after the terror attack. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARCUS FREEMAN, NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL HEAD COACH: You know, in the toughest moments, the culture of -- of any program of a nation is revealed. And I have a lot of faith this country will rally around New Orleans and support all the victims and families that were affected. 
 
We also have to understand this -- there's a game to play. And there's an opportunity that both programs have to play in the college football quarterfinals. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: And, Brianna, a spokesperson for the Sugar Bowl says that they will be holding a moment of silence to pay tribute to all those people who are affected by the terror attack. 
 
KEILAR: All right. We'll be looking for that. 
 
Andy, thank you for the latest there. 
 
And ahead on CNN NEWS CENTRAL, we'll have more on what we're learning about the Bourbon Street attack, as federal investigators are looking into the suspect's background. Well talk about what we found out. 
 
Stay with CNN.
