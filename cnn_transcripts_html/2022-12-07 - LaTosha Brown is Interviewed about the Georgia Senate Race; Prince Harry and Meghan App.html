KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Make history. In the new Congress he is going to be taking on the highest ranking job ever held by a Latino in congressional leadership. He's going to serve in the number three position in Democratic House leadership. He talked to me about the importance of this moment of generational change for Democrats, but also what it means for him.

REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): My dad used to sneak out of his house at the age of 10, 11, he lived on Route 66 in San Bernardino, and he would sneak out and shine shoes outside of the bars and taverns. And to think that, you know, he teaches me how to shine my shoes and now these shoes walk the halls of Congress, it's just so impactful for our community, for my family, for me. 
 
COLLINS: And how are you preparing to deal with a GOP majority that is vowing to be very aggressive? 
 
AGUILAR: We're going to be prepared to have the back of the administration, to make sure, again, that we're fighting for -- to highlight the successes that we have had these two years and make sure we don't unwind that important success. 
 
But we understand what it means, the power of the speakership, and that this Republican speaker could seek to unwind those successes, as well as provide oversight over the Biden administration, and some of that is likely going to be unfair. Our job is to make sure we're standing up for the Constitution. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: An interesting few months ahead for those new Democratic leaders. And our thanks to Congressman Pete Aguilar for his time. 
 
Don and Poppy.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: That was a great interview. 
 
Again, Kaitlan, thank you. We'll get back to you really soon. 
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: We'll see Kaitlan a little bit later on.
 
President Biden helped Democrats avert a midterm disaster. Does the party now have no choice but to support him for re-election? 
 
HARLOW: And a major case being argued today at the Supreme Court. A case that could determine the future of voting in this country. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:36:09]
 
HARLOW: Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING. Here is what we have coming up for you. 
 
The Senate runoff race in Georgia decided with Democrats winning the night in a very close contest. Does Biden now have the backing of his party for a 2024 run as he keeps winning? 
 
Also, Prince Harry and Meghan stepping out last night in New York ahead of their highly anticipated Netflix documentary. That drops tomorrow. 
 
And a very high stakes election case before the Supreme Court today. Why it could determine the way our elections are decided. 
 
LEMON: Well, Poppy, Georgia voters handing Democrats what's soon to be a 51-seat majority in the U.S. Senate by re-electing Senator Raphael Warnock amid another major win. Are Democrats, the question is, now forced to back President Biden in 2024. 
 
Joining me now from Atlanta is LaTosha Brown, a grassroots organizer, co-founder of Black Voters Matter.
 
 Thank you so much. I'm - it's so good to see you.
 
I am in awe of this woman, I'm just going to let you know. The work that you do, living on -- in buses and RVS and getting so many people out really, really doing the work that many people talk about, she actually does it. 
 
So, hello to you. 
 
And let's start with - and thank you for joining us early in the morning. 
 
Let's start with what happened in Georgia. Does Warnock owe this win to black voters, LaTosha? 
 
LATOSHA BROWN, CO-FOUNDER, BLACK VOTES MATTER: Yes. Let me tell you what Warnock did. What he was able to do is build this broad-based coalition. He had AAPI (ph) voters, he had labor union workers, he had progressive whites, independents. He was able to pull this broad-based coalition. 
 
But there is, without a doubt, that his base vote were black voter. That black voters came out in record numbers throughout the metro area, but also in rural areas throughout the state of Georgia. And I think that is what pulled it over for him. So, black voters absolutely showed up and showed out on this particular election. 
 
LEMON: OK, but let's talk about black women, though. 
 
BROWN: Black women did what we do. You know, I think it's really interesting, because I think in this election, what we saw, we saw a narrative that was saying, not just black men, that black men would not come out. And what we saw is that black men also came out and supported Warnock in record numbers. Black women and men were actually on the ground, leading these efforts, that it was grassroot organizations. I can't tell you how many organizations, from fraternities, to sororities, to churches, to civic engagement groups. It was a beautiful sight on the field (ph).
 
What we saw, this was clearly a collective effort, and we saw black people literally step up and stand up and do a lot of the organizing. And black women absolutely won the vanguard and on the front of that. 
 
LEMON: So, let's talk about that. I mean, listen, this was in November, I think, in November the numbers were about 90 percent of African Americans in Georgia who supported Raphael Warnock. I would imagine it would be similar last night. 
 
I heard, again, this is not a CNN poll, but - and - but this is what I've heard, that that -- this is a poll from November, 90 percent. All right, 8 percent for Walker. But I heard -- I understand even last night, or yesterday, it was fewer African Americans voting for Herschel Walker. 
 
Many have said that Herschel Walker, his candidacy was an insult to black voters because he is just simply unqualified and someone was picked just because they were black and a star in Georgia and every - and - and they thought that people would just get out and vote for him just because he's black. 
 
BROWN: Absolutely. Don, I think there were three things that made the difference in the election, particularly to black voters. One is, I think, that black voters were actually upset, and they were petrified that here it is, this candidate, that they plucked out of Texas, that the Republicans thought so little of Republican - that Democrat of black voters that they thought they could pick up and pluck a candidate, put -- who had ran a ball, who was a football player, that in some way they could prop him up and black voters were going to fall from that. 
 
You know, I think the other thing is, he was so disconnected that even just recently, a few days ago at a rally, he referred to himself - he talked about how he was called a coon, and that a coon was the smartest animal. 
 <br>[06:40:01]
 
That's such a racist, derogatory term that has been used - that had been used in the south to black people. As a matter of fact, if you go back in - into to the '60s and Dr. King oftentimes that racists who were running - who were in position would actually call him Dr. Martin Luther coon, oh, I mean, Dr. King. 
 
So, here's a man that was so out of touch with our community, that was so disrespectful of the plight of black people that he actually would refer to - to himself in a racist, derogatory term and embrace that. 
 
The second thing is that black voters did not forget SB-202, which was a voter suppression law. That we did not forget that what happened, that we were actually targeted right after the last Senate election and that there were laws that were created through this SB-202 law that would make it harder for us to vote. Case in point, that we - the last election we had nine weeks to vote. That was truncated to only four weeks of early voting this election. We also had the secretary of state, the Republican secretary of state, the constitutional officer that is supposed to actually lead the -- and govern the elections, that is actually supposed to get people engaged and informed to make sure we have a strong democracy, actually sue so that we would not have a Saturday voting day because of a confederate holiday, Robert E. Lee's birthday. What black voters wanted to send is a resounding message that, no, we're not going back, that we are -- we were offended, that we were strong, and that we were going to - we were going to make a difference in this election. And I think that's what we see. This is the results of that.
 
LEMON: I just - I have to ask you, because we said that we would ask you this question regarding the president, Joe Biden. And, listen, he's not polling very well, but still he's getting a lot accomplished, his agenda. People are looking to this election saying, Joe Biden is winning and so there may not be a choice for Democrats come 2024. Is there a connection there? Do you agree with that sentiment? 
 
BROWN: You know, I do. I think that, at the end of the day, I think part of -- and black voters (INAUDIBLE) has been very clear about this, that oftentimes there's a paradigm that elections are about the candidates and the political parties. I think what you see happen in Georgia is that while those are factors, this is an election that is about the people. And I think that what we're going to see is that just like with the polls were wrong, and many of us said it, that there was not going to be a red wave, that literally there was a blue wall that was rising up, I think you're going to see the same thing. That people are not stupid. We're tired - tired of seeing folks that actually are taking for granted our vote and that we're organizing ourselves we're going to say, what happened in Georgia was not a fluke, it was the future. 
 
LEMON: Listen, here's what, LaTosha Brown, they do. They get people out to vote. They don't tell them how to vote. They educate them on the issues. Black Voters Matter and also Fair Fight, as well and a number of other groups, the same thing. The reason I say that I have respect for her is because she actually walks the walk. 
 
How long - how long did you live on a bus traveling throughout the south registering voters? 
 
BROWN: Technically we're still living on the bus, right?
 
LEMON: Yes. BROWN: We're still having a runoff election in Louisiana. 
 
LEMON: From 2020? 
 
BROWN: But -- yes. No. But, seriously, we have been going all across this state. We are committed. We're committed - in -- in our state, we have the lowest minimum wage in the country. Our minimum wage is $5.15 an hour. We have 1.5 million people who are without health care. We have real policy needs and desires in the state. And as long as literally we have those needs, we're going to do the work. We do the work at Black Voters Matter 365 days out of the year. Why? Because our people matter, because our communities matter. 
 
LEMON: Thank you for being a patriot, thank you for what you do, and thank you for appearing. LaTosha, be well.
 
BROWN: Thank you for having me. 
 
LEMON: Poppy.
 
HARLOW: All right, so, coming up, the documentary series "Harry and Meghan" is about to drop tonight on Netflix. We are live in London with what has the royal family concerned. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:47:43]
 
LEMON: So, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan, honored at a charity event in New York City last night. It comes as the British royal family braces for their Netflix documentary series set to premiere tomorrow. The series, "Harry and Meghan," gives an inside look at the royal rift that led the duke and duchess of Sussex to step back from their official roles.
 
CNN anchor and royal correspondent, Mr. Max Foster, joins us now live. 
 
Max, I was actually at that event. It was - they were mobbed, swarmed by people last night. There was a Ripple of Hope Awards event that they were at. They received an award.
 
So, tell us more about the royal red carpet. 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you know - well, it was a blue carpet, wasn't it, I think. This was the -
 
LEMON: Yes, it was a blue carpet.
 
FOSTER: This was a theme. You were seen on it, of course, Don. But this -- other honorees were President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, for example. So, this was high-level stuff.
 
And the couple were called incredibly brave for addressing racial injustice. So, Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation, said she was very proud to be honoring the couple for their heroic stance against the structural racism of the monarchy. So very much endorsing the message the couple have had about their experience within the monarchy, and saying they've stood up, they've talked about racial justice and they've talked about mental illness in a way that was incredibly brave. 
 
So, this is something, obviously, a narrative that the couple was supporting here. They were having some chitchat on stage. They said they didn't get out much. This was normally their date night, but they were spending it at this event because they saw it was very important. But this was, I think, Don, don't you agree, a real endorsement of their message over the years. 
 
LEMON: Yes. Yes, and they thanked all of us in the crowd for coming out for their date night, being a part of their date night.
 
But I've got to ask you, as you mentioned, I was on the blue carpet. I got a lot of questions about this Netflix series and if I was going to be watching and what I thought was in it and what have you. So, I think there's a concern from the royal family about what might be revealed in this doc, right? 
 
FOSTER: Well, I think there would be naturally because they haven't seen it and, according to the trailers, it's going to be pretty controversial. And you saw, you know, the prince and princess of Wales appearing in it. There's some searing music behind quite a cold-faced look from Kate, for example. So, I think there is concern. 
 
You've got to consider as well, Don, that this is a different monarchy now. The queen, Queen Elizabeth, didn't want to get into a public row with Prince Harry, for example, after the Oprah Winfrey interview. 
 <br>[06:50:04]
 
And she wasn't a target for Prince Harry either. 
 
We'll have to see if Charles and William are targeted and whether they choose to respond this time. It's a different case. We'll wait and see. 
 
LEMON: Good to see you, Max. Thank you very much. 
 
Poppy.
 
HARLOW: All right, well, this morning, the Supreme Court is going to hear arguments in a case that could completely change the way U.S. elections are decided. We're talking about a potentially profound repercussion for American democracy. The case is called Moore versus Harper, and it asks whether state legislatures should have absolute power over elections. On its face, this is a case about gerrymandering. And if you're falling back to sleep because of that word, don't, stick with me here, OK, because it is bigger than that. It is about who runs elections, and who sets election laws. And, even bigger than that, it could be about the cornerstone of democracy, like you remember from civics class, checks and balances. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, "SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK" (singing): Each controls the other you see, and that's what we call checks and balances.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: You remember that? How did we get here, though, right, to have this case before the high court? It's because of a legislative map drawn by North Carolina Republicans that their own state supreme court struck down calling it illegally partisan gerrymandering. But now those same legislatures are asking the Supreme Court to reverse their lower court decision and adopt an very obscure, legal theory. It is a theory pushed by some familiar names in the Trump orbit, like attorney John Eastman, a key architect of the push to overturn the 2020 election, and it is called the Independent State Legislature Doctrine. 
 
It's a clunky name, but it goes like this. Under the elections clause of the U.S. Constitution, something Trump's been talking a lot about this week, quote, the times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof. 
 
Proponents of this partisan state legislature theory should be able to then set rules in federal elections with no check, no check from state constitutions, no check from state courts, no check from state commissions. No balances. 
 
And it isn't just the maps. This could be about all rules in federal elections. 
 
But it is some of the top Republican lawyers and judges in the country who are ringing alarm bells. Ben Ginsberg, you've seen him on this network a lot, for many decades the go-to election law expert for national Republicans, he is warning that if this theory were adopted, it would, quote, increase the odds that state legislature replace the popular vote with their own political preferences. 
 
Another legal luminary in conservative circles, retired federal judge Michael Luttig, who testified before the January 6th hearings, is co- counsel on this case before the court today, arguing against the doctrine. Here's what he told "The New Yorker." This is, quote, without question the most significant case in the history of our nation for American democracy. He says, Don, it is the whole ball game. 
 
LEMON: Poppy, that was amazing. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
 
HARLOW: You got it.
 
LEMON: Take a look at what's next. 
 
(VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: So, that was Morocco booting the mighty Spaniards straight out of the World Cup. We're going to have sports this morning next. We're going to talk about who got the most goals. 
 
HARLOW: (INAUDIBLE). You're going longer than (INAUDIBLE).
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:56:49]
 
HARLOW: Rain on tap for the Northeast. A flood threat in the works for Tennessee and the Mississippi River Valley. And even more snow expected out west. 
 
Let's go to meteorologist Chad Myers. 
 
A mixed bag for the day, huh? 
 
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Absolutely, Poppy. I mean umbrellas across the south and the east, snow shovels in the west. And the biggest coat you can find in your closet in Minot, it is 17 degrees below zero right now. 
 
This weather is sponsored by Safelite, your vehicle glass and recalibration experts. 
 
So, yes, the rain does move across the deep south. A lot of it here. But I'll tell you what, there's a major drought going on here. We talk about the one in the west, but there is a big drought here. That's why the Mississippi River is so low as well. The Ohio River doesn't have a lot of water in it. We'll take the rain where we can get it. It moves away for the weekend and actually turns out pretty decent. 
 
This is the rain we're talking about, two to four inches across parts of Tennessee, Arkansas, even into parts of north Georgia. 
 
Poppy.
 
HARLOW: Minot, North Dakota, get your parka on. 
 
MYERS: Biggest. Yes. Snow -- we used to call them snow snowmobile suits. 
 
HARLOW: Oh, yes.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: I'm going to take you snowmobiling one day, Mr. Louisiana. 
 
LEMON: OK. I'll be looking forward to that. I'm still -- I can't believe, 17 below. Not my jam right there. 
 
Let's go to sports now this morning. 
 
The World Cup is down to just eight nations remaining. 
 
CNN's Andy Scholes joins us now. 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.
 
LEMON: Andy, Portugal benched arguably the best player of all time and still won in a blowout.
 
SCHOLES: Yes.
 
LEMON: What up with that?
 
SCHOLES: They did, Don. You know, Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the best, most popular players ever, he's got 509 million Instagram followers. You know, to bench him in the World Cup would take incredible, you know, you know what from Portugal's manager, but Fernando Santos making that decision after Ronaldo showed his displeasure when he was removed from that final group stage game. Starting for Ronaldo against Switzerland, Goncalo Ramos. And the 21-year-old had only played 33 international minutes in his career before yesterday. But he scored a hat trick as Portugal just ran away with this one, winning 6-1. 
 
And Ronaldo did come into this game as a sub in the 72nd minute. 
 
Now, Morocco, meanwhile, pulling off one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. They beat number seven ranked Spain 3-0 in a penalty shootout. And this is an historic milestone for Morocco. They're the first Arab country to ever reach the quarter finals. 
 
But the win was not without some controversy. Morocco's players unfurled a Palestinian flag during their celebration. Now, FIFA regulations prohibit the display of banners, flags and flyers that are deemed to be political, offensive and or discriminatory in nature. In the past, football's governing body has issued fines for displays of the Palestinian flags inside stadiums. 
 
Now, for the first time in more than two weeks, got no World Cup games for you to watch today. There is a break until Friday when the quarter finals began. 
 
So, guys, kind of sad. You know, Don, we've had - we've had games to watch morning and afternoons for more than two weeks now, but have to take a little break, I guess. 
 
LEMON: Yes, but, you know, you're covering it well. You've got it all under control there, Andy Scholes. Thank you very much. 
 
SCHOLES: (INAUDIBLE).
 
LEMON: We're back in a moment.
