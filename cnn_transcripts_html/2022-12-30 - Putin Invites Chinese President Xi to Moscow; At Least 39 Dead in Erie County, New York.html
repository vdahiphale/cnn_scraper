THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Two of their seven drones that were headed toward the capital, two of them were shot down before they even reached the outskirts of the city. The other five were shot down over the city.
 
But there is intensifying combat in the eastern part of the country. Ukrainian officials acknowledging in the city of Bakhmut, which has been the scene of some of the most intense fighting of this war, both sides, both Ukrainian and Russian sides are taking heavy casualties as this battle has raged on for weeks, actually months.
 
And also along the entire eastern front, it appears that the Russians have been using a lot of their heavy firepower. In the southern part of the country, in the Kherson area, we've seen another intensification of Russian bombardment on that area recently liberated from Russian forces. Jessica?
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN ANCHOR:  And, Ben, I'd like to circle back to that potential Xi visit to Moscow. What kind of impact might that have on the war in Ukraine and is that getting any sort of attenston there on the ground?
 
WEDEMAN:  Well, people are watching very closely given that China and sort of the Russian/Chinese partnership, the Chinese are definitely the stronger partner. But at the same time, the Chinese have been hesitant to back Putin militarily.
 
China is one of the biggest arms manufactures on Earth. But to-date, to the best of knowledge of intelligence agencies, the Chinese have not provided the Russians with much in the way of hardware or ammunition. In fact, the Russians have had to turn to countries like Iran and North Korea for the supplies they need.
 
The Chinese, even though rhetorically they support the Russians and seem to accept the Russian excuses or rationale for this war, they do not want to be the object of western sanctions. So, in theory, it is a partnership that provides benefits to the Russians, but on the ground here in Ukraine, it hasn't really made much of a difference. Jessica?
 
DEAN:  Ben Wedeman live for us in Ukraine, thanks so much for that reporting. Still to come this morning, a man went into hero mode when he and several others were trapped outside during the deadly winter storm in Western New York. What he did that police say saved lives, that is next.

DEAN:  Just into CNN, a potential development in the murders of four college students in Idaho.
 
CNN's Veronica Miracle is in Moscow, Idaho. What are you learning, Veronica?
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Well, Jessica, I just got off the phone with police a few moments ago, and they tell me there is going to be a press conference today at 1:00 Pacific Time at city hall to announce developments in this case.
 
We are expecting major developments to be announced today as this is the first time in weeks that police have held a press conference in the murders of these four students. This comes nearly seven weeks after this happened when four University of Idaho students were murdered, the coroner said, in their sleep, Madison Mogen, Kayle Goncalves, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle.
 
During this time, of course, the families, the community has been reeling, even one family, the Goncalves family, who has been very outspoken about the fact that there have been very little developments in this case and police the entire time have been consistent in saying, stick with us, there are strong leads in this case, we're not releasing information to protect the integrity of this investigation, and they've been steadfast with only really announcing very few details.
 
But today, we understand there is going to be a press conference. The nature of that press conference, rather, and exactly what is going to be revealed, police are not saying. They're just saying that they are going to be sharing some developments today and we expect major developments to come out. Jessica?
 
DEAN:  Okay, Veronica, and an important context that we haven't had a press conference from them in a while. So, it will be interesting to see what they update us with later this afternoon.
 
Veronica Miracle in Idaho, thanks so much for that update.
 
Also this morning, officials in Erie County, New York, saying at least 39 people died in that catastrophic blizzard and that the number could still continue to rise. We're also learning about some heroic acts that saved dozens of lives.
 
CNN National Correspondent Athena Jones joining me now live from Buffalo, New York. And, Athena, you're outside of the school that became a refuge, essentially, a refuge during the storm. Tell us how and what happened.
 
ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Jessica. Well, this is finally a good story we can tell you about a very brave and industrious and inventive mechanic named Jay Withey.
 <br>[10:40:04]
 
He got a call on Friday night from a friend who was stuck somewhere out in the storm and so he went out to try to find him. But he himself ran into trouble along the way, eventually got stuck. He ended up picking up another young man he didn't who was not dressed not well for a storm, wearing a light jacket. Later that evening, while sitting in his car figuring out what to do, another elderly woman came and knocked on his window, so she joined the group in his vehicle.
 
At one point, this mechanic went to, he says, ten different houses begging for people to let him in, saying he's afraid ever dying. He offered $500 to be allowed into someone's house to sleep on the floor. All of them turned him away saying I'm sorry, but I can't let you in. And so they returned to his car, they spent the rest of the night taking turns napping.
 
By the morning, one of them had to use the restroom and so he looked on his GPS and he found the school that you see right behind me, Edge Academy. We're here in a suburb of Buffalo. So, he went to the school and he knew it would have heat and bathrooms. So, he used some old brake pads, he broke a window on the side of the school. We went around there and saw where the sunglasses is on the ground and he managed to get in. And so the two -- his two guests were able to enter the school.
 
And then later he found that right outside in this area, there were several cars with older people just stranded in their cars. And so he went and brought them into the school. He later broke into the cafeteria and got cereal for the folks to eat, and so everyone was safe inside.
 
And he said in a letter, at the end, they stayed, they got into the school by Saturday morning, they stayed there until Sunday evening, so the evening of Christmas Day. He, at one point, got a snow blower from the school, managed to start it without the key because he's a mechanic, went outside and blew off the snow around the cars of all of the elderly people that he'd found by then. This is about ten people.
 
Here is what he said in a note he left at the school. To whomever it may concern, I'm terribly sorry about breaking into the school window and for breaking in the kitchen. Got stuck at 8:00 P.M. Friday and slept in truck with two strangers just trying not to die. There were seven elderly people also stuck and out of fuel. I had to do it to save everyone and get them shelter and food and a bathroom. He signed a letter, Merry Christmas, Jay. Jessica?
 
DEAN:  Just incredible and so nice, like you said, to have a nice story, a good positive story coming out of Buffalo as they continue to dig out of the storm. Athena Jones, thanks so much.
 
And we'll be right back.
