THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[19:00:00]
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: The two candidates hitting the campaign trail hard hoping to find an edge. This election will likely come down to these swing states you see in yellow on the map. That's where both Harris and Trump will be laser-focused in the final days. 
 
Let's check in with Danny Freeman on the Trump campaign trail. 
 
And Danny, Trump just wrapped up a town hall there in Pennsylvania. He was also in Pennsylvania last night. How has his swing through that state been? 
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jessica, frankly tonight we saw a more disciplined former president Trump than perhaps we have seen him over the course of the weekend here in Pennsylvania. They were far fewer tangents tonight. He mostly stayed on topic. It was actually even a shorter event than we were accustomed to seeing from the former president. 
 
It seemed like the former ESPN anchor who moderated the event, plus the campaign selected voters who asked him questions really were able to keep him on track for the majority of the evening. He emphasized his proposals on the economy, talking about no taxes on tips and overtime. He talked about supporting fracking, but mostly he railed against the Biden administration on the subject of immigration. 
 
Now, make no mistake, there were several exaggerations when it comes to the economy, immigration and crime, and some of his normal asides including bragging about his polling, airing grievances against ABC News for their past debate performance. But there were none of the vulgarities that we saw for example last night in Latrobe or any anecdotes like we heard about Arnold Palmer again last night in Pennsylvania as well. 
 
I will say, though, Trump did continue to boost his surrogate Elon Musk, the billionaire tech giant, who has been stumping for the former president all weekend long, including offering a million dollar raffle to supporters who signed a petition which some legal experts say might not be legal. Take a listen to how he described Kamala Harris and also Elon Musk in the same breath almost. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This woman is so incompetent, she is so bad, you cannot -- and I would normally not like this speak like that. If they get chosen, our country is finished. You know, Elon Musk is a very smart guy. You got to see his endorsement. He said, if this election isn't won by Donald Trump, our country is essentially finished. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN: Now, Jessica, earlier Sunday Trump perhaps made his most memorable stop of the campaign trail. He went to a McDonald's in Bucks County. That's that purple county in the suburbs of Philadelphia. He made fries in the fryer. He also did a photo-op serving customers at the drive-thru. 
 
Later tonight then, Jessica, he's expected to head to Pittsburgh to root or to cheer on, I should say, the Pittsburgh Steelers who are playing this evening on Sunday Night Football -- Jessica. 
 
DEAN: All right. Danny Freeman for us in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state. We're going to have -- everyone is going to spend a lot more time in Pennsylvania in the coming days and weeks. 
 
Danny, thank you so much. 
 
Kamala Harris spent her day in Georgia at a church in suburban Atlanta. Supporters singing to the vice president as she marked her 60th birthday. 
 
Harris urging Georgians to cast their ballots as soon as she can. She also sit down for a conversation with MSNBC's Al Sharpton where she explained why she feels Donald Trump is not fit to lead the country. 
 
Eva McKend has more. 
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: In that interview with Al Sharpton here in Georgia, Vice President Harris said that when the former president talks about her, insults her, that he is demeaning the Office of the Presidency and that he lacks the basic standard to return to the White House. 
 
And it is an argument that we have seen the vice president employ increasingly over the last several days. It seems catered to a very specific type of voter, a voter that may not necessarily agree with her on every policy issue but may be in alignment with her on this broader argument that the former president is unhinged and unfit. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, we, representing the United States of America, walk into rooms around the world with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about the importance of democracy, rule of law, and have been thought of as a role model. Imperfect, though, we may be, but a role model of what it means to be committed to certain standards including international rules and norms, but also standards of decorum. 
 
And what you see in my opponent, a former president of the United States, really is it demeans the office. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND: And another big component of the vice president's Georgia swing was reaching black voters in these Souls to the Polls event aimed at galvanizing black voters. Essentially they come to church, get fired up, and then vote immediately after attending the service, something that they can do here in Georgia as early voting is underway. And this comes as Democrats are routinely accused of taking black voters, the base of the party, for granted. 
 <br>[19:05:00]
 
The campaign, though, maintaining that that is not so. They very much perceive black voters as persuadable voters and doing all that they can to motivate this key part of the Democratic coalition -- Jess. 
 
DEAN: All right. Eva McKend for us there in Georgia. 
 
And let's talk more about all of this with Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She's also a former head of the Democratic National Committee. 
 
Congresswoman, good evening. 
 
REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): Thanks. Hi, Jessica. Good to be with you. 
 
DEAN: Yes, thanks for being here. As we just laid out, this race is historically close. Harris is trying to close the deal. How does she do that? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, with the joy continuing like you heard today with Georgia voters celebrating her birthday and carrying her on their shoulders. I mean, we've got record turnout, early voter turnout going on in Georgia right now. Early voting starts tomorrow in Florida, and we expect a very enthusiastic motivated group of voters to start coming to the polls tomorrow and they're already voting by mail here. 
 
The way that the vice president is going to make sure that we can elect her to the White House is by contrasting as she has the stability and the progress that we've been able to make particularly around our economy and focusing on middle-class issues like she has, making sure that she talks about how we can make housing more affordable. Focusing on making students -- going to college more affordable. 
 
And Donald Trump at his rallies, in his interviews, is talking about Arnold Palmer's genitalia, falling asleep in the middle of one of his events, and avoiding interviews and debates. He's so exhausted apparently he's canceling events, you know, several days in the future. So the contrast could not be more clear, neither could the joy. 
 
DEAN: And you're a former chairwoman, as we mentioned, at the Democratic National Committee. Would you be doing anything differently at this point? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: You know, we're really focused as we should be on GOTV, getting out the vote right now. I know here in Florida, you know, for the last few days and weeks, I've been focused on doing -- launching canvas kickoffs. We have phone banks going on all across our state. That's happening in the battleground states across the country as well. We're making sure that we have shifted from persuasion now to getting the vote out of our supporters who've been identified, and, you know, continuing to make sure that we draw that contrast. 
 
But it is all GOTV all the time now, voters are voting and we've got to make sure that people know what's at stake in this election. We have, you know, an extreme MAGA agenda that Project 2025 which Donald Trump has been doubling down on. We have extreme abortion bans in Georgia, here in Florida, in states across the country. And Donald Trump is continuing to talk about how proud he is that he ripped women's reproductive freedom away by appointing a Supreme Court that overturned Roe versus Wade. 
 
That's not the direction that Americans want to continue to take this country. And I think that's why they're going to turn out in droves as you can already see they are in Arizona and in Georgia, states across the country. But it is close so we can't take anything for granted. 
 
DEAN: Yes. It is, it is historically close as we've said. I want to talk about Florida for a second because there is an abortion measure on the ballot in your home state. That is certainly an issue that has galvanized Democratic voters, independent voters and women. It is interesting though that despite that issue being on the ballot, that if that election was held actually today, Vice President Harris would have a very hard time winning Florida. It would be a surprise if in two weeks she wins Florida. Why do you think that is? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We've seen a lot of polls that show the race very close, within the margin of error. You know, there are a couple of polls, could be outliers, who knows? But the election is going to come down to who is going to get their voters to the polls. In Florida, we are a historically purple state. I mean, 2022 was really an anomaly and we do have amendment for, the Reproductive Freedom Amendment on the ballot, and that is going to pass and it's going to pass the past with 60 percent of the vote, Jessica, so we're going to see Republicans, Democrats, and independents going to the polls voting for that amendment to restore reproductive freedom that Republicans under Ron DeSantis robbed us of after 35 years of it being in our Constitution and Donald Trump, you know, allowing for the most extreme abortion ban here in Florida. 
 
And then they go into vote a reproductive freedom ticket here in our state. That's how it's going to happen. And we also have a recreational marijuana amendment on the ballot as well, where it is likely that many voters who don't want to see an extremist MAGA agenda implemented go to the polls and vote that kind of ballot as well -- vote a Democratic ballot as well. 
 <br>[19:10:11]
 
DEAN: I also want to ask you about this phrase that the former president has been using. He's been talking about the enemy within. Last week he said he may use the military to deal with the enemy from within. This is what he said Wednesday during a town hall on FOX News. I just want to play a clip. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: It is the enemy from within and they're very dangerous. We have China, we have Russia, we have all these countries. If you have a smart president they could all be handled. The more difficult or, you know, the Pelosis, these people, they're so sick and they're so evil. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: So he singled out Nancy Pelosi. Today he singled out Adam Schiff as the enemy within. Pelosi's husband has been the victim of political violence. How concerned are you about the risk for political violence in the wake of this election? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: The person who is to serve and sick is clearly Donald Trump. I mean to have a candidate for president who is a former presidents himself, who, you know, called on his supporters to commit insurrection and trying to overturn the results of a legitimate election in 2020, now he is calling out enemies of the state essentially that are elected officials and politicians with whom he disagrees. He also said that he was going to right when he became president seek revenge against his enemies. 
 
This is the United States of America and we have a democracy and the rule of law. This is a man who has been convicted of 34 felonies and it's hard for me to believe, it's breathtaking actually that this race is close. But I think Americans when they go to the polls are going to overwhelmingly realize and see that we need to make sure that we have stability and security and the ability to have confidence in who is leading our country. 
 
Not just so that we can have stability across the globe, but so that we can make sure that we can continue to move our economy forward, and not having an extremist like Donald Trump whose priorities are clearly out of whack and who speaks in a very dangerous and dark way that could upend everything we hold dear in terms of our democracy forever. 
 
DEAN: All right. Congresswoman Debbie Wassermann Schultz, thank you so much. We appreciate your time. 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thanks for having me, Jessica. 
 
DEAN: Still ahead, Israel launches new strikes in Lebanon tonight targeting Hezbollah's financial institutions. It's as the Israeli military presses ahead on another front in Gaza. How they continue to target Hamas as the U.N. warns, quote, "the nightmare is intensifying." And what we're learning about the investigation into where a U.S. intelligence leak came from. 
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:17:42]
 
DEAN: Tonight, new video coming in to CNN as Israel launches another round of airstrikes on Lebanon. 
 
This video geolocated by CNN captures the moment an Israeli airstrike hits a building near Beirut's international airport, and you can see that building collapses. Airstrikes also hitting parts of the city's southern suburbs. The IDF issued evacuation orders saying it was targeting Hezbollah's financial network. 
 
Israel is also right now stepping up its military operation in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing that the war will continue after the killing of Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar this week. 
 
And CNN's Matthew Chance has the latest now from Tel Aviv. But first, we want to warn you some of the images you are about to see are graphic. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) Israeli forces patrolling the labyrinth of narrow streets in the central Gaza Strip. These latest images from the Israeli military what they say is their continued activity amid the devastation to dismantle Hamas. 
 
To the south in Rafah where the Hamas leader was recently killed, drone footage of strikes what Israel says are more Hamas fighters and infrastructure. While across Gaza, civilians are paying a heavy price. At this hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip, an influx of casualties from a new Israeli strike at Beit Lahia where Palestinian health officials say dozens of people including women and children were killed. 
 
Among the shrouded bodies of her family, this woman calls her father to grieve their loves. 
 
I swear, Dad, nobody is left, she sobs. 
 
Israel says the casualty figures are exaggerated and that they operate against Hamas in a precise and targeted manner. But eyewitnesses at the scene say the Israeli airstrikes felt like an earthquake. 
 
It was just Wednesday when an Israeli drone captured the final moments of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's life. His killing fueling hopes of a hostage release, even a ceasefire in Gaza and beyond. [19:20:11]
 
In fact, the region seems to be plunging further into chaos with the Israel stepping up strikes and pressing deeper into neighboring Lebanon, hitting what it says are strongholds of Iranian-backed Hezbollah like here at the town of Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon. 
 
Back in Israel, Hezbollah rockets have been striking the country's north. One drone even hitting near the Israeli prime minister's private house in the coastal town of Caesarea. He called it an assassination attempt by agents of Iran, vowing to press ahead with military action. Iran denies involvement and Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility. 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: We're going to win this war. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: So what's happened deter you? 
 
NETANYAHU: No. 
 
CHANCE: Amid fears of an even wider escalating war, all sides seemed bent on pressing ahead. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHANCE (on-camera): Well, tonight the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for areas of Beirut, the Lebanese capital. Now, Lebanese media say airstrikes have again hit the city's southern suburbs. 
 
Amid growing concerns that Israel is poised to strike Iran as well, the conflict seems to be escalating by the hour. 
 
Back to you, Jessica. 
 
DEAN: Matthew Chance in Tel Aviv, thank you very much. 
 
Lawmakers are expected to get a classified briefing following the leak of highly classified U.S. intelligence. Sources telling CNN the leaked documents show Israel's plan for retaliation against Iran over the recent missile attack. 
 
CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz is joining us now. 
 
Arlette, any update on where this investigation stands? 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jessica, the U.S. continues to investigate how exactly these highly classified intelligence documents were leaked. There are major questions about who might have had access to those documents and ultimately leaked them, and also whether there might be any other sensitive information that is out there. Now House Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed this investigation earlier today. He said he anticipated receiving a briefing on the matter and said that overall the leak is very concerning. Now these two documents first came to light into public view on Friday
 
 after they were posted on Telegram. The documents include markings, it showed it is top secret, but also that it was meant for the viewing of only the U.S. and the Five Eyes allies. That includes countries like the United Kingdom and Canada. 
 
Now, without getting into the specifics of these documents, they essentially show the U.S. descriptions and assessments of satellite imagery that was taking a look at Israeli Air Force exercises that include using air-to-surface missiles as well as the movement of Israeli military equipment including munitions. 
 
Now the fact that Israel might be preparing for a response against Iran is no surprise. But it is surprising that these highly classified documents were leaked out into the public. It does come at a very sensitive time when the U.S. is working with Israel trying to offer counsel on the next steps that they should take as they are preparing to retaliate for Iran's barrage of missile attacks that the country had launched towards Israel back earlier this month. 
 
Now President Biden has said, he does have an idea of how and when they will be responding. But one thing that this leak does show is that the U.S., even as they are in deep conversations with Israel, they are also taking other steps to assess and analyze on their own the plans that Israel is planning to take against Iran at this very complex moment in the Middle East. 
 
DEAN: All right, Arlette Saenz at the White House for us tonight. Thank you for that reporting, Arlette. 
 
Still ahead, how fans around the world are honoring the late One Direction star Liam Payne. 
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:28:51]
 
DEAN: Around the world today One Direction fans gathering to pay tribute to Liam Payne as questions remain about the circumstances around the singer's sudden death at a hotel in Buenos Aires this week. 
 
CNN's Camila Bernal has the latest now, and Camila, the investigation is underway. 
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is, Jessica, and we were told that even though the father was there since Friday in Buenos Aires, they will not release the body to the family until they complete clinical tests. And a source telling CNN that those tests are expected to be done at some point next week, this coming week, but it really could happen at any point now. 
 
That source also telling CNN the father was able to see the body at the morgue, but he was not allowed inside of the room where his son was staying at. So what they did is they allowed him to go into the hotel, into another room, another floor, similar to where his son had been staying there in Argentina. And while he was there, the father also greeting a lot of the fans that have been gathered outside of that hotel in Argentina and thanking them for their support. 
 
You mentioned fans in Indonesia and we just saw that. There's many fans all over the world gathering in London, in Japan, here in the U.S., in a number of places, just people coming together as you saw earlier, to sing together, to bring photos, to bring letters, candles, balloons, so many things, and so many fans expressing just how special One Direction has been for them as they've been growing up with this band.
 <br>[19:30:23]
 
You've seen an outpouring of support in person, but also on social media. So many people also expressing their grief on many social media platforms, including his sister, who said she was in disbelief, who said he was her best friend and expressing her love for him.
 
Now, I also want to point out that another member of One Direction, Zayn Malik, he postponed his US part of the tour that is happening right now and he thanked the fans for understanding. Again, this is just been very difficult for people that knew him and for his fans -- Jessica.
 
DEAN: Surely has.
 
Camila Bernal, thank you so much.
 
We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:35:48]
 
DEAN: This just in: "60 Minutes" is responding to recent claim from former President Trump, who accused the program of deceitfully editing a recent interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.
 
That interview aired two weeks ago on October 7th, and it all comes weeks after Trump pulled out of his own scheduled interview with "60 Minutes."
 
This is where we bring in CNN's Brian Stelter to the conversation.
 
Brian, just first, what do you make of this statement from "60 Minutes"?
 
BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA ANALYST: This is very unusual and we should explain why it's a big deal in the first place. It's a big deal because Donald Trump has made it a very big deal. He has made this "60 Minutes" story a part of his campaign message. He has brought this up repeatedly at rallies and in interviews and the message that Trump has delivered his audience the following.
 
He is saying to his fans, this is the biggest scandal in broadcast history. CBS should have its licenses taken away by the government. "60 Minutes" should be forced off the air, and it should be investigated for this behavior.
 
That is the message from Trump. And let's get to -- what is he really saying to his fans. He's saying they're all out to get us, they're all out to get you even the big news outlets. Okay, so that's the message from Donald Trump. That's why this response from CBS is important.
 
CBS saying in a statement tonight: "Trump is accusing '60 Minutes' of deceitful editing of our October 7th interview with Harris, but that is false. "60 Minutes" gave an excerpt of our interview to 'Face the Nation.' They used a longer section of her answer than the one that was on '60 Minutes.' It was the same question, same answer, but a different portion of the response."
 
"60 Minutes" goes on to say: "When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, a movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on '60 Minutes' was more succinct, which allowed time for more subjects in a wide-ranging segment."
 
Then CBS reminds everybody that Trump pulled out of his interview with "60 Minutes" while Kamala Harris did participate. And then CBS concludes: "Our long-standing invitation to Trump remains open if he would like to discuss the issues facing the nation and the Harris interview, we'd be happy to have him on '60 Minutes.'"
 
So, CBS really trying to clear things up here, trying to correct the record after two weeks of controversy. Media critics, like yours truly, had said that this seems like a screw up by CBS to run one part of Harris' answer on one show and a different part of her answer on a different show. But it seemed like an innocent mistake by two different shows and that's exactly what CBS is saying tonight.
 
Donald Trump is trying to portray this as a conspiracy, as a scandal by news producers who are out to get him. We know that for him, bullying the media tends to work. But in this case, CBS isn't taking it. They are standing up to him and saying, he's wrong -- Jessica.
 
DEAN: Brian, how often is it that media organizations like or even a specific show within a media organization in this case, take this sort of step?
 
STELTER: This is very rare for a network to try to come out and correct the record and it's happening because frankly, Trump won't let this go. He's been bringing this up again as recently as today and not just complaining about it, he's making threats.
 
He has threatened virtually every major media company in the United States in the past few months. But when it comes to broadcast networks, he threatens their licenses. Local stations have to have licenses to broadcast on the public airwaves. Normally, that's no big deal. Media policy is not usually a part of a presidential campaign.
 
But Trump has threatened to CBS and NBC and ABC. He also complains a lot about Fox, but earlier today, in an interview on Fox, I noticed there were some clear edits to the interview. Of course, Trump didn't complain about that because Fox, he views as his home team. But once again today on Fox, he complained about CBS.
 
So I think "60 Minutes" tonight is trying to clear up the very muddy waters, whether any Trump fans get the message though it remains to be seen.
 
DEAN: Sure and look, this is what we see time and time again. It's just -- it is just putting enough questions and cracks into something that frankly is commonplace when you do a long interview with someone, you can't air the whole thing, you have to. It's edited and that's pretty common, but it's putting enough cracks into something that is, I guess, considered the establishment to make people really feel like it's a conspiracy.
 <br>[19:40:06]
 
STELTER: That's the real context here. It's the playbook that worked really well for Donald Trump in 2016. It's a playbook that did not work quite as well for him in 2020, but he always goes back to that same idea, grievance and resentment against the people he portrays as elite.
 
In this case, CBS trying to squash that tonight, we'll see if it works.
 
DEAN: All right, Brian Stelter, thank you, as always. We appreciate it.
 
STELTER: Thanks.
 
DEAN: Still ahead, a new way of treating cancer. How a new immunotherapy is increasing some patients' chances of survival.
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:45:17]
 
DEAN: Tonight, Israeli airstrike hitting three branches of a Hezbollah linked financial institution in Beirut. That is, according to Lebanon state-run national news agency. The Israeli military earlier saying it was planning to carry out targeted strikes on Hezbollah's financial network, issuing evacuation warnings for parts of Beirut as a result.
 
It's just the latest in a series of back-and-forth strikes over the Israel-Lebanon border. The IDF saying tonight about 200 projectiles were fired by a Hezbollah into Israel today.
 
Robert Roberson, the Texas man whose execution was halted late Thursday and a last-minute intervention by the Texas Supreme Court is expected to appear in front of the State House tomorrow. As of now, the Texas attorney general has ordered he testify via Zoom, but attorneys for Roberson want him to testify in person. His fate remains uncertain. He was convicted of murdering his daughter in 2002 in a case that relied on shaken baby syndrome. But his attorneys and a bipartisan group of law makers argue new evidence shows his daughter died from different causes that did not involve abuse.
 
Encouraging news for people living with Hodgkin lymphoma, a new treatment shows great promise and improving survival rates according to a study in a New England Journal of Medicine.
 
CNN's Jacqueline Howard has more details on this.
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: This is a new clinical trial where nearly 1,000 patients with stage three or stage four Hodgkin lymphoma. They were divided into two groups. One group was treated with the immunotherapy approach. They were given the immunotherapy drug nivolumab plus three standard chemotherapies.
 
The other group was given an antibody drug plus those same chemotherapies. The researchers found that after two years, 92 percent of the patients in the immunotherapy group did not relapse, did not see the cancer progress, and they did not die from the disease.
 
That's compared with, in the other group at 83 percent of patients experienced those same outcomes. Here's how the lead researcher, Dr. Jonathan Friedberg describes these results.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. JONATHAN FRIEDBERG: DIRECTOR, WILMOT CANCER INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER: We're curing substantially more patients with this regimen and in addition, the regimen was less toxic than the previous regimen.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOWARD: So this suggests that nivolumab, when it's paired with chemotherapy can become a standard treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. It's a drug that's already FDA approved for some other cancer types and we're hearing that some doctors already use it off label for their Hodgkin lymphoma patients.
 
And here the United States, it's estimated that more than 8,000 people may be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma this year. And sadly, about 900 people could die from the disease this year.
 
So, having more treatment options is so important, especially options with fewer side effects. And this is a cancer type that we know disproportionately affects younger patients.
 
So again, there could be thousands of patients out there who could potentially benefit from this immunotherapy approach.
 
Back to you.
 
DEAN: Encouraging news there, Jacqueline Howard, thank you. Game five of the WNBA Finals is about to tip off in a winner-takes-all matchup between the Minnesota Lynx and the New York Liberty. The Lynx chasing their fifth WNBA title after narrowly hanging in on game four and now, the Liberty have a shot in their first championship right at home in Brooklyn.
 
Still ahead tonight, how the upcoming election could have a massive impact on American foreign policy. Fareed Zakaria joins us live next. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:53:27]
 
DEAN: The upcoming election could have a massive impact on American Foreign Policy and the world. Will the US maintain its decades old alliances with other countries, or will it turn inward?
 
Next on CNN, Fareed Zakaria explores this consequential question and the history that brings us to this moment. And his latest CNN special, "America First" here's a preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST "FAREED ZAKARIA GPS" (voice over): After piloting the first solo nonstop flight across the Atlantic --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): The greatest stunt of all.
 
ZAKARIA (voice over): Charles Lindbergh was an international sensation.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): The most idolized man in the world.
 
ZAKARIA (voice over): For "Time" Magazine's first ever Man of the Year in 1928, he was the natural choice. He parleyed his fame into politics, becoming the spokesman for the largest anti-war organization in US history, The America First Committee. It included people from all walks of life from the architect Frank Lloyd Wright to Walt Disney.
 
JOHN MEACHAM, AUTHOR "FRANKLIN AND WINSTON": America First was the embodiment, the manifestation of this isolationist sentiment and it was hugely important and popular.
 
ZAKARIA (voice over): It was 1941 and World War II was raging. The Nazis had taken over most of Europe, but Americans wanted desperately to stay out of the war, 93 percent of them, according to one poll.
 <br>[19:55:11]
 
The America First Committee grew to 800,000 members and Charles Lindbergh was its champion.
 
CHARLES LINDBERGH, AMERICAN AVIATOR AND MILITARY OFFICER: We cannot win this war for England that is why the America First Committee has been formed.
 
ZAKARIA (voice over): His biggest opponent, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who knew that if Germany took over Europe, America could be next.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: Fareed Zakaria joins us now.
 
Fareed, history teaches us so much. This is history that many Americans don't know how strongly Charles Lindbergh advocated isolationism as World War II was dawning.
 
Walk us through why it is so relevant again? How it is so relevant again, as Donald Trump strongly criticizes US support for Ukraine?
 
ZAKARIA: You know, it's well beyond Ukraine.
 
Really for 75 years, ever since 1945, Americans have not had a debate on whether we should be engaged with world. It's been about what particular policy, you know, what specific area, but never the issue of should we have alliances with countries in Europe? Should we be providing foreign aid to the world's poorest countries?
 
Those fundamental questions we kind of answered in 1945 and we said to build a more peaceful, more stable world, we are going to jump in and were going to stay involved as the leading country in the world. We tried it the other way and that led to two world wars.
 
A lot of what Trump says, what JD Vance says, and a lot of where the Republican Party is going, is just -- ask for a kind of fundamental rethink of that seventy-five-year-old consensus, so I think it was really important to remind people what the history was and it's an absolutely fascinating history that I found myself surprised by when I was researching it.
 
DEAN: What surprised you?
 
ZAKARIA: There is a wonderful story in there of what made the Republican Party finally internationalists in the 1950s, because after World War II, the leading Republican, the guy who was running for president, the frontrunner, Robert Taft wanted to take the party back to isolationism and this will sound familiar, he hated NATO. It had just been formed and guess who was running, who is going to run against him or thinking of running against him, General Eisenhower, the first head of NATO.
 
And so there you had the clash between these two figures and I discovered -- I talk about a meeting that they had, which, I mean, I don't want to give it all away, but it was absolutely fascinating.
 
DEAN: That's so incredible. And just widening it out, is it even possible to be an isolationist in the world we live in today, in 2024?
 
ZAKARIA: It's a great question because the truth is, we are so intertwined. We are so involved economically, politically. I mean, just think about the trade and travel and all of that, that goes on, all over the world.
 
So, when you try to pull out, just on this one way politically, it's going to be much, much messier then it was when we pulled out in the 1920s and 30s because we weren't really engaged with the world.
 
It was easy to draw up the drawbridge. How do you do that now and what will it look like? In a sense, we'll suggest that it's going to be very messy to try to do something like that. And remember, nobody can fill the role the United States does. There's just no country big enough, no country that has the heft.
 
We are still --  our military budget is still larger than next five countries put together. We're still the largest economy in the world by far.
 
DEAN: Yes, and you know as you're talking, I'm just writing myself a note, as we've gone through the last three hours, we do these shows it doesn't it seems like and I'm curious what your thoughts are that there's never been a moment where the foreign policy could go in such different directions depending on who is elected.
 
ZAKARIA: That's why I thought it was so important to do this special because we are at a hinge moment. The United States has stabilized the world. It really created a new world since 1945 and for the first time you have people who are saying, this was fundamentally the wrong direction and we're going to go in a different and one. That's what's at stake.
 
DEAN: And he says there's a lot at stake, Fareed Zakaria, thank you so much. We'll be watching, great to have you on to talk about it.
 
ZAKARIA: Such a pleasure. Thank you.
 
DEAN: Thank you.
 
And be sure to tune in "America First: A Fareed Zakaria Special," it is airing next right here on CNN.
 
In the meantime, I want to thank you so much for joining me this evening. I'm Jessica Dean. We're going to see you right back here next weekend. Have a great night, everyone.
