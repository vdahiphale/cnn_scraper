ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN London, this is CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson. 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Welcome to what is the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson in London. Time here at 3:00 
 
 p.m. 
 
This hour, a report from the devastated town in the West Bank was torched by dozens of Israeli settlers. And -- 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR: That is the border posts that clearly got heavily hit when Ukraine moved in hard over a 
 
 week ago. Russia's borders here completely undefended. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, CNN goes to the border of Ukraine and Russia. In the United States presidential candidates are on the campaign trail laying out their 
 
 plans for the economy. We will break down the key differences that you need to know. 
 
But we start with day two of the latest Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha happening after what a White House official calls a promising start on 
 
 Thursday. Negotiators from Israel, the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar at these talks while Qatari and Egyptian mediators are in contact separately with 
 
 Hamas' representatives. Qatar's prime minister describes negotiations as, quote, "sensitive" and we have learned several sticking points do remain. 
 
How these talks go could impact and directly impact the next moves by Iran and the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, both of them have threatened to attack 
 
 Israel in retaliation for recent assassinations of senior figures in Hamas and Hezbollah. I'm just getting some news in from Qatar so let's get to 
 
 Jomana Karadsheh, who is back with us this hour from Doha. 
 
What are we learning? 
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, we understand that the talks here in Doha have concluded. A diplomat familiar with these 
 
 discussions is telling my colleague, Alex Marquardt, they wrapped up about an hour ago. Technical teams will continue to meet in the coming days 
 
 starting tomorrow, according to the source, until the high level delegations meet again next week in Cairo. 
 
And we also understand according Alex's source, Becky, that Qatar's prime minister has called Tehran twice in the past two days to keep them updated 
 
 on these discussions. Once yesterday and once today. And it is the Qatari prime minister who spoke twice with Iran's acting foreign minister and 
 
 Qatar had agreed to keep Iran updated and the prime minister communicated that it would, quote, "be in the interest of finalizing a deal to not 
 
 launch any major escalation during the negotiations." 
 
It still has to be seen what they have come out with from these discussions. But as we have been reporting, Becky, there was no expectation 
 
 that they're going to sign any deal. There are quite complex issues on the table that they are -- they're working to get through when it comes to the 
 
 implementation of that broad framework agreement. So, I mean, all indications we have been hearing, you know, the British foreign secretary 
 
 in the past few hours, speaking in Jerusalem, said that the first day went, quote, "quite well." 
 
So we'll have to wait and see what we hear from sources about how these discussions went. But now they are going to continue working with the 
 
 technical teams and next week you will have the high level delegations meeting again in Cairo. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes, good to have you. That's important stuff. 
 
So these talks have ended for the day, at least that is what we understand. What's come out them as Jomana has suggested is unclear at this point. 
 
 These couple of calls that Jomana has been reporting on -- thank you, Jo -- from the Qatari prime minister to Iran, keeping them abreast of what is 
 
 going on is absolutely crucial because of course the region has been on tenterhooks given the threats from both Iran and Hezbollah, the Lebanese 
 
 proxy force, about what they do next in retaliation for the assassinations of two key leaders. 
 <br>[10:05:08]
 
And France's foreign minister is pushing back at comments from his Israeli counterpart today who said he expects both France and Britain to join in 
 
 attacking Iran if Iran attacks Israel. Stephane Sejourne says now is not the moment to discuss attacking Iran. Sejourne and the British Foreign 
 
 Ministry, sorry, foreign secretary are both in the Middle East, you see them there, pushing for a de-escalation of tensions. 
 
At a news conference in Jerusalem, Sejourne told reporters that France proved its support of Israel when its military helped intercept a barrage 
 
 of Iranian drones and missiles fired at Israel back in April. 
 
Well, Hamas has called on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to rise up following an attack by a mob of Israeli settlers on the town of Jit on 
 
 Thursday. According to Israeli officials, dozens of settlers entered the town setting fires and throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. The head of 
 
 the town council says they were armed and fired live rounds and that his cousin was killed in the violence. This is how one eyewitness described it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. IBRAHIM CHEDDI, JIT RESIDENT (through translator): It's a wat. A lot of stones. Look at the streets. Look at the wall here. Look at the balcony. 
 
 Look at how they broke into this. They were standing up and all of the places full of stones. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Nic Robertson with more details from the West Bank. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, the car behind was set on fire as those settlers came into this hilltop village. The man 
 
 who owns the car, I'm looking at him, his face is smashed up. He said he tried to confront the settlers as they came in. He described a scenario 
 
 that they haven't witnessed in this particular village for a long time. And he said never before in fact had they ever seen armed settlers coming in 
 
 firing live rounds, firing tear gas. 
 
But when we arrived in the town here a little earlier on in the day, we were witness to the funeral cortege of Rasheed Seda, a 23-year-old young 
 
 man, who were shot dead by the settlers. There was a lot of anger in that cortege at the settlers, at the Israeli government. A lot of pain being 
 
 felt. This was a young man of the village. He was being carried at shoulder height, wrapped in a Palestinian flag. 
 
Young men carrying him, older men watching from the sides, and the funeral service in the graveyard a little after the oration there was absolutely 
 
 powerful and very clear in its message that the people of this village don't feel safe, that they believe that the settlers were acting with the 
 
 support of the Israeli government. They don't feel in this village protected by the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force. In fact, they alleged that 
 
 the Israeli Defense Force was protecting the settlers. 
 
Now the IDF did stop a second attack overnight getting into this village. The IDF and the Israeli police are investigating the incidents so far. 
 
 We've heard condemnation coming from the U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew saying he's absolutely appalled by this and these attacks must stop. The defense 
 
 minister of Israel, Yoav Gallant, has put his condemnation out as well, calling it radical violence that does not, he said, does not stand up to 
 
 the values of the state of Israel. 
 
Israel's Interior minister has condemned it as well, calling it violent nationalist riots. Those were his words. So the condemnation coming from 
 
 Israeli officials, even from right-wing leaders like Itamar Ben-Gavr, although he did say that the Israeli Defense Force should do more to 
 
 protect the settlers, and Israelis from the stone throwers who he calls terrorists in these villages, that's his allegation, and he -- but he did 
 
 say that this is absolutely unacceptable. 
 
So this is strong condemnation coming from Israeli officials, but it just doesn't cut through in these villagers. People here don't feel safe and I 
 
 think irrespective of what they hear from the Israeli government they will continue to believe that events like last night, the settlers coming in 
 
 armed in the village where no one was expecting, killing a young man injuring others. they think these are coordinated by the government. 
 
 They're in cahoots together. 
 
This is deeply divisive particularly at a time that these very sensitive talks in Doha about the future of Gaza are going on. 
 
Nic Robertson, CNN, Jit in the occupied West Bank. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, settler attacks in the occupied West Bank are a near daily occurrence since Israel elected its most far-right government in history 
 
 last year and they have only gotten more extreme especially following the October 7th Hamas attacks. 
 <br>[10:10:09]
 
Given that many members of government were former settlers themselves, they've actively encouraged violence against Palestinians. Well, this is 
 
 the aftermath of that settler attack on the village of al-Mughayyir back in April, one of the largest attacks this year, according to Palestinian 
 
 officials. Hundreds of armed Israeli settlers set fire to homes and cars killing at least one person. 
 
And a week after October 7th, six Palestinians were killed in one village. Five of whom were young boys in settler attacks. My team and I traveled to 
 
 the village of Qusra, not far from where last night's attack took place. Here's a clip from what we reported back then. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON (voice-over): Images of the lost plaster the walls in Qusra. Hani Ouda is the mayor here. His community lives in fear he says, constantly 
 
 attacked by Jewish settlers, and he says, it's getting worse. 
 
HANI ODEH, MAYOR OF QUSRA (through translator): The situation is so, so bad. You can't even describe it. We're living in a devastating 
 
 psychological state. None of us can sleep. 
 
ANDERSON: Torched cars, water pumps, electricity lines ransacked, Hani tells me settlers roam freely here, often under the protection of the 
 
 Israeli police. Their aim he insists to drive Palestinians from their homes and ultimately from the occupied West Bank. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Ukraine says that by bringing the war to Russian territory, it is hoping to bring Russia to the table. An aid to Ukraine's president 
 
 says the incursion into Russia's Kursk Region is aimed at persuading the Kremlin to enter, quote, "fair negotiations." Well, senior U.S. officials 
 
 tell us Moscow has diverted several thousand Russian troops from Ukraine to the new front line in Kursk. 
 
Our Nick Paton Walsh shows us what they are fighting for. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATON WALSH (voice-over): This is where Russia begins. It's startling to see that steady flow of military vehicles that probably an ambulance and 
 
 armor just passing through the Russian border point here. That is the border post that clearly got heavily hit when Ukraine moved in hard over a 
 
 week ago. Russia's borders here completely undefended. 
 
It's also remarkable, the freedom with which the Ukrainian military are moving around here. They simply aren't afraid of the drones that have 
 
 hampered their every move for the past months. That says the border service of the FSB, the Russian security services of Russia. That's a bullet hole 
 
 above the rules and bullet holes in the rules themselves. 
 
Now this is what's so startling about this offensive. There's a volume of Western supplied armor that we're seeing passing back and forth. Their 
 
 passage through here up into Russia unimpeded entirely. That Roshel from Canada. 
 
(Through text translation): Did you expect it? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): No, we didn't expect this. There's a task, we're doing it. No more, no less. The final result? No one 
 
 speaks about that one. 
 
PATON WALSH: Just saying about how frequently they've been going back and forth over the last week or so. And you've got a real sense of the euphoria 
 
 but ultimately, too, the enduring question, what is all this for? What is the end game? Yes, it's a huge embarrassment for Vladimir Putin but they're 
 
 sending some of their best equipment deep into Russia. And I'm sure in the back of the minds of these troops is the question of what ultimately, are 
 
 we going to achieve? And we just don't know the answer to that. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Nick Paton Walsh is there on the ground. 
 
Still to come on CNN, the economy takes center stage once again in the U.S. presidential race. Kamala Harris poised to lay out her economic plan for 
 
 Americans the day after being blasted by her rival, Donald Trump. 
 
Plus CNN visits a shop in Virginia selling Trump merchandise owned by a black woman. What does she think about the former president's efforts to 
 
 reach minority voters? More coming up. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:16:38]
 
ANDERSON: CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. Sixteen minutes past 3:00 here in London. Normally out of the Middle East, our Abu Dhabi bureau 
 
 there in the UAE, but in London this week. 
 
And reporting on U.S. politics the Democratic Party's presidential nominee will unveil an economic plan later today, which she hopes will help win the 
 
 White House. In North Carolina, Kamala Harris is expected to share proposals to lower costs for middle-class families, including a ban on what 
 
 is known as corporate price gouging, according to her campaign team. It will also include a plan to make housing more affordable especially for 
 
 first-time home buyers. 
 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, continues to use his time in the spotlight to attack Harris for her economic record and to 
 
 insult her. Here are a few remarks from his news conference that he held on Thursday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist, or somebody that's going to 
 
 destroy our country. I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. She's considered far more radical than Bernie Sanders. I'm very angry at her. 
 
 She's a very strong communist lean. She actually called me weird. He's weird. You're all going to be thrown into a communist system. 
 
I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. You're going to be thrown into a system where everybody gets health care. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: OK. Just some of the lines from Donald Trump in his press conference last night. We're going to move on in light of, well, given that 
 
 happened yesterday. Today, we've got some expectations certainly about what might be announced by Kamala Harris with her economic policy. 
 
CNN's Julia Chatterley following on all this from New York. 
 
I don't know. Do you have some comments about what he said? You don't have to. I certainly want to talk about food prices. Kamala Harris rolling out a 
 
 new proposal on this front. What does that include? 
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: Yes. Let's just leave Trump where he was if you wouldn't mind because I've got enough to talk to you about 
 
 with Kamala's proposals, but I will give you the context, though, where I can on what he said and continues to say. It makes perfect sense to me for 
 
 Kamala to be talking about food price inflation and trying to distance herself from the criticism that the Biden administration has faced over 
 
 rising prices. This is how also taking a leaf out of the former prosecutor's book, of course, to tackle corporate. Price gouging is when 
 
 corporates collude either to keep prices high or to pad their profits when we're in a rising price environment. 
 
She's floated the first ever prospect of a federal ban on price hikes and far more powers to some of the federal bodies like the FTC. What they can 
 
 do at the FTC is tackle price fixing. They can stop merges in the grocery industry. Meat is a great example because just a few companies control that 
 
 market. 
 
What it can't do, Becky, and this is key, is go to a grocer and say, hey, egg prices are too high, you need to lower them. If they did, it would be a 
 
 huge expansion of power and it would require an act of Congress. What the problem that you're trying to fix, though, is the critical question here. 
 
 Does it come down to corporate greed or is it to do with a war in Ukraine, those grain crises, climate change, wages for workers and accessibility or 
 
 lack of accessibility of workers in the agricultural industry? 
 
Understand the problem that you're trying to fix I think is a message that sells well with voters. 
 <br>[10:20:05]
 
I think the practicalities of this are far more difficult. And as you and I well know, if you want to control inflation focus on the Federal Reserve. 
 
 Let them do their job to raise interest rates. Trump wants to interfere with that. Kamala said, look, I'll leave them alone. And quite frankly 
 
 right answer from her. 
 
ANDERSON: Absolutely. Jerome Powell certainly says at least he won't be influenced in his decision. 
 
A couple of other things I want to talk to you about because as I understand it, she's going to talk Social Security and she's going to talk 
 
 housing. What's been the message on Social Security? 
 
CHATTERLEY: Well, so this is actually the Trump campaign that's floated this and said, look, for the people that get Social Security in the United 
 
 States, they shouldn't pay tax on it. It's around 27 million people that get Social Security benefits and they also pay tax. 
 
Just to give you a sense, if you earn more than $25,000 as an individual in the United States, up to 50 percent of those benefits are potentially 
 
 taxable. And he's saying, look, no more. The Tax Policy Center says the benefit would be around $550 annually per person, but the unintended 
 
 consequences here, Becky, are vast. How are you going to pay for it? If he's going to talk about taxing higher-earning individuals, then that's 
 
 perhaps one way to fund it. 
 
Otherwise, you've got to dip into some of these Social Security funds. And the fear is that they're already set to run dry over the next 10 years. So 
 
 that would eventually mean benefits being cut somewhere down the road. It'll also going to mean a massive hit to the deficit as well. And we don't 
 
 often talk about that. We'll pay for it later, but that is a huge problem, too. The money here matters. 
 
ANDERSON: Absolutely. Housing. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. 
 
ANDERSON: It's an issue here for youngsters. Getting sort of young, sort of up and coming, you know, millennials as it were on to the housing market in 
 
 the U.K. has been a real issue and the Labour Party, the new Labour Party here has said that it will take that. Housing also a massive issue in the 
 
 United States. What's the plan? 
 
CHATTERLEY: It's massive and it's the same issue in the U.K. It's a lack of supply. Ultimately it's pushed prices up. Young people can't get on the 
 
 housing ladder. That pushes rent up because that's the only alternative. And if mortgage rates are high people are afraid to refinance. We wait for 
 
 them to come down because they don't want to lock in a super high rate if they've got a lower one, too. 
 
The most important part of the Harris plan is to boost construction of houses. Up to three million homes. They've talked about a $40 billion fund 
 
 as well that perhaps can help at the local level to help and influence what's going on in the housing market. Tax credits for homebuilders. Again, 
 
 it all sounds good. The execution on this is going to be important. And what I will say as well is right now in the United States, we have job 
 
 openings, 300,000 construction workers needed even today. 
 
Want to build houses, Becky? Got to have the workers. Sort that one out. 
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. Always a pleasure. Thank you. 
 
Recent polls show Kamala Harris gaining momentum in her bid for the U.S. presidency. They also show the Democrat winning over more support from a 
 
 key voting bloc, which is black voters. According to data this week from Pew, 77 percent of black voters support Harris compared to 64 percent who 
 
 back Biden in July. Republican Donald Trump's support among black voters is unchanged at just 13 percent. 
 
Now this comes as the former president does try to appeal more to the black community, a group that has long and overwhelmingly backed Democrats. 
 
CNN's Elle Reeve spent some time at a shop in Virginia selling Trump merchandise to gauge support. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JO ANNE PRICE, RUNS A TRUMP STORE: Everyone want to have one of these. It's one of those things that when people see one, then they want one. Same 
 
 thing with the Confederate hat. You know why? Because people don't think you have the nerve to do it. 
 
ELLE REEVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jo Anne Price runs a Trump store in Christiansburg, Virginia. 
 
When Joe Biden announced he wouldn't run for president again, was there any part of you who felt a pull to vote for Harris? 
 
PRICE: No. 
 
REEVE: Why not? 
 
PRICE: Absolutely not. I would not vote for either one of them. I would not vote Democrat ticket. No way. 
 
This is a white privilege card. And this is just a play, it just says this card trumps everything and it gives the bearer happiness and success 
 
 because of the color of the skin. 
 
REEVE: And who buys that? 
 
PRICE: White people. 
 
REEVE: OK. 
 
PRICE: It's funny. 
 
SEBRIAM VANNOY, TRUMP SUPPORTER: And then when you give it to a state trooper, they'll let you go and don't write you a ticket. 
 
REEVE: You think so? 
 
VANNOY: Yes. I've experienced it. 
 
PRICE: Yes. 
 
REEVE: Wait, really? 
 
VANNOY: Yes. And then he said, OK, he laughed at it and gave it back to me and did not write me a ticket. 
 
REEVE (voice-over): This actually happened at least once elsewhere. In 2022, a woman claimed Alaska police let her go without a ticket when she 
 
 flashed a white privilege card instead of a driver's license. 
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
PRICE: It's humorous to us. You know, it really is. It's humorous to the average American here, you know? 
 
VANNOY: Chances are 2 to 1 he was a Republican, too. 
 
REEVE: Trump has been working to appeal to black voters, and polls showed some success when Biden was still in the race, but have since gone down. 
 
The Trump campaign this year has made a big effort to reach out to black voters. What do you think of their efforts? 
 
PRICE: I think their efforts aren't succeeding tremendously. All the things that have happened to President Trump, the attacks on him, have done 
 
 nothing more than strengthen black people's connection to him because now he's someone who is the target of a struggle, and they have always been -- 
 
 felt that they've been a target. 
 
I did prison ministries for five years. So, you know, if you're a convicted felon and then somebody else is a convicted felon, there's a camaraderie 
 
 there. 
 
REEVE (voice-over): Donald Trump attacked Kamala Harris, questioning her racial identity. She's black. 
 
TRUMP: I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black. 
 
REEVE: He's acknowledged his commentary has provoked mixed reactions. Price is just one person and not a swing voter, but we were curious what she made 
 
 of his comments given that she's a black woman and fervent Trump supporter and former local Republican Party chair. 
 
How do you make sense of how Trump talks about Vice President Kamala Harris, that he sort of suggests that he doesn't understand her biracial 
 
 background, that first she was Indian and then she was black? What do you make of that? 
 
PRICE: I don't understand it either. She's Indian and she's Jamaican. 
 
REEVE: Yes. 
 
PRICE: Is she black? 
 
REEVE: I mean, do you not think she's black? 
 
PRICE: Is she? Was she born here? 
 
REEVE: Yes. 
 
PRICE: Yes. Were her parents citizens? No. 
 
REEVE: OK. But we have birthright citizenship in America. Do you -- 
 
PRICE: We call that anchor. 
 
REEVE: People can't immigrate here and not be citizens, but have green cards and work permits. 
 
PRICE: Yes, that's true. However, she can claim to be black because of her Jamaican father. You know, that's her right. We're a melting pot, you know, 
 
 because I basically have a combination in my family as well. 
 
REEVE: How do you reconcile that? Like, you have a history of blended families in your family. How do you reconcile that with Trump seeming to 
 
 not understand how Kamala Harris could have a blended family herself? 
 
PRICE: Herself? She could have a blended family. What I'm saying is, is his comments about that, I think he's making a point. And, you know, I'm not so 
 
 disturbed by that. 
 
REEVE: But what is the point he's making? 
 
PRICE: The point he's making simply is, is that she is not a black, black person. 
 
REEVE (voice-over): There were some mixed views on the idea of a woman president. 
 
What do you think about Kamala Harris? 
 
VANNOY: Kamala Harris, may I say this? And hopefully that you ladies won't get offended. But because of what happened in the Garden of Eden, there 
 
 will never be an elected woman, whether she's black or white, that will occupy the White House, that God would ever stand behind. 
 
REV. MERRIE TURNER, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I'm not sure America is quite ready for female leadership. It would be wonderful to have a female president if 
 
 and when one arises that has conservative values, that are going to lead the nation in prosperity. 
 
REEVE: Did Joe Biden dropping out change your view of the election at all? 
 
JOE SHANNON, OBAMA-TO-TRUMP VOTER: Oh, it surely did. I think she's going to be worse than Joe. I just don't think she has the experience. I think 
 
 she was only chosen because she was a woman. 
 
PRICE: He has been mocked, scrutinized, slandered, dragged into court. This man is still standing and he's standing strong because he knows that he was 
 
 chosen. He's our David. 
 
REEVE: Elle Reeve, CNN, Christiansburg, Virginia. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, just ahead, fears of famine and a country at breaking point, I've been speaking with the U.S. special envoy for Sudan. Hear what 
 
 he has to say about peace talks after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:32:39]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. 
 
Talks aimed at ending Sudan's devastating 16-month conflict are currently underway in Switzerland despite the absence of one of the main players in 
 
 the war. Sudanese Armed Forces or SAF declining to attend citing a failure to implement the Jeddah Declaration, a resolution that was agreed upon more 
 
 than a year ago. 
 
The conflict has created a humanitarian catastrophe with millions facing acute hunger, and until now no peace initiative has alleviated the 
 
 suffering or silence the guns. Well, there is some good news now. Despite their absence, the SAF announced that it will open a key border crossing 
 
 for humanitarian aid after they closed it in February, alleging that the Rapid Support Forces or RSF were using it to move weapons. 
 
Well, the mediators in Geneva saying in a statement, quote, "The delegations in Geneva welcome the decision by the SAF to open the Adre 
 
 border crossing. We call on the RSF to take immediate steps to ensure that the aid groups entering through that border crossing are provided safety, 
 
 unfettered humanitarian access, and operational independence from armed and political actors." 
 
Well, earlier, I spoke to a key player in these mediation talks. The U.S. special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perillo, who told me that the main goals for 
 
 this initiative are to end the hostilities, increase access to humanitarian aid, and have a long-term political mechanism signed by the parties. But 
 
 how do you achieve success without all the parties at the table? Here's what he told me in response to that question. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TOM PERRIELLO, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO SUDAN: We have the ability to communicate with people every hour as we're doing with both SAF and RSF. 
 
 We've put together a diplomatic coalition that represents an enormous amount of knowledge and relationships to both SAF and RSF, as well as 
 
 understanding of these humanitarian issues and ceasefire issues. 
 
And the Sudanese people were very clear, they don't want anything to stop us from moving forward to try to produce results when over 25 million 
 
 Sudanese people have been forced from their homes, are facing acute hunger or even famine, and the daily abuse of atrocities and shelling. 
 <br>[10:35:09]
 
So we are moving forward. We had the Adre border opened yesterday and this team was immediately able to start activating on how that translates into 
 
 results for men, women, and children who have been suffering from famine inside. We are going to keep working away at these results. We'd be able to 
 
 do a lot more if President Burhan sends a senior staff delegation. Particularly we'd be able to do more on cessation of hostilities consistent 
 
 with the Jeddah Declarations that the parties have already signed. 
 
ANDERSON: Well, let's talk about that border crossing because that is really important. The Sudanese government has agreed to open that key 
 
 border crossing with Chad for humanitarian aid for three months. News it's been welcomed of course in Sudan and at these Geneva talks, but aid 
 
 agencies calling for unfettered access saying they should not require consent for the transfer of aid. What is the enforcement mechanism around 
 
 this? 
 
PERRIELLO: Well, that's part of what we're looking at right in the room. We are very appreciative that it has finally been reopened up by President 
 
 Burhan. And we are immediately working with the international humanitarian community, Chad and others to make sure that translates into food and 
 
 medicine as soon as possible in areas like the Zamzam camp. This is an area, the famine that has gone on too long, and we need to continue to use 
 
 this to build more progress from the SAF and RSF on issues related to humanitarian issues of famine and of abuse of civilians. 
 
ANDERSON: Right. You say you were encouraged by this border crossing being opened and you welcomed that move by Burhan of the SAF. But let's be quite 
 
 frank about this and I want to push you again on why it is that they're not at the table and the effect of that. This is not a civil war. This is a 
 
 fight between two warring parties. Are you convinced both want to end this war? 
 
PERRIELLO: Well, we're convinced the Sudanese people want to end this war, or the Sudanese people did not want this war to start in the first place. 
 
 And they have been very clear about wanting both SAF and RSF leadership to be here at these talks. There's been an enormous amount of support for this 
 
 mediation effort. We could do more if that SAF delegation arrives, but we're going to continue to push the envelope on what we could do with this 
 
 virtual proximity talk model. 
 
And I can tell you that the diplomats here have been really pushing the envelope on innovation and entrepreneurial approach of how we can draw on 
 
 each of our strengths in order to do the most we can for the people. 
 
ANDERSON: The SAF and the Sudanese people have accused the UAE in attendance at these talks of arming the RSF, something that the emirates 
 
 have categorically denied. What is their role and in these peace talks, how can countries who are part of the region, and they are in attendance this 
 
 time? And I'm including Egypt and various others here. How can they be part of a solution at this point? 
 
PERRIELLO: Well, look, there have been far too many foreign fighters, foreign elements and foreign countries that have been pouring fuel on the 
 
 fire of this war. And we need them to be parts of the solution, parts of solidifying the peace effort. We've heard very clearly from SAF that they 
 
 care about the enforcement of existing agreements, and we've put together a diplomatic coalition here with the Saudis, the Egyptians who played such a 
 
 huge role in putting this together along with the emirates, the E.U., and the U.N., but also many partners that are not in the room, like Arab League 
 
 and EGAD, and E.U. that have been central to the diplomacy to put the push the parties forward on these issues. 
 
And again, the goal here is not an agreement on paper. The goal is to take agreements already on paper and turn them into action. 
 
ANDERSON: I have to warn you this. There are intelligence reports suggesting that Iran has been playing a role in fueling the conflict in 
 
 Sudan. In light of its role in funding and arming proxy groups in the region, is the U.S. aware of this? Have you seen these reported 
 
 intelligence documents and how concerned are you about the potential? Should there not be a ceasefire at this point of a wider regional conflict? 
 
PERRIELLO: Look, anyone who's not concerned certainly should be, whether it's the influence of that country or several others. What we see is a 
 
 country that is not on a trajectory towards stability, but towards such a level of instability and violence that it is pouring out across into 
 
 neighboring countries and across the region. When people ask why this is different than earlier negotiations, the humanitarian crisis has only 
 
 gotten worse. 
 <br>[10:40:02]
 
But it's also become a regional security issue. And I think it has become clear in my meetings with our African counterparts and Gulf counterparts 
 
 that nobody wins from this war going forward. Everybody stands to lose. Most of all the Sudanese people. And I think because of that, we have a 
 
 very different diplomatic energy here in these talks, but also in the broader coalition that's pushing for peace. 
 
ANDERSON: You say that country, Iran, and others who are not present in Geneva of fueling this war. I want to press you on this. Have you seen 
 
 reports, intelligence reports to suggest an expanding role for Iran and who else are you talking about who you believe is fueling this conflict? 
 
PERRIELLO: There have been public reports and open source reporting on Iran backing of or arming of in this conflict on the south side. There's been 
 
 documentation of extremist fighters from across the Sahel that had been appearing and fighting on the RSF's side. We actually see a broadening of 
 
 international actors, none of whom really have the interests of the Sudanese people at heart. 
 
In fact, what you see is in countries that are reaching a certain level of fragility, it's almost like seeing vultures circle the country and what the 
 
 Sudanese people are saying is we need help pushing those actors away, helping us get to peace, helping us get to stability. 
 
ANDERSON: Do you treat the RSF and the SAF as equal partners here? There will be people watching this who say, isn't it the right of the SAF to stay 
 
 away from these talks? 
 
PERRIELLO: They aren't the same in fact. They have different histories and different legal legitimacies. I've spoken to that before. We believe the 
 
 Sudan Armed Forces has a long future role in a sovereign Sudan under a civilian democratic government. We've been very clear about that. But the 
 
 nature of ceasefire discussions is that you invite people in a way in their capacity as belligerents that does not bestow or deny any legitimacy on the 
 
 parties. 
 
And the whole reason to do it is for exactly this situation. We need to have pragmatic conversations about the cessation of hostilities that can 
 
 save lives of the Sudanese people tomorrow and humanitarian access that can save the lives of Sudanese people tomorrow while other conversations about 
 
 politics and legitimacy are important and can run in parallel with that. 
 
ANDERSON: What do you understand to be the prospective leadership on Sudan shown by Kamala Harris should she win? What's her position on Sudan as you 
 
 understand it? 
 
PERRIELLO: Well, Vice President Harris has been very clear about caring a great deal about the crisis in Sudan. She's been regularly getting updates 
 
 going back many months and the Biden-Harris administration has made clear in bringing me into this position that they want to elevate our leadership 
 
 and engagement with our African partners, as well as our Gulf partners. We see that here. 
 
We've seen Secretary Blinken personally engage, as well as the Biden-Harris White House with leaders throughout the region, as well as called -- 
 
 multiple calls this week to President Burhan. And I think this is really a whole of government effort from the U.S. with a country we've had a long 
 
 history with, and where we care deeply about doing everything we can to contribute our part, whether that's on humanitarian aid or these diplomatic 
 
 efforts. 
 
ANDERSON: And should Donald Trump win? 
 
PERRIELLO: Well, again, I can't speak for a future administration. What I can tell you is that the bipartisan support for Sudan on Capitol Hill on 
 
 both the Senate and House side is rock solid. It has long been that. We have seen that go through administrations in my lifetime, both Republicans 
 
 and Democrats. So in our system I think that probably bodes well for a lot more consistency. So right now I think that's important. The U.S. is 
 
 strong. It's bipartisan, it's going to continue and that sense of urgency is something that is pressing for action far, far sooner than anyone will 
 
 go to the polls in the United States. We need this action now for the people of Sudan. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: U.S. special envoy for Sudan speaking to me just a little earlier. 
 
When we come back, we're getting new details on what came out of these Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha. I'm going to get that for you right after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: So news just coming in to us. We are getting new details of the latest ceasefire talks that have ended within the past hour in Doha. A 
 
 joint statement by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt calls the talk serious and constructive, and says mediators presented Israel and Hamas with a bridging 
 
 proposal that aims to close the remaining gaps between them. 
 
Let's get you to Doha and to Jomana Karadsheh. 
 
What have you got, Jomana? 
 
KARADSHEH: Well, Becky, as you mentioned there, those talks we understand concluded about an hour or so ago and in the last few minutes, this joint 
 
 statement coming from the mediators, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt. And as you mentioned, they described these talks as serious and constructive and they 
 
 say that they have presented both sides with a bridging proposal that they say would close the remaining gaps of disagreement between both sides. 
 
They say that this, quote, "builds on areas of agreement and bridges remaining gaps in a manner that allows for swift implementation of the 
 
 deal. Now, they don't elaborate on what the areas of agreement are or what that bridging proposal is. We will wait to find out potentially in the 
 
 coming hours what that is. But we understand the technical teams will continue to work starting tomorrow and in the coming days on that 
 
 implementation of that bridging proposal. 
 
And the senior officials, these high level delegations will meet again before the end of next week in Cairo. And according to the statement they 
 
 aim they say to conclude the deal under the terms put forward. 
 
And look, Becky, it has been no secret that the mediators have been running out of patience. They have put unprecedented pressure on both Israel and 
 
 Hamas to try and get a deal done. But what we don't know right now is how the -- what the Israeli position is, what Hamas' position is because, as 
 
 you know, Hamas was not involved in these indirect negotiations. The Egyptians and the Qataris will have to engage with Hamas, as they've said, 
 
 to take whatever has come out of these talks, this bridging proposal, back to Hamas and see what their response is. 
 
So we'll have to wait and see. And of course, what is very important as well as we are hearing from a diplomat familiar with these talks, telling 
 
 our colleague Alex Marquardt that the Qatari foreign minister and prime minister has called the Iranian acting foreign minister twice, once 
 
 yesterday and once today, relaying a message that it will be in the best interest of these talks that Iran does not launch any major escalation in 
 
 the region as they try to finalize this agreement, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you. Thank you very much, indeed. Incredibly important dateline for us today in Doha. These talks have now ended. As we 
 
 understand it, technical teams will be continuing to work and we expect these teams to be back in business again in Cairo on Thursday. That is 
 
 certainly what we are hearing behind the scenes. And as Jomana rightly pointed out, the Qatari prime minister keeping Iran up-to-date in two calls 
 
 about where they stand. 
 
Israel and Hamas now have a bridging proposal as described by one source to us and we will keep you bang up-to-date on how they respond to that as we 
 
 get more information. 
 <br>[10:50:12]
 
You are watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. Coming up the new season of the Premier League is a few hours away from kickoff. Can 
 
 anyone stop Man City from lifting a fifth straight title? Details and thoughts after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Right. We are just hours from kickoff in the new English Premier League season or the EPL with Manchester United set to Fulham. United 
 
 manager Erik ten Hag says he is concerned his team are not ready for Friday's open. 
 
Well, Patrick Snell joins us live. Why is that? 
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Hi, Becky. Yes, exciting times just hours away now, as you say, for the start of the Premier League season. I think 
 
 it's a reference there to the fact though United has spent big under their new owners this post season, but it's the injuries they've had in 
 
 preseason. I'm pretty sure that is what Ten Hag is referring to. 
 
Key injuries to their striker, their lead striker, they're only out and out designated striker at the club, Rasmus Hojlund. That was in preseason 
 
 action against the Arsenal. Luke Shaw, the highly talented left-back, but with a history of being injured at several times over his long United 
 
 career. And really the most difficult one for me, the young French teenage defender Leny Yoro as well, the 18-year-old who had surgery after getting 
 
 injured in the same match against Arsenal during preseason. 
 
Really, really tough challenges at that, but United has spent big. They're being brought in Matthijs de Ligt, the talented defender from Bayern 
 
 Munich. Let's hear more now from Erik ten Hag, get his thoughts ahead of today's game with Fulham at Old Trafford. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ERIK TEN HAG, MANCHESTER UNITED MANAGER: We know our targets. We know that we are in the right direction. And we know we have won two trophies. We 
 
 know our K model. So now we have to integrate the new place where we think they can improve the K model. They can improve the team levels, and to take 
 
 it from there. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL: Yes, the pressure is definitely on Ten Hag. This is his third season now in charge of United. 
 
What bought him time, Becky, was winning the FA Cup at the end of last season at the expense of Manchester City, their great rivals. United 
 
 finished eighth last season. That was their worst finish ever in Premier League history. 
 
Let's get to United's big Northwest English rival Liverpool. Liverpool now a new era for them. This is the post-Jurgen Klopp era. They've got the 
 
 Dutch head coach, another highly talented Dutch head coach on a slot taking charge of the reds. High expectations for the reds. They open up on 
 
 Saturday against newly promoted tractor boys, Ipswich Town. 
 
And interesting times at Liverpool, Becky, because they are the only side in the top five European Leagues up to now to bring in even one signing. So 
 
 what does that say that Slot is either super confident with a Scottie house? I will say there are still two more weeks left in the Premier League 
 
 transfer window, two weeks today, that slam shut. But exciting times. And I know you'll be keeping a very close eye on your beloved Tottenham. 
 
ANDERSON: I most certainly will. As a long suffering fan, you always feel optimistic at the beginning of the season. They -- well, anyway, let's not 
 
 say they let you down halfway through the, you know, the autumn term as it were. 
 <br>[10:55:02]
 
Listen, what are your predictions for this season? I mean, is it going to be hard to bet against Man City, isn't it? 
 
SNELL: It really is. I mean, I would love to say my beloved Man United, Becky, will be back but, you know, I have my doubts. You know, the post-
 
 Ferguson era is proving a very challenging one. I think that's fair to say for Manchester United at the 11-year mark now since their last title. 
 
Look, it's hard to bet against Manchester City, isn't it? They are the all- conquering kings of England right now under Pep Guardiola. I don't think too much has changed there. Kevin De Bruyne still very much part of their 
 
 playing squad. 
 
Look, they have just become the first English team ever to win four straight top flight titles. They're now going for number five to make it a 
 
 fifth consecutive top flight title. They would be further extending their own record. I do think Liverpool will have a good season under their new 
 
 Dutch head coach. So I see a top four finish for Liverpool. But I want arsenal to really step up to the plate and believe in themselves. 
 
There's so much talent in that squad. They haven't won the title since 2004. So I'm going with City again, but I'm sure most Arsenal fans really 
 
 want their team to develop and strengthen their inner bellies. 
 
Back to you. 
 
ANDERSON: Well, I wish I could support you on that, but I won't. 
 
SNELL: I know you won't. 
 
ANDERSON: Because they're our North London rivals. All right. Thank you for that. 
 
And that is it for CONNECT THE WORLD. Stay with CNN. "NEWSROOM" with Rahel is up next.
