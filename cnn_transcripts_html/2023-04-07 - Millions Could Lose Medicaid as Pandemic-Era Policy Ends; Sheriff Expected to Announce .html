JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: CNN's Amara Walker has been digging into the story. Amara, imagine, there are a lot of people out there concerned thinking how can I make sure I stay on if I still, I am allowed to be on?
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Yes, John, they'll be concerned if they're even aware that this is even happening. So, as you said, yes, you're right. I mean, this will disproportionately impact children and of course, people in the black and Latin X communities. But right now the most important thing to do for Medicaid recipients is to get online, go to your state's Medicaid portals and update your contact information, your financial information.
 
And do not forget to press the Renew button; renewing your enrollment will be paramount. There are two main things though to be I guess people are keeping an eye on that they're concerned about. And you mentioned to John 15 million people, they're expected to potentially lose their Medicaid insurance coverage.
 
This is primarily for people with low incomes, not because and about half of those 15 million are expected to lose their coverage not because there are - they're no longer eligible. But because perhaps mistakes will be made along the way by state employees, or the Medicaid recipients are not aware of this "Unwinding period" and they will fail to re-verify their information and re-enroll.
 
Also, to keep in mind, the biggest challenge right now for advocates is just getting the word out, making people aware that this is even happening. Right now, 14 state, states will have about 14 months I should say to re-verify and dis-enroll people from the Medicaid rolls.
 
And I spoke with Courtney McKnight. She is an enrollment specialist here in Georgia. And she said yes, that has been the biggest hurdle getting people to know that this is even happening. Listen.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My family --, because I have Medicaid for my kids, and I can lose Medicaid for my kids. That's what you're saying? COURTNEY MCKNIGHT, CERTIFIED ENROLLMENT SPECIALIST, GEORGIA PRIMARY CARE: Yes, ma'am. Everyone has been pretty receptive. And I think it was just everyone was freaking out. Because the way the information is given, it's like; you're going to lose your benefits. And it's like no, that you have not lost them. You're not going to lose them if you enroll within your 30 days.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALKER: Alright, so I mentioned earlier that mistakes potentially will be made. As of April 1, every state has begun the process of re- verifying all 92 million Medicaid recipients. As you'd imagine, John, it's going to be a monumental task, especially for many states that are dealing with staffing shortages, and high turnover rates, which means that there will be some inexperienced workers who will potentially make mistakes and perhaps deem someone ineligible for Medicaid, even if they are eligible.
 
So, the best thing to do right now, what's in your power as a Medicaid enrollee is to get to your state's Medicaid portal and update all your information and re-enroll now, don't wait for the state to contact you that you need to do so in this short window, John.
 
BERMAN: That is such an important advice. Amara Walker, don't wait for the deadlines check now. This is something really important for so many people. Thanks so much Amara for that report. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN HOST: All right, John. We are waiting on new information from Marion County, Florida. You are looking at live pictures now as we wait for the sheriff to bring forth some really important new information potentially an arrest; they said one was imminent yesterday, waiting to hear what he has to say about the murders of those three teenagers. That happened over several days. That's just ahead.
 
(COMMECIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
SIDNER: All right, we're going to take you to Florida right now where you can see the Marion County Sheriff there making a major announcement in the investigation of three murder teenagers there, let's listen.
 
SHERIFF BILLY WOODS, MARION COUNTY, FLORIDA: she would later succumb to her injuries. The following morning, we responded to a location about a half a mile away and located a second victim deceased on the side of the road from an apparent gunshot wound. Then on Saturday, April 1, my deputies located - car abandoned and partially submerged in a pond about nine miles from the location where she was found.
 
My investigators located the third victim inside of the car. And I'll go ahead and tell you because you've been asking me for specific details. She was located in the trump. Now, I want to clear up before we get into those details based on the interviews, digital evidence from her phone. She was there of her own free will. Now I'm going to start off by thanking all of the entities. If there's ever a true example of law enforcement, communities coming together and almost perfect collaboration to come to a conclusion in a week on a triple homicide is truly amazing.
 
Those entities include the FBI, FDLE, U.S. marshal's office, and in my opinion probably the best state attorney in the state of Florida for the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Bill Gladson Assistant State Attorneys OPD my deputies, detectives, forensic professionals and our citizens who are truly amazing.
 
Now this one's going to come as a shock to you that includes you the media. You helped us getting information. My emotions right now are all over the place because I am so, so proud of my guys and girls, I didn't do a damn thing. But they stepped up to the plate.
 
And yes, you put information out there. And I will admit this, you wore my ass out, of - you hounded me. But don't ever think I didn't use you as well to get the information I needed. Now the investigators were able to determine that this group of juveniles was involved in committing burglaries and robberies which they referred to as a lick.
 
Now, although we had out there that was gang related, we have nothing specific to say that it was any rivalry or anything to such that cause. But however, each and every one of them in some shape or form is associated with a gang. Basically, simple terms, there is no honor among thieves.
 
And at some point, these three individuals turned on our three victims and murdered them. Two of them right there. They fled the scenes, but left a lot of evidence and they're weak.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
Through the cooperation of the agencies that I previously mentioned, and my office, we were able to begin compiling all of the evidence and finding these killers. Now, we were shocked and saddened by the violence as all of my citizens. Because we are shot not only are the victims juveniles, but the murderers, or juveniles as well.
 
I know each of you in the media here and viewers out there probably heard us in law enforcement or even in community events, talk about what is the problem. And I'm going to go ahead and address the first thing that I know it's going to come up.
 
Because there are individuals out there viewing and occlude some of you media, they want to blame the one thing that has no ability, or the capacity to commit the crime itself. And that's the gun. These individuals committed the crime. What's the solution? I wish I could give you that answer, because this world would be a whole lot better.
 
But the fact is society fails. We do not hold our juveniles accountable. We minimize their actions. Let me tell you why I say this. Last night, I had to stare into the eyes of two mothers. It's not their fault. Because what I saw last night were two mothers who are willing to give their sons everything, do everything for them, and give them their own lives.
 
Just like you and I, no matter how much we teach them because I am a father. I am a father and I cannot fathom what they were going through. These mothers and mothers across this nation need all of your help because here's what infuriates me.
 
I've got a particular media who has a problem with putting photos of juveniles out. Now we do what the law says we can do but these photos out. I put myself in the shoes of those mothers because I heard one of them say it. I wish I would have known what this one was doing and who they were because my kid never would have hung out with them.
 
And to think and believe to minimize any actions, that is criminal of a juvenile is a disservice and frankly stupid to think. We need to hold them accountable and then hope that we can change them. I'm not going to be able to give you everything because there is a third suspect that we were unable to locate last night.
 
But however, you will receive you may already have it the probable cause affidavit that tells you the details of the events that occurred. I will tell you this. I already told you about the witness hearing the gunshots that is, when all three were killed. The suspects were in the vehicle.
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
This individual who is a juvenile also is who we're looking for. Now I'm talking to the viewers. Some of you know him, you know where he is and you need to turn him in. Now I will get him, I will find him and justice will be completed. As you can imagine, my thoughts are all over this page right now. Fighting these crimes, this type of crimes requires all of us to come together as a community.
 
And Marion County stepped up to the plate. And we've been successful. Now, I know I've forgotten something. And I'm missing something. So, I'm going to open up the floor to questions.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any type of motive given--
 
WOODS: Mentioned it robbery.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --struck words.
 
WOODS: Go to her first.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to clarify you said it suspects were in the vehicle. So, are you paying off six were in there at one time?
 
WOODS: Yes, ma'am.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And so, the three individuals and two that are in custody and this person, they turned all the other three in the vehicle. And that's --something.
 
WOODS: That's correct.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --a robbery of the three victims.
 
WOODS: Not going to get into too many, too many more of those details because of the third suspect being there.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure - Rick, Fox News. Did the suspects and the three-bit teams, have you been able to determine how long they've known each other?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not entirely.
 
WOODS: Short time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sir, if you mentioned the gun, and we know how the software got to hold of the weapon--
 
WOODS: Yes. Right, all the gun laws we got in place didn't prevent it did it? Neither will any new ones. Because here's the fact the bad guy is going to get a gun no matter what law you have put in place. These juveniles should even possess a handgun. But they did.
 
And I'll go back to you and your question, a simple burglary, as some people will say, but I don't consider anything simple when it comes to a burglary. The law allows me I'll plastered their face up on this page up, on my page up a media, I will hand it out if law allows me because parents have the right to know who their kids are hanging out with and preventing this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did the suspects parents say when you spoke with them about the arrest?
 
WOODS: I personally didn't speak to them about the arrest is immediately after the interviews in which I talked to their mothers. But really, they don't have a whole lot to say. If you're a parent put yourself in their shoes. Holy hell, panic! I'm scared to death as a parent embarrassed, ashamed. What do you think they're going to say?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure. Words are the - these three juveniles will be tried as adults.
 
WOODS: State Attorney's Office is reviewing that right now. OK, so I don't want to say yes. And then it turned around no, then you will end up calling me a liar at some point.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, what - account to kind of piggyback off that. So, what does accountability look like for you? I know you talked about do not - accountable for their actions.
 
WOODS: I will refrain an awful lot on that answer to this question. To the full extent of the law, OK, don't take me wrong. I might be hard on people but I also have a heart. And I've already told you I am a father. But here's the one thing my boys know.
 
Growing up the fricking barber had my permission to whip their assets. And not only that, when this stuff came up on TV, I pointed him. I said you don't have to worry about the law coming after your full extent because they took a life. [09:50:00]
 
But you all comprehending that, they took a life without thought they deserved the full extent of the law.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you come in contact with these teams before and seen the pictures? Are these mug shots from previous incidents?
 
WOODS: I personally have it. But have we?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
 
WOODS: Minimum contact, I can tell you right now. I know somebody over here had a question.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do I understand correctly that the three victims were an active part of crimes prior to their death with these three, is that correct?
 
WOODS: I don't want to give too much detailed information. OK. But let me put it this way. My dad was a fireman. Always said where there's smoke, there's fire. OK. Folks, don't ask dumbass questions. And Andy, I apologize. But really, they have to spell it out to you. What do you think they were doing? They were associated with a gang. And I've told somebody go on interviews.
 
Gangs don't go to church on Sunday and then preach the gospel for the next six days their gains because they commit crimes. How simple is this idea? Where are we losing in it? And I know we're going long but this is my press conference. Not yours?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.
 
WOODS: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --committing crimes. They're going to wind and - turned off the other three?
 
WOODS: I can't divulge that. I wish I could tell you. I'll tell you when we get this one. OK. I want to tell you everything. I really do. And since day one, I've wanted to tell you anything, they have had a leash on me like you wouldn't believe. Next, let's get somebody new.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We know the timeline of the three victims in terms of how they were shot. Was it all at once? And then -
 
WOODS: Hold back. You heard the bosses.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't have a representative where they hang out somewhere where how will you ever catch up?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The one subject on the previous photo, Rob Robinson was in custody already at the juvenile detention facility. And the Christopher Atkins the 12-year-old we've located him at his house yesterday after serving a search warrant.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, they weren't on anything. They seem surprised even see you show up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. They were very surprised. We showed up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you able to make any statements as to what they said?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll leave that to you sir.
 
WOODS: No, you'll get that eventually. We told you he was in DJJ. He was arrested by OPD the next morning after the murder.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For the document there?
 
WOODS: And a fray at the school. Oh, that's what I call a light bulb coming on right there. Remember, I just talked about minimizing and holding students accountable. Our school district not just here I'm not going to point out just mine. School districts across the state and across this nation need to quit minimizing the actions of their students. Hold them accountable. That's where the failure is.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we know where the last suspect was seen. WOODS: We're going to hold that one.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If all three guns or was it just one time? And which one pulled the trigger?
 
WOODS: All right. Some of that I'm not going to answer.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. WOODS: Some of it, I will. The one I will is, the two confess to shooting our third victim in the trump.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How many guns were involved?
 
WOODS: I'm not going to answer that one. I appreciate your questions. You wouldn't be doing your job if you didn't ask any others?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --third suspect was - worried about him?
 
WOODS: No, the community doesn't need to worry about. I'm outside of I want them to find them. That's what they need to worry about locating for me. And they do. If you ain't ever watched my - Wednesday, that's successful and they find them. I'll allow more time.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are these juveniles for students at the same school?
 
WOODS: No. All right, thank you!
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: All right. So, we have been watching this press conference from the Marion County Sheriff on the very latest arrests made. And a suspect they are still looking for in the murders of three teenagers in Marion County. A press conference announcing arrest but a press conference that you don't have the likes you don't often see.
 
Joining me right now is CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem. Juliet, the facts that came out, the facts that came out in this are two arrests they're juveniles, they have confessed to shooting at least one of the victims here, these teenagers, one juvenile suspect still on the run, they are still looking for him. And they are asking for the public's helping it. One of the kids that they have arrested is 12 years old.
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I know.
 
BOLDUAN: In this murder, and then these murders of these three teenagers. State's attorney is going to be determining the charges that they will be facing. That's the facts of what we're learning. But I have to say some, what's your reaction to the sheriff?
 
KAYYEM: I'll say it. That was the craziest most unhelpful press conference, I'm just, and I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of law enforcement press conferences with you over the years. It was defensive, it was personal. It was making legal representations that he that are going to hurt the prosecution in the future.
 
And I mean, it sounded like a political campaign. I'm just being honest; I've never heard anything like that before. There are three dead teenagers and three teenagers whose lives are essentially going to be in jail or even younger than teenagers. None of this, none of this is funny. None of this is about him.
 
None of this is, when you come and start a press conference and say this has nothing to do with guns, you've lost me. I mean, not because I want to have a debate about guns. But you've come into this discussion, already telling me it's all the kid's fault.
 
You know, I mean, whatever you want to call them, they are they are under 18. The law recognizes that is different. He was antagonistic towards the media antagonistic towards the school district because apparently.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, defending gun laws and pointing the finger at the school.
 
KAYYEM: Yes, at the schools.
 
BOLDUAN: To failing the whole juvenile accountable.
 
KAYYEM: I mean, let's just focus on the facts, because that's what not what was going on there. The facts are clearly this was a horrendous team killing. There's still one suspect at large. The atmospherics of what we saw, I think our you know, given the nature of elected law enforcement, given the nature that he may have political aspirations in the future, you just got to say it that that's it seemed like that was his opportunity. I know, they won't like me for it, but I thought it was whatever you think of the kids, they were in a gang, they are dead. And they and that's, you don't blame them. You don't call them bad people. I mean, it just was a, it was an odd one. And it's sort of a sad way to end in any tragedy.
 
BOLDUAN: It's a tragedy. And the tragedy continues to unfold as you talked about the mothers of the boys now under arrest and the fact that these mothers are at a loss of what they are now going through. But he started the press conference; one of the first things he said is that his emotions were all over the map.
 
And I was just wondering, what you see in why the sheriff was so weird, what the emotion was, because people were waiting for a major announcement, which you did eventually get to of the facts that what, a community was looking for answers for, because they have three dead teenagers. That was obviously very scary for families and people across that community.
 
KAYYEM: Yes, as you lead. I mean, if you're law enforcement, this is a law enforcement press conference. You lead with what people the community, not the media, not what the community wants to know, right? What happened? Could it happen to my kid? No, this is a particular type of situation where those kids were, were, I think stealing cars and other things, right?
 
They all knew each other. And if you want to make sure that there's not a team killer around the community, you lead with that. Look, he talked too much about himself, right, the emotions, you know, we all have emotions. Those of us in this field have emotions. It's not about us. It's not about us.
 
It's about the victims, the community, the parents, everyone and it was just a sort of unfortunate turn in a case that is relevant the case is now confined. That's good. It is not a teen killer -
 
BOLDUAN: That is one thing we learn about.
 
KAYYEM: Yes, this is not a teen killer. And there will be investigations. But you know, that was airtime for someone who ought to know better and didn't. And don't talk about your - I mean, we don't talk about our emotions. Just don't talk about it.
 
BOLDUAN: Stick with me, John. We're going to continue to follow this very closely.
 
BERMAN: Yes, Kate. We're going to try to dig into the facts of what we just learned this triple murder in Marion County Florida, there have now been two arrests that a suspect is still on the run.</pre>
