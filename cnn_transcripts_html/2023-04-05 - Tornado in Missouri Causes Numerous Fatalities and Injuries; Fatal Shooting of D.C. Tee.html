SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  New video for you now out of Missouri. It shows the destructive force of a large and extremely dangerous tornado that touched down there overnight. Now, officials say there are multiple fatalities and injuries. It's one of at least 10 tornadoes reported in three states now, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois.
 
We also heard reports of hail the size of grapefruits. The danger continues as severe weather threatens 85 million Americans nationwide as the storm system is now moving east. John
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right, Sara.
 
This morning, the FBI and DOJ have opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal police shooting of a 17-year-old. Dalaneo Martin was fatally shot by a U.S. Park Police officer last month. Officials have now released the body camera video of that encounter, and I do want to give you a warning, this video can be hard to watch.
 
Police say the vehicle you see here was believed to be stolen. Inside was 17-year-old Dalaneo Martin. Police say, he was asleep in the parked car. The video shows the police discussing ways to get into the car to arrest him. At one point, an officer opens the back door to get in, while another officer opens the front driver door. The footage shows the car suddenly drive off, and one of the Park Police officers is still in the backseat of the car and yells for him to stop. There is a tussle. And then this.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Police. Don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop. Stop, man. Just let me out. Let me out. Stop. Stop or I'll shoot.

BERMAN:  This is the point when the video shows the officer fired several shots. Seconds later, the car crashes into a nearby home. Police later pulled Martin out to try and revive him with CPR. They were unsuccessful. Police say, he died at the scene. The Park Police says, there is an investigation into this incident that is being handled by the Metropolitan Police Department and being reviewed by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C.
 
CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem is with me now. And Juliette, whenever we have an incident like this, the key question is reasonable use of force. How is that determined with something like this?
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  So, it's going to be the circumstances of what happened in the car. So, here are aspects of this that I don't quite understand. It's daytime. The car is surrounded. The driver is asleep. How many attempts are made to wake him and then essentially ensure that he does no harm?
 
Once they're in the car, then the other question is, why were they able to do -- the one thing you'd want to do when you're in the car is ensure that it does not move. Once the car is moving, they've lost control of the situation. So, there are legitimate questions to be raised.
 
On the counter to this, they -- maybe they did try to wake him in the in the moments before and we were -- we are not privy to what that was, and he may not have been responsive. And then it is clear that when the accident occurs, they do try to revive him.
 
So, this is not your typical case of police brutality essentially, you know, trying to kill an unarmed passenger or -- there are enough questions about this case and certainly about jurisdiction. What did the Metropolitan Police Department do? Why were the Park Police in the situation they were in that is worthy of investigation at this stage.
 
BERMAN:  You know, you bring up jurisdiction is interesting. There is a young man who has died here so it can seem cold to talk about jurisdictional issues. But in Washington, D.C. these matters and it does raise important questions there.
 
KAYYEM:  It absolutely does. I mean, we saw -- we -- there are very different circumstances. January 6th, Lafayette Park, you know D.C. because of its territorial status does not have -- has a very different jurisdictional structure. Why does that matter to the average citizen? Because this does sound a little bit cold when we're talking about unarmed and dead teenager is who is investigating it, and then what legal authorities would apply?
 
So, D.C. under protocol, I should say, the Metropolitan Police Department have a lead here. So, they will be investigating this case, even though it involves the Park Police. The U.S. attorney's office, the federal jurisdiction, what we view that and determine whether there should be intervening federal charges. So, it's very complicated for citizens of D.C. What I'd have to say is, there's a lot of training between the state, the local -- or I should, say D.C. and federal agencies. But it does matter who in fact fired the shot.
 
The police -- Park Police are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Interior, this is a lot of governmental boxes at play now, and those officers are now under protocol are now on leave simply because this is rare. I looked it up before I went on air. I think the last time there was a Park Police shooting of a civilian was over 60 years ago at this stage.
 
BERMAN:  Juliette, the civil rights investigation, what exactly does that mean and what would have to be proven there.
 
KAYYEM:  So, you'd have to prove intent at this stage. I mean, they're both -- this would be the federal civil rights claim that would give the U.S. attorney's office and then, of course, the FBI jurisdiction that intent. So, the race of the passenger whether that played into how the police reacted to the situation. So, as I said at the beginning, you -- police are trained to deescalate.
 
So, I never quite understand why, you know, why people say, well, the police were in an unusual situation. That is what police are trained for. And this seems semi-unusual, but it is daytime, the passenger -- the driver is asleep.
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
So, there's enough questions is whether the intent because of the race of the passenger, because of things that we haven't seen on -- not on the video that haven't been disclosed in the video would rise to a civil rights case. This would then make it, give it federal jurisdiction. And a lot of that will be what were the atmospherics surrounding the car?
 
Again, I -- daytime is a factor here. And I think it's going to require the Metropolitan Police Department and the Park Police to explain how did the situation that was relatively peaceful escalate. And remember, there could have been people harmed in the home that the car went into. So, there's a lot of explanation needed here.
 
BERMAN:  Important questions, Juliette. Thank you so much for helping us understand the important ones.
 
Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Thanks, John.
 
The Nashville officers who heroically stopped a school shooter, they're speaking out. Hear them in their own words, how they described what they saw when they entered that school that day.
 
And new jobs numbers just out this morning, lower the next -- lower than expected. So, what does that mean for the Fed's fight against inflation now? That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
SIDNER:  New economic numbers for you this morning. U.S. employers, as you probably have already seen, are scaling back on hiring as the economy slows and borrowing costs continued to go up, that is, according to the latest monthly report from Payroll Processor, ADP. The private sector added 145,000 jobs, which is a considerable retreat from February's upwardly revised monthly job gain of 261,000.
 
CNN's Rahel Solomon is here with us to break down this new report. So, thank you so much for being here. Can you first walk us through the numbers that we're getting?
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good to be with you, Sara.
 
So, let's start at the top. 145,000 jobs being added in the month of March, annual pay increasing by about seven percent. I should say that both of these are declines. And what this really signifies is an economy that is slowing but normalizing after years of really strong growth in the labor market.
 
Let's take a look at sectors in terms of where we're seeing jobs being lost and where we're seeing jobs being added. So, we look at jobs being lost, manufacturing, financial activities, professional and businesses are all losing jobs. But on the other hand, look at the industries that are still really adding jobs, leisure and hospitality, almost 100,000 jobs there.
 
SIDNER:  Wow.
 
SOLOMON:  Construction 53,000 jobs. And I should say that the bulk of almost all of these jobs with the exception of about 10,000 are small and medium sized firms.
 
SIDNER:  Now, you ended up speaking to ADP's chief economist. What did she tell you?
 
SOLOMON:  Yes, Nela Richardson. And so, you know, what's interesting because every day it seems like we're hearing about layoffs, right? So, how do we square that with what we're actually seeing in the data? And she said, look, these are small firms that are finally being able to compete in terms of getting workers. She told me in part, small firms create the bulk of net new jobs in an economy. Adding, they are the engine of growth for the labor market. And they are finally now getting some room to groove in terms of hiring.
 
So, this is the type of report that the Fed wants to see and also the type of report that small businesses like to see.
 
SIDNER:  You don't often hear a chief economist saying, groove.
 
SOLOMON:  I know, right?
 
SIDNER:  Let's get into the groove. So happy that you're here, Rahel. Thank you.
 
John.
 
BERMAN:  All right, Sara. Artificial intelligence, does it intrigue you or terrify you? New safeguards just proposed by the White House.
 
And Tiger Woods causes a new frenzy of speculation. Could this be his final Masters?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
BOLDUAN:  The wait is almost over, friends, or at least Masters' fans. Tomorrow is finally the start of all the action in Augusta. And Tiger Woods is now opening up about his game right now and also what the future may hold for him. CNN's Don Riddell is live in Augusta.
 
And Don, it was your conversation, your question to him, that really brought this out. What did Tiger say?
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, WORLD SPORT:  Yes, it was really interesting, Kate. You know, of course, everybody wants to know what his game is like. He says, his game is better than it was last year. He says, his endurance is better than it was last year, where he was only just a year after that devastating car accident that could have cost him his leg. But I put the question to him about the future, and it got a really, really interesting response that really captured everybody's attention.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL:  When you're playing this course, does it ever cross your mind, this could be the last time?
 
TIGER WOODS, 5-TIME MASTERS CHAMPION:  Yes, it has. I didn't know -- I mean, last year was kind of -- I didn't know if I was going to play again at that time. For some reason, everything kind of came together and I kind of pushed a little bit. I was able to make the cut, which is nice. And, yes, I don't know how many more I have in me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL:  So, there you go, Kate. Enjoy it while it lasts. This is his 25th Masters. His fans are still hoping he can do something special. He hasn't missed the cut since the mid-90s. So, hopefully, he'll be around for four full rounds. But we're not really going to know what state he's in until he gets going on Thursday.
 
BOLDUAN:  25th masters is just mind-boggling in and of itself to think of that and just how long he has been in the game and on top of his game. Before all the magic happens tomorrow, you have the Par 3 contest that's going to take place this afternoon. What should we be expecting with this?
 
RIDDELL:  Well, it's always fun. This is one of the great traditions in sport. Of course, they have the Champion's Dinner on Tuesday night, the Par 3 competition on Wednesday, and it's just such a fun event. It's an opportunity really for the golfers to get out there and share the event and the day with their families. And a lot of the top players like -- right now, like, Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, they've all got young kids. And so, I think it's going to be a lot of fun to see them out there.
 
But here's something you should know. No winner of the Par 3 has ever gone on to win the Masters on Sunday. So, anybody who's playing well expect them to suddenly not be playing well at the end, because none of them really want to win it.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
BOLDUAN:  This is definitely what the one golf contest you want to throw, the Par 3 contest, if you want to have a chance.
 
RIDDELL:  Yes.
 
BOLDUAN:  Good knowledge is always, Don. It's good to see you. Thank you.
 
So, I won't admit it to Don Riddell because he's just so much fun. I will admit it to you. I know little about the Masters or golf, but we do know that when it comes to Tiger Woods, it's always news.
 
SIDNER:  I played. I'm terrible. I'm garbage, So -- 
 
BOLDUAN:  Well -- I'll -- 
 
SIDNER:  -- we'll just pay attention to Tiger.
 
BOLDUAN:  There we go.
 
SIDNER:  Coming up. We're now learning just how many prominent "Fox News" TV personalities are going to be testifying in that $1.6 billion defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.
 
Also, multiple people killed this morning in Missouri as violent tornadoes trekked through the Midwest, where the storm is headed next.
