JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, I'm John Vause, ahead on CNN Newsroom.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. FARHAN ABDELAZIZ, EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN: The situation here is intense. It's catastrophic.
 
VAUSE: And it's getting worse. Even as more aid trucks are allowed to cross into Gaza, Human Rights Watch alleges children are dying because of Israeli starvation tactics.
 
KATIE HOBBS, ARIZONA GOVERNOR: And now we're talking about whether or not we should put that doctor in jail.
 
VAUSE: Just like they did in Arizona way back in 1864, when a near total abortion ban was in effect, because now that law is once again enforceable.
 
ANNE MAHRER, CO-PRESIDENT, KLIMASENIORINNEN: The court has recognized us and our fundamental right to a healthy climate.
 
VAUSE: And Switzerland found guilty of violating human rights for not doing enough to stop climate change, a landmark ruling with sweeping consequences.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: U.S. President Joe Biden has delivered his sharpest rebuke yet to the Israeli Prime Minister and how he's conducted the war in Gaza. During an interview with Univision, President Biden was blunt, saying he disagrees with Netanyahu's approach and called for an immediate weeks-long humanitarian ceasefire.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I think what he's doing is a mistake. I don't agree with his approach. I think it's outrageous. So what I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks total access to all food and medicine going into the country. And I think there's no excuse to not provide for the medical and the food needs of those people. They should be done. They should be done now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: The biggest disagreement right now between both leaders is a looming Israeli offensive on the southern border city of Rafah, now home to almost one and a half million Palestinians. Netanyahu is under immense pressure from within his far-right coalition government. A number of senior cabinet ministers are demanding a ground invasion go ahead, targeting the last Hamas fighters and infrastructure in Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (through translator): We will complete the elimination of the Hamas battalions, including in Rafah. There is no force in the world that will stop us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: That, according to senior White House officials, is little more than bravado from Netanyahu, and they doubt that a date has been set for the Rafah offensive. And in northern Gaza, bodies are being exhumed from mass graves around the Al Shifa hospital. A warning now. Some of the images you're about to see are graphic.
 
Officials say the remains of nearly 400 people have been recovered from the vicinity of the complex since Israeli forces withdrew on April 1st after a terrorist attack. Some of the bodies have been crushed by tanks, making identification difficult. Other hospitals in Gaza are now struggling to keep the patients alive and keep the lights on. CNN's Paula Hancocks reports now on the ongoing suffering.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): A nine- year-old girl cries out, it hurts, it hurts. The doctor holds her hand as she lies on the floor and tells her it's going to be okay. There's no pain medication for her burns and shrapnel wounds. He tells her to pray.
 
Nearby, another doctor tries to save one of his own, performing CPR on a paramedic who was injured by Israeli artillery fire. His heart eventually restarts, one life saved amid so much loss. His longer-term chances of survival in a decimated medical system are unclear. These doctors are American, volunteers on a World Health Organization- coordinated mission to the north of Gaza, desperate to help in an ever more helpless crisis.
 
ABDELAZIZ: The situation here is intense, it's catastrophic. I realize words are hard to describe what we're seeing. I mean, you're talking about mass casualty events where people are coming in with limited staff, limited overworked staff, hungry staff, all working, who've been displaced from homes, and they're sitting here in the ER trying to do the best they can.
 
HANCOCKS (voiceover): This is Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north, one of the few hospitals still open, although barely functional.
 <br>[00:05:09]
 
DR. SAMER ATTAR, ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON: This morning we woke up and found out that four patients died in the ICU. One of them was about 10 years old and the mom just refused to leave the child's bedside, refused to believe that the child was dead, refused to let the staff cover her up. The child died of malnutrition and dehydration.
 
HANCOCK (voiceover): Patients here lie on the floor in their own blood. Electricity relies on solar panels. The fuel ran out some time ago. The hospital's director says volunteer specialists travelling into Gaza are a massive help amid a shrinking medical staff. Close to 500 medical personnel have been killed since October 7th. Nearly 300 others have been detained by the Israeli military, according to Gaza health authorities. A UN-backed report had warned famine could hit northern Gaza any time between now and May. Under U.S. pressure, the Israeli government announced last week it would reopen the Erez crossing to allow humanitarian goods to reach the area. Those plans have since been delayed, according to an Israeli official, shattering what was a small but needed glimmer of hope. 
 
ATTAR: These people, they just need help. They just want this to stop. Nobody talks. Nobody discusses politics here. They just talk about food and water and shelter and they just want the war to end.
 
HANCOCKS (voiceover): As the war enters its seventh month, the injured must be wondering if anyone is hearing their cries for help. Paula Hancock's CNN, Abu Dhabi.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: A ruling by Arizona's Supreme Court has turned the clock back to 1864. A 160-year-old law banning all abortion except to save the mother's life is now once again enforceable. CNN's Brian Todd has more on this historic ruling.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOBBS: It is a dark day in Arizona.
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Arizona's Supreme Court ruling that the state must enforce a near total ban on all abortions. The controversial law which dates back to the Civil War before Arizona even became a state. The court saying, quote, physicians are now on notice that all abortions except those necessary to save a woman's life are illegal. Abortion providers could face a prison sentence of two to five years.
 
HOBBS: The near total Civil War era ban that continues to hang over our heads only serves to create more chaos for women and doctors in our state.
 
TODD (voiceover): The Arizona law is on hold for two weeks while a lower court hears arguments on its constitutionality. And Arizona's Attorney General Chris Mays, a Democrat, says that at least while she's in office, no woman or doctor will be prosecuted under this law by the state. President Biden calls the new ban cruel and Vice President Kamala Harris said this on X.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: To stop bans like this, we need a United States Congress that will restore the protections of Roe v. Wade. And when they do, President Joe Biden will sign it into law. And let's always remember, it does not have to be this way.
 
TODD (voiceover): Opponents of abortion are applauding the Arizona ruling. The group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America in a statement saying, quote, we celebrate this enormous victory for unborn children and their mothers and claiming the ruling, quote, will protect more than 11000 babies annually. This comes just one day after former President Donald Trump announced his campaign position on abortion, declining to support a federal nationwide ban on abortions, saying it should be left up to states. 
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people. 
 
TODD (voiceover): And it all comes on the heels of a controversial ruling in Florida's Supreme Court last week that allowed a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy to take effect next month. Florida's high court did allow a proposed constitutional amendment that would establish the right to an abortion to go on the ballot this November. To the delight of abortion rights activists, who pushed for that. 
 
LAUREN BRENZEL, DIRECTOR, YES ON 4: What it does is remove politicians ability to interfere with her private medical decisions. Florida is one of several states where abortion will or may be on the ballot in November when voters will decide whether to guarantee the right to an abortion in their state's constitutions.
 
AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, "WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY" &amp; "UP FIRST" PODCAST: You're seeing all of this turmoil where people don't know from day to day what is going to be the law in their state, what happens if they get pregnant and they want to terminate the pregnancy.
 
TODD: Many abortion rights activists still have their sights set on a longer term strategy to restore federally approved access to abortion. But even they realize it won't happen soon. One leader of Planned Parenthood saying it could take decades. So for now, their strategy is focused on going state by state to protect and maybe even expand in some cases access to abortion. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

VAUSE: For the first time, the parents of a school shooter in the United States have been held accountable for their child's actions. A court in Michigan sentenced James and Jennifer Crumbley to 10 to 15 years in prison, ruling they are criminally responsible for a mass shooting committed by their son. The Crumbleys were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year. 
 <br>[00:10:29]
 
Prosecutors argued they were grossly negligent in allowing their teenage son to have access to a gun and ignoring signs of his spiraling mental health. Before they were sentenced the parents apologized to the families of their son's victims.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENNIFER CRUMBLEY, MOTHER OF MASS SHOOTER ETHAN CRUMBLEY: To the victims and the families I stand today not to ask for your forgiveness as I know it may be beyond reach but to express my sincerest apologies for the pain that has been caused. 
 
JAMES CRUMBLEY, FATHER OF MASS SHOOTER ETHAN CRUMBLEY: As a parent our biggest fear is losing our child. My heart is really broken for everybody involved. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: His son is currently serving a life sentence without parole for killing four students ruining six others and a teacher when he opened fire at Oxford High School in 2021. He did not testify at his parents trials. A landmark ruling. The European Court of Human Rights has found Switzerland violated human rights by failing to adequately address climate change. It's the first time the court has ruled on climate matters. The case was brought by more than 2 000 swiss women most in their 70s who claimed heat waves were harming their health and quality of life. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAHRER (through translator): We can be very proud we the elderly to have brought to the court for the first time the issue of climate and fundamental rights and the court has recognized us and our fundamental right to a healthy climate and that our country should do what it has not done until now meaning to take ambitious measures to protect our health and protect the future for all of us
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: There's no right of appeal and the court and the judgment is legally binding which means Switzerland may have to address its fossil fuel usage more quickly than planned. The ruling could also set a precedent for similar claims in other international courts to other climate cases. Before the court of human rights were both ruled inadmissible each for different reasons but that that was the big one, and CNN's Clare Sebastian has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the fact that three cases claiming government-alleged inaction on climate change violates people's human rights made it to the European Court of Human Rights in the first place was already groundbreaking. But the fact that one of the cases was partially successful is another major milestone for climate activists. 
 
It explicitly links national climate change policies with the state's duty to protect the human rights of its citizens, and it bolsters, of course, the body of proof that litigation can be an effective tool alongside global treaties to force governments to do more to stop global warming. Experts and activists say this will open the floodgates to more cases in Europe and globally where there is a growing trend of human rights cases being brought over climate change. That, a view shared by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.
 
GRETA THUNBERG, CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVIST: This is only the beginning of climate litigation. All over the world, more and more people are taking their taking their government to court, holding them responsible for their actions. And the results of this can mean in no way that we lean back. This means that we have to fight even more since this is only the beginning.
 
SEBASTIAN: Well, the two other cases, including one attempting to force 32 countries to do more to prevent global warming, were dismissed for technical reasons. But the court's ruling in the Swiss case is binding, with no option to appeal. Switzerland will now be compelled to act, including possibly reducing its green house gas consumption. The Swiss government says it's analyzing the judgment and the, quote, measures Switzerland has to take for the future. Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.

VAUSE: Still to come here on CNN, in southern Russia, tens of thousands forced from their homes after a major dam burst causing widespread flooding.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:15:19]
 
VAUSE: Flooding from a burst dam has forced more than 100,000 people from their homes along the Russia-Kazakhstan border. And CNNs Isa Soares reports, anger is mounting over a poor government response.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Catastrophic flooding and thousands of lives are pended across several regions in Russia. Forcing many to evacuate with just their pets and a handful of belongings. At least three people are reported to have died so far. Authorities declared a state of emergency in the Orenburg region near Kazakhstan. 
 
After the Ural, Europe's third longest river, swelled several meters and burst through a dam embankment in Oursk, a city of more than 200,000 residents. The anger there was palpable on Monday, with protesters chanting shame on you at local officials and Putin help over the government's response. No one is helping us here, a man in this crowd shouts. The state is doing nothing he says. The city mayors said the flood has now peaked, according to Russian state news agency TASS.
 
And the Kremlin spokesperson described the deluge in these regions as inevitable, due to an abnormal increase in water levels. Dmitry Peskov also said that President Vladimir Putin is currently not planning on visiting the affected areas.  Across the border, in Kazakhstan, the country's president said the floods were his country's worst natural disaster in decades. In Russia, the country's emergency situations minister flew over some of the flooded zones on Tuesday to inspect the damage. And over in the Kurgan region, melting ice and torrential rains caused another river to overflow. 
 
This is not a joke, the regional governor says bluntly. Leave, take your papers, valuables, children, elderly relatives with limited mobility, you need to do this now, he says. Floodwaters in Kurgan are expected to rise even higher over the next 48 hours, putting thousands more lives at risk and wreaking even more havoc. Iza Suarez, CNN, London.

VAUSE: Water rationing begins Thursday in Colombia's capital Bogota. According to the city's mayor, reservoirs are at historically low levels. And you know, weather patterns since last July have made it hotter, contributing to droughts and forest fires across the country. Hospitals and schools will have contingency plans in place to ensure they don't run dry. The mayor, though, is calling on residents to be vigilant. Don't waste a drop.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CARLOS GALAN, BOGOTA, COLOMBIA MAYOR (through translator): The Chingaza system is below all the projections that were expected for this year and the next one. This forces us to take measures to reduce water consumption. We will do and sustain this. We will do this through changes in behavior and restrictions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Jeff Hoffman is the lead freshwater scientist globally for the World Wildlife Fund. He joins us now from Chagrin Falls in Ohio. Thanks for being with us.
 
JEFF OPPERMAN, GLOBAL LEAD FRESHWATER SCIENTIST, WORLD WILDLIFE FUND: Yeah, thanks very much. Nice to be here.
 
VAUSE: Okay, so we'll start with the water shortage in Bogota. And once again, let's listen to the city's mayor.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GALAN (through translator): We have to continue advancing and reducing water consumption. And we will do it. We will maintain efforts and multiply them. But even reducing water consumption will not be enough due to the crisis we are experiencing in the reservoirs.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: That seems to be a fairly candid assessment by the mayor that reducing consumption alone won't solve this problem. So what are the other options here? And how serious is this crisis for Bogota?
 
OPPERMAN: Well, it's very serious. The reservoir system that has the water supply has dropped below 20% of capacity. It's the lowest it's been in 40 years. 
 <br>[00:20:09]
 
And this is a city for 9 million people that has begun water rationing. So that's a very real thing when people begin to, you know, turn on the tap and there's not water for parts of the day. And, you know, this is coming at a time when there's been 500 forest fires across Columbia. This is, you know, being driven by El Nino and climate change. So it is a really major challenge and reducing water consumption is clearly a big part of it, a big part of the solution, but really a solution this challenging is going to require many, many different solutions working together.
 
VAUSE: And just in the past few weeks alone, if we look at the global picture, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe have issued some kind of drought emergency and are asking for assistance. Johannesburg, the biggest city in South Africa, taps are running dry on a daily basis there. Mexico City, home to more than 22 million people could run out of water within months. You know, that's just a small sample. Water restrictions during a dry spell are not new, but it seems those days are long gone. Severe water shortages now happening more and more often, usually with greater severity and El Nino is not helping, but what are the big drivers here? What's causing this?
 
OPPERMAN: Well, so yeah, El Nino is layered on top of climate change, which has been shifting precipitation patterns. One thing that scientists have been predicting for a long time with climate change, there's a lot of uncertainty. There's certainty that the temperatures are rising, but there's a lot of uncertainty about precipitation. But in general, people think that the hydrological cycle is getting accelerated. It's becoming more flashy, meaning the periods of flood are becoming wetter and more intense, and the periods of drought are becoming longer and more severe. So these things, so essentially it's an intensification of the hydrological cycle. And so, yeah, we are seeing more severe flooding. We are seeing more severe and intense droughts.
 
Sometimes the same regions are ping-ponging back and forth between those. And remarkably, you listed a number of cities, but in the past two years, 1.4 billion people experienced drought. And so that's a huge number. And even more remarkably, almost half the world's population in the past few years have encountered or been affected by some level of water scarcity. So this is we're hearing about these cities, these very high-profile cities, but it's actually quite a global challenge. VAUSE: And as for the consequences here, a UN report was pretty blunt. Here's the headline, water crisis threatens world peace. You know, the bottom line is unless we do something about our dwindling water supplies, you know, then global issues like war and agriculture and migration will only get worse. So what needs to be done? And are we anywhere close to actually doing it?
 
OPPERMAN: Well, you know, what this really brings up, there's this, this very famous phrase that says, if climate change is a shark, then water is its teeth. Meaning the way most people are going to experience the disturbances that come with climate change will be through floods, droughts, and other issues. And really, nothing underscores how important water is than when there is, when there are water crises. Because water crises very much become food crises because water is so fundamental to growing food. So a climate problem becomes a water problem, becomes a food problem. It becomes, water problems become energy problems. There are parts of Africa that rely on hydropower and those reservoirs are so drained, Zambia and Zimbabwe, for example, that they're having to do energy rationing. So we've got water rationing in Bogota, energy rationing, and it's all being driven by, by this water scarcity.
 
VAUSE: Jeff, thank you for being with us. It is a big picture story and something, some very sort of difficult to wrap your head around when you think about one point something billion people going without water on a regular basis. But yeah, thanks for being with us. And thanks for explaining it.
 
OPPERMAN: Great. Thanks a lot.
 
VAUSE: When we come back here on CNN, a CNN investigation casting doubt on Israel's version of events when dozens were killed while lining up for food assistance in Gaza City in February. Details in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:25:09]
 
VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone. I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN Newsroom. It's been just over a month since one of the deadliest single moments of the war in Gaza, when dozens were killed while waiting for food assistance. A warning some of the images are about to see are disturbing. At the time, the Israeli military claimed its tanks fired warning shots into the air to try and disperse the crowd after seeing people were being forced to turn around. trampled. Some were being run down by aid trucks. Gaza's health ministry says more than 100 Palestinians were killed. Hundreds more were injured. However, a CNN analysis of videos, interviews and eyewitness testimony cast doubt on Israel's version of events. And CNN's Katie Polglase has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KATIE POLGLASE, INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCTER  (voice-over): It's early morning on February 29th on Al Rashid Road in northern Gaza. Thousands of starving people have gathered here to receive food. But as the aid trucks arrive, this happens. The night would become known as the Flower Massacre. By morning, over 100 would be dead in one of the single biggest mass casualty events of this conflict. CNN investigated this incident, obtaining never seen before videos of that night, collecting evidence from 22 eyewitnesses and tracing the aid itself all the way to a Muslim charity in the UK. It was the IDF that was then responsible for safely delivering these vital supplies. But we found they opened fire on unarmed starving Palestinians at close range as the aid arrived.
 
Their explanation for the tragedy using this drone video was a stampede that caused soldiers to fire warning shots in the air. They later admitted to firing some shots directly at so-called suspects who approached them. But the IDF footage is incomplete. It cuts between crowds surrounding the truck. The IDF footage shows the truck and bodies lying on the ground. Even this reveals they were firing in a densely packed area, likely to cause severe bloodshed. CNN requested the full footage from the IDF, but it was denied. Jihad Abu Watfa  was amongst the starving Palestinians and started filming as the trucks crossed into northern Gaza.
 
JIHAD ABU WATFA, EYEWITNESS (through translator): We decided to face the danger, to risk our lives to obtain any piece of bread for our families. 
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): Videos from Jihad and another key eyewitness, Balal, indicate the gunfire started earlier than the IDF claimed. The IDF published this timeline saying the trucks arrived at the checkpoint at 4am. They then crossed at 4.29 and only after that did the IDF fire shots at the crowd. But in Balal's video, filmed seven minutes earlier, at 4.22am, gunshots ring out. He warns there was a tank.
 
The IDF claimed the convoy was still stationary at the checkpoint at this time. Next Jihad begins filming. It's now 4.28am and there's a barrage of gunfire and the shots are close. Analysis by weapons experts of the bursts indicate it is heavy automatic gunfire at 600 rounds per minute. Jihad keeps filming. A tank is beside me. We're now under siege he says. 
 <br>[00:30:10]
 
Moments later, you see a truck driving along the road. We spotted traces from the gunfire here.
 
One could be seen ricocheting up here, according to weapons experts.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
GRAPHIC: The feeling was totally indescribable, fear, confusion. You fear, God forbid, going back to your family as a martyr.
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): As day broke the number of dead and injured that merged was staggering. Interviews with survivors at hospitals afterwards found some people had been shot in the upper body.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
GRAPHIC: Where were you injured?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
GRAPHIC: In my chest, and it went out through my back.
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): Amid the devastation, CNN found a clue as to who had delivered this aid, this box with the writing, Ummah Welfare Trust. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was the first time that it had reached Northern Gaza. And we were very, very excited and happy that, finally, we have gone through. 
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): They received the terrible news as to what had happened via WhatsApp.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I woke up to some photos with cardboard boxes of our logo with bloodstains on them. And it came as a shock. 
 
This is the first time in 20 years where I've actually seen blood being mixed with aid.
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): In all, at least 118 died that day. With the U.N. struggling to access Northern Gaza, the IDF are responsible for ensuring aid arrives safely. 
 
Despite this, the U.N. has documented two dozen attacks on Palestinians awaiting aid in the last three months alone. 
 
For those like Gehad (ph), living on the verge of famine, it has led to a desperate fight for survival. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
GRAPHIC: I must get food for myself and my children.
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): And now that fight becomes more challenging than ever. 
 
Katie Polglase, CNN, London.

VAUSE: We have this note: CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment of these findings. We're awaiting a response. 
 
OK, a short break here. Back in a moment. You're watching CNN.

VAUSE: To Chicago now. The chaos and mayhem at a deadly traffic stop, all recorded by police body cameras. In less than a minute, police opened fire with 96 shots.
 
A preliminary investigation suggests 26-year-old Dexter Reed opened fire on police first, but questions remain as to why the plainclothes officers stopped him in the first place. 
 
CNN's Omar Jimenez has details and a warning. This report contains some disturbing images.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): March 21, 2024, Chicago police are initiating a traffic stop on a driver, reportedly for not wearing a seat belt, according to the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, a traffic stop being conducted by five tactical officers. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Roll the window down.
 
What are you doing? 
 
Roll that one down, too. 
 
Hey, don't roll the window up. Don't roll the window up. Do not roll the window up. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Unlock the doors now.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): The temperature quickly escalates. 
 
One officer puts what appears to be his gun on the windshield. Reed then fires first, hitting an officer in the forearm, according to the initial investigation. Then, chaos.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shots fired! Shots fired! 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I see his gun!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shots fired!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shots fired!
 
(GUNFIRE)
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): Reed goes down.
 
Then three final gunshots, 96 in total, according to investigators. A gun was later recovered from the front seat of Reed's car.
 
Porscha Banks had just been on the phone with her brother in the minutes before it all happened. Then she turned on a police scanner at her shop. 
 
PORSCHA BANKS, DEXTER REED'S SISTER: We're listening to the police talking, like saying, "Shots fired." But I can hear all the shots from the scanner. I got to hear so many shots, so many shots, so many shots. But didn't know that it was my brother. So then to know, later on that night that those shots that I heard,
 
 and then the ambulance going past my shop was my brother, was the most heartbreaking thing that I could have ever felt in my life. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): One of the family's attorneys argues this never should have happened in the first place. 
 
ANDREW M. STROTH, ATTORNEY FOR DEXTER REED'S FAMILY: There was a weapon recovered in his car. However, it started with an unconstitutional, pretextual, and unnecessary stop of Dexter Reed, and that's what precipitated the entire incident. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): And questions remain over why tactical officers initiated a traffic stop for a supposed seat belt violation. 
 
As part of a brief statement, Chicago Police says this incident is still under investigation, but the stop is where it all began. 
 
ROOSEVELT R. BANKS III, UNCLE OF DEXTER REED: If you don't stop my nephew, he'll be alive today.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): Reed's uncle sitting alongside his father.
 
R. BANKS: When this happened to my nephew, I hope the police can understand that this is the same pain that they feel when an officer is killed in the line of duty. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): It's a pain that manifests in memories and pain that manifests in despair. 
 
NICOLE BANKS, MOTHER OF DEXTER REED: They took my son away from me. He ain't got that on no one and called no one out.
 
P. BANKS: And I just wish that I could talk to him. But to see him gunned down, I never ever thought that it'd be him. I never thought that it would be him. I've never thought that it would be him.
 
JIMENEZ: Just hearing the amount of shots is incredibly difficult for anyone, but especially this family. And that's a lot of what we talked about. 
 
They're dealing with pain on the inside. But from the outside, looking in, initial reports do indicate that Reed did fire first. So the initial response from police is less of what's in question here. 
 
What's in question is why this traffic stop happened in the first place, and why the shots continued in the way that they did. 
 
The Office of Police Accountability has recommended that the police department relieve these officers of their police powers while this investigation plays out. And it's an investigation the police department says they are fully cooperating with.

Trump's lawyers made the request to challenge a gag order, which prevented the former president from publicly commenting on witnesses, as well as court workers.

Judge Juan Merchan later expanded that order to cover his own family after Trump made unfounded allegations about the judge's daughter on social media.
 
In the coming hours, White House will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on an official state visit. Fumio Kishida. 
 
U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden literally rolled out the red carpet for Mr. and Mrs. Kishida on Tuesday. But official talks won't start until Wednesday.
 
CNN's Hanako Montgomery has details on the agenda.

HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. President Joe Biden explored how the two countries could further develop their business relations, with a specific focus on critical and emerging --
 
MONTGOMERY: -- technology. We saw the tech company Microsoft announce it would invest 2.9 billion U.S. dollars over two years, focusing on its cloud and A.I. development in Japan, making this Microsoft's largest investment in Japan in the 46 years it's been operational in the country. 
 
Now, this investment would also help open its first Microsoft research Asia lab in Tokyo and further cybersecurity collaboration with the Japanese government. 
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Now, on Wednesday, according to a senior U.S. government official I spoke with, we can expect Kishida and Biden to announce a joint defense council which would explore further military exports. 
 
We've already seen Japan agree to send U.S.-designed Patriot missiles to the United States that were made in Japan. So this would be an expansion of such efforts. 
 
MONTGOMERY: Now, the government official I spoke with also said we can expect Kishida and Biden to announce a joint operations command in Japan, which is a move that the U.S. government has long pursued.
 
Right now, joint operations of U.S. personnel in Japan are directed by INDOPACOM, which is headquartered in Hawaii. So according to the experts I've spoken with, this would be much easier to coordinate military operations in real time.
