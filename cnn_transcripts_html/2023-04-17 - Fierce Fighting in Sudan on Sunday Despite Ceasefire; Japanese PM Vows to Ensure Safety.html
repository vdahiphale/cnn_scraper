MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome. Coming to you live from Studio Four at the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company.
 <br>[00:00:36]
 
Coming up here on CNN NEWSROOM, conflict in Sudan. Despite a ceasefire agreement, the death toll rising as fighting between the army and a paramilitary group intensifies. 
 
The Japanese prime minister reassuring G-7 leaders about security in his country just days after being the target of an attack. We're live for you in Tokyo. 
 
And the rise of renewable energy. As the use of solar and wind power hit record levels last year, a new study suggests we could be seeing the beginning of the end of fossil fuels. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Michael Holmes. 
 
HOLMES: And we begin in Sudan, where a temporary ceasefire agreement failed to stop fierce fighting Sunday between the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group and the country's army. 
 
The death toll among civilians has risen to at least 97, according to a Sudanese doctors' union. The World Health Organization says more than 1,100 have been injured. 
 
Witnesses tell CNN they heard continuing exchanges of gunfire Sunday, despite the U.N.-brokered three-hour ceasefire that was negotiated to address urgent humanitarian needs. 
 
The sudden eruption of fighting on Saturday forced shops to close without notice and left many people with no time to stock up or prepare. There are reports of water and power cuts and shortages of fuel, food and medical care. 
 
Sudan's former prime minister called for both sides to step back from the conflict before the country returns to full-on civil war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDALLA HAMDOK, FORMER SUDANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): That is why we demand for an immediate ceasefire and to reach agreements that will lead to a permanent end of hostility. We need to at least reach a truce that will lead to establishing a humanitarian corridor. That will allow civilians to have access to medicine, treatment and food.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: The leader of the RSF accuses Sudan's army of breaking the temporary ceasefire. CNN cannot independently verify that claim, but our Larry Madowo spoke by phone with the leader of the paramilitaries. Here's part of their conversation and more on what is driving the conflict. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two generals at war. Since Saturday, the forces of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as a Rapid Support Forces, paramilitary group, or RSF, have been locked in battle with the Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan. 
 
The fighting comes as Sudan tries to finalize a deal to return to civilian rule after two military coups in recent years, which temporarily united the army and the RSF.
 
In a phone interview, Dagalo, who is better known as Hemetti, told me ruling Sudan isn't his endgame. 
 
MADOWO: What do you personally want from this situation, General Hamdan? Do you want to lead the army? Do you want to be the chief? 
 
GEN. MOHAMED HAMDAN DAGALO, LEADER OF PARAMILITARY RAPID SUPPORT FORCES (through translator) (via  phone): I don't want to be the leader of the army. There's a framework agreement between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don't want to lead anything. These are all propaganda they are making.
 
MADOWO (voice-over): As part of the agreement, the RSF, some 100,000 strong, would merge with the army. But differences over how long that would take and who would end up with more power aggravated tensions between the two factions, which have since erupted into open warfare. 
 
Residential areas across Sudan have become battlefields, with anti- aircraft weapons in the streets, and warplanes hovering overhead. Scores of civilians have been killed. 
 
The army blames the RSF for the violence, with Hemetti pointing the finger back at al-Burhan. 
 
MADOWO: What is your message to the many people of Sudan who are scared about this fresh round of violence? DAGALO (through translator) (via phone): We offer a serious apology to
 
 them, because what we can say is al-Burhan is the one that forced us to do this. It was not us who did this. We were defending ourselves. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Doctors unions say it's been difficult for medics to move about, amid reports of many people being trapped near fighting hotspots. 
 
Despite a U.N.-brokered temporary truce, there were reports of gunfire in Khartoum, which Hemetti again blamed on the army. 
 
DAGALO (through translator) (via phone): We're under attack from all directions. They are attacking us with marked and unmarked vehicles. Unfortunately, they're not stopping. 
 <br>[00:05:06]
 
MADOWO (voice-over): It's unclear what side was firing during the ceasefire. But the army says it retains the right to respond if any violations occurred. 
 
Sudan's neighbors are looking for ways to deescalate the violence. Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate talks between the two sides.
 
The African Union and the Arab League both held emergency sessions, with more calls for an immediate end to the hostilities. The army has said there will be no dialogue until the RSF is dissolved.
 
Hemetti says the stakes are so high in Sudan that any possible negotiations would have to be serious.
 
DAGALO (through translator) (via phone): We are not refusing to go to the negotiating table. As long as the negotiation is true and truthful, honest, not playing games.

HOLMES: For more on the conflict in Sudan, I want to bring in Susan Stigant. She's the director of Africa programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace, and she joins me now from Washington, D.C. 
 
Thanks for doing so. To say the least, there is a trust deficit between these two sides. You know, the supposed ceasefire didn't hold. What are the chances of a cessation of hostilities? What's at stake right now? 
 
SUSAN STIGANT, DIRECTOR OF AFRICA PROGRAMS, U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE: I think it's difficult to read at this stage, why the humanitarian ceasefire that was called for earlier today didn't hold. It was announced quite at the last minute. It was unclear whether it was a command issue, whether it was just not respected, whether it was a communication issue. 
 
Nonetheless, it really needs to be tried again. At stake right now is really fundamentally protection of civilians. There's heavy fighting in urban areas. People can't move from their houses to get food, water, basic supplies. And there's -- there are houses that are getting hit in the middle of Khartoum itself. 
 
I think more broadly, there's the risk -- and it's already taking place -- that the fighting will spread to other parts of Sudan. And the -- both the Sudan armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces are locked into this zero sum game. 
 
HOLMES: Yes.
 
STIGANT: And then, more broadly, I think we're concerned about the risks that this could tilt into a more regional fight. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Yes, I want to explore that a little bit further, because as you make the point, I mean, there is a lot of history, enmity among the two sides, and it's not all political. And I think it's important to say that. A lot of it is tribal. 
 
Do you think the risk is a growing ethnic tribal conflict with the complexities and brutality that can bring? 
 
STIGANT: Well, Sudan is an incredibly rich place in terms of identity, and richness also brings with it complexity. But I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that the fighting right now is between men who have guns, and they're fighting about power. And they're fighting about how their interests can be met, and they believe that that can be done through violence. 
 
There is, I think, a concerning escalation of hate speech that's taking place and -- and some mobilization. But at the end of the day, I think it's really important that these issues don't become conflated --
 
HOLMES: Yes.
 
STIGANT: -- between people who are seeking to make changes through violence and those who fought so hard and struggle so courageously to make change in a non-violent way.
 
HOLMES: There are a lot of mutual outside interests in Sudan among, you know, you could say traditional foes. I mean, you've got Russia and the U.S. with interests. China also.
 
What more should or could the international community, the West but also the U.N. and African nations, Arab Gulf nations? What should they all be doing right now? 
 
STIGANT: Well, the first step is really to call to halt the violence. And whether that's a permanent halt, or whether it's temporary halt so that people can move around and move to safety. 
 
And we've seen some good moves in that direction. The regional leaders met today, and all called for an end of the violence. We expect that three heads of state will travel to Sudan tomorrow. The African Union met, and both Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate. 
 
I think it's important that investment is made now. It will be relatively cheap, both in terms of resources from partner countries and also avoiding the terrible human costs. 
 
If there is a step that can start to get towards one, ensuring that there aren't resupplies once the weapons run out, and that's about putting pressure on neighboring countries to make sure nobody opens up those supply lines. And then to get a serious move towards a political negotiation that can lead to a new government. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Yes, I mean, the horrible part of this is Sudan should be a food exporter, not in the dire situation that it is now and has been for some time. 
 
The aim, of course, remains for a return to civilian government. What do you think the prospects are for that in the short to medium term, and you know, how how does this complicate the process? Can you see civilian rule anytime soon? 
 
STIGANT: Well, the reality right now is that all of the civilians are in lockdown right there. They're sheltering in place to protect themselves and their families. As we -- as I talked to colleagues and friends, you can hear the heavy fighting, hear shelling; people are -- houses are getting hit nearby.
 <br>[00:10:06]
 
And unfortunately, I think civilians are being drawn into a debate about how to end the fighting, not what needs to be done to set up a new government that can deliver on the aspirations for freedom, peace and justice that the Sudanese people have been struggling for since well before 2019. 
 
So I think there's -- there's prospect and possibility. But right now, we can't lose sight of the fact that the -- the military and RSF leaders have shifted the narrative. And they've made it about a fundamental security question. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, yes. I wish we had more time. It is -- It is an awful situation; always worse for the civilians. 
 
Susan Stigant with the U.S. Institute of Peace, I really appreciate your time. 
 
STIGANT: Thank you. 
 
HOLMES: Japanese public broadcaster NHK reports police have raided the home of the man accused of throwing an explosive object at Prime Minister Fumio Kishida during a campaign event. 
 
Investigators searched the home of the 24-year-old suspect on Sunday, removing more than 10 boxes of material from the property. They also reportedly seized the suspect's personal computer, mobile phone and gunpowder. 
 
Police are still investigating the suspect's motive for Saturday's attack. 
 
All of this coming as the G-7 foreign ministers meeting in Japan. For more, let's go to our Marc Stewart, who's standing by in Tokyo. 
 
Good to see you, Marc.
 
Tokyo trying to reassure G-7 leaders all is well following this attack on the P.M. Bring us up to date. 
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Michael, you mentioned that police raid taking place at the suspect's home. That is going to be crucial, because right now, this question of motive is still wide open. It is hoped that some of this evidence that is taken will provide some better idea as to the intention of this young man. 
 
Right away, though, I want to show you some video we obtained early this morning. It shows that cylinder-like device very near the prime minister. And then a member of his security detail basically kicking it away and then opening up what appears to be some kind of shield to protect the prime minister. 
 
Of course, the prime minister is now safe. But as you mentioned, this is happening as foreign leaders are gathering in Japan in anticipation of the larger G-7 summit to be held next month in Hiroshima.
 
Obviously, a lot of questions about security. It's a question that the prime minister addressed just hours ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): For event schedules like the G-7 summit, where dignitaries from around the world gather, I believe Japan nationwide will have to work together to make the utmost effort to provide security and safety. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART: Of course, this case this past weekend obviously brings back memories of the recent assassination of former prime -- former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 
 
Of course, questions about security are being asked. It's interesting to know, Michael, that in Japan, unlike other parts of the country, such as the United States, political candidates on campaigns really have direct access with the public, with the voters.
 
And it's something that Japan certainly wants to preserve and at this point is really not being called into question, despite what has happened over the weekend, Michael.
 
HOLMES: Yes, yes. And before we let you go, we mentioned the G-7. What's some of the top agenda items there? 
 
STEWART: So if you look at the agenda, of which many foreign ministers are now going to be attending, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, it's basically created into different clusters. There's issues focusing on Asia Pacific issues. Afghanistan, as well
 
 as what's happening in Ukraine. The point there is to begin discussions. There's also a lunch, a photo op. 
 
So this is kind of step one in anticipation of the larger visit next month in Hiroshima. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Marc, appreciate it. Marc Stewart in Tokyo for us. 
 
Well, not even the Orthodox Easter could bring a halt to the fighting in Ukraine. On Sunday, Ukrainian forces said Russia had unleashed almost 100 shells in the past 24 hours around Bakhmut with about 35 fights taking place. 
 
Other areas nearby also faced heavy shelling. 
 
Ukrainian and Russian forces are battling street by street, house by house for control of what is now a decimated city. 
 
But there was still time for reflection and prayer on the Easter holiday, a group of Ukrainian soldiers attending an outdoor service about 25 kilometers from the front lines, even though authorities had asked that services be held online. 
 
And there was even a little joy. A hundred and 30 Ukrainians now back home after a prisoner exchange with Russia.
 <br>[00:15:00] 
 
In the Ukrainian-held city of Sloviansk, it has been a difficult Easter. Russia's bombardment of the city on Orthodox Good Friday showing that hit an apartment building and destroyed a children's playground left at least 15 people dead, two dozen others injured.
 
As Ben Wedeman shows us, for many, the Easter holiday was a time to pray. Pray that someday, peace will come again. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Air raid sirens. And a sermon. 
 
It's Orthodox Easter in Sloviansk, a town battered Friday, Good Friday, by deadly Russian missile strikes. That didn't stop residents from packing the church, with worshippers spilling outside. 
 
"I always pray for Ukraine, for our children," says 73-year-old Anya (ph). "I ask for peace as soon as possible, to live a little bit longer without war. We don't want to die." 
 
Anya (ph) and others have brought bags and baskets of food to be blessed. 
 
In these troubled times, more people than ever attend church, even if some are reluctant. WEDEMAN: Not everybody can make it to Sunday services. These emergency
 
 workers have been here all night, because they believe there are still more bodies under the rubble. 
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): This was the deadliest strike on Sloviansk since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. An S-300 missile gouged out the top floors of this apartment block, killing, among others, a little boy.
 
"The child who died was only 2 years old," says Tatiana (ph). "His father is still there. If only they could lift those slabs, they could rescue him." 
 
That family, like many others, fled Sloviansk early in the war, but came back after the Russians retreated last autumn. Officials say around 30,000 residents have returned in recent months.
 
"I knew all of those who were killed," says Lilia (ph), a neighbor. "It's horrible." 
 
Elsewhere in town, another missile landed in a playground. As fate would have it, Friday was cold and rainy. The playground was empty. 
 
The Easter services here o on for hours, allowing those shaken by recent attacks to renew their faith that this war will eventually come to an end. 
 
Ben Wedeman, CNN, Sloviansk, Eastern Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: And economic skirmishes emerging between the E.U. and two member countries over Ukrainian grain. 
 
The European Commission says Poland and Hungary's unilateral decisions this weekend to ban imports of Ukrainian grain and other agricultural products are unacceptable. The E.U. lifted tariffs on Ukrainian grain to make it easier to export to Africa and the Middle East. But much of it has stayed in Poland, where the government says it is hurting its farmers by bringing down prices. 
 
The two countries say they need the ban to protect their own agricultural industries. 
 
And the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, met with Chinese defense minister, Li Shangfu, in Moscow on Sunday, just weeks after the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, also visited the country. 
 
Mr. Putin told Li that President Xi's visit was, quote, "very productive." And he praised their countries' bilateral cooperation in multiple areas, including the military. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  There is a very good development of relations between our countries in all areas: in the economic, social, cultural and educational sectors, but we are also working actively through the military department.             
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HOLMES: This was Li's first foreign trip since becoming defense minister. He emphasized the, quote, "special character and strategic importance" of the Moscow-Beijing relationship. 
 
A horrifying scene at a swimming pool in Mexico. Seven people murdered, one of them just a child. We'll have the latest on the search for the gunman. 
 
Also still to come, a former lawmaker in India shot dead while in police custody. What we know about the gunman and how the government is responding to the shocking attack. That's when we come back.

In the U.S. the city of Dadeville, Alabama, is the latest community grappling with a mass shooting. Dozens gathered outside a church on Sunday for a prayer vigil for the victims. 
 
Police say four people were killed at a sweet 16 birthday party late on Saturday night. Twenty-eight were wounded, some of them critically. 
 
One victim has just been identified by family as high school senior Keke Smith. Another victim was Philstavious Dowdell, the brother of the birthday girl and a beloved high school athlete. Here's what his coach had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL TAYLOR, DADEVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH: The biggest thing is she -- she don't understand why. Why did it happen? You know? We don't have any enemies. Well, Phil just told me about a month ago. He said, Coach, anything ever happen to me, even when I go to college, take care of my two sisters. I've never dreamed that he was talking about this. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Police have not released any details about a suspect or motive. They're asking for help from the public. 
 
President Joe Biden calls this later shooting outrageous and unacceptable. In a statement he released on Sunday, he said, quote, "What has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear? When parents have to worry every time their kids walk out the door to school to the movie theater, or to the park? Guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising, not declining." 
 
Mexican authorities are trying to track down the gunman who killed seven people at a swimming pool on Saturday, a young child among the victims. It's unclear why they were targeted, but the area is known for gang activity.
 
More now from CNN's Rafael Romo. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A relaxing and sunny afternoon abruptly turned into hell in Mexico Saturday when gunmen suddenly showed up and opened fire at a crowded swimming pool. 
 
It happened in Cortazar, a city in the Mexican central state of Guanajuato. According to police, at least seven people were killed, including a 7-year-old child. 
 
The victims were three men and three women, in addition to the minor. Mexican media report they were all members of the same family, but officials have not confirmed that. 
 
Social media videos show people in swimsuits, screaming and hugging their children after the mass shooting.
 
According to a statement published by the city of Cortazar, it all started at about 4:30 in the afternoon. After shooting the victims, the unidentified gunmen vandalized the swimming pool, shot before taking security cameras and a monitor with them. 
 
The Mexican army and security forces have been deployed to search for those responsible for the attacks so far. 
 
Mexican officials have not disclosed the motive. According to an assessment by the U.S. State Department gained violence associated with the theft of petroleum and natural gas from the state oil company occurs in Guanajuato. 
 
It also says that a high number of murders in Guanajuato's Southern region is associated with cartel-related violence. 
 
Guanajuato is a major agriculture and manufacturing hub and the native state of former Mexican President Vicente Fox. Several major carmakers, including Chevrolet, Ford, GMC and Toyota, have assembly plants in the state.

An Iranian court has convicted as many as 10 military personnel over the downing of a passenger plane in January 2020. The military court said the Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down by, quote, "human error" when an Iranian commander mistook it for a cruise missile. 
 
The Kyiv-bound flight was hit by anti-aircraft missiles and crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. 
 
A semi-official Iranian news agency says the main defendant in the trial, the commander of the missile defense system that shot down the plane, was sentenced to 13 years in prison. 
 
Still to come on the program, with record levels of wind and solar power use, a new study says fossil fuel might might -- might -- have peaked. I'll speak with one of the authors of that study after the break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:30:19]
 
HOLMES: Welcome back to our viewers all around the world. I'm Michael Holmes. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Now it may seem impossible after all the bad news, but a new study suggests we could be seeing the beginning of the end of fossil fuels. 
 
Experts at the think tank Ember found the use of solar and wind power hit record levels last year, while renewable and nuclear energy supplied almost 40 percent of the world's electricity, also a record high. 
 
Fossil fuels like coal, though, still reign supreme for now, but experts say we may have seen their peak. 
 
All right. For more, I'm joined by Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, the lead author of that study, and senior electricity analyst at Ember, a climate and energy think tank. 
 
It's good to see you. Part -- part of the headline on the web -- Ember website reads, Power sector emissions may have peaked, which I
 
 don't know, it seems like a ray of hope, amid all the bad climate news we get. Are we at a tipping point in terms of fossil fuel emissions?
 
MALGORZATA WIATROS-MOTYKA, SENIOR ELECTRICITY ANALYST, EMBER: Hi. Yes, this is crucial milestone for the climate. Once we have power sector emissions peak we can expect from in the sector, which is the great which is the biggest emitter of CO2. 
 
HOLMES: It's certainly.
 
WIATROS-MOTYKA: So it is crucial.
 
HOLMES: Yes, and it's great news. I mean, wind and solar reach a record 12 percent of global electricity in 2022. It is impressive, but it is still only 12 percent.
 
Tell us, though, about the significance of that number and where the trend is headed. 
 
WIATROS-MOTYKA: So wind and solar have been growing every year for about 20 percent together. And they are basically winning the competition with fossil fuels. 
 
So we expect further growth in line with the average from -- from the last decade or so. And from this year, we expect, therefore, fall in fossil fuel. It will be small, but every -- every following year, it will increase. 
 
So now we have over 6 -- 60 countries generating over a 10th of the power from wind and solar. So it is significant. HOLMES: Very, very much so. The report it is striking. I read it all, and it's very thorough in terms of what it looked at. It analyzes data from 78 countries. That represents 93 percent of global electricity demand. 
 
And it was interesting, because I read that three of the top five wind and solar generators are in Asia. China, which of course, is a huge polluter, as well. India, the same. And Japan. And, you know, even though China is growing its coal generation. 
 
I mean, what is the significance of where the biggest changes are happening? And why there? 
 
WIATROS-MOTYKA: So it is very significant, because China alone accounted for over half of the global rise in the electricity demand. So them deploying wind and solar is very important, because that means that they're growing; demand needs will be met by clean electricity. So they will stop generate more planet-warming emissions.
 
And same with India. The energy needs are growing, so that's good that they are adding more wind and solar.
 
HOLMES: Yes, exactly. They've got work to do on reducing emissions, but they are growing their alternatives, which is good news. 
 
It was interesting. Solar is the fastest growing source of electricity. For the 18th consecutive year, according to the report. It's rising 24 percent year on year. That is impressive.
 
But coal remained the single largest source of electricity across the globe. How quickly can renewables bring that number down the percentage of polluting coal. 
 
WIATROS-MOTYKA: So we expect that coal will start falling from this year. How quickly, it is not set -- set yet. But based on the average group of wind and solar, we expect every year to see this fall from now on. 
 
HOLMES: We all hope so. The fossil fuel lobby has had extraordinary influence over the world's politicians when it comes to policy. 
 
I'm curious whether you see that influence ebbing, or perhaps are energy companies themselves seeing the writing on the wall and transitioning, seeing that renewables are, you know, economically smarter, as well as environmentally better? 
 
WIATROS-MOTYKA: Yes, so renewables are definitely cleaner, and they met -- They make more economical sense. Definitely wind and solar are winning this competition. They rose 20 percent together, while coal rose only 1 percent last year. 
 
So change is happening. 
 
HOLMES: It certainly is said we do a lot of climate stories on the program, and it's normally bad news. I mean, this is at least a ray of light and a very thorough report. Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, thank you so much. Really appreciate your
 
 time. 
 
WIATROS-MOTYKA: Thank you very much for having me. Thank you. 
 
HOLMES: All right. The effects of climate change are evident as wildfires rage in parts of Europe. Emergency officials in Southern France are rising to fight the fire the size of one usually seen in the summer months. 
 
Hundreds of firefighters were deployed on Sunday to control the blaze that has consumed more than 660 hectares of land. 
 
Meanwhile in Northern Spain, huge clouds of smoke darkened the skies on Sunday. The fires in both Spain and France have been made worse by drought conditions throughout the year. 
 
In the coming hours former U.S. President Bill Clinton will join other political leaders at a major conference marking the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. 
 
Former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern will be among those participating in a three-day conference commemorating the peace deal at Belfast's Queens University. 
 
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is hosting the conference as part of her role as chancellor of that school.
 
And coming up later on Monday, Christiane Amanpour sits down with Ahearn, Blair and Bill Clinton for an exclusive reunion interview in Belfast, marking the anniversary of that historic achievement that brought peace to Northern Ireland. 
 
Well, it is the end of an era on Broadway.

The award for Best Film went to the controversial documentary, "To My Nineteen-Year-Old Self," which chronicles the lives of six students growing up in turbulent Hong Kong.
 
The co-director says he's disappointed that many people have not been able to see the film.

WILLIAM KWOK, CO-DIRECTOR, "TO MY NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD SELF" (through translator): Can we separate the work from the controversy? I don't know. But I believe that the recognition of this documentary by the Hong Kong Film Awards is based on its artistic and content merits. 
 
Our film deserves the recognition it received. Unfortunately, not many people have the opportunity to watch this film and experience it for themselves. 
 
I believe that when people have a chance to watch this film themselves, they will be able to make a more fair and just judgment.

HOLMES: The film was pulled from theaters after some interviewees claimed they did not consent to public screenings. 
 
The end of an era on Broadway. The curtain has come down for the final time on "Phantom of the Opera." The show ran for 35 years, making it the longest running play in Broadway history.

ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER, COMPOSER, "PHANTOM OF THE OPERA": I don't think anybody, any of us thought that the Phantom would go on quite as long as it has. I'm sorry, but it never left (ph). But -- but what I would love to say is that it was going to go out with a bang, then it couldn't have gone out with a better performance. I thought it was one of the greatest performances.

POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You can't be the longest running show on Broadway and not pick up some fans along the way. In fact, since it first debuted back in 1990 -- '88, all the way down to this past Sunday when the curtain closed one last time, "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway entertained roughly 20 million audience members here at the historic Majestic Theater in Times Square, all of them drawn here by Andrew Lloyd Webber's organ-heavy score, those beautiful sets, and not to mention the elaborate costumes. 
 
But it was all extremely expensive, as well. In fact, the pandemic really changing the course for this iconic show. In fact, the -- it costing roughly a million dollars to produce on a weekly basis, the profit simply not enough to offset the cost. 
 
So that's why the creators, the producers, directors, all making that very, very difficult decision to close that show. Certainly, some sad news for some of the fans that have followed the
 
 show for quite some time. In fact, we caught up with one that was able to see one of the final shows just a couple of days ago.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was introduced to this musical when I was 7. I was -- I was in line for a car wash with my mother. She is going through her CD book, and she goes, "Have I ever showed you Phantom?" I said no. 
 
Fell in love with it. I really did. I began singing. I grew up to be a vocalist. I now hold my bachelor's in music with a musical theater concentration. 
 
And seeing the heartbeat of Manhattan leave, it is quite sad, honestly. 
 
SANDOVAL: Well, "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway, also one of the largest single generators of income and also jobs, employing roughly 6,500 employees here on Broadway during the course of its -- of its run. Again, about 35 years.
 
So there will be production scheduled for later this year in South Korea, Italy and Prague.
