BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: The parents of a missing American man found alive in Syria are relieved and shocked at the news. 
 
Twenty-nine-year-old Travis Timmerman was found walking barefoot near Damascus Thursday after rebels freed him earlier this week. He says he was arrested over the summer while on a Christian pilgrimage. 
 
His parents described their reaction to CNN. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED STEPFATHER OF TRAVIS TIMMERMAN: When I saw him on the news, I just started -- I started bawling. I called her, I'm like, really him? He's really alive? You know, after seven months, you start thinking the worst. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MOTHER OF TRAVIS TIMMERMAN: And I think he's been through a lot. He looks different.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: Back in Syria, CNN's Clarissa Ward reports that for many families, the search for loved ones continues often with much bleaker outcomes. 
 
A warning this report contains some graphic content. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
(WAILING)
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A woman wails on the floor of the (INAUDIBLE) Hospital. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
WARD: "My mother, she's been missing for 14 years," she says. "Where is she? Where is my brother? Where is my husband? Where are they?" Dr. Ahmed Abdullah shows us into the morgue, where about 35 bodies
 
 have been brought in. Discovered in the military hospital days after the regime fell, they are believed to be some of the last victims of Bashar Al Assad. 
 
"Take a look. This is the crime of the regime," he says. "Even in the Middle Ages, they didn't torture people like this." 
 
Another man points to their tattered clothing, evidence, he says, "that most were detainees at the much feared, Saydnaya (ph) Prison. Even in death, they are still only identified by numbers.
 
Everyone here heard about the horrors that took place in Assad's notorious prisons, but to see it up close is something entirely different.
 
(on camera): A lot of them have bruises, have horrible wounds that seem to be consistent with torture. 
 
I just saw one woman retching as she came out of the other room. Families are now going through trying to see if their loved ones are here.
 
(voice-over): There's not enough room for all of them in the morgue, so a makeshift area has been set up outside. 
 
(CRYING)
 
WARD: More and more families stream in. The light from their cell phones, the only way of identifying the dead.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
WARD: " My only son, I don't have another. They took him for 12 years now, just because he said, no. Twelve years, my only son," this woman shouts.
 
"I don't know anything about him. I ask Allah to burn him," she says of Assad. "Burn him and his sons like he burned my heart." 
 
A crowd swarms when they see our camera. Everyone here has lost someone.
 
(on camera): All of those people are asking us to take the names of their loved ones to help them try to find them.
 
WARD (voice-over): It is a mark of desperation, such is the need for answers. But finding those answers will not be easy. 
 
At the military intelligence facility, known as the Palestine Branch, officers burned documents and destroyed hard drives before fleeing, but their terror was on an industrial scale.
 
Troves and troves of prisoner files remain. It will take investigators years to go through them. 
 
Below ground, more clues etched on the walls of cells that look more like dungeons.
 
(on camera): So, you can see this list of names of -- it looks like 93 prisoners here. There's also a schedule for keeping the cell tidy. And just graffiti everywhere, people trying to leave marks for someone to find.
 
(voice-over): Down here, insects are the only life form that thrives. It's clear that anyone who could survive this will never be the same again. 
 
The cells are empty, but the doors are finally open. The quest for answers is just beginning.
 
(on camera): The one thing the Assad regime did do a very good job of was documenting its own crimes. 
 
And so the question now is, how long will it be until you start to see human rights groups and investigators coming into Syria to try to start the vast process of poring through all that data? 
 
And then, what's the next step towards getting some sort of justice for these people? Could the Syrians choose to do what the Ukrainians did, which was essentially to open themselves up to be under the jurisdiction of the ICC? 
 <br>[14:35:07]
 
That would be the hope of many Syrians but the disappointment as well, for a lot of people you talk to here, is that Bashar Al Assad is very unlikely to ever see his day in court because, of course, he is now in exile in Moscow. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANCHEZ: Our thanks to Clarissa Ward for that report.

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: For the first time, the public is hearing from the top executive of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, after it's CEO, Brian Thompson, was assassinated on a Manhattan street. 
 
In a "New York Times" guest essay, Andrew Witty said, "Thompson, whose murder has been celebrated by many, was," quote, "a brilliant, kind man who was working to make health care better for everyone." 
 
Witty also addressed the widespread outrage that has been expressed against health insurers, writing that, "Claim denials are not well understood," and, quote, "We need to improve how we explain how decisions are made." 
 
The suspect accused of gunning down Thompson, Luigi Mangione, will be back in court in 10 days. 
 
CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller, is here now.
 
John, give us the latest on the investigation. 
 
JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, we're learning some new things today. It starts with the finding by the New York City Police Department in consultation with UnitedHealthcare that the suspect was never a client of theirs, not a customer. 
 
Part of that goes to what was behind his particular animus to this organization and its leader. And apparently, based on that, it wasn't anything that happened between him and the company. 
 
Rather, it may just be that UnitedHealthcare, for a guy who was very vociferous online about his feelings about the health care industry, was simply the biggest.
 
In the note that was allegedly found on his person by police in Pennsylvania, it says, quote, "United is the fifth-largest company in the United States by market cap, behind only Apple, Google and Walmart. It has grown and grown." 
 
That may have more to do with it with his targeting than anything between him and the company. 
 
The other thing that emerged last night was reporting by CNN about three search warrants that had been obtained.
 
It looks like those search warrants are most likely for the laptop he was actually working on while he was arrested at that table at the back of a McDonalds in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Investigators want to get into that.
 
Now, in the note, he says that he is -- "My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering, so probably not much in there." 
 
That may be true, but they still want to get into that computer and find out, was he talking with anyone else? Was he working with anybody else? 
 
He also says in the note that he wants to avoid a lengthy investigation, and he wants to state plainly, "I wasn't working with anyone." That may be true, but they want to get into those devices and determine what was in them. 
 
The burner phone that he was walking with on the street, on the video, you can see him actually talking with someone on the phone right before the murder. They want to get into that phone and find out, who was that person?
 
So a lot of loose ends to tie up while they wait for the extradition proceedings to go on between New York and Pennsylvania.
 
KEILAR: Yes, certainly. 
 
John Miller, thank you for keeping an eye on all of that.
 
Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: Now to some of the other headlines we're watching this hour. 
 
The wife of the Wisconsin kayaker who police say faked his own death, just to flee to Europe, filed for separation. 
 
In the petition, Ryan Borgwardt's wife is requesting sole custody of their three kids, claiming the couple's 22-year marriage is irretrievably broken.
 
Officials say Borgwardt willingly returned to the United States this week. it's still unclear, though, why he abandoned his family. He's charged with obstruction and faces up to nine months in jail if convicted. 
 
Also, the widely popular drinkware brand, Stanley, is recalling more than 2.5 million travel mugs over a possible burn hazard. 
 
The recall applies to all Stanley's Switchback and Trigger Action mugs after the company received more than 90 reports worldwide over problems related to detached lids. And 38 of those complaints were tied to burn injuries, with 11 requiring medical attention. 
 
And a Buckingham Palace staffer was arrested after a drunken brawl at the end of a Christmas party. It happened at a London bar earlier this week. 
 
The palace says it's investigating after the 24-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly. 
 
The woman, who spent the night in jail, is believed to be a maid. She could face further disciplinary action from the palace. 
 
Well, it is one of the oldest traditions in college football, and one of the only times when journalists, like CNN's Brianna Keilar, get to be biased and pick a side, the annual Army-Navy game. 
 
We're going to see if the game can actually unite some Democrats and Republicans, even when they're cheering for separate teams. 
 <br>[14:44:49]
 
Stay with NEWS CENTRAL. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: We are counting down to the kickoff for one of sport's greatest rivalries, the Army-Navy game. They square off tomorrow for the 125th time, battling for the commander-in-chief's trophy.
 
And the friendly trash talking has been going on all week in this studio at military installations all around the world, even in the hallowed halls of Congress. 
 
Joining us now from the Hill is Republican Congressman Nick LaLota from New York, United States Naval Academy class of 2000 -- I think I have that right. And Democratic Congressman Pat Ryan from New York, United States Military Academy class of 2004. And also West Point is in his district. 
 
Gentlemen, I think Congressman Ryan and I know the answer to this question, but nonetheless, who do you think is going to win tomorrow? 
 <br>[14:50:05]
 
REP. NICK LALOTA (R-NY): It's going to be Navy the whole way, despite this injury being two on one, two Army versus one Navy. 
 
Navy is going to pull it off by a score of about 2,000 to zero tomorrow. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
REP. PAT RYAN (D-NY): Just -- just look at this season. I just look at the facts, look at the data, look at the heart, look at the grit. Look at our quarterback and look at our ranking. Army is going to crush Navy tomorrow. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. it's going to be some good football, no doubt about that. 
 
And I think you can't ignore that there is a little bit of a political backdrop here. President-Elect Trump is going to be at the game. His defense secretary pick, who isn't a sure thing, there's this big fight playing out over politicization of the military right now. 
 
But this is a game that is supposed to be about something so much bigger. And it really is. I wonder what you hope people take away from it.
 
LALOTA: This is an inspiration to the whole country, and specifically now that this game is being played in our nation's capital. 
 
Hopefully, it's an inspiration to members here on Capitol Hill that the country should come first. 
 
The folks who are playing on the field tomorrow are willing to give their lives for everybody watching. That ought to be an inspiration to everybody here in this town and work together and put the nation far, far before themselves. 
 
RYAN: Yes. And -- and despite our disagreement on football and sports, I mean, Nick and I have worked on a lot of legislation together. There's actually a group called the For Country Caucus, bipartisan military veterans. 
 
When we were out, going out on mission and you're doing your patrol brief, you don't care about any of the differences. Certainly political differences. You have a larger purpose to serve. And tomorrow is just a patriotic day where we're so proud of these
 
 young men and women and what they represent. And it makes me optimistic at a time when we certainly all need a little bit more optimism about our country and our politics. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. And look, I am admittedly biased here. I'm wearing this year's Army jersey. My trash talk has been a little out of control. 
 
And I wonder, because up there on the Hill, as you mentioned, you do have a lot of veterans. You have a lot of representation from the academies that are going to be playing tomorrow. 
 
Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, Congressman Todd Young, Wes Hunt, John James, Warren Davidson, Senator Jack Reed, and there's others I didn't name there.
 
What, Congressman Ryan, has the trash talk been like? 
 
RYAN: It's a lot of fun. I mean, it's fun to talk about things like this rather than some of the other things that have been bogging down and slowing down this Congress. 
 
I actually caught another Naval Academy grad, who shall remain nameless, not -- not (INAUDIBLE) here, trying to sort of put up some beat Navy signs on my office this morning. Luckily, I intercepted them. And the Navy spirit mission on my office failed. 
 
So we're having a lot of fun. And look, there's so much we agree on in this country. And that's what I think both of us have tried to do in our time here, is just try to find that common ground. 
 
KEILAR: And what about you, Congressman? Are --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: Yes. 
 
LALOTA: Yes, Pat Ryan's, the attempt on his office was unsuccessful. But that wasn't the only salvo we fired. I also got a successful one into John James of Michigan's office. Got some good "Beat Army" pictures at his desk. 
 
He was tremendously embarrassed. Just like the Army football team will be embarrassed tomorrow. 
 
KEILAR: I don't know, I see some interceptions, just like we saw at Congressman Ryans office, I think we're going to see some interceptions. Maybe that don't favor Navy. I'm just saying. 
 
But I wonder, do you guys want to get a bet going on, you know, really put some skin in the game here, some dignity on the line? What do you think? 
 
LALOTA: How about we bet a floor speech? 
 
(CROSSTALK) LALOTA: How about we bet a floor speech that whichever team wins, that member gets to choose the speech of the other member about the team's football. 
 
KEILAR: Do you accept?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
RYAN: -- since we're on national television? So, yes, I agree, and I look forward to praising Army's victory next week on the House floor. 
 
LALOTA: And for transparency's sake, maybe the producers can put up the record of the all-time series in some of the headers or footers there, because the viewers should know that Navy is far ahead in the all-time series. 
 
KEILAR: Listen, I am biased, but I will have you know, we put that up yesterday. I mentioned it. Navy is well ahead. 
 
So I just want you to -- I don't know it off the top of my head -- but we did say it yesterday. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
KEILAR: Navy is well ahead in the all-time count, sir. I admit it. 
 
And lastly, Congressman Ryan, there's a lot of pre-game traditions, including the cadet midshipman debate that actually took place today on the Hill. I know you were a judge in it. Who won? 
 
RYAN: Yes, it was a lot of fun, actually, over in the Senate and on C- Span for the -- for the folks who want to check it out. It was a tight debate, but Army actually won four to three. 
 
And to see these young men and women, how smart they are, how passionate they are, again, it's just something I think the whole country can and should root for. 
 <br>[14:55:04]
 
And we'll see that tomorrow on the football field, too.
 
KEILAR: I think we will. 
 
All right. You guys want to cancel each other out with your -- your cheer. Go for it.
 
LALOTA: Go Navy beat Army, beat Army. Beat army.
 
KEILAR: No. oh, no.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
LALOTA: I'm never going to hear that in the Control Room. Never going to hear the end of that edit --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: Guys, beat Navy. 
 
LALOTA: Oh, Mr. Ryan.
 
KEILAR: OK, start over. Congressman Ryan, start over. 
 
LALOTA: They want you to try again. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
LALOTA: It's got to be Navy beat Army. OK? 
 
KEILAR: Go Army beat Navy.
 
RYAN: Go Army, beat Navy. Yes! 
 
KEILAR: All right, guys, we'll see you tomorrow at the game. And may the best team, Army, win. 
 
We'll be right back.
