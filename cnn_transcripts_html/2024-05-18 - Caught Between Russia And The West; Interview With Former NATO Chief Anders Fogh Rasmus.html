THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[10:59:48]
 
KARA SWISHER, PODCAST HOST: Wow, I don't know what else to say except that there's a big backlash, obviously online and all over the place, more than half the women, half the class is women. there was a lot of unhappiness by the women, although it's a very conservative college. A lot of people did like it, but it was truly disturbing. 
 
And -- but my favorite part is that he quoted Taylor Swift, who is one of his teammates' girlfriend and the Swifties are on it. And so hopefully there'll be a backlash. 
 
CHRIS WALLACE, CNN HOST: And we should say, the NFL rushed to say that he in no way represents the views of the NFL. 
 
SWISHER: No. Yes. 
 
WALLACE: All right. Gang, thank you all for being here. And thank you for spending part of your day with us. We'll see you right back here. Next week. 
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello everyone, and welcome to THE AMANPOUR HOUR. 
 
Here's where we're headed this week.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: Supported by China, armed by North Korea and Iran, as Putin tightens his anti-American alliance, a former NATO chief says the West should make sure Ukraine doesn't just hang on but wins.
 
ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN, FORMER NATO CHIEF: Ukraine should receive weapons, not just to survive but actually to win the war.
 
AMANPOUR: Then caught between Russia and the West, the president of Georgia says Putin is using Soviet era substitutes to pull her country back into the Kremlin's orbit.
 
SALOME ZOURABICHVILI, GEORGIAN PRESIDENT: The population here is very well aware of this old Russian Soviet propaganda tricks. AMANPOUR: Also this hour, Bethlehem-born chef Fadi Kattan on
 
 celebrating Palestinian food, but struggling to cook while his people have starved in Gaza.
 
FADI KATTAN, PALESTINIAN CHEF: At a certain moment, commodity (ph) has to prevail on this. We're being denied our existence.
 
AMANPOUR: From my archive an earlier war that transformed a small group of Israeli settlers into a mass movement that reshaped this Holy Land.
 
And finally, the super sophisticated A.I. chatbots blurring the lines between human and machine. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go ahead and show me that selfie and I'll put my emotional detective hat on.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Good to be back with you again this weekend.
 
And we begin with another photo op for the anti-American axis. Xi Jinping rolling out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin for the second time in six months with their military ties and the war in Ukraine high on the agenda.
 
In a moment, you'll hear the president of Russia's neighbor, Georgia, which was rocked by protests this week, accusing the Kremlin of using Soviet tactics to sabotage their democracy. 
 
It is a story that sounds a lot like Moscow's infiltration of Ukraine where Russian troops have exploited aid delays this week with major strategic advances in the northeast. He's what Ukraine's defense minister Rustem Umerov just told me.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RUSTEM UMEROV, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE MINISTER: We are fighting near the border. So they are crossing the border the invasion, the second front started. So that's why we are repelling them and that's why we want to save more lives of people, that's why we work (ph) with them to the city.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR: Former NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen says Putin won't stop unless Ukraine is a member of the transatlantic military alliance. He also calls it embarrassing that Europe can't deliver as much military aid in a year as North Korea can to Russia in a month.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: Anders Fogh Rasmussen as far rest mucin, welcome back to our program. 
 
RASMUSSEN: Thank you. 
 
AMANPOUR: Can I start by asking you about the delay in American aid, the advances that Russia is making. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Kyiv this week. I want to know whether you think the gains by Russia now are reversible.
 
RASMUSSEN: It is reversible, but obviously the delay in the American aid and the lack of fulfillment of the European pledges have made it more difficult for the Ukrainians. And Putin is exploiting that situation. 
 
So provided that we deliver everything the Ukrainians need, I think they can reverse the development. 
 
AMANPOUR: And by that I assume you mean you have to prevail in Ukraine. Ukraine has to win this.
 
RASMUSSEN: Absolutely. And we should make it a clear goal that Ukraine should receive weapons sufficiently to win the war, not just to survive, but actually to win the war. 
 
And I think we should have the Ukrainians in their air defense just like we helped Israel to protect itself against Iranian missiles and drones. We should establish missile defenses on nature territory along the border of Ukraine and help the Ukrainians shoot down incoming Russian missiles and drones. 
 <br>[11:04:55]
 
RASMUSSEN: We need that for humanitarian reasons to protect the civilian population. But also to protect the weapon deliveries that we send to Ukraine and to defend their defendant (INAUDIBLE). 
 
AMANPOUR: And do you think that the rules of engagement should change because we've heard in the past that when NATO sends weapons there are certain constriction, certain restrictions on what Ukraine can do with them. 
 
RASMUSSEN: We should lift all caveat, all restrictions including on the use of weapons. You cannot win a war if the Ukrainians have one arm tied on the back. That's not possible. 
 
And when Russians use launching pads located on Russian territory, obviously the Ukrainians should be allowed to target those launching pads.
 
AMANPOUR: Secretary general, can I ask you, you know Vladimir Putin over the last year or so has made it known that he will wait the West out. He doesn't believe the West will keep up with it slogans of full- scale to victory, standing with Ukraine. 
 
So was it inevitable that we'd get to this point? 
 
RASMUSSEN: I think we should tell Putin that not only will we continue our support for Ukraine, as long as they take part with as much as it take. So in addition to delivering all the weapons the Ukrainians need, we should invite Ukraine to start accession talks with NATO. 
 
We need Ukraine as a bulwark against an aggressive Russia. So I think at the NATO summit in July in Washington, D.C., we should extend an invitation to Ukraine to start accession talks. And by that we would also tell Putin better come to your senses, better stop the war. You cannot avoid the inevitable, Ukraine will join NATO. 
 
AMANPOUR: So, you know that all the other NATO leaders feel pretty much differently, or at least most of them that they, even if they wanted to, they wouldn't do it in the midst of a war. 
 
RASMUSSEN: Yes, but that's a very dangerous argument. You de facto give Putin an intention to continue the war, to avoid a future Ukrainian membership of NATO. 
 
We have to break that calculation and we can do that by extending an invitation though a war is still going on. It would be unprecedented. 
 
So and invitation to start accession talks is not membership overnight, but it is an invitation to start the process. 
 
AMANPOUR: What do you make of this week's lovefest, if I might say, the anti-American axis putting on a big show. Putin and Xi in Beijing. We know that they're both very dependent on each other. Beijing is bailing out Putin, buying Russian oil, sending spare parts for all sorts of military equipment. I mean, where do you think this stands right now? 
 
RASMUSSEN: Putin's visit to Beijing demonstrates the joint efforts of China and Russia to undermine freedom and democracy. They want to diminish the role of the U.S. and its allies and the world. They want a world dominated by dictators and autocrats. 
 
And we have to strike back. I mean the best way to deter tyrants is to demonstrate firmness and power. That's the only language they understand. 
 
AMANPOUR: Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former NATO secretary general, thank you very much indeed for joining us. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: And coming up next. As I just mentioned, my conversation with the president of Georgia, who blames Soviet propaganda tricks for trying to pull it back into Russia's orbit. 
 
And then later Bethlehem-born chef Fadi Kattan on sharing Palestinian culture and finding humanity through food.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KATTAN: If we don't know each other, we wouldn't be able to get along which is basically absurd (ph).
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:09:35]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like this law is going to destroy the European future that my country has been fighting for. I think the Georgian government is trying to take something away from us that we -- the majority of us is like very desperate to have.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR: Indeed 80 percent of Georgians are pro-E.U., pro the West and the scene outside parliament in the former Soviet republic this week was kind of violent. 
 <br>[11:14:47]
 
AMANPOUR: While inside brawling lawmakers approved a controversial foreign agents bill. Critics say it mimics the same laws used by the Kremlin to crush opposition and dissent.
 
Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili calls it a Russian hybrid war to sabotage its dreams of E.U. membership and pull it back into Russia's orbit, much as Putin is trying to do with Ukraine.
 
As the law passed this week, I asked about the Putin effect on her independent pro-Western nation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: President Zourabichvili, welcome back to the program. How dangerous and critical a moment is this for Georgia in its democratic transition?
 
ZOURABICHVILI: It is critical, because as you know, Georgia has received the candidate status to the European Union last December and was on its way to have the opening of negotiations, additional negotiations by the end of the year.
 
So, it's very needlepoint (ph) that there is this new pressure The reintroduction of this Russian law, because it's nothing else but a Russian law, and many other laws that are very disturbing and that take us away from the recommendations of the European Commission and from our European past (ph) in general.
 
The message that we're seeing today in the streets, on the streets, the way to treat very peaceful protesters is a very Russian way. It's a way of intimidation, of trying to stop the protest, and to stop people to say that they want their European past back.
 
AMANPOUR: OK. Now, let's get to the nitty-gritty of this law. Why is it so opposed by the majority? What makes it so dangerous? Those groups that back it -- well, the ruling group that backs it, which we understand is pro- Kremlin or backed by the Kremlin says that it's all about sovereignty and, you know -- and independence. So, what do you say about that?
 
ZOURABICHVILI: First of all, it's a copy, a duplicate of the law that Putin adopted in 2012. And the law was used to really completely oppress and repress the civil society. As a result, we see today what's happening in Russia. 
 
And it has this main aim. And what is even more preoccupying in a country like Georgia that has never known that, that through this law and through their rhetoric at the same time the authorities are calling, in fact, our partners of 30 years, foreign powers that want to subvert the country, they are calling them, our partners, agents that want here to provoke a new war like in Ukraine, because that's what they are saying. And the population here is very well aware of these old Russian Soviet propaganda tricks. 
 
So, it doesn't work. They see what's happening, and they're going to stop it from happening.
 
AMANPOUR: You say that, and you must also be aware of Russia's expanding influence, the fact that Russia still occupies some 20 percent of Georgian territory since 2008, as it does in Ukraine. And Russia's success, frankly, in driving wedges between its vision and those who believe in a western vision.
 
So the question, I guess, is, are you confident and -- or rather, do you believe that Russia tried to -- is trying to sabotage Georgia's rapprochement and further integration in the E.U., as some in your country believe?
 
ZOURABICHVILI: I think that Russia is worried about that, has been worried and is more worried when it comes closer and closer, which is a case when we have already the candidate status and we're in the possibility, have the possibility to see the opening of negotiations. So, they certainly don't like it. 
 
But they also do not like the evolution of Armenia. They also do not like the evolution of Azerbaijan and their closeness with Turkey. They also do not like the fact that they do not control the Black Sea as they would wish to. But not everything that Russia likes happens. 
 
So, we are -- again, we are determined -- yes, we have 20 percent of our territory that is occupied by Russia, but that has not diverted Georgia from following its European past. It has not stopped us an inch and it will not stop us from continuing.
 
AMANPOUR: Well, President Salome Zourabichvili, thank you very much for joining us.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[11:19:46]
 
AMANPOUR: And the president is really laying her hopes and those of the Georgia majority on elections in the fall that hope to reverse this draconian new law. 
 
And after our conversation, we learned that Slovakia's pro-Putin Prime Minister Robert fico, had been shot in politically motivated attacks.
 
Still to come on the program, renowned Palestinian chef Fadi Kattan, his pride and his heartache for Palestinians and their rich culture.
 
But first, an amputee child learning to play video games with his feet, just one hundreds of children our Jomana Karadsheh meets at a makeshift camp for Gaza evacuees. 
 
Her report is next. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I ask what makes him so resilient.
 
"Because I'm from Gaza, because I'm Palestinian," he says, "Nothing can stop me."
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:20:34]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
Welcome back. 
 
The U.N. calls it a war on children, seven months and many thousands of young lives now lost in Gaza. The biggest challenge we face covering the Israel-Hamas war is the lack of access to foreign journalists while scores of brave Gazan journalists have been killed telling the story.
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh had to travel to Doha to talk to some of the injured, homeless and even orphan children who've been evacuated to a former World Cup compound in Qatar.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH: Far from a place of death and destruction, Gaza's children try to be children again.
 
But everywhere you look here, you see the real cost of a war Israel says is against Hamas, what the U.N. has called a war on children.
 
So many injured little ones, so many who've lost limbs. Mahmoud can no longer ride a bike.
 
The nine-year-old lost both his arms in an Israeli strike. He's one of hundreds of children evacuated by Qatar for medical treatment.
 
Mahmoud is finding ways of living a childhood shattered. He shows off how he's learned to use his feet to play video games.
 
"I want to fulfill my dreams. I want to be a journalist and a pilot," he says.
 
The once independent child now needs his mother to feed him, dress him and take him to the toilet.
 
I ask what makes him so resilient.
 
"Because I'm from Gaza, because I'm Palestinian," he says, "Nothing can stop me."
 
Those children here, like Mahmoud, don't want to talk about their injuries. They've found sanctuary in this unlikely place.
 
A compound Qatar built for World Cup fans, now turned into housing for nearly 2,000 Gaza evacuees, most of them women and children.
 
It's a safe space to deal with the trauma of war and offers us a first-hand glimpse into the suffering which Israel has forced us to cover from afar by preventing international journalists from freely accessing the enclave.
 
In this room, women gather for a session of Palestinian embroidery. It's therapy, a distraction, but how could anyone forget what they've been through and all they've lost?
 
Alma quietly sits watching her grandmother embroidery, her wounded mother's in hospital, her injured father still in Gaza.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I didn't expect Alma to survive. She had a fractured skull, an amputated leg, shrapnel in her back and a broken arm.
 
KARADSHEH: Like many children, Alma has lost more than her leg. The blast that maimed her took her eight-month-old sister Sham, who died in her arms, and her six-year-old brother Ahmed.
 
"I am sad about my brother and sister," Alma choking back tears, can't say any more.
 
Everyone in this room is missing loved ones, those gone and those they've had to leave behind. Weighed down by grief and guilt, they tell us they deprived themselves of food and sleep.
 
SOHEIR ISSA, SONS KILLED IN GAZA: I've been sleeping on a couch. How can I sleep on a bed when my sons are sleeping in a tent and on sand? How can I eat when my children are hungry?
 
KARADSHEH: Soheir's three children and husband are in Rafah. Like others, she desperately wants to get them out.
 
She shows us pictures of what used to be home, where she was injured, where she lost her mother, six-year-old niece and two of her sons, all killed in a strike, she says, while they were sleeping.
 
She gleams with pride talking about her boys. Sixteen-year-old Sharif was top of his class. Mahmoud had just gotten a scholarship to study medicine abroad.
 
ISSA: Israel left no dreams. I now find myself thinking I wish I had let my sons take up arms instead of dying like this. KARADSHEH: Soheir says she raised her boys to never carry weapons, to serve their people through their education.
 
ISSA: I want to tell them you destroyed the people, the mothers. You created more hatred. I used to feel for them with the hostages. 
 <br>[11:29:51]
 
ISSA: As a mother who's lost her children, if I could avenge my son's death, I would do it myself.
 
KARADSHEH: Memories and photos, all she has left of them. 
 
ISSA: When I go to sleep at night, I put my arms like this. I imagine I'm hugging Mahmoud and Sharif, hugging my mother.
 
KARADSHEH: Pain in this place is palpable. Those who've made it out may have escaped the war, but there's no escaping the everlasting scars it leaves behind.
 
Jomana Karadsheh, CNN -- Doha.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: And still no ceasefire or aid into Gaza. And still no deal to release the Israeli hostages. 
 
Coming up next in the program from my archive, what started as religious zeal quickly turned into strategy. The Jewish settler campaign to retake the West Bank nearly three-quarters of a century ago. 
 
But first a celebration of Palestinian culture and identity. As I joined Palestinian chef Fadi Kattan in his fine dining London restaurant. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KATTAN: Our cuisine is rooted in 5,000 -- 6,000 years of history. And it's a beautifully diverse cuisine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:31:03]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
AMANPOUR: Welcome back. 
 
And in my "Letter from London" this week, a feast of culture and humanity through the universal language of food. 
 
Chef Fadi Kattan was born and raised in the Occupied West bank, where he's had a restaurant in Bethlehem since 2015, specializing in Palestinian food. He opened a second restaurant in London last year, which is where I met him to talk about the crisis in Gaza, and how hard it is for him to cook now, while so many of his people and family are starved in the wake of the October 7 attack and the war on Gaza by.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: Fadi Kattan, welcome. 
 
KATTAN: Thank you.
 
AMANPOUR: I'm actually in your restaurant so -- your tiny -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
AMANPOUR: But what is it about your homeland and your food that you felt needed to be explained. 
 
KATTAN: Everything, everything. People don't know enough about Palestinian cuisine. People don't know the long history.
 
Our cuisine is rooted 5,000 -- 6,000 years of history and it's a beautifully diverse cuisine. Tiny country with at least three different terrain -- the desert, the coast and the fig and olives landscape. I think it was really important to be able to share with the world that.
 
AMANPOUR: You have just come back from Bethlehem on the West Bank. What did you see, feel, endure experience, even though you're not in Gaza, of the war.
 
KATTAN: I have family in Gaza. I have friends in Gaza. In the West Bank it is scary to say the least. People are worried. The settler attacks on Palestinians have increased. The land grabs -- you know, when I was going around the market because in my book there's people that are in the book that are from the Bethlehem market.
 
So I was giving people the book and the sentence I kept hearing from everybody is, are we next? And are we next means what is happening in Gaza is going to happen to the rest of Palestine.
 
For me, it's very difficult as a chef to even be cooking. And honestly, after 7 October, for the first few weeks, I couldn't even cook. There's a whole part of my people that are being forcibly starved. It is a man-made starvation. That has to stop. 
 
What's the future? What is the future of all this insanity. At a certain moment humanity has to prevail on this. 
 
We're being denied our existence. I mean, you've seen and I've seen a lot of your guests have (INAUDIBLE) that Palestine is not even existing and stories of oh, but we are Arabs who came in 48 to that land. 
 
I lived in Bethlehem in my great grandfathers house that was built in 1886. I have title deeds of our rounds in Gaza that was confiscated in 48. So at a certain moment those fears -- when I was back home, I was
 
 imagining what was happening in Gaza calling my family in Gaza when I managed to get through what they're living is I don't have the tools to understand it, I think.
 
AMANPOUR: They survived? 
 
KATTAN: They survived. They're hiding but, you know, it's I don't know what survival is. I have friends who had to leave, who managed to pay that horrendous fee and get out of Gaza. Some of them were not that lucky.
 
What's really scary is none of the official speeches we're hearing from the Israelis are even acknowledging that we exist.
 
AMANPOUR: You, with your book Bethlehem, with your restaurants, with the olive tree here, with the ancient keys that you decorated this restaurant which mark the Nakba and Palestinians lost homes, you are in I think putting Palestinian culture and the Palestinian nation right there for everybody to see and acknowledge. Is that part of your mission? 
 <br>[11:39:52]
 
KATTAN: No. Thank you for actually even seeing this if I were an Italian chef celebrating my history it would be normal. 
 
As a Palestinian very often I feel that I have to be apologizing for being Palestinian. Or when I talk about like lands we lost or oranges I long for the oranges of Gaza, which I never got to taste but I grew up with stories of my family picking oranges and exporting their oranges here to the U.K.
 
My mission is to share with people the beauty of Palestine. My mission is to celebrate Palestine.
 
AMANPOUR: Is there anything in these dark times that gives you hope for the future, in your country.
 
KATTAN: What gives me hope is seeing all these voices across the world beyond faith, ethnicity, political orientation, sexual orientation, raising their voices in a call of love. Because at the end, when you call for humanity, it's a call for love. 
 
It's not a football game. You're not taking sides. That is not -- it's not the Israelis versus the Palestinians. It's a call for humanity and seeing that from the students in the U.S. to people in London, people all over the world are marching out there and calling for an end of this insanity and seeing how diverse they are. 
 
Because and you know Palestine quite well. Palestine is a diverse place also. The old city of Jerusalem has more languages spoken than anywhere else. That is who we are. And it's important that we see that diversity, finally calling for an end to this. 
 
There should be an end to this. That's the hope I have. AMANPOUR: Fadi Kattan, thank you very much indeed. 
 
KATTAN: Thank you, Christiane.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: And Chef Fadi's new book has just been released this week. It's called "Bethlehem, a Celebration of Palestinian Food".
 
Now, you can see our full-length conversation on my weekday show. That'll be next week.
 
Coming up next, as open A.I. unveils its nearly human chatbot flashback to the time the godfather of A.I. gave me his predictions on how the world of work is evolving.
 
And from my archive, I'll introduce you to God's Jewish warriors standing in the way of peace now. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR: So you trick them. You kind of lied about your intentions. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn't call it lying. It was more like we got the land in a roundabout way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:42:18]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
AMANPOUR: Welcome back. 
 
76 years ago this week, Israel became an independent state. Although this year the celebration was overshadowed by the grief of the October 7th attack. For Palestinians it marks the Nakba or catastrophe when 700,000 people were displaced from their homes.
 
At the heart of this conflict is the contested Holy Land and all too often those battling to keep it have resorted to violence. More than seven months into the latest Gaza war, 30 miles away in the occupied West Bank, settlement expansion and settler violence continues to surge.
 
From my archive this week, we look at an excerpt from my special report about God's Warriors and their strategy to settle what they believe to be Israel's biblical land, a lasting and central obstacle to any viable resolution.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: It would take another war in 1973 to transform the small band of settlers into a religious and political mass movement that would change the face of the Holy Land This time, Israel fought an uphill battle after a surprise attack by
 
 Arab armies on the Jewish Holy day Yom Kippur. Even though victorious Israelis now felt vulnerable.
 
KAREN ARMSTRONG, AUTHOR, "THE BATTLE FOR GOD": A certain complacency had set in after the 1967 victory in Israel.
 
AMANPOUR: religious historian Karen Armstrong.
 
ARMSTRONG: Israelis thought they were invincible. This gave them a real shock and they felt acutely their isolation.
 
And among the religious, it was felt that secular Zionism had failed.
 
"God's Jewish Warriors" claimed to have the solution. An all-out campaign to settle the West Bank. Their movement took a name, Gush Emunim, the bloc of the faithful.
 
One of the most faithful, Yehuda Etzion. When he saw this Israeli military being built high on a West Bank hill, Etzion and his friends convinced the contractor to hire them. Then they moved into these dilapidated buildings near the job site. 
 
Using the name of a biblical town in the Book of Joshua, they posted a sign "Ofra Work Camp".
 
Was it really a camp for workers.
 
YEHUDA ETZION, GOD'S JEWISH WARRIORS (through translator): That and more. We came here to build a settlement. 
 
AMANPOUR: So you tricked them. You kind of lied about your intentions. 
 
ETZION: I wouldn't call it lying. It was more like we got the land in a roundabout way.
 <br>[11:49:49]
 
AMANPOUR: Roundabout and like the earliest schemes, effective.
 
Ofra grew and so did popular support for the settlers.
 
GERSHOM GORENBERG, AUGHOR, "THE ACCIDENTAL EMPIRE": Remember this is the 1970s, this is the same time that Islamic radicalism is rising in the Muslim world. It's the same time that fundamentalists are returning to politics in the United States. Religion, which had been written off as a factor in the politics of the modern world, was suddenly returning to the political arena.
 
AMANPOUR: In Israel, a right when leader named Menachem Begin was elected prime minister in 1977 on a platform of keeping what the religious believed was the biblical land of Israel. It was a victory for God's Jewish Warriors. 
 
And at Ofra, a new sign went up. "Keep off the grass." The settlers were here to stay. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANPOUR: And since 2007 when I reported from there, the population of Ofra has grown to over 3,500. It's just one of hundreds of illegal settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, home to around seven 700,000 settlers in all. 
 
And despite worldwide condemnation, Benjamin Netanyahu's extremist, right-wing coalition today continues to advance plans for thousands of new houses in the West Bank. And it also calls for Jewish resettlement of Gaza when this war what ends.
 
It's a all part of a political agenda aimed at undermining any prospect of peace with the Palestinians.
 
So we hope that this little bit of context helps to understand where we are today. 
 
And when we come back another giant leap for artificial intelligence. How super sophisticated chatbots are blurring the lines between human and machine.
 <br>[11:51:52]

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR: That was a clip from the 2013 movie "Her" about a man who falls in love with his A.I. assistant. 
 
Well, that might not be movie sci-fi for much longer after another bombshell in the artificial intelligence arms race. OpenAI unveiled its most advanced chatbot yet this week called ChatGPT 4.0 which can imitate human-like conversations and interpret documents, videos, and images.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey ChatGPT.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, there. What's up? How can I brighten your day today? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ok. Yes. So I'm going to show you a selfie of what I look like and then I'd
 
 like you to try to see what emotions I'm feeling based on how I'm looking. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sounds like a fun challenge. Go ahead and show me that selfie and I'll put my emotional detective hat on. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ok. So there's me. So what kind of emotions do you think I'm feeling? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It seems like I'm looking at a picture of a wooden surface. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, you know what? That was the thing I sent you before. Don't worry. I'm not actually a table. 
 
Ok. So take a take another look. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That makes more sense. There we go it looks like you're feeling pretty happy and cheerful with a big smile and maybe even a touch of excitement. 
 
Whatever's going on, it seems like you're in a great mood.

AMANPOUR: It is extraordinary and Microsoft has spent billions of dollars embedding OpenAI technology into its products and rivals like Meta and Google are also working on their own chatbots and already rolling out new A.I. features. 
 
Now back in February Microsoft A.I. CEO Mustafa Suleiman predicted that we were on the verge of the most productive decade in human history.

MUSTAFA SULEIMAN, CEO, MICROSOFT A.I.: This is fundamentally a labor- replacing technology in the long term. In the medium-term over the next decade, it's going to be labor-augmenting. It will make people smarter, more productive, more efficient with their time, more accurate with their engagements in working in an everyday office or organization.
 
But in the very long term, that same A.I. is going to learn to do those tasks more effectively than a regular human. And that on its face should drive an enormous amount of value. That is good for everybody. 
 
We're going to see the most productive decade in the history of our species. We're able to do much, much more with less. The question is, how does that value get redistributed? And that's the age-old challenge. 
 
If we leave that just to the market to its own devices over the next two or three, or four decades, then we will see what we've seen in the last five decades, which is the returns to capital compound far more quickly than labors' wages can grow. In fact, we've actually seen a stagnation of wages over the last four decades.
 
And we've seen massive growth and concentration in capital. And this is a tool that shifts value from labor to capital because an A.I. is essentially a capital form of labor. It's an intelligent interactive dynamic interface that gets things done just like a project manager or an assistant gets things done.

AMANPOUR: So what happens to jobs and people in the decades after this revolution? That is obviously occupying regulators' minds right now or it should be.
