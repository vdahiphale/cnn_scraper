CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Callie Weems. According to a GoFundMe that was set up by the family and some friends, Callie was a new mother and she leaves behind a 10-month-old daughter. Now, according to her family, she loved her child and everyone saw her, in their words, being a "phenomenal mom."
 
The second person that was killed was 62-year-old Shirley Kay Taylor. Her daughter, Angela, said that she was the hardest working woman she knew and that she was a great person. 50-year-old Roy Sturgis, he also died in the shooting. We're told that he leaves behind a daughter and two sisters. And 81-year-old Ellen Shrum was the oldest victim. According to her family, Ellen worked for a time as a cashier for a few months at the store where this shooting happened. She leaves behind her husband, three children, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
 
Now, over the weekend, as all of these families grieved, we learned more about the shooting, including the actions that Callie took all in an effort to try to save the lives of others.

COLONEL MIKE HAGAR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY:  During the incident, we observed the very best and the very worst of humanity. As an example, instead of fleeing from the obvious danger, Callie Weems began using her training as a nurse to render aid to a gunshot victim and unfortunately, became a victim herself as a result of her selfless actions.
 
The actions of the suspect were the most cowardly, pathetic actions imaginable, as he was literally preying on defenseless victims, the majority of which were female.

SUAREZ:  Two police officers were also hurt in the shooting. Both of them are expected to be OK. As for the gunman, Sara, as you noted, the 44-year-old was taken into custody and he is expected in court later today to face a number of charges including capital murder.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. Carlos Suarez, thank you so much for your reporting this morning. John.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. Happening now, a flood emergency in Iowa has forced hundreds of people from their homes. This morning, 22 counties are under a federal disaster request as rivers reach all- time record highs. Some areas saw a month's worth of rain in just three days, and the threat's not over. Let's get right to Meteorologist Elisa Raffa with the very latest. What are you seeing?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  John, we still have flood warnings in effect, not because it's still raining, but because we're still so waterlogged, the rivers are aggravated from Mankato down over towards Sioux Falls in South Dakota, Northwest Iowa, and we have flood warnings running down the Missouri River from Sioux City down to Omaha.
 
Because look at these rain totals. In just three days, we have this swath of 10 to 15 inches of rain in parts of South Dakota, Northwest Iowa, a big swath there of some four-to-six-inch totals or more. I mean, we're talking 17-inch totals in parts of South Dakota, a foot of rain in Davis, South Dakota, a foot also in Rock Rapids, Iowa.
 
We're talking about well more than a month's worth of rain. That's why we still have about 50 rivers that are still at major and moderate flood stage. Again, as I mentioned, we're just still so waterlogged and aggravated. John.
 
BERMAN:  And I know the heat's a little better for us here in the northeast, but that's not the case everywhere, is it?
 
RAFFA:  Yes, you get a little bit of a break because of the front that you had come through yesterday, but that heat dome basically just kind of nudged itself back to the west. So, we still have heat advisories for that heat index up to 110 degrees from the Dakotas all the way down to the Gulf Coast. I mean, we're talking about more than 1,000 miles of area covered here of these heat alerts.
 
Look at some of these temperatures today. 98 degrees in Oklahoma City, Dallas as well could be nearing triple digits in Kansas City. Sweltering in the heat in Atlanta, 98 degrees. There's that little bit of a break that you get from that front from yesterday from the mid- Atlantic up into the northeast, 80 degrees in New York.
 
But as we go through the next couple of days, we'll still have this heat dome where more than 77 percent of Americans, that's more than 245 million people, will have that temperature at 90 degrees or hotter. We could be looking at more than 200 records falling, both daytime highs and overnight lows, because in some places you don't drop below 80 degrees at night. So, really just getting no relief.
 
Here's a look at temperatures for the next three days up near triple digits. In Atlanta, about 10 degrees above the average. Again, this is not normal. Oklahoma City is well up near triple digits. 89 degrees is your average temperatures, nearing that century mark in Memphis as well.
 
After you guys get a little bit of a break in New York and D.C., notice the temperatures do come back up into low and middle 90s by Wednesday. So, some of that heat does come back. That means that that heat risk could be exceptional for some places, especially across the Southern Plains, where we're looking at heat index values up to 110. So, you really want to watch out for the signs and symptoms of heat sickness. Check on kids, elderly, and pets. John.
 
BERMAN:  Yes, not good, not comfortable, not healthy. Elisa Raffa, thank you very much for that. Sara.

SIDNER:  All right. This morning, there's growing concern among Democrats that President Biden is struggling to maintain a key demographic for his path to re-election, Jewish voters. As Israel's war against Hamas continues in Gaza and amid a sharp rise in antisemitism, several Jewish leaders have privately complained to our CNN reporter that they have not seen enough direct engagement from the Biden camp since the Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7th. And as the president tries to shore up their support, the Trump's campaign is working overtime to try to capitalize on potential opening there.
 
CNN's Isaac Dovere has that latest reporting. Isaac, what is the Biden administration doing to try to deal with these concerns from Jewish voters?
 
EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, look, this is happening on the government level and on the political level, but as you said, there are a lot of feelings, a lot of concerns about where the policy is on Israel and the situation there, but also, about this rise in antisemitic incidents, even last night or yesterday during the day in Los Angeles, with a protest outside of a synagogue there, and a feeling like there is a concerning level of antisemitism in among the progressive left that is turning some people away from their commitment to Joe Biden and part of this growing trouble that he seems to have in knitting together the coalition that he's going to need for November.
 
Of course, we are looking at a situation where in a number of battleground states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, the number of Jewish voters is larger than the margin of victory. So, it's just, as I said, another part of this coalition that Joe Biden needs to keep together and is hoping to with the work that he's doing over the course of the next couple months.
 
SIDNER:  Yes. Right in your piece, you use the word politically homeless, that's what the quote was from some of these Jewish voters. I'm curious how vice president -- the vice president's husband, Doug Emhoff, is playing into this to try and help with these concerns.
 
DOVERE:  Yes. Well, Vice President Kamala Harris' husband is Jewish himself and he has taken a leading role in this both yesterday in government kind of work at the groundbreaking for the new Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where that shooting happened in 2018 and stepping up that way.
 
But also, politically. I was, just two weeks ago, at an event in in New York at Russ &amp; Daughters, the famous smoked fish emporium for a Jewish themed fundraiser, and Emhoff talking about his real sense of purpose and burden in a way of leading the Jewish response to what's going on here. Talking about Donald Trump as a known anti-Semite. Firing back at him in a direct way, a more direct way than you've seen many of other people do it.
 
And that's going along with other leading Democrats. People like Josh Shapiro, also an observant Jew himself, and the governor, obviously, of a key state. He's telling me that there is a tradition that he puts Donald Trump in that goes from Pharaoh to Hitler to Kim Jong Un. And obviously, Pharaoh and Hitler, very specifically chosen names there of dictators, he's told me who have been very bad for minority rights and of course, would -- in his mind, would be very bad for American Jews if Donald Trump were to get a second term.
 
SIDNER:  Isaac Dovere, thank you for all of your reporting on this, a very interesting article that you've written.
 
DOVERE:  Thank you.
 
SIDNER:  All right. Today marks two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade, ending the federal right to an abortion. This will no doubt be one, if not the biggest issue for voters coming in November. Vice President Harris this morning is making that message clear to voters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  And the fact that after the Dobbs decision came down, that laws have been proposed and passed, that as Hadley has said, make no exceptions even for rape or incest. Think about what these extremists are saying to a survivor of a crime of violence to their body, a survivor of a crime that is a violation of their body, and to say to that survivor, and you have no right or authority to make a decision about what happens to your body next. That's immoral.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  All right. Joining me now Republican strategist Brian Robinson and CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona. Thank you both for showing up early this morning for us.
 
You just heard Kamala Harris talking there about abortion, the effects of the overturning of Roe versus Wade. Today does mark that two-year since that was overturned in the Dobbs decision. I want to go to what Donald Trump has said on the issue of abortion and have you all react to it. Listen to this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  In my first four years, we totally transformed the federal bench. Thanks to these justices, we have also achieved what the prolife movement fought to get for 49 years. And we've gotten abortion out of the federal government.
 <br>[07:40:00]
 
And I believe in exceptions for the life of the mother, rape and incest. Some people do, I think most people do actually, but some people don't. You have to go with your heart, but you have to also remember you have to get elected.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  The key words there, you have to go for your heart, but you also have to get elected. First to you, Brian. What are Republicans going to do, because this is a question that is undoubtedly going to come up during the debate, to sort of counter this momentum from Democrats on this particular issue?
 
BRIAN ROBINSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, this, for now, as Trump has pointed out, is no longer a federal issue. This is something that's being decided at the state level, and to some degree, it's already baked in. We have had state level elections here in this country since some of these laws have taken place. Whether -- and even in these swing states like, you know, Arizona and Georgia, Wisconsin. These are places where it's sort of been vetted a little bit and voters have made their decisions on the local level.
 
I don't know that it's going to make a huge difference in the federal election. If you were in a blue state, you are perfectly happy with the abortion laws in your state. They're very liberal. It doesn't get attention like how liberal some of those laws have become since this went into effect. But I don't think on the federal level this is going to be top of mind. It's crime, the economy. And if Democrats are talking about something that's not top of mind, it's a strategic blunder.
 
SIDNER:  Maria, do you buy that this is not top of mind for voters?
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes, good luck with that. That is exactly what Republicans thought in 2022 and look what happened. And this is, I think, going to be even more of an issue in terms of mobilization and energy on the Democratic side.
 
But here's a problem that Republicans are facing. It's not just Democrats, it's not just progressives. I have talked to many Republican women who have said to me, Maria, I'm going to vote for the Democrat. I'm not even going to tell my husband. I'm not going to tell my family. But I do not want to live in a country where I need to raise my daughter in a way where she's going to have less rights than I do.
 
And so, this is an issue that is very personal, not just for women, but for their families as well. And this is where Donald Trump is going to be in trouble as well as Republicans, because this is what they do not understand. They cannot take this issue and split it by saying, oh, blue states this, red states this, when one in three women live in states that have these draconian extremist laws that literally put their lives in danger.
 
They have to -- in order to look for reproductive care, they have to travel four states over, they have to spend money. So, the women that are most affected by this are women from poor communities, black women, Latino women, Native American women. And so, again, this is something that Republicans are really going to have to contend with because, again, they can't say, oh, well, this is good for these states, this is good for those states, because so many women are living in these states where they're literally putting their lives in danger.
 
And so, when Donald Trump says, oh, this -- you know, we've fixed this now, this has gone to the states. He says he's for -- an exception for the life of the mother, but then he is supporting these states that have these draconian laws. And so, that's what Democrats are going to be focused on.
 
SIDNER:  Maria, Brian did bring up the two things that are at top of polls when Americans are asked, it's inflation, what they're paying for things, and immigration. What does Biden have to do on the debate stage to try and convince people that he is the better candidate for those two things, which people are truly complaining about?
 
ROBINSON:  Well, you're right. Those are the number one issues, and that -- and those are things they should be focusing on, but they're going to be out there talking about abortion, which is much further down the list of voters' concerns. That's why I think it's a strategic blunder.
 
If abortion is your top issue, we know what you are, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican. If that is your number one thing, your vote is already settled. You're not really up for grabs. But people are talking about immigration, they're talking about crime, they're talking about the cost of living. And voters trust Donald Trump more than they trust President Biden on this.
 
Biden so much wants to go out there and brag about the macroeconomic data, but that is not what people are feeling when they go to the grocery store, when they try to buy a home with high interest rates. He's got to really balance the desire to brag on his record with the way that people are feeling. He can't tell people that they're wrong about the economy. It doesn't work.
 
SIDNER:  Maria, that question was for you, but Brian jumped in.
 
CARDONA:  That's OK.
 
SIDNER:  But Brian making his point, do you agree with that, that he really has to show some empathy to the people who are saying, look, these prices are killing us?
 <br>[07:45:00]
 
CARDONA:  I actually do agree with that. And he has been doing that. He doesn't go out there and say that people are wrong for how they're feeling about the economy. What he is saying, and what he'll do on Thursday and he'll do throughout the election cycle, is say, look, here is what we have done. We have brought back the economy from the brink of destruction due to Donald Trump, and here is what we are doing to continue to make sure that everyone feels the benefits of this economy.
 
He'll talk about the jobs that he has created, record number of jobs. He'll talk about additional jobs that need to be created for those who still want and need a job. He'll talk about what he's done to keep costs down. He'll talk about what Donald Trump wants to do that economists have said will jack up inflation, will cost families more, will take away families' health care, will hit families in their pocketbook. So, he is absolutely ready and willing and excited about making that contrast in terms of where the economic plans lie.
 
On immigration, Sara, I think it's the same thing. President Biden can talk about how Republicans have only wanted to weaponize this issue when they were faced with an opportunity to actually fix a huge part of this in terms of border security, they turned their back on their own bill, that says to the American people that this is a candidate and a party that has no interest whatsoever in actually solving the issue and that it's Democrats is the ones who know how to solve the issue with a common sense, balanced approach, of strong border security and expanded legal pathways, which is what the president has done through his recent executive actions.
 
SIDNER:  He certainly tried to thread that needle. Maria Cardona, thank you so much as well as Brian Robinson. And I'm sure you'll be watching the debate along with all the rest of us. John.
 
CARDONA:  Thanks, Sara.
 
ROBINSON:  Thank you.
 
BERMAN:  Right. I can't believe this didn't come up in the political panel there because there is a major Taylor Swift news this morning. These surprise royal selfies. But that's not all. We had this surprise dancing guest on the London stage. CNN's Max Foster is with us now with the results of your CNN investigation, Max. What have you learned about all this?
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Deep analysis coming from me, John, as you'd expect on Taylor Swift. But I'm going to start with this picture because this is the royal couple meeting a guy called William. He's a local guy. Brought his kids along.
 
You know, everyone is talking about Taylor Swift. I had so many friends that went to this -- one of their gigs. They started on Friday. William went to see them on Friday. And -- that's not the picture. It's the one with Kelce. There you are.
 
And the big highlight really was that Kelce, I'm speaking to all my experts on this issue, John. And the fact that Taylor has never posted a picture of Kelce before. So, this is seen as a bit of a coming out for them. And then he appears on stage as part of the act. And he wasn't announced. It all sort of bubbled up on social media when they realized who he was, but he actually put on some of her makeup and carried her off. As you can see there.
 
I mean, fever really has hit London. And the only way that could hit London, I'll take you to the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.

FOSTER:  So, there you are. That was when Taylor's first concert was on Friday and you can't get a better welcome than that. Everyone's very excited about it and it's completely sold out. Of course, people are desperate to get tickets.
 
BERMAN:  That is remarkable. And I'm looking at the Travis Kelce video here. At least he was dressed up. I mean, at least he respected the formal nature of your culture, Max. I'm glad that he was wearing the top hat and the tails.
 
FOSTER:  Belding in.
 
BERMAN:  Yes, he does. He does blend in. And I'm also glad that you have a lot of friends. Just full stop. I mean, you said you had a lot of friends who were at the Taylor Swift concert, so it is nice to know. It is nice to know you're well loved.
 
I'm going to change the subject here very quickly, Max. I do understand there is news about Princess Anne, an injury. What have you learned there?
 
FOSTER:  Yes. So, the king's sister is in hospital with concussion, but we're told she's well and she is expected to recover by the end of the week. She's got a state called Gatcombe. It's in the west of England. She is a -- you know, a very keen horsewoman. She was in the Olympics. She rides a lot. But apparently, she was walking along the edge of the park, and we've had -- we're not being given all the detail, but, you know, I've read these statements to you over the years, haven't I, John, and they're all a bit cryptic.
 
But as we understand it, what happened was she was walking along, there were horses in the facility, and her royal highness' medical team say that her head injuries are consistent with a potential impact from a horse's head or legs. So, while she wasn't riding, she does seem to have had some sort of incident with a horse. And she is in hospital recovering. The king's been informed, but they're not too concerned about her. They expect her to be out by the end of the week.
 <br>[07:50:00]
 
BERMAN:  All right. Thanks for the update on that, Max. Appreciate it. Sara.
 
SIDNER:  All right. We've got more on the Entertainment Beat. Their songs are known around the world and they could be selling for a champion size amount of money.

SIDNER:  Hit after hit after hit. Queens iconic music catalog that includes classics like "Bohemian Rhapsody," "Another One Bites the Dust," "We Will Rock You," and of course, "We are the champions," you just heard that they, reportedly in the process of being acquired by Sony music for over $1 billion. Yes, a billion. This deal would set the record the biggest single artist catalog sale in history, more than doubling the $500 million the boss Bruce Springsteen sold his for back in 2001. Queen and Sony have not responded to CNN's requests for comment.
 
All right. Just ahead, the protests are raging between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Los Angeles with police, as you see, they're struggling to keep both sides apart. We'll tell you that story coming up.
 
And beloved Hawaiian lifeguard known around the world for his surfing killed in a shark attack. Those details, next.

BERMAN:  New reaction this morning after climate protesters stormed the 18th green of the PGA Tour's Travelers Championship. Our Coy Wire has the details.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Six climate activists face criminal mischief and trespassing charges after causing a chaotic scene at the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut. They ran onto the green while the leaders were lining up their putts on the final hole of regulation, leaving a red and white powdery substance on the grass. Several of the protesters were wearing shirts that read, no golf on a dead planet. The play was delayed a little over five minutes. As world number one Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim waited to putt out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, TWO-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION:  It was definitely a bit weird. You know, I saw one person out of the corner of my eye and then I saw about five police officers sprinting around. From my point of view, they got it taken care of pretty dang fast. And so, we were very grateful for that. I don't -- it seemed to go by really quickly to us.
 
But, you know, when something like that happens, you don't really know what's happening. So, it can kind of rattle you a little bit just because there's people running around the green and there's police officers running around the green and you don't know if they're peaceful. You don't know what they're doing. It's -- you have no idea what's going on. And so, it can be a bit stressful. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Now, Scheffler would go on to win the tournament with a par on the first playoff hole. He's now the first player since Tiger Woods since 2009 to record six or more victories in a single season and the first since Arnold Palmer in 1962 to win that many before July. Back to you.
 
BERMAN:  All right. Coy Wire. Thank you very much. Sha'Carri Richardson has qualified for her first Olympic Games after winning the 100-meter final Olympic trials. Richardson won with the fastest time of 100 in the world this year. Back in 2021, Richardson was expected to be one of the stars of the Tokyo Olympic Games, but she wasn't allowed to compete after accepting a one month ban for testing positive for THC.
 
A veteran lifeguard, surfing legend, and actor in Hawaii has died following a shark attack. Honolulu first responders had to use a jet ski to bring Tamayo Perry to shore where he was pronounced dead. The 49-year-old was also an actor, appearing in "Blue Crush," "Pirates of the Caribbean 4," and "Charlie's Angels 2." Officials told CNN he was a lifeguard loved by all.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KURT LAGER, ACTING CHIEF, OCEAN SAFETY DEPARTMENT:  Tomayo's personality was infectious and as much as people loved him, he loved everyone else more. Our condolences go out to Tomayo's family and to the entire lifeguard Ohana.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN:  Honolulu's mayor says Perry will never be forgotten. Sara.
 
SIDNER:  All right. NASA says it will be at least a week before the Boeing Starliner capsule returns to Earth. The Starliner launched on June 5th for its mission to the International Space Station. The entire trip was only expected to last a week, but a series of issues has delayed the capsule's return.
 
CNN's Tom Foreman is joining us now. Boeing getting a grilling for its aircraft here on Earth. And now, this issue, what are some of the things that are stopping this capsule from being able to take those astronauts and bring them home?
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Two key things, helium leaks and problems with the thrusters. The two may be related, we don't really know. The problem is, they developed these helium leaks as they got up into the air there. One of the thrusters went out, some others were then shut down. Now, only one out of 24, I believe, is believed to be not working.
 
All of this is tied to the ability to undock and safely deorbit, to get back up to ground here safely. So, if this were considered a test drive, they're halfway through the test drive and now, they're kind of parked. Several issues here that are really important. Remember, when a spacecraft like this is docked to the ISS, that spacecraft is serving a very important role. It is, in a sense, an emergency exit for anybody who's --
