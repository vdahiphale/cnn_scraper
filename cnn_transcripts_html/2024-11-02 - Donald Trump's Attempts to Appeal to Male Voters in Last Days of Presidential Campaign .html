CHRIS WALLACE, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello again and welcome. It's time to break down the big stories with some smart people. 
 
Today, we're asking, with Election Day almost here, some Donald Trump supporters worry about his closing message. Why is he manning up so much? 
 
Then, trash talk twists. Will the Puerto Rico insult turn Biden gaffe help or hurt Kamala Harris's chances? 
 
And later, lock the clock. The yearly ritual dozens of states and some on our panel want to stop. 
 
The gang is here and ready to go. Sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. 
 
Up first, with just three days to go until Election Day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are still locked in a dead heat, according to the latest CNN national poll. As they barnstorm the swing states, Donald Trump has been focusing on his male MAGA base, ramping up inflammatory rhetoric with some supporters fearing will turn off women voters. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She is a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? 
 
WALLACE:  Donald Trump taking aim at a fierce critic, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney. 
 
TRUMP:  Let's see how she feels about it when the guns are on her face. WALLACE:  Cheney responded, comparing Trump to a dictator and saying
 
 women will not be silenced. 
 
TRUMP:  I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them. 
 
WALLACE:  As Election Day nears, Trump has been appearing with controversial figures popular with young men who often trash talk Kamala Harris. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country. 
 
WALLACE:  Add to that Elon Musk's pro Trump super PAC which aired but then pulled an ad which called Harris a "C word" after facing backlash. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A big old C word.
 
WALLACE:  Some of Trump's female supporters fear his courting the, quote, bro vote could backfire. 
 
NIKKI HALEY, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is not a time for them to get overly masculine with this bromance thing that they've got going. Fifty-three percent of the electorate are women. Women will vote. 
 
WALLACE:  While Democrats hope that Trump's strategy will help put them over the top. 
 
REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN, (D-MI):  I think we have going on right now in the state of Michigan what I call the secret women's vote. 
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
WALLACE:  Here with me today, podcaster, journalist, and author Kara Swisher, Reihan Salam, president of the Manhattan Institute and "National Review" contributing editor, "New York Times" journalist and "The Interview" podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and conservative pollster and "New York Times" opinion writer Kristen Soltis Anderson. Welcome back, everyone. Reihan, can the bro vote carry Trump to victory? 
 
REIHAN SALAM, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, "NATIONAL REVIEW":  I think it can make a really big difference. Younger voters have always been a vulnerability for Republicans and in particular for Donald Trump. Yet there has been a widening gap among young men, and I think that there has generally been a decline in stigma around backing Trump especially among men. And I think that could make a big difference. 
 
WALLACE:  But when you hear the tone this bro appeal is taken, hypermasculine, somewhat insulting to women, do you worry about that? 
 
SALAM:  Well, what I worry about is the fact that if you look at democracies around the world incumbent governments are getting shellacked. There is basically no chance of a shellacking in this case. This is the closest election in modern polling history, and that's partly because Donald Trump hasn't done with what Nikki Haley recommended. Try to soften edges, try to bring people into your coalition. He hasn't done that. But he has made significant gains among men. And the thing about gender gap is that it has two dimensions. 
 
WALLACE:  Kara, can Trump win with the "bro vote", and what do you make of the latest comment from Trump about Liz Cheney? 
 
KARA SWISHER, PODCAST HOST, "PIVOT" AND "ON":  Well, it's terrible what he said, but I think he tries to do this every day, does something shocking so we're all obsessed with the crazy thing grandpa is saying, what he says. This is very violent and dangerous. And I'm sure Liz Cheney, who already was getting death threats, is getting more of them. It's really irresponsible, but he doesn't care, because he really is a misogynist. I think pretty much that tells the story. He is comfortable doing things like that and then using some excuse, like, what I really meant to say was. But what he really meant to say was he hates Liz Cheney. And so that's what he was doing. I don't think it helps him in any way. 
 
And as to the bros, as I am a worldwide expert of bros, especially tech bros, I think they don't vote with as much enthusiasm as women do. 
 <br>[10:05:05]
 
And I think it's a huge mistake. I thought Nikki Haley was absolutely on point this week saying that, and I think she's issuing a warning, and given how many people she got to vote for, he should listen. But he's not. 
 
WALLACE:  Kristen, what do you make of the bro vote, and is it a way to win this election? 
 
KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CONSERVATIVE POLLSTER AND "NEW YORK TIMES" CONTRIBUTING OPINION WRITER:  I think the bigger problem Republicans are going to have is around Dobbs rather than just about Trump and his tone.
 
WALLACE:  Dobbs being the decision to overturn Roe. 
 
ANDERSON:  Dobbs being the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Think about this. Donald Trump, right before the election in 2016, the "Access Hollywood" tape came out. We're talking about misogyny, bad treatment of women. This was shocking, it was appalling, and yet Donald Trump, he didn't win women in that election, but he didn't lose them by massive margins. And the polls that we have seen show him not doing well with women, but because, as Reihan noted, the gender gap goes both ways, it feels like he's gambling. He could lose female voters by 10 to 15 points, but if he runs up the score with men in a way that he has not tried to before, he can counterbalance that. 
 
WALLACE:  Lulu?
 
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, "NEW YORK TIMES" JOURNALIST AND PODCAST HOST:  I think that it is a huge miscalculation. I think the "bro vote" is not going to come through for him. And we're seeing in early voting women voting at much higher numbers than men, especially in a place like Pennsylvania. I think it's 12 points over men at this point. So I think the numbers don't lie. 
 
I think the other issue that he is going to be facing is that there really was an impact among Latinos with this comment that he made about Puerto Rico being trash. 
 
WALLACE:  We're talking about that in the next segment. 
 
One Trump backer who is popular with young men is Robert Kennedy Jr. And this week both Trump and Kennedy talked about Kennedy's role if the former president is re-elected. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The key that I think that President Trump has promised me is control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH, and a few others. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALLACE:  Lulu, is RFK Jr. a good choice, a reassuring choice for health? 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  No. And I think this is really important, because now what is starting to come into view is what exactly a Trump administration might look like and how extreme it really might be. There was the Elon thing about letting him run wild trying to reform federal spending, and now there is this. 
 
Listen, he is an anti-vaxxer. Let me just give you one statistic here. If you don't like vaccines, think about this. Polio used to infect, kill 500,000 people a year before there was a vaccine. Now it's in the hundreds. Vaccines are safe. They have changed the health prospects of children and people across the world. The idea that we are somehow going to be throwing that out is crazy. 
 
WALLACE:  I was in the first generation that got the polio, the Salk vaccine, and we were all terribly grateful for it.
 
Kristen, RFK Jr.'s scientific bona fides aside, does Trump saying he's going to let RFK Jr. go wild on medicines and health, is that a good political strategy? 
 
ANDERSON:  So I wouldn't say he would be my first choice, and that's an understatement. But in terms of the politics of it, it's kind of strange the way you now have this coalition that used to be thought of as kind of the crunchy left, right? Organic, we don't trust big medicine. We don't trust big industries. And there is now this movement on the right that I think used to be thought of as this rump libertarian raw milk kind of group that is much bigger now as distrust in science, distrust in big anything has gotten to be a bigger deal on the right. 
 
There are now an awful lot of people, including some young women who fall right into the camp that might otherwise be very skeptical of Trump and Republicans on grounds like Dobbs who are saying, I am open to someone who is going to tell me I don't have to vaccinate my kids or et cetera. And I do think that that's not an insignificant piece of the electorate these days. 
 
WALLACE:  But Kara, yes, we are talking about politics. We're also talking about real and public health.
 
SWISHER:  Yes, real health, yes.
 
WALLACE:  And Howard Lutnick, a big businessman who was one of the co- chairs of the Trump transition team, went on air this week to basically argue that vaccines cause autism, which has been just wildly disproved. 
 
SWISHER:  Yes, it was really disturbing to see that on top of it. Having RFK Jr. in that -- the only people that we have, measles best best friend, I always call him that, because it's just, it's really irresponsible to do this. 
 
The other thing, and I know it sounds crazy, Trump has a lot of supporters in the pharmaceutical industry and everything else, they're going to push back on RFK Jr. 
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
So from a lot of perspectives, it is going to probably be some ugly fight if he in fact gets in that job. I don't even think he will pass the Senate. I just feel like he's --
 
WALLACE:  Well, but they are talking about him as a health czar, so he wouldn't have to actually go through confirmation. 
 
SWISHER:  Perhaps, but then he can't get anything done. Whether he can get something done is a big question.
 
WALLACE:  Kristen, final question. Election night could be election days or election weeks. We could be here for a while before we know who wins this presidential election. I'm going to ask you in the next segment about Harris, but what is your bellwether, what's going to be your early indicator you're going to looking at election night to see whether Trump is doing well or not? 
 
ANDERSON:  So I'm going to be looking at Bucks County, Pennsylvania. That's a county where Republicans and Democrats used to run pretty evenly. It's suburban Philadelphia. And yet it's the sort of place that Joe Biden began running a little bit more away with. Democrats have begun doing better there. It's more college-educated than your median place in Pennsylvania. If Donald Trump is losing that by big margins, that's going to be a big problem for him. WALLACE:  And if he's running pretty even? 
 
ANDERSON:  If he's running pretty even, he may be holding onto that more of that kind of white college-educated Romney era vote that I think some people are expecting. 
 
WALLACE:  In the final days of the campaign, everyone is analyzing the smallest change in the polls, some of which could increase good news for Kamala Harris. But is this last-minute momentum real? 
 
Plus, trust issues. We'll dig into the real concerns about claims of fraud before the ballots are even counted. 
 
And later, going bananas, the artwork on sale for $1 million, but you can buy it at a grocery store for a dollar. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:16:23]
 
WALLACE:  Like Donald Trump, Kamala Harris is spending this final weekend crisscrossing the battleground states, especially the blue wall where the latest polls show a slight edge for Harris in Michigan and Wisconsin, but still a dead heat in Pennsylvania. And her closing message was interrupted by a verbal gaffe from her boss. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENNIFER LOPEZ, SINGER:  You can't even spell "American" without "Rican." 
 
WALLACE:  Jennifer Lopez joining Kamala Harris in Las Vegas, keeping the focus on a comedian's racist joke during the Trump rally. 
 
LOPEZ:  It wasn't just Puerto Ricans who were offended that day. It was humanity and anyone of decent character. 
 
WALLACE:  J-Lo joins a swath of Puerto Rican celebrities who have come out for Harris since the Madison Square Garden moment. 
 
TONY HINCHCLIFFE, COMEDIAN:  There is literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico. 
 
WALLACE:  But the trash talk took a turn when President Biden said this in a call with a Latino voting group. 
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters, and his demonization seems unconscionable. 
 
WALLACE:  Biden clarifying his comment, saying he was describing the comedian's joke as garbage, not Trump supporters. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. WALLACE:  But Harris clearly distancing herself from Biden for the
 
 first time in her campaign, hoping that the presidents comment does not undercut her final message of unity. 
 
HARRIS:  Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. 
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
WALLACE:  Kara, after seeming to stall for a couple of weeks, do you think Kamala Harris has regained her moment? 
 
SWISHER:  Yes, I think there is a lot of energy happening now. It feels like her speeches are better, she has gotten better at it, as you would. This is a truncated election. But yes, I think she's doing really well in putting her messages through right now. There is just no time is the problem. 
 
And for the garbage thing, then Trump appeared in a garbage truck, almost fell over getting in, it looked like Mr. Bill standing in the weird jacket, so I think he took that, the Biden stuff away and moved it away, because everyone was focused on his outfit. 
 
WALLACE:  All right, we're going to that in a moment. Reihan, do you see any uptick for Harris in these closing days of the campaign? 
 
SALAM:  The big advantage that Harris and the Democrats have is that they are now the party of high propensity voters. They're the party of voters who have already banked their votes in many cases. So her game right now is to motivate her base, but also to demotivate potential voters for the other side. If this is a very low turnout election, then she has a much, much better chance of winning. I think that they feel pretty anxious and have good reason to feel very anxious. But I think that if you get people to not turn out at the polls, then she will have a fighting chance. 
 
WALLACE:  Her speech, and we played a clip of it there at the end, Lulu, on the Ellipses, at the same spot that Donald Trump gave his speech on January 6th before the riot, huge crowd, an estimated 75,000 people. Do you think that was effective? 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  I think it was effective. Listen, what she is trying to do is really showcase herself in these last few days while everyone is paying attention to her, everyone is focused on the election. People are actually voting right now, and so it is this kind of show up election where she is really trying to get people to show up for her. 
 
I think the Puerto Rico thing was a big moment, because, quite frankly, Latinos and Puerto Ricans, they don't like it if you trash their island. They take it very seriously, and they took it to heart. 
 <br>[10:20:03]
 
And when you bring together Bad Bunny and the Archbishop of San Juan, and J-Lo, this is a very big cross-section of Puerto Rican society condemning something, you know you have a problem. 
 
WALLACE:  All right, well let's dig down on that, because President Biden is not doing Harris any favors. She hasn't campaigned with him for weeks. The other day, he called for locking Trump up before quickly adding, politically lock them up. And after the garbage remark, Trump, as Kara said, did a photo op in garbage truck. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  That's like deplorable. This is deplorable for Hillary. And I think this is worse, actually. For Joe Biden to make that statement, it's really a disgrace. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALLACE:  Lulu, how big a burden is Biden? 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  It is -- he is now woman's burden. This is a typical thing where a woman has to clean up over a man's mess, and in this case, it's Kamala Harris cleaning up --  
 
WALLACE:  Reihan, I don't know if you take offense to that.
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Cleaning up over Biden's mess. He needs to stay in his office and be quiet. 
 
I will say this, I don't know if anyone really believes that he was saying that for real, that he has shown contempt for the people that support Donald Trump. Nothing that he has ever done and none of his policies have ever evinced that.
 
ANDERSON:  -- the people who are voting for Donald Trump. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Sure. 
 
ANDERSON:  As a base motivator, this is the bullet material. It is the sort of --
 
WALLACE:  Let her finish. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Yes, but then Donald Trump --  
 
ANDERSON:  Much to my chagrin, I am on all of these stupid text message fundraising email lists for both parties. And I will tell you the number of things that I have gotten that have been like, Joe Biden thinks you are garbage. This is the message that is being pumped into the bloodstream of the MAGA movement to make sure there is not a single Donald Trump leaning voter in America who is not told you've got to vote -- 
 
WALLACE:  So which do you think is more damaging? The joke about Puerto Rico being a floating island of garbage and how that hurts Trump and helps Harris, or Biden's remark about the supporters being garbage, whether the apostrophe is there or not, and how that hurts Harris? ANDERSON:  I think it hurt in different ways. I think the Biden garbage comments are just an extra base motivator. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  But they feel that already. 
 
ANDERSON:  But I think the Puerto Rico comments are damaging specifically because Trump's whole theory of how he is going to win this time is that he's doing better with Latino voters, he's doing better with black men. And this undercuts that massively.
 
SWISHER:  Also, I don't think Biden matters at all. I was sort of like, oh, he is still here. And then Trump always manages to make a mess of it. He wanders to the garbage truck, which is a weird visual. He's wearing orange, another weird visual. Everything is visual right now. 
 
SALAM:  I think President Biden matters more than a roast comedian.
 
SWISHER:  Yes, I understand, but I don't think people are paying attention to him. I think they are paying attention to Trump. 
 
WALLACE:  Let, go ahead, Reihan. 
 
SWISHER:  Let me just finish. He wanders over, he falls on the way there, and then says crazy things about Liz Cheney. He just sucks up all the oxygen. 
 
SALAM:  Yes, I think that basically you have a lot of voters who believe that there is a certain censoriously that's coming from the left, and the idea that we are elevating a warm-up act who tells rancid, wretched jokes and has been doing it for years. And I think that that may well have been a bad call. But the president of the United States actually has for four years been denouncing his political opponents, talking about ultra MAGA, invoking fascism when referring to people who are people who oppose his agenda. This is absolutely routine background noise, and this garbage remark is something that actually does remind people of it. 
 
SWISHER:  Trump makes, literally every hour Trump makes an offensive remark. 
 
WALLACE:  Let her --  
 
(CROSS TALK)
 
SWISHER:  Every hour Trump makes another offensive remark, one more offensive than the other, because one, he's addled, again, which you don't mind him being addled but you mind -- 
 
SALAM:  -- something that tells the truth, something that reveals the truth. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Reihan, you had Trump say that Mark Milley, General Mark Milley should actually shot for treason. You've had him now make these other comments about Liz Cheney again invoking warfare. 
 
WALLACE:  OK, we got it. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  So I don't understand how Biden misspeaking is somehow equal to that. 
 
SALAM:  The issue is, does it actually reflect something real and persistent? Does it reflect the sentiment that's real and persistent? For Donald Trump, when he's calling out war hawk, this is a real, persistent sentiment. And that's why, yes, of course he's going to get some pushback from it from war hawks. Similar, when Joe Biden is describing people as garbage, then taking a pause, that is going to be something that people are going to pay attention to. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  -- the language, the violent language, not for the sentiment.
 
WALLACE:  Wait, wait, we are running out of time in this segment, and I want to get to a fact. I asked you for your bellwether for Trump. What is your bellwether for Harris? What's going to be your early indicator on a long election night, things are either going well or not so well for Harris? 
 
ANDERSON:  So it's not actually in a battleground state. I was going to say it used to be a battleground in my home state of Florida. It's Osceola County where there is a very large and very rapidly growing Latino population, particularly Puerto Rican. 
 <br>[10:25:04]
 
It's the sort of place that Obama won by almost a two-to-one margin when he first ran. But Republicans have been closing the gap there. And if it's the sort of place where Harris can actually hold more Obama-like numbers, maybe these remarks really did make a difference. 
 
WALLACE:  The garbage remarks? 
 
ANDERSON:  The garbage remarks about Puerto Rico.
 
WALLACE:  We will see. 
 
More than 100 election related lawsuits already filed, some of which could get to the Supreme Court. Can Donald Trump count on the conservative majority there? 
 
Plus, statue scandal. We'll break down the big reveal that has got sports fans heated. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:30:15]
 
WALLACE:  Even before we get any election results, claims of voter fraud are already flying. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They have already started cheating in Lancaster. They've cheated. We caught them with 2,600 votes. No, we caught them cold. 
 
(BOOS)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALLACE:  Donald Trump seizing on reports about suspicious voter registration forms, not ballots in a Pennsylvania County. State election officials quickly dismissed the claims while also asking for patience in pushing against distortion of what's going on. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AL SCHMIDT, SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA:  Lancaster did what any other county would do, which is to investigate and make sure that potentially fraudulent voter registration applications are not processed. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALLACE:  Since July, more than 100 election lawsuits have been filed by groups associated with both political parties in more than half the states. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARC ELIAS, DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS LAWYER:  It is hard to wrap your head around how litigious this year has already been, and we have not yet even hit Election Day. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALLACE:  Add to that armies of poll watchers from both the Harris and Trump campaigns trained to monitor voting sites and flag any issues they think are suspicious, which leads us to wonder, Reihan, is trust in the election already gone? 
 
SALAM:  There is absolutely a lot of really deep distrust. One of the biggest problems is that a lot of our election systems are incredibly antiquated. If you look at the contrast between Florida and California, for example, one state where you typically have a pretty reliable, solid count on the night of an election, versus in California were literally in 2022 it took until after Thanksgiving to get a solid, reliable account. These are things that sap faith in the election system, whether you are in a blue or a red state, and there's a lot we need to do to ensure that the voter rolls are up-to-date and that people can get reliable results fast. 
 
WALLACE:  Not surprisingly, there has some been polling on this. Sixty-six percent of voters are at least somewhat confident the 2024 election will be conducted fairly. But there is a big gap in the electorate -- 87 percent of Harris voters feel that way, but only 44 percent of Trump supporters. 
 
Kara, how seriously has confidence in the election already been undermined? SWISHER:  He has been force-feeding them election lies the whole time
 
 about how it's -- if you keep telling people, whether the press is bad or elections are bad, you start to believe it. You just mix things up. He lost all the suits, he lost every single one of them. 
 
WALLACE:  You're talking back in 2020.
 
SWISHER:  Back in 2020, he just repeats it and repeats it and repeats it. And so they believe it over time, and that's why you see those numbers, because we are not being force-fed all this crap. And it really is crap. 
 
WALLACE:  Kristen, what's your biggest worry about election integrity this time? 
 
ANDERSON:  The good news is we are not in a global respiratory pandemic, so I'm hopeful the ballots will be counted quickly. But the longer counting takes, the more time there is for mischief. And by mischief I mean things like we had that example of the ballot box being burned out on the west coast. 
 
WALLACE:  It wasn't one, it was three. One in Oregon and two in Washington state. 
 
ANDERSON:  That kind of stuff is terrifying, because then what do you do if all of a sudden 1,000 ballots go up in flames and you have a state that is close as Florida was in year 2000? Add to that, then you've got generative A.I. where people can do all sorts of mischief that then sets new fires online. I am very --
 
SWISHER:  Mischief -- it's violence. 
 
WALLACE:  You are very concerned. 
 
ANDERSON:  Very concerned. I'm very concerned not that the election will be administered improperly, but that we are in a really tough place on trust that can be easily exploited by people who want to exploit it. 
 
SWISHER:  Yes, but that is violence, not mischief. It's violence is what's happening to these election workers who are getting threats and everything else. So it's a little more serious than just hijinks. The other thing is this was the plot on "Succession," just so you know. A couple of seasons ago, it was the same thing, the burning of ballots, things like that. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WALLACE:  Lulu -- I don't know. Lulu, is there anything that keeps you up at night in terms of concern of whether or not this is going to be a fair election, and whether people are going to trust it?
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  What's interesting to me is the flipside of what Reihan was saying. What you see on the left is a lot of concern that Donald Trump is going to try and steal the election as he did in 2020. And so there is a lot of theories about what he was talking about when he said that he had concocted a secret with the head of the --  
 
WALLACE:  The Speaker of the House.
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  The Republican Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. It hasn't clarified what he meant by that. There is a lot of writing and theories about what that may mean. 
 
And frankly, everyone is prepared for the election to be very litigious. The question is, is it going to be violent? That is the fear. That is the fear on the left and that is the fear on the right. 
 <br>[10:35:03]
 
WALLACE:  Then there is the Supreme Court which is already being drawn into election disputes. This week, the court's conservative majority allowed Virginia to resume a purge of its voter rolls to keep noncitizens from voting, even though by law, the activity must stop 90 days before an election. Lulu, can Trump count on the Supreme Court, which has three justices that he appointed, can he count on the court to side with him? 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  I don't know. I don't want to speculate on that because I don't want to feed into what has become a very, very perilous moment for the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court gets involved in the election and tries to tip the scales one way or the other in a way that half of this country sees as illegitimate, I think it will do serious damage not just to the court, but the very core of our democracy. So what I would say is that we are in a very dangerous situation if the court at this point after everything that has happened tries to get involved in this election in the way that you are suggesting. 
 
WALLACE:  Again, there is polling on this -- 44 percent of voters say that they trust the Supreme Court a great deal or a moderate amount to make the right decision about the 2024 election, which is not exactly voting confidence. But while 61 percent of Trump supporters feel that way, only 31 percent of Harris supporters do. 
 
Reihan, is Lulu's concern about the court of how it's perceived, because it will certainly get cases in this that go up to the court challenging various results, is the concern about the court legitimate? 
 
SALAM:  We do have a track record of Trump appointees, particularly Justice Barrett, pretty consistently taking stands against former President Trump. So I think that we reason to believe that they're going to fair-minded, thoughtful, and balanced about this. 
 
But also, there has been a campaign from Kamala Harris to undermine faith in the Supreme Court for some time. It has been very active, talk of court packing and other aggressive measures that are designed to remake the court. I think that that's a legitimate concern. 
 
To go to that Supreme Court decision regarding Virginia, I just want to say that there is an awful lot of concern about noncitizen voting. And look, trust, faith in elections is important. The appearance of things that --  
 
WALLACE:  Let me just --  
 
(CROSS TALK)
 
SALAM:  No, Chris, just give me one moment. 
 
WALLACE:  Let me just get into this for a second. There is a law that you can't be purging voter rolls 90 days before because they don't give people recourse. And as it turned out, some of the people that they purged, in fact, were citizens, and there were just clerical errors. The question isn't -- we all agree we don't want noncitizens voting. There is a question as to whether or not you should be doing it --
 
SALAM:  Chris, there was a case in Michigan --  
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Disenfranchising people right before an election.
 
SALAM:  Pardon me, there was a case in Michigan in which you had a noncitizen, we had a noncitizen who voted whose vote was tabulated, and then basically said, I want to request my ballot back. And then the county clerk in Washtenaw County said, oh, now we are going to prosecute you, because the person requested the ballot back. Normally we do not request --  
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  You are disenfranchising --  
 
SALAM:  Lulu, please. I would love to explain the context. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  There is no -- there is no proof --
 
WALLACE:  OK, folks, we have to leave it there, but I think we have our answer, which is there is concern about the court. 
 
Usually, more sleep is a good thing. So why are so many states trying to keep you from getting it? 
 
Plus, let's split it, the head scratching art sale that is driving some people bananas. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:43:13]
 
WALLACE:  Once again, it's time to get our group's yay or nay on some big talkers. Up first, don't forget to fall back tonight. Once again, at 2:00 a.m., clocks roll back one hour to standard time, which means you will get an extra hour of sleep. But not everyone likes the switch. At least 30 states have considered passing laws to keep daylight savings time year-round. Arizona and Hawaii stay on standard time. And in Congress, Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduces a bill every year to get rid of standard time across the country, but the bill never goes anywhere. Reihan, are you yay or nay on daylight saving time? SALAM:  I'm yay on keeping things exactly as they are. Back in the
 
 1970s, there was an experiment of rolling back this switching the clock, and basically, it was a disaster. It caused all sorts of productivity mishaps and what have you. Just let's not mess with something that is working just fine. Let's stick with it. 
 
WALLACE:  Kara, how do you feel about having to get up at 2:00 in the morning? I never understood why you couldn't get up at 8:00 or 9:00, to put your clock back? 
 
SWISHER:  This is the only time you'll hear it out of my mouth, but I agree with Marco Rubio on this one. It's ridiculous and confusing. And it doesn't really matter. I'm going to be getting up anyway early because my three-year-old -- 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  There are electric clocks that do this automatically now. You don't have to wake up --  
 
WALLACE:  This is my dad joke, and I say it every year, and it's a tradition that I make this stupid joke. My family finds it as entertaining as all of you do. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SWISHER:  We'll get you an Apple watch. 
 
WALLACE:  Next, the sports statue everyone is talking about. This week, the NBA's Miami Heat unveiled a statue of the team's legendary player, Dwyane Wade, which shows Wade celebrating a big victory, and fans immediately got heated, which most pointing to the statue's face, which they say doesn't looks anything like their beloved star. 
 <br>[10:45:03]
 
Instead, many say it looks like actor Lawrence Fishburn in the movie "The Matrix." TNT's Charles Barkley gave his take. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHARLES BARKLEY, FORMER NBA PLAYER:  If you made an ugly statue, that is what it would look like. That thing is awful. The statue was so bad they had to put all his stats behind it so you know who it was. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALLACE:  But Wade doesn't seem bothered, calling it an artistic version of a big moment. Lulu, are you yay or nay, as a resident of Miami, on Dwyane Wade's statue?
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  So first of all, yay on the statue, because we've got to love the Heat. But secondly, absolutely yay, because everything is an artistic interpretation and that was the artist's interpretation. And so it was lovely. 
 
WALLACE:  This isn't the first time this has happened. Check out this airport bust of soccer grate Cristiano Ronaldo, which was so reviled by his fans they had to replace it with this new one. Kristen, where are you on Dwyane Wade's, quote, likeness? 
 
ANDERSON:  Why are we as a society so bad at statues these days? Maybe we need to make art great again. This is -- I'm a nay on this. I'm pro-Dwyane Wade, but this statue is bad. Put me down with Charles Barkley. 
 
WALLACE:  Finally, art lovers are going bananas over a viral work of art named "Comedian", which is just a banana duct-taped to a wall. Seriously, folks. It was sold for $120,000 in 2019. Now, it's back up for sale and it's expected to for, wait for it, as much as $1.5 million. The bidder with the most appealing offer will go home with a banana, a roll of duct tape, and instructions on how to install the art. Kristen, yay or nay on the million-dollar banana? 
 
ANDERSON:  No, this is very connected to my views on the last issue. I am so reactionary on this. Make art beautiful again. I also want to know, how do they keep it from rotting? As the parent of a toddler, we have bananas in our household. They do not stay good for a long time. 
 
WALLACE:  Well, that's a very good question, and I happen to have the answer. Let me make it clear. The banana has to be replaced every two or three days, because bananas, as Kristen said, rot. And the artwork has been eaten twice in museums. One offender explained he was hungry. Kara, are you buying the banana? 
 
SWISHER:  No. ridiculous. It's just silly. I don't even know what to say here, Chris. It just gives you a chance to make banana jokes all over the place. So whatever, if it makes you happy, Chris. 
 
WALLACE:  That's not worth $1 million to me, but it's worth something. 
 
The panel is back with their takes on hot stories and what will be in the news before it's news. That's right after this break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:52:30]
 
WALLACE:  It's time for our panel's special takes on what's happening or predictions of what we should be looking out for. Lulu, hit me with your best shot. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  The Commonwealth Fund which was founded in 1918 or thereabouts is a nonpartisan sort of think tank charity, and it came out with a series of studies on gun violence deaths in the U.S. and comparing them the countries around the world. And you would be unsurprised to note that it is pretty shocking. The overall rate of firearms deaths in Mississippi was nearly twice that of Haiti. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama had higher fire arms death rates than Mexico, which brings me to the conclusion that Donald Trump is talking about these immigrants coming to the country and bringing a lot of crime. But actually, the crime here is already worse than some of the places that they are coming from. 
 
WALLACE:  Reihan, you are focused on one of the biggest factors in politics, which we didn't talk about so far, money. SALAM:  Absolutely. So if you look at Kamala Harris's principal
 
 campaign committee, it's raised over three times as much as Donald Trump's. If you look at the battleground House races, Democrats are outspending Republicans by more than two to one. These are extraordinary margins. If Republicans hold their own, if they manage to win, that is going to raise a lot of questions about the utility of all this campaign cash. 
 
Another thing I will add is that that money is more efficacious when it's raised through hard dollars, because you can get about three or four times as much airtime if you are a candidate buying those ads yourself than if it's a super PAC. This is a massive, unprecedented advantage, and Republicans are thinking hard about how to address it. 
 
WALLACE:  Kara, best shot?
 
SWISHER:  Tech companies had a spectacular quarter, all of them, this quarter, including Snapchat and Reddit, even the small ones. But what was striking was the time -- a lot of it was related to A.I. investments they're making. They're seeing some real upsurge in growth and everything through it. That said, you have yet to see the real benefits on revenue yet. They are spending enormous amounts of money to try to win here $30 billion to $40 billion for Meta, for example. The race really, the A.I. arms race really is on. 
 
WALLACE:  And very quickly, where are we going to see the big moneymaker? 
 
SWISHER:  We don't know yet. That's the thing. They are making these investments ahead of really knowing. Apple just introduced Apple Intelligence. We will see if it's useful yet. Underwhelming reports so far, but we will have to see where it pays off. But they are making these investments. 
 
WALLACE:  Kristen, bring us home. 
 
ANDERSON:  So we know that Donald Trump has been making a big play for young male voters and by doing so on podcasts, and then J.D. Vance making that circuit. 
 <br>[10:55:05]
 
But the Harris campaign struck back this week. Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, appeared on my favorite podcast, "The Ringer Fantasy Football Show." He talked about how he has been in a fantasy football league since, I believe, 1989, talked about drafting his team. Now, I personally feel very targeted by the Harris campaign because she's talked about how she likes Formula One, growing chili peppers, like all of my hobbies. It's leading me to believe they think that I might be the last undecided voter. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WALLACE:  So in ten seconds, you are telling me that you listen to "The Ringer Fantasy Football Show"? 
 
ANDERSON:  Multiple times a week during the football season. 
 
WALLACE:  And how is your fantasy football team doing? 
 
ANDERSON:  Exceptional. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WALLACE:  We're going to leave it there. Gang, thank you all for being here. Congratulations. 
 
And thank you for spending part of your day with us. We will see you right back here next week.
