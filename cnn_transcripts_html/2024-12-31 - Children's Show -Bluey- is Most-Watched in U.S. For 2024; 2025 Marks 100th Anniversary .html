JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST: Welcome back to CNN's coverage of New Year's Eve live from all around the world. We've just seen Sydney, Australia welcoming the New Year, ushering 2025 in in truly epic style. The city's Harbour Bridge and the Opera House lit up, truly lit up to introduce the new year.
 
Lynda Kinkade is in Sydney, was there witnessing that spectacular. I know she's going to bring us another iconic Aussie voice now, Linda, but oh boy, I'm sure the party is just getting warmed up there. 
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR: The party is well and truly warmed up. You can hear the music, people are dancing, and of course, those fireworks are just magical. I mean, it doesn't get better than this particular spot. Well, I want to go to another iconic Australian. 
 
Of course, 2024 was the most streamed show was the Aussie cartoon Bluey in America. In America grabbed about 35 billion minutes worth attention from audiences. And I want to play just a little bit of sound from that famous cartoon, Bluey. Listen.

BANDIT HEELER: What are you doing here? 
 
CHILLI HEELER: I don't know how to relax.
 
B. HEELER: Oh, come here. 
 
C. HEELER: It's harder than it looks. 
 
B. HEELER: I'll tell you what, you want to learn to relax? Go and get some tips from the masters.
 
BINGO HEELER: Yeah, a little bit this way. Wait, (inaudible)  back that way? 
 
BLUEY HEELER: Mom, watch this.
 
C. HEELER: Watch what? You guys are crazy. 
 
B. HEELER: My turn. 
 
C. HEELER: You kids just go about it, don't you? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Well, Bluey is a constant in my household with my three little kids. And now, I want to welcome the voice of Bluey's mom, Melanie Zanetti. She joins us live from Pennsylvania. Happy New Year.
 
MELANIE ZANETTI, ACTRESS: Happy New Year. 
 
KINKADE: So no one was more excited about the fact that I'm interviewing the voice of Bluey's Mum. They're my three girls who are aged eight to four. They are obsessed with the show. It's the biggest export in television. Yes, the biggest TV export since Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin. Why do you think it's such a success? 
 
ZANETTI: I think doesn't matter who you are or where you live in the world. The stories resonate because they're so truthful, and funny, and true to life. I think there's something in -- yeah, in that. And they're so beautifully told and the animation is gorgeous. There's a lot to love. 
 
KINKADE: And, of course, you are an accomplished actress on stage and in film. Just explain for us how you landed the role of the voice of Bluey's mum.
 <br>[08:35:03]
 
ZANETTI: It was a really serendipitous situation. I was putting a voiceover down in someone's studio, which happened to be Dan Brumm, who's Joe Brumm's brother, who's the creator. And he said, "My brother's making this animation. It's already cast. You have a great voice. Can we chuck down some demos?" And at the 11th hour, they needed to change the voices up for the premiere at the cartoon convention. And then they did their due diligence, kind of auditioned for three months. And then they came back to me and said, "You were right all along." So that's my journey to Chille. 
 
KINKADE: That is amazing. So of course, it is 2025 here in Sydney, Australia. But of course, New Year's Eve is a while off there where you are in Pennsylvania. How are you planning to celebrate and what is your wish for the year ahead? 
 
ZANETTI: Oh, for this year ahead, that I get to continue doing wonderful creative projects and spend time with the people that love. I think they're the most important things to me. 
 
KINKADE: Well, all the very best for 2025. Melanie Zanetti, the voice of Bluey's mom, Chille. Great to have you with you. Thanks so much. And happy New Year. 
 
ZANETTI: Happy New Year. Thank you so much.
 
KINKADE: Pleasure. And now, it's back to you, Julia, in New York City. CHATTERLEY: And Happy New Year, too, to Melanie there. Thank you for
 
 that. Now, we on CNN are ushering New Years all around the world. Thailand's capital is about three and a half hours away from the New Year as we speak. And the great news is Will Ripley is in Bangkok counting down to that moment. Well, what does Bangkok have planned for New Year's celebrations? 
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, my goodness, Julia. So I have to -- I was here last year for New Year's as well. I keep getting this assignment. I must be doing something right. I was about a mile upstream here along the Chao Phraya River last year, standing across the serene Temple of Dawn, where there was a rooftop party with a few dozen people and some nice lounge music. And we were looking at the temple and the fireworks overhead. 
 
Well, this year I am at IconSiam, one of the most impressive shopping complexes I've ever seen that's really trying to cement itself as a global countdown destination on New Year's Eve. And I'm joined by tens of thousands of my closest friends who are, at this very moment, packing their way into this venue to watch the live performances happening behind me. 
 
And the big headliner later this evening, Lisa of Blackpink fame. Now, she's on her own. In addition to being a member of that group, she's doing some extraordinary work. We're going to be speaking with her in the coming hours. And we're going to be soaking in all of this atmosphere here in Bangkok, which is a city that offers so many different paths for people and how they want to celebrate their new year. They can be at a big party like we are tonight. They can be across from a temple like we were last year. But when you're here in Bangkok, it's guaranteed to be a great time, Julia. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Well, you might be selling it too well there. I was telling Linda earlier, I've got grand designs on Sydney, but maybe Bangkok (inaudible). Thank you so much for that. We'll be back with you later.
 
All right. Coming up for us in just ahead on the show, we're going to get a sneak preview of the party coming up here in Times Square. And the cast from the Great Gatsby will join us in real style. Stay with CNN. There's more to come. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:43:30]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to CNN's New Year's Eve special. I'm Julia Chatterley live atop one of the world's most iconic destinations for New Year's Eve, New York City's Times Square. In just hours from now, this place is going to count down until midnight and start a party like nowhere else on earth. Yes, I'm British, but I'm completely biased. 
 
CNN has a bird's eye view over the screen Square today as we're perched on top of the city's New York Marriott Marquis hotel with an incredible view as the excitement builds over the coming hours. And we're going to be here for you all the way through until midnight. 
 
And also, we're joined by Brynn Gingras who is joining us now for a look at the coming party. Brynn, I'll be honest with you and I'll tell you a secret, this is my first time in Times Square for New Year's Eve, so I'm practically bouncing up and down with excitement. Tell me and tell our audience what's going coming up over the coming hours. 
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Julia, listen, I've been here like four times now, but each time, it's just as exciting. So you are in for a major treat as is the thousands and almost millions of people that come here to New York City to enjoy the New Year's celebration. Hey, look, I am just under you. I can see you. I'm waving to you, Julia. I am on the risers where tonight Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen are going to be staged, giving you a front row seat really to all the excitement for tonight's show. 
 
Now, let me come down here, Jamie (ph). 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
Come on and show everybody what Times Square looks like right now. Okay. So the party has not quite started yet. There's not anybody here. But listen, this is the space, the heart of the city of New York, where it is just going to be packed with people. And that hasn't started just yet. So that's going to begin in just a couple of hours where all the people that are going to be flocking to Times Square, Julia, probably you've heard the stories where they wear their diapers, they can't leave once they come in, they are put into these pens. They are all going to start going through security with the NYPD in a short time and then slowly making their way into the pens, of course, if they are here. The earliest they get to be, the closest to where that ball drop is going to happen right behind me. But yeah, look at this view. I mean, it is incredible. And when it comes to midnight, when that ball counts down to zero, this whole area will be just swarming in confetti, and music, and celebration. It is extremely, extremely exciting. 
 
Really quick, I want to mention about security. This is one of the most secure areas in the entire world right now. We had an NYPD briefing just yesterday where they talked about how more than 600 officers who are just new recruits, this is their first job. That is the tradition for every year, they work patrol, in addition to all, of course, the security measures that have been taken by the NYPD, by the FBI, all law enforcement, to make sure that this party goes off without any issues. And we are here for it, Julia. I'm very excited for you for this being your first one. It's going to be quite a night. 
 
CHATTERLEY: I'm literally bouncing up and down, Brynn. The confetti drop is my favorite part of this as well, with people's wishes for 2025. But I think I just saw myself while you were talking. Can your cameraman just pan up and I'm going to wave at you again? This is so exciting. 
 
GINGRAS: I see you. 
 
CHATTERLEY: (Inaudible) control of it. (Inaudible), we've got you. Happy New Year's Eve. This is magical. I love it. All right. I'm going to get turned (ph) off. Brynn, thank you so much for that. For now, we'll leave you down there in Times Square. And we'll get back down under to Lynda in Sydney. Lynda, I'm waving it to you, too. You can't see me, but I'm waving, continuing the party with you. 
 
KINKADE: The glamorous and gritty 1920s has roared onto the stage at the Broadway Theater. The Great Gatsby musical follows the eccentric yet mysterious millionaire, Jay Gatsby, played by Jeremy Jordan. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY JORDAN, PLAYS JAY GATSBY IN "THE GREAT GATSBY": You have to make him as real, and likable, and complicated as possible. And if you can achieve that, then you've done what you've set out to do. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Gatsby desperately pursues the love of his youth, Daisy Buchanan, played by Eva Noblezada. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EVA NOBLEZADA, PLAYS DAISY BUCHANAN IN "THE GREAT GATSBY": I wanted this role so bad. And I was so nervous. But the process couldn't have been more invigorating and more challenging, but also like, rewarding.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: The Great Gatsby novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald was published in 1925. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAN #1: Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Since then, it's been adapted to film multiple times. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAN #2: Will you have a drink Old Squad?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Made into a stage play. And now, a musical.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JORDAN: I think there's also this morbid fascination that we have with watching rich people do crazy things. 
 
NOBLEZADA: No matter how crazy these characters are, you can kind of sympathize and see maybe a bit of yourself in a most -- in a very extreme lens. 
 
NOBLEZADA: All the years that we missed --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Brought to Broadway by acclaimed Korean musical producer Chunsoo Shin. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Why do you think the story still resonates with people 100 years after the novel was published? 
 
KAIT KERRIGAN, MUSICAL BOOK WRITER: I think there's a lot of ways in which we're not that very different. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: The musical's book writer, Kait Kerrigan. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KERRIGAN: They were dealing with technological changes that made it feel like the world was going so fast.
 
LINDA CHO, WINNER OF THE 2024 TONY AWARD FOR BEST COSTUME DESIGN IN A MUSICAL: So the book is in the 1920s, but my design is actually the Gatsby of our imagination. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KERRIGAN: Winner of the 2024 Tony Award for Best Costume Design in a Musical, Linda Cho. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHO: There are 250 costumes on stage every night. But one of the challenges of designing for a musical that has dancing, and contemporary movement, and things like that is you also have to consider making an outfit that they can move in. 
 
KINKADE: You entered this industry against the advice of your mom, is that right?
 <br>[08:50:00]
 
JORDAN: Still so special of a piece. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: So if you want to party like it is, the Jazz Age, we have you covered. Of course, The Great Gatsby opened on Broadway in 2024. And next year will mark 100 years since the classic book was first published. So there are plenty of parties planned in New York City. They'll raise money for the New York City Library in January this year.
 
But Julia, it has been just a magical time here in Sydney to ring in 2025. I'm still bouncing up and down. I'm ready to party. But I am really looking forward to the rest of CNN's broadcast throughout the coming hours. 
 
CHATTERLEY: You've been absolutely brilliant. The firework display truly set the bar, Lynda. And I'm so happy that you're home in Sydney to celebrate for the first time in 10 years. Awesome job. Happy New Year. And happy 2025. Big hug to you.
 
Now, we can't promise necessarily 1920s style fashion. But what if your New Year's resolution is to revamp your wardrobe? Where do you even start? Well, a lot of people are turning to experts to find their best color palette so I decided, hey, it's worth a shot. 
 
I visited a color analysis studio with the very talented and very vibrant Richard Quest tagging along for the ride. Watch this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Julia, what am I doing here? What are we doing here? 
 
CHATTERLEY: We're stuck in a rut.
 
QUEST: What? 
 
CHATTERLEY: We're stuck in a color rut. So New Year, new colors. We have two color queens. And we didn't have to go to South Korea to do it. This is all the rage on social media. Ladies, six of these. 
 
WOMAN #1: Hi.
 
CHATTERLEY: Hi. 
 
QUEST: Hello. She says I'm stuck in a rut.
 
CHATTERLEY: No. Let's go. 
 
QUEST: So as mine. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Start the magic. 
 
WOMAN #1: Wow. This can be good vacation color. You look more tan. 
 
QUEST: Oh, I like that. 
 
WOMAN #1: Right? It's so pretty. 
 
QUEST: No. 
 
WOMAN #1: This one. 
 
QUEST: No. 
 
WOMAN #1: This one, when you're wearing makeup -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: Yeah. WOMAN #1: -- because it steals your color away.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yeah, it leeches color. Oh, that's interesting. 
 
WOMAN #1: It makes you look more classy and calm. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Tell me, who comes to get these consults with you. Who are you helping? 
 
WOMAN #1: Literally everybody. So we used to have a lot of people in their 20s. But now, we have people in their 60s and 70s also come because they retired, they want more confidence, a little fun in their life. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Can I try that fluorescent green? Is that -- am I wearing the color? Oh, dear.
 
WOMAN #1: So you look -- 
 
QUEST: It's good. It's not taking me out of my comfort zone. 
 
WOMAN #1: Let's see the size (ph).
 
QUEST: Now. that. Now, you see me, now you don't. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Now, we're in the game. 
 
WOMAN #1: Let me show you bright yellow.
 
QUEST: Now, we have a name for this. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Yeah, this is the one. 
 
WOMAN #1: I like yellow. 
 
CHATTERLEY: This is the winner. 
 
QUEST: This is (inaudible).
 
CHATTERLEY: Oh, this is gorgeous.
 
QUEST: Yeah. 
 
CHATTERLEY: That's so funny. 
 
QUEST: That's not (inaudible), is it? 
 
CHATTERLEY: Oh, that's -- can we try that? 
 
QUEST: Would you ever wear a tie? 
 
CHATTERLEY: Of course. What do you think?
 
QUEST: Now, we're talking. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Do I mean business? QUEST: You do indeed (inaudible). Yeah, that's cool.
 
CHATTERLEY: Chatterley means business.
 
QUEST: That's Lovely (inaudible). Let's see the (inaudible). 
 
WOMAN #1: Julia, you should definitely get some coral or rose gold. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Rose gold. 
 
WOMAN #1: It has lots of rosiness on your cheek area. Very nice.
 
CHATTERLEY: Wow, that's nice (inaudible). 
 
WOMAN #1: Why do you look good in everything? 
 
CHATTERLEY: Happy 2025.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Okay, next up. This major Asian cities counting down to 2025 in just over an hour. Tokyo hitting the New Year. And then after that, it's Hong Kong's turn. And Hong Kong is where we find our Kristie Lu Stout. Kristie, great to have you with us. Happy New Year's Eve. Tell us about your celebrations and what's planned. 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Happy New Year, Julia. We are so excited to party with you. I'm standing here in Hong Kong with the iconic Victoria Harbour right behind me. We're just over two hours away from midnight. And let me tell you, when the fireworks come off, when that harbor is lit up, there is nothing like it because here in Hong Kong, when they do fireworks, it is done in a big way. This year, it's going to be huge. The fireworks show, which is going to be called a symphony of happiness, will span some 4,000 feet. Pyrotechnics are going to be fired from five barges from 16 pontoons, from the rooftops of some of those iconic skyscrapers that you see behind me. 
 <br>[08:55:05]
 
We're going to do the countdown here in Hong Kong as well as in Tokyo with Hanukkah Montgomery, as well as in Bangkok with Will Ripley. And we got a slate of Asian superstars. Taeyang from Big Bang will be in the house. Lisa from Blackpink will be joining us from Bangkok. Also, Marie Kondo, the queen of decluttering is going to give us some good New Year's resolutions. Takashi Murakami, the artist. Vivienne Tam, the designer. We're going to get exclusive footage of the adorable baby panda cubs here in Hong Kong.
 
So Julia, there's going to be fur. There's going to be fireworks. There's going to be fun. And also, before I go, I want to show you this. I got a gift for you, okay? Now, Julia, you're probably -- I think you have a return monitor so you can see what I'm going to show you right now. You might guess what's in the bag. You know, for years now, we've been watching your show, First Move. You've been covering crypto for years. Well, before the recent rally, this is official merchandise, at least the bag is in the duct tape, from Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire who bought the original -- I'm sorry, I couldn't get you the original. 
 
The original is $6.2 million. He got it from Sotheby's earlier this year. That story went viral. But the idea is here. The duct tape is quasi-official. I wish I could teleport this to you. Our CNN engineers tell me they're working on the technology right now. But hey, we can't do Martini's girlfriend, but at least I can give you a scammy banana. Happy New Year. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Kristie, how much do I love you? I love you a lot. And don't worry, for $6, I can get a banana and some duct tape of my own, so I'm not worried about that. Thank you. 
 
Well, 2025 is well and truly underway in Australia. But for the rest from the world, of course, the party is still to come. Stay with CNN as we take you all around the globe and for the best and brightest of the fireworks and the celebrations. Stay with CNN.
