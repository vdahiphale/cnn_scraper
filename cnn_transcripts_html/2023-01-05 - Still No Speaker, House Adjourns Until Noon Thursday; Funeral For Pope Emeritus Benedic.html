ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM, the funeral of former Pope Benedict XVI is set to begin in just about an hour from now. We will go live to Vatican City for a preview of today's event. After six rounds of voting the U.S. House of Representatives still does not have a leader. Ahead, what concessions Kevin McCarthy is willing to make to become how speaker. And promises of no tricks and no ambiguity as Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak lays out his priorities. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. We begin in Washington where the House of Representatives should be getting down to the people's business. Instead, Republicans are in disarray after six failed votes to elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House. The GOP holds a slim majority in the chamber but a small group of conservative holdouts now known as "Never Kevins" is blocking McCarthy's path to the speakership, demanding key changes to House rules. 
 
McCarthy has been meeting with members of his caucus. Sources tell CNN he's proposing some more major concessions, and even though he may not have the numbers yet, the California Republican remains confident.

REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I think that it's probably best that people work through some more. I don't think voting tonight is any different but in voting in the future will. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you have a deal with those guys right now? 
 
MCCARTHY: Not yet. But a lot of progress. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: The House will reconvene at noon in the day ahead. Possibly taking a seventh vote. 
 
CNN's Manu Raju reports now from Capitol Hill. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kevin McCarthy is upbeat about his path to the speakership. But he is not there yet. There is still work to go to get to 218 votes. He needs to peel off 16 Republicans who voted against him. There were 20 who voted against him. He can only afford to lose four votes. He does not have those votes yet but they are deep in negotiations. They have made an offer to a group of conservatives to review it. The process could change a substantive, processes change, as I am told, they are moving closer in the direction of some of those conservative opponents and they're getting some positive reactions. 
 
Several of them who I spoke to say that they believe that these talks have been very encouraging, said that they potentially could change their vote in support of Kevin McCarthy. But that will not be enough. There are other Republicans who have other demands and McCarthy 's allies flatly acknowledge that there'll be more negotiations to be had, raising questions about whether McCarthy can actually get there by noon, which is when the House will reconvene on Thursday for another vote, or will they try to delay it again? 
 
They voted to adjourn on Wednesday night. Will they try to adjourn on Thursday afternoon? That is still an open question as they tried to push to get a final vote here. But, for the Republicans right now, who are pushing for another candidate, there is not another candidate who could get 218 votes in the House. And as a result, the chamber will be paralyzed. It cannot move forward in any way. It can't even govern, can't swear in its members, can't form committees. 
 
A significant development that needs to be resolved for the functioning of one branch of government. Can they get there on Thursday? McCarthy is hopeful he can. But he's not there yet. 
 
Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: Well, Democrats are all but gloating over the Republican meltdown in the House. Reporters asked President Biden about the chaos while he was on a trip to Kentucky on Wednesday. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's embarrassing for the country. I mean literally. I don't -- that's the reality is. That, you know, to have a Congress that can't function is just embarrassing. We're the greatest nation in the world. How can that be? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted, "All who served in the House share a responsibility to bring dignity to this body. Sadly, Republicans' cavalier attitude in electing a speaker is frivolous, disrespectful and unworthy of this institution. We must open the House and proceed with the people's work." 
 <br>[02:05:10]
 
And we will have much more ahead this hour on the chaos in the House. Former Republican congressman, Charlie Dent, and Democratic strategist Caroline Heldman will join me for analysis in just a few minutes from now. 
 
Dignitaries from all around the world will gather at the Vatican in the next hour for the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who died Saturday at the age of 95. Over the last three days, the former pontiff has been lying in state inside St. Peter's Basilica with nearly 200,000 people paying their respects during the public viewing. Pope Francis will lead the mass and will become the first pontiff in modern time to preside over the funeral of his predecessor. He had these words on Wednesday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS, CATHOLIC CHURCH LEADER (through translator): I would like us to join with those here beside us. Who are paying their respects to Benedict XVI. And to turn my thoughts to him. A great master of catechizes. May he help us rediscover in Christ the joy of believing and the hope of living. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Benedict XVI was born Joseph Ratzinger in 1927 in Germany. He became a cardinal in 1977. Following the death of John Paul he was elected Pope in 2005. He resigned from his role as Pope in 2013. Benedict said his choice to step down was made due to his lack of strength of body and mind. 
 
And CNN is covering all angles of today's events. Vatican correspondent Delia Gallagher is in St. Peter's Square. Senior international correspondent Frederik Pleitgen is standing by in Rome where we also find our senior Vatican analyst, John Allen. 
 
Good to see you all. But let's begin our coverage in Vatican City with Delia Gallagher. 
 
So, Delia, as requested, the Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI himself, his funeral will be a simple ceremony, won't it? So what does that mean exactly? And what can we expect in the coming hours as sort of people gather to mark this day? 
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, in part, Rosemary, simple has to do with protocol with those guests that are invited. You know, if a head of state comes with an entire entourage with SUVs requiring security, it puts a lot of pressure on the host city. And so part of the point of keeping it simple was so that the Vatican and Rome didn't have to deal with that kind of level of coordination of security and so on. 
 
So in fact, you'll see, for example, the United States is sending as their representative the ambassador who's already here, Ambassador Joe Donnelly, to the Holy See. So that's an important part of helping to keep the ceremony simple. The mass will be a simple mass, a funeral mass, but, of course, at the Vatican, nothing is ever that simple. It will still be quite elaborate and a basic funeral mass for a pope. 
 
What we'll see in about 45 minutes is Pope Benedict's coffin being brought out from St. Peter's Basilica. It was closed last night, Rosemary. Inside the coffin they put coins from the pontificate, medal from the pontificate, and a scroll which kind of describes the life of Pope Benedict and some of the major points of his pontificate. So we'll see that brought out, put before the altar. Pope Francis of course will then begin the mass. He won't actually be saying the mass, he'll be presiding at the mas. 
 
He'll be there but because of his mobility problems, we know he has a knee problem he's been in a wheel chair for some time now so it's hard for him to stand for long periods of time so the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Ray, will be saying the mass. Pope Francis will be technically presiding because he's there. And of course he will give a homily so we'll have a chance to hear from him as well -- Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: All right, Delia Gallagher joining us from St. Peter's Square. Many thanks to you. 
 
So let's head out now to Rome where CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is standing by. 
 
So, Fred, the funeral for the former pontiff is set to begin the next hour. And of course, a lot of attention will be on Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI's time and influence in his homeland Germany. Talk to us about that influence and the legacy that he leaves behind. 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and I think one of the interesting things about that, Rosemary, is also when we go back to what Delia was just saying, that some of the delegations are fairly small. The U.S. sending its envoy to the Holy See. 
 <br>[02:10:01]
 
Well, the German delegation is absolutely massive. You have the German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier. You also have the German chancellor Olaf Scholz. But also the heads of all of Germany's constitutional bodies have come to Rome and will be there at that funeral as well. 
 
It was quite interesting because it was really a last-minute decision that was made by the Germans. Originally, they had only said that the German president would come. But then I think what they did realize, this is a gigantic moment, obviously not just for the Catholic Church but for Germany as. It was 500 years, more than 500 years since there have been a Pope from Germany. So obviously this was a huge milestone for the country. 
 
But if you look at Pope Benedict himself, he was of course from Germany. He was always very attached to Germany. But he was certainly also very attached to his homeland in Bavaria. And so the southwest of Germany. And there's also a huge delegation coming from Bavaria as well. In fact, the Bavarian government rented its own plane. And you'll have the Bavarian governor and his two predecessors are coming, as well as lot of members of the Bavarian government. 
 
Again, that is really where the Pope Benedict XVI certainly has a really staunch support that never went away. And I think, you know, one of the things looking at the pontificate, I was able to witness some of it especially in the early stages when he became Pope is that I think the best times in that pontificate he really had in Germany because he became Pope in 2005 and then we had the World Youth Day in 2005 in Cologne where literally millions of people came here, and that was sort of the height of his popularity very early on. 
 
Of course we also recall that he was already 78 when he became Pope so he still had a lot of energy at that point. He was quite popular at that point. And of course later, as time progressed, a lot of the turmoil that the Catholic Church was in, Pope Benedict XVI did not feel that he was able to come to terms with that. He said both mentally and physically as he himself was aging as well as his popularity was waning. And then he made that decision, took that step to resign. 
 
Maybe also in light of the fact that in the last year of the pontificate of John Paul II, we saw his health really deteriorate. And that suffering, you know, public suffering of John Paul II in the last couple of years, certainly obviously not something that Pope Benedict felt that he wanted to put himself through, put the Catholic Church through as well, so he decided that at that point in time, it was time for someone new to take the reins over the Catholic Church. 
 
But certainly this is definitely a big moment for Germany and you could see a lot of government representatives and the head of state of Germany coming here to Rome. I think the largest foreign delegation that is going to be here -- Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: Yes. Absolutely. Fred Pleitgen, joining us live from Rome there, many thanks. 
 
So let's bring in CNN senior Vatican analyst now, John Allen, with his perspective. 
 
Good to see you, John. So what has been historical impact of the former Pope, Benedict XVI? 
 
JOHN ALLEN, CNN SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST: Hi there, Rosemary. Well, I think to begin, Pope Benedict XVI is going to be remembered as a great teaching Pope. I think many of his writings will still be studied and pondered over by theologians and experts in Catholic seminaries all around world, you know, 100 years from now, 200 years from now, 500 years from now. 
 
I think that of these four cornerstone speeches that he gave in Regensburg, Westminster in the U.K., Paris and at the Bundestag in Berlin during the course of his papacy, all of which were about the relationship between faith and reason, and the role of religious faith in a pluralistic democratic world. I mean I think those speeches will be studied as well as that subject
 
 being studied. And then of course, the other aspect of his historical significance that we cannot forget today is the way his papacy ended. The first Pope in more than 600 years to resign and the first really to do so not under external pressure because there was a schism or for an army or whatever. But simply a free personal decision that he no longer have the force to carry out his duties. That was a titanic act of personal humility that probably also has set up precedent for the Catholic Church going forward -- Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: And John, this will of course be the first time that a current Pope will president over the funeral mass of a former pope who previously resigned. How significant is this? And do you see history repeating itself now that a precedent has been set? 
 
ALLEN: Well, I certainly think it is possible, Rosemary, that future Popes will resign. I mean bear in mind, the Catholic Church tends to elect its leaders at a fairly advanced age, Benedict was elected and 78, Francis of 76. And given advances in modern medicine, the ability to sustain life much longer than in previous eras, yes, I think we probably as time goes on we will see other resigned Popes. 
 <br>[02:15:00]
 
Now, whether that will play out exactly the way it did under Benedict XVI, we don't. I mean whether future retired Popes will continue to wear the papal (INAUDIBLE), whether they will continue to be referred to as His Holiness. We don't know. These are all things that the experts and the church, church and lawyers and so forth are discussing even as we speak. But I think that the one thing that we can take to the bank is this, Rosemary. 
 
While it is entirely possible that Pope Francis one day may resign, that one day certainly is not today. Despite the knee problems that Delia referenced earlier, all indications are for the foreseeable future Pope Francis is good to go. So while we may see a transition sometime in the future, in fact we certainly will, that future I don't think is on our near term horizon. 
 
CHURCH: All right. Well, that is good to know. John Allen, joining us live from Rome, many thanks. 
 
Well, the Republican squabble over House speakership moves into its third day. Kevin McCarthy has already given in to some demands by far- right members. But so far he has not closed the deal. We will discuss what's next with our political experts. Plus, the blame game continues in Moscow over a devastating New Year's Day rocket strike, which took out dozens if not hundreds of Russian troops. 
 
We're back with that and more in just a moment. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. 
 
Well, Republican Kevin McCarthy says he is not giving up on becoming U.S. House speaker, despite failing to secure the post in six votes over the past two days. An historic seventh vote is expected when the House of Representatives reconvenes on Thursday at noon. The new Congress, led by a paper thin Republican majority, cannot officially get down to business until the leadership role is filled. 
 
Over the past few hours, sources say McCarthy has proposed more major concessions to hardline Republicans, but it's not at all certain it will get him the 218 votes he needs. 
 
So let's bring in Democratic strategist Caroline Heldman and former U.S. House Republican Charlie Dent. 
 
Welcome to you both. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good to see you. 
 
CHARLIE DENT, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Hi, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: So the House is adjourned until noon today. Kevin McCarthy deciding Wednesday night he didn't want a seventh vote on the speakership. But he says they are making progress. 
 
So, Charlie, where do you see this going in the next few hours? And do you worry that with so many concessions already made, and probably more to come, that McCarthy or whoever ends up being speaker, will be beholden to this band of rogue Republicans going forward? 
 
DENT: Yes, Rosemary, look, let me just be very clear. I think Kevin McCarthy or whoever the Republican nominee for speaker will be has a very narrow path to securing 218 votes. 
 <br>[02:20:08]
 
Is it possible? Yes. Is it probable? I'm kind of doubtful at this moment. You know, when they adjourned tonight, it sounded as if Kevin McCarthy made some progress in getting some votes from some of those 20 holdouts. Now I don't know how many, but I'm under the impression that there are still at least five hard no's against him. He cannot lose five votes. That blocks him from becoming speaker. 
 
He has made many concessions. We've heard about some tonight, including one that has nothing to do with the House rules, frankly, but has to do with his super PAC, that supports him. That super PAC could not intervene in open Republican primaries where there is no incumbent involved, which I believe would be a mistake. That super PAC should get involved in open primaries to try to nominate a more electable candidate, somebody who's not an ultra MAGA type who is more likely to perhaps lose a seat, or in fact they do get elected someone who would likely not be part of the governing majority. 
 
It would be part of this group of 20 that really is more interested in blowing up the place than in leading and governing. So right now I think the path is very narrow, and we'll see what goes from there. 
 
CHURCH: And Caroline, are the Democrats enjoying every humiliating moment of this saga as McCarthy twist in the wind? Or is this ultimately damaging to both sides of politics? 
 
CAROLINE HELDMAN, PROFESSOR, CRITICAL THEORY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE: I don't think it's damaging to the Democrats at all. I see three scenarios here. And I think the one that's most likely is what Charlie just mentioned. So either McCarthy gets it or he gets tired of this, or is asked to take step down and it goes to Steve Scalise or Elise Stefanik or Jim Jordan or someone else waiting in the wings who might be able to garner the 218 votes, or the third option which is that a few Democrats break ranks or maybe more than a few and join in supporting McCarthy or another centrist candidate. 
 
I think that the last scenario is highly likely because it benefits the Democrats tremendously if the Republican Party is in disarray. And this is a party that has been struggling for the soul of the party, right, since 2015. These are hardline MAGA Republicans, and what's so fascinating is that even though Donald Trump essentially created this group, he no longer has control over it. He's been making phone and trying to get them to support Kevin McCarthy, and it's simply not working. 
 
CHURCH: It is fascinating, isn't it? I mean, Charlie, we have a situation here where the Republicans want House, and they've been able to turn it into a failure. These six failed votes for Kevin McCarthy. What does it reveal about him, about Donald Trump, as well as these now empowered 20 or so hardliners who've been pushing for their own selfish concessions in the midst of all of this? 
 
DENT: Well, what we're witnessing in the House of Representatives today is really a continuation of what we've seen since 2011, to be perfectly candid. We've had a group, a rejectionist wing of the party that has really tried to undermine leadership, Speaker Boehner, Speaker Ryan, and now Speaker-designate Kevin McCarthy. And the challenge now is this problem has gotten worse because the margins are slimmer and there are more of these, I'll say, these ultra MAGA types, who are in the House right now. 
 
So this is what has occurred and again, this is not a new phenomenon. But this is really the crescendo of this dysfunction, that is now on full display for the American public. You know, John Boehner, they tried to take out John Boehner as speaker, though unsuccessfully. Then of course they tried to get him another time and then John decided to retire. They also worked very hard to undermine Paul Ryan, who is speaker. 
 
So this is nothing new, although this is very damaging to the party, it's damaging to the institution of the Congress, and it's damaging to the country that whoever becomes the next speaker, Republican speaker, is going to have a very difficult time securing votes on legislation. 
 
Hey, voting for speaker is supposed to be the easy vote. That's the first vote. And it's the easy one. Well, it's not so easy. Everything else is going to become hard, too, so that's where we are today sadly. 
 
CHURCH: Yes, and that's the problem, Caroline. I mean, the House is paralyzed, unable to address any business until a speaker is elected here. Will American voters remember this come 2024, that a small band of extreme right-wing Republicans held the country essentially to ransom preventing the American people from being properly served by their representatives? 
 
HELDMAN: You know, Rosemary, we have a really short attention span, so I doubt folks will remember this in two years. 
 <br>[02:25:03]
 
You know, this thing that hasn't happened in 100 years, which is this speaker vote going again and again. And when it happened 100 years ago it was a two-month process with nine votes. I don't think that will happen here. I think we'll wrap up well before two months. But I think what voters will remember is what is about to happen in the House of Representatives. So one of the concessions that Kevin McCarthy is likely to make, or anyone who gets the speakership is allowing one member of the House to bring a vote to remove the speaker. 
 
Now he's already made a concession of five members, so one member is an extreme measure. And this is really setting up what's going to happen the next two years. It's going to be a bloodbath within the Republican Party. If I were in that party, I would not be looking forward to what happens. Already, you're not going to pass legislation. It's about saying no to the Biden agenda for Republicans, and it's about investigating the Biden agenda or Biden himself. The Afghanistan withdrawal I think is legitimate. Laptops and other investigations that will happen less so. 
 
It's just a waste of taxpayer money, but they can't get started on any of that work given what is happening right now. And I don't think it's going to be a productive Congress at all the next two years. 
 
CHURCH: Yes, so frustrating for so many people watching on. 
 
And Charlie, after meeting with Kevin McCarthy Wednesday, Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert called him a desperate guy and said there is life after Kevin. They're clearly digging their heels in and not budging. But why aren't other less extreme Republicans telling them to stop, that this is not way to serve the people of this country? 
 
DENT: Well, the 201 or 202 Republicans who are supporting Kevin McCarthy are frankly livid with the 20 or so members who are obstructing right now. They are really fit to be tied and so -- but again this is not something that is new. We have always -- at least in recent years, we've seen this projectionist wing within the Republican Party that never can get to yes, that really just thrives on undermining the leadership, and in fact some of them are monetizing this. 
 
I've been receiving fundraising e-mails from Andy Biggs, one of the leaders of this group. They're raising money off this. This is their moment in the sun. They are getting their more than 15 minutes' worth of glory right now, and they are monetizing it. And so they see there is an advantage to this politically. 
 
Now this is not good for the country or for the institution of Congress, or for the Republican Party for that matter. But that doesn't seem to stop them. So in a more functional Congress, what would happen is Republican leadership would say to this 20, OK, we've had enough, we're going to marginalize you and we'll march across the aisle and they talk to the Democrats for votes. But I don't think that Kevin McCarthy at this point is in a position, you know, to get Democrats to help support him. Perhaps some other Republicans, but I don't think Kevin McCarthy can do that right now. 
 
CHURCH: Yes. Certainly extraordinary, extraordinary moment in history in this country, and we'll see what happens in the hours ahead. 
 
Caroline Heldman, Charlie Dent, many thanks to you both for joining us. Appreciate it. 
 
DENT: Thanks, Rosemary. 
 
HELDMAN: Thank you, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: Well, Britain's Prince Harry is making some surprising claims in his forthcoming book, "Spare." According to an advanced copy obtained by "The Guardian," Harry says his brother Prince William physically attacked him in 2019 during an argument about his relationship with Meghan Markle. Harry says William called Meghan difficult, rude, and abrasive. Quote, "He grabbed me by the collar. Ripping my necklace and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dog's bowl which cracked under my back. The pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out." 
 
According to "The Guardian," Harry says William urged him to fight back but he refused. William left and returned a short time later looking regretful and apologized. 
 
Well, the Holy See is preparing for the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. We will go live to the Vatican where his coffin will soon be brought to St. Peter's Square. 
 <br>[02:30:50]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: The funeral for Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is set to get underway next hour.
 
Within the next few minutes, his coffin will leave St. Peter's Basilica, where Benedict has been lying in state. The funeral will be held at St Peter's Square. Pope Francis will preside over the ceremony. Officials say the funeral will be simple in keeping with Benedict's own wishes, dignitaries from a number of countries will attend.
 
Ukraine is dismissing Moscow's claims that the use of cell phones by Russian troops led to a devastating strike. The Russian Defense Ministry says those phones allow the Ukrainians to geo locate the soldier's position and destroy their barracks, killing dozens perhaps hundreds of troops, in the eastern city of Makiivka on New Year's Day.
 
Russia says four HIMARS rockets given to Ukraine by the U.S. were used in that strike.
 
Meantime, Ukraine's defense intelligence chief is predicting more attacks deeper inside Russian territory.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think there'll be more?
 
KYRYLO BUDANOV, DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE OF UKRAINE: I think so.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, more attacks inside Russia, deep inside Russia?
 
BUDANOV: Deeper and deeper.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And in Crimea?
 
BUDANOV: Crimea, it's a part of Ukraine. It's our territory. We can use any weapon on our territory.

CHURCH: CNN senior international correspondent, Ben Wedeman, has more details now reporting from Eastern Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In Russia, barrages of blame are being fired back and forth between officials, politicians and prominent military bloggers over the killing of dozens of Russian soldiers in Makiivka in Russian occupied, Donetsk.
 
The Russian Defense Ministry concedes at least 89 soldiers were killed in the bombardment in the early hours of New Year's Day. But the ministry says it was because their position was exposed by soldiers' unauthorized use of their cell phones.
 
The prominent Russian military blogger who goes by the name of WarGonzo says that such claims are not convincing and an attempt to smear the blame. The Ukrainian defense ministry says that as many as 400 Russian soldiers were killed in that attack and an additional 300 wounded, but neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian claims can be independently verified.
 
As the debate rages on in Russia, more signs that the prolonged Russian offensive against the eastern city of Bakhmut is faltering. The head of the Russian private military contractor, Wagner, says one of the reasons why the offensive is stalled is because in his words, there's a fortress in every house.
 
But the fighting in Bakhmut has come at a high price. The head of the Donetsk regional military administration says that more than 60 percent of the city has been destroyed and only 10 percent of the population remains

CHURCH: Economy is in trouble, skyrocketing inflation, and many people in the U.K. scrambling to pay the bills.
 
Now British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, is promising solutions. In his first major speech of the year, he said he plans to, in his words, build a better Britain. And to do that, he made five specific promises to British voters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RISHI SUNAK, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: So, five promises, we will halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting list, and stop the votes. Those are the people's priorities. They are your government's priorities, and we will either have achieved them or not. No tricks, no ambiguity. We're either delivering for you or we're not.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: In addition to the faltering economy, Britain was also hit by a series of strikes recently affecting its railways, schools, hospitals, and the postal service. Well, a rare winter heatwave is spreading throughout Europe, while many are welcoming the unusually warm temperatures, some climatologist say there's reason for concern.
 
Here's CNN's Isa Soares with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The New Year may have only just begun, but temperatures already heating up across much of Europe. At least eight countries smashed their winter weather record having recorded their warmest day ever in January.
 
As the world rang in New Year celebrations this week, climatologists were busy tracking extreme temperatures and found countries including Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Liechtenstein and Belarus, all reached alarmingly warm temperatures on January the 1st. Meteorologists say it's too early to attribute the extreme heat to climate change, but do say the driving force is a warm air mass from Africa's west coast, moving across Europe.
 
It may look warm in the Spanish city of Bilbao, but locals are noticeably wearing winter coats basking in the winter sun.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): It's not normal for Bilbao to have such good weather. It always rains a lot here. It's very cold and it's January and it feels like summer.
 
SOARES: And what would normally be covered in snow, this ski resort in France, is now stuffed off it, forcing businesses to shut their doors to customers until conditions improve. GREGORY ROMANO, RESTAURANT MANAGER (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Sure, we are, of course, a little bit sad about having to close. We had a good Christmas holiday season, which matters.
 
SOARES: Over in war-torn Ukraine when much of the country's energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed, millions of Ukrainians were without power over Christmas. But cities across the country including Kyiv, broke weather records in January, which may have helped reduce energy consumption. As Ukrainian advisor, Anton Gerashchenko, put it, even the weather is on our side.
 
Just before the year came to an end, the U.K. Met Office said last year sweltering heat, which ran rivers dry and caused the drought in parts of England was the country's hottest on record.
 
Though January is mild, temperatures might provide some relief to the cold. Meteorologists warn, it could offer a glimpse of a concerning and possibly even warmer future.

CHURCH: We return now to our top story. Any moment now, the coffin carrying the late Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, will leave St Peter's Basilica. And these are live images of Vatican City as mourners gather for the funeral for the former pontiff.
 
Joining me once again Vatican correspondent, Delia Gallagher, is in St Peter's Square. Senior international correspondent, Frederik Pleitgen, is standing by in Rome where we also find our senior Vatican analyst, John Allen. Good to have you all three with us yet again.
 
And, Delia, let's go to you first because it is a very bleak day today in keeping, of course, with this somber moment as the coffin of the late former Pope Benedict XVI is set to leave St. Peter's Basilica talk to us about what we can expect in these next few moments.
 
GALLAGHER: Well, Rosemary, we are hoping that this is just some morning fog that will burn off and we'll have a bit of sun later. We are expecting, as you mentioned, the coffin to come out any minute now. That coffin was sealed last night, Rosemary, inside. They put coins and metals from the pontificate.
 
They also put a scroll. We now have the text of that scroll. The scroll contains biographical information, as well as some of the major points of Pope Benedict's pontificate. In that scroll, they say that he was the son of a police officer and that his mother was a cook in a hotel before she was married a family of modest economic means.
 
They also make reference to the sex abuse crisis, saying that Pope Benedict fought firmly against the crimes committed by members of the clergy against minors and vulnerable adults. So a reference to that period which, of course, was a major one for the pontificate of Benedict XVI, the sex abuse crisis in the Catholic Church.
 
They also mentioned his writings, his books on Jesus of Nazareth, they think are one of the major points of the legacy that this Pope leaves as well as some of his encyclicals. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: And, John Allen, I want to bring you in here, of course, with this historical perspective, because it is an historic moment, isn't it? It's the first time that a current pope will preside over the funeral mass of a former pope, who has resigned. I mean, just in that -- in that one sentence say it's historical, isn't it? Talk to us about that. And, of course, the history that this pope, former Pope Benedict XVI, what he means to the Catholic Church.
 
[2:45:20]
 
JOHN ALLEN, CNN SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST: Well, Rosemary, you're absolutely right. I mean, look, when you're talking about an institution that has more than 2,000 years of history under its belt, like the Catholic Church, and it's kind of stood at the crossroads of every significant global drama during that span of time.
 
You don't get the chance to use the word unprecedented very often. But that is absolutely what we're watching here this morning. There's simply never has been a situation in which a pope, not under pressure, not because there was a schism or invading or any or something like that, but by his own free choice, the pope decided to step down and make way for someone else.
 
Spent a decade living in the Vatican then died a -- and only to see his successor preside over his funeral mass. Utterly unchartered waters. And in that sense alone, I mean, this morning is of enormous significance.
 
Beyond that, we are, of course, marking the life and legacy this morning of one of the titans of 20th and 21st century Catholic history, Joseph Ratzinger, the man who became Pope Benedict XVI. He was, for 25 years, the intellectual architect of the papacy of John Paul II for a turbulent years. He led the Catholic Church as a great defender or church teaching and Catholic orthodoxy.
 
And then for the next decade, became almost against his will, a symbol for the more conservative and traditionalist wing of the Catholic Church that to some extent, is unhappy with some of the changes being introduced by Benedict successor, Pope Francis.
 
So a man who just cuts across every important moment in Catholic and world history for almost a century, it is difficult, Rosemary, to overstate the significance of today's events or the life that we are commemorating. CHURCH: So important and Frederik Pleitgen, standing by in Rome as well. And, Fred, this is an historic moment for the country of Germany. Of course, Benedict XVI was born in that country. And it is -- it has been important for Germans to mark him as a pope. And, of course, talk to us about how Germany is remembering him.
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Germany is going to send the largest delegation there to the -- to the Vatican today. And if we look at some of the live images that we're seeing there, St. Peter's Square, if you look at St. Peter's Basilica, then to the right of that, that's where sort of the political prominence is going to be. And that's where that German delegation is going to be. That's also, of course, when the Bavarian delegation is going to be.
 
Pope Benedict XVI, of course, very much a German Pope, but also very, very much from Bavaria, and very much love in his homeland of Bavaria. He hails from the small town of Marktl am Inn ,which is close to the Austrian border and spent much of his childhood there as well.
 
So the German government, I think, realize that this is going to -- this a very important moment. Since today is about 500 years since there was a pope from Germany. And so they're sending the German president, the German chancellor, and also the heads of all of Germans -- Germany's constitutional bodies to the Vatican to pay their final respects and to take part in that liturgy and in the funeral service as well.
 
And then also the government of Bavaria chartered its own planes. And they have the current Bavarian governor and the last two Bavarian governors as well. And a lot of other people who have sort of been alongside Pope Benedict XVI is sort of followed his papacy, and also the time when he was the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, which was a really important time for that archdiocese, as well.
 
But I think one of the things that we do have to keep in mind, Rosemary, is that while Pope Benedict XVI, obviously a towering important figure for Germans, his legacy is also one that's viewed very differently in that country as well and very differentiated.
 
One of the things that, of course, has happened in the final months of Pope Benedict life is that he was haunted by those sex abuse scandals from the Catholic Church in his time when he was the head of the Archdiocese in Munich and Freising, when he was the archbishop in that archdiocese.
 
In fact, he himself admitted in the final months of his life that mistakes were made in a certain case of child abuse that took place there, which was awful for the victims that had to endure that. This is the case of a priest from northern Germany, who was brought to Bavaria and then sort of moved around different congregations there, as it was clear that he was abusing children. Obviously, that was something that apparently was known within the Catholic Church there.
 
Benedict himself had said that he did not take part in any of the meetings and then later did have to admit that he was part of one of the meetings that took place where all of this was discussed. So certainly in Germany among the leadership, it is clear that this is a very special, a very important moment for the country, but at the same time, of course, if you look at the legacy of Pope Benedict XVI, then it is a mixed bag in Germany as it is no doubt around many other parts of the world as well, Rosemary.
 
[2:50:19]
 
CHURCH: Very important point to make, Fred.
 
Let's go back to Delia Gallagher there in St. Peter's Square. We've been looking at these incredible live pictures. And as you noted, I mean little earlier, it was fairly foggy, it's starting to clear now. We are looking now at the casket of the former Pope Benedict XVI being moved from the basilica there for the funeral.
 
So, Delia, talk to us about what we're expecting to see in the next few moments as we watched his casket being moved.
 
GALLAGHER: So, Rosemary, the casket itself is quite elaborate. It's a cypress casket put inside a zinc casket, put inside a wooden casket, it's carried out, will be placed here on the altar for the mass of Pope Francis.
 
At the end of the mass, what's significant about a funeral mass is there's a blessing with holy water on the casket before it goes back into St. Peter's Basilica to be put in the papal tombs in the crypt, underneath the Basilica.
 
With regard to the delegations that are here, I think it's important to say that Pope Emeritus wanted this to be a simple ceremony. And part of what that means is that there is not the usual protocol for major heads of state to come in terms of security, most especially because, of course, they travel with large entourage is that requires a lot of coordination.
 
So you'll see, for example, the United States is represented only by their Ambassador to the Holy Sea, Joe Donnelly, who was here in Rome, rather than President Biden coming over with a large entourage. And that is echoed throughout many of the countries with the exception, as we heard from Fred of the Germany, German delegation and Italian delegation.
 
So they're just bringing up the casket now. And, shortly, there will probably be the rosary said, there are prayers said, by the faithful while they are waiting for the funeral mass to begin. Of course, this has been quite a long process. We've had three days of lying in state with Pope Benedict with the open casket, so people could go through St. Peter's and see him and have a quick moment to pray before his casket. And then last night with the closing of the casket, that also is a big ritual, but it happens behind closed doors. Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: John Allen, and I did want to just bring you in for a moment here. Why is it do you think that former Pope Benedict XVI decided that he would prefer a simpler funeral? ALLEN: Well, it wasn't -- I think it was utterly in keeping with his personality. I mean, you know, I don't know that there was any public figure of, say, the last 50 years, where the contrast between his public reputation and his private persona was quite as dramatic as with Benedict XVI.
 
You know, in public, he was seen as aloof and authoritarian and draconian and all of that. But privately, you'll never -- you would never meet a nicer guy. I mean, he was an extraordinarily humble, shy, gentle, kind person. And so this desire not to draw too much attention to himself, I think, is just utterly in character.
 
I was reading this morning and a cardinal who had been with him the night of his resignation in February 2013, as he was saying farewell to the pope, as he left the Vatican, was crying and Benedict said to him, look, don't worry about it. Popes come and go. What's important is that Christ is always here.
 
I think that was Benedict's ethos and sort of the idea of not wanting to have a big spectacle around his funeral, Rosemary, would be very consistent with that.
 
CHURCH: And, Fred, as we watched these pictures, and we've seen the casket of the former Pope Benedict XVI, moved there to the altar, talk to us about the mood on the ground, because it's always difficult to pick up on that when you're watching these live pictures.
 
PLEITGEN: Yes, it certainly is. And I think if you look at the mood on the ground, I think a lot of the people who have come to St. Peter's Basilica over the past couple of days, I think they were very well aware of the gravity of this moment.
 
And, you know, one of the things that I think John Allen was just saying is so important, because it's something that we also saw, especially around the time that Pope Benedict XVI became pope, and the early years of his papacy is that he was a very humble figure, as John just put it, just simply a very nice guy.
 
And I spoke to a lot of people who were sort of side by side with Pope Benedict XVI in the time when he was still Cardinal Ratzinger in Munich and Freising and the time that he was a very big figure in the Catholic Church. And they also spoke about the fact that he was very soft spoken, very humble that you really when you spoke to him in person, you would not realize that this is someone who wielded that much power with the -- with the Catholic Church and in the Catholic Church. Certainly someone who was always extremely approachable.
 
[2:55:18]
 
And we've been hearing over the past couple of days, especially from some groups in Bavaria that he was a part of, you know -- that we -- that he was very close to, especially the time -- since the time that he stepped down from the papacy.
 
And they also said, they visited him in the Vatican in the past couple of years, and that he was always someone who they could talk to, who was approachable, who was just very, very friendly. So I think that's certainly something that transcends now.
 
But I also -- I also think that right now, we are witnessing an extremely moment -- extremely important moment for the Catholic Church as someone who was extremely powerful in that body over the last decades, is now being laid to rest.
 
CHURCH: Our thanks to John Allen, Fred Pleitgen, and Delia Gallagher.
