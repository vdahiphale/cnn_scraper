RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN ANCHOR: And that young man is going to join us live this hour on CNN This Morning, which starts right now.
 
Well, this morning the debt limit crisis appears to be finally over.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.
 
SOLOMON: The Senate passed the deal late last night and President Biden is set to sign it into law today. He's also planning to address the nation from the White House later tonight. This all comes just a few days before a potential default could have really wreaked the economy, wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy and global economy. And we're keeping a close eye on Wall Street to see just how the markets will react when they open, and about an hour and a half at 9:30 Eastern.
 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hailing the deal as a victory for Democrats.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER: House Republicans were ready to take default hostage in order to pass a radical hard-right agenda that never could have passed with the American people. So many of the destructive provisions in the Republican bill are gone.
 
This bill was a total rejection of what the Republicans wanted. And look at the vote. That proves that our strategy was the right strategy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Right strategy. But not every Democrat is excited about what came of that strategy. In fact, some of them refusing to support the bill, voting against it. One of the biggest complaints, stricter work requirements when it comes to SNAP benefits, commonly known as food stamps.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): We should never have been put in this position to begin with. This is about paying the ransom to a bunch of hostage takers. And that is not how we should run this government. It's not good for the people of this country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Phil Mattingly joining us live from the White House this morning. So, Phil, President Biden is praising Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell for getting this done quickly. And it was very fast, as the Senate goes, which is good news. So now we keep moving forward until the signing a little bit later today.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and I think that's far more reflective of senators who wanted to get home -- 
 
HILL: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: -- on a late Thursday night -- 
 
SOLOMON: Noted.
 
MATTINGLY: -- than it is about the debt deadline, although that was very real. And I appreciated the caveat that Rahel had at the beginning. The debt crisis appears to be over until the President signs this into law. Always fair to be a little cautious about things.
 
But the reality right now is in Washington, there is kind of a big sigh of relief to some degree. One White House official I was texting with last night during the lengthy Senate amendment and final passage vote process asked, what are you going to do now? And exhale was the one word response.
 
And I think to some degree, it underscores just how all-consuming this fight, this issue. And I think the stakes here have been over the course of, not just the last several weeks when negotiations really kicked into gear, but, you know, Democrats, including senior White House officials, were talking about this shortly after Republicans won the majority in the midterm elections last year.
 
They've always known this was coming. They always knew this was going to be a huge fight. And no one was totally sure how they were going to get out of this. So the ability to reach an outcome and a bipartisan outcome and, yes, there are some frustrated Democrats. There are certainly a number of very frustrated Republicans.
 
That's kind of a space the President, a, always assumed they were going to end up in, according to officials, but also is a space he's pretty comfortable with. And I think that's something you're going to hear tonight. You know, it's really interesting after the vote last night, very late last night, is when they added to the schedule these Oval Office remarks tonight at 07:00 p.m.
 
It'll be the first, at least by my count, Oval Office address the President has actually given since he's been in office. I don't think you're going to see a victory lap. I think White House officials, while they are quietly pretty happy with where this ended up, given the fact it's divided government, I think are cognizant of the fact that there's frustration from Democrats here that this isn't necessarily a good process to be going through for the sake of the U.S. government.
 
But what it does is it kind of clears the decks going forward. And going forward, where you don't have this looming over everything, you don't have necessarily clear stalemates or back and forth going on is important, not just for Washington, not just for this White House, particularly this White House as it engages and starts to engage even more heavily in a reelection campaign, but also for the entire country.
 
So how the President frames kind of the pathway forward the relationship that he started to establish with the speaker of the House, they didn't know each other that well before this, that has started to change a little bit. And whether or not that's a working relationship going forward, I think all of those are elements you're going to hear from tonight.
 
I think the biggest thing and the biggest takeaway, though, by far, is this has been hanging over everything. It is now gone. What does that mean? And if the President's going to outline that tonight.
 
SOLOMON: Well, Phil, I think that's such an interesting point because I think one of the things that have come out of this long process appears to be a new working relationship between President Biden and Speaker McCarthy. This was, some would say, a really big test for McCarthy, one of his first. What do we know about what appears to be a new working relationship?
 
MATTINGLY: You know, when you talk to White House officials, they're a little wary to give a lot of credit to House Republicans on anything, and I think the same would be for House Republicans as well. But they are also cognizant of the fact that almost every step of the way, the Speaker was able to do things or accomplish things within his conference, particularly after it took 15 vote just to become speaker. That wasn't necessarily expected.
 <br>[08:05:02]
 
More importantly, though -- and Rahel, you make a really great point -- the President knew the Speaker. They met when the President was vice president. Had breakfast a few times in McCarthy's role as majority leader back then, but they did not have a long-term working relationship, weren't very close.
 
This was an opportunity to start to establish that. They are not good friends. This is not something that's going to lead to major bipartisan revolutionary legislation in the weeks and months ahead. But the opportunity, even in kind of a crisis moment that you'd never want to be in, to actually have discussions where, according to people that I've spoken to, they felt like McCarthy was an honest broker. They felt like he was serious, they felt like he was professional.
 
And they also said every single time, he made clear that they needed to find an outcome here, they could not default. So the policy disagreements, obviously very, very acute. Very, very real. But the ability to get this over the finish line and the President's view and the White House team's view, that relationship was at least effective in this moment, even if it was a self-imposed crisis. That's important for a town that hasn't seen a lot of cooperation between the two parties over the course of the last several years.
 
HILL: That is putting it very nicely, Phil. Not a lot of cooperation. And it will be interesting to see how that plays out, if at all, moving forward.
 
Before we let you go, President Biden took what looked like a pretty hard fall when he was at the Air Force Academy commencement yesterday.
 
MATTINGLY: Yes.
 
HILL: Was springing off -- you know, when he got back to the White House later in the day, how is he doing this morning? What are you hearing from the White House?
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, you know, I think his current state was indicative of the kind of jig that he did when he got back to the White House. We were waiting for him. We wanted to ask him how he was doing. We'd heard from White House officials he was fine.
 
Wanted to hear from the President. Made a joke about it, said he got sandbagged. Fairly clever, although, you know, he had a couple of hours on a flight to come up with it. Look, everything that we've heard is he's totally fine. He was moving totally fine last night.
 
The fall, as you noted, when you saw it happen live, I mean, it was hard, it was fast, and I think everybody was very concerned. He's 80. And I think that's just the reality here of any time the President stumbles or looks any bit uneven, but got back to his seat on his own volition.
 
The culprit was a sandbag. No comment yet from the Sandbag on what the sandbag did or if it feels responsible, but everything here seems to be totally fine, guys.
 
HILL: I know, though, you'd be -- that you do have those calls out. So Phil, let us know -- 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes.
 
HILL: -- when you hear back from the Sandbag or -- 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. Question on that one.
 
HILL: -- its folk's bags.
 
SOLOMON: Also, I will add, Phil, thank you. Only Phil can make that joke because Phil is very quick with the joke.
 
HILL: Yes. He doesn't need two hours on Air Force One to come up with that. SOLOMON: Thank you, Phil.
 
HILL: Thanks, Phil.
 
MATTINGLY: Thanks, guys.
 
HILL: Joining us now for more, the assistant Democratic leader, Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina, who is also the national co-chair for Joe Biden's 2024 reelection campaign. Sir, good to see you this morning. Thanks for being with us.
 
Let's pick up -- 
 
REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Thanks for having me.
 
HILL: Let's pick up, if we could, we were just talking with Phil Mattingly, our Chief White House Correspondent, about this new working relationship between the President and the Speaker. Does this set a tone for Congress moving forward? Do you anticipate it could lead to a little bit more cooperation, even with 2024 looming over?
 
CLYBURN: Well, I certainly hope so. I think that all of us are looking forward to a future that will be one that every American can be a part of and feel a part of. And I think that has -- that depends upon whether or not people feel that those of us working in Washington, irrespective of which party we may be a member of, that we can work together.
 
I have worked with Republicans all of my political life. I get along very well with the Republican governor of South Carolina, who is someone that I feel very friendly with, but we don't agree on anything politically. And so we can do this.
 
I tell people all the time that we should really view our relationships there in the Congress pretty much the way we review our relationships in our families. We don't get along all the time, but we stay unified.
 
HILL: All right, well, I'm going to see if that can happen as we move forward, and we'll be watching that space. When we look at this bill, in particular, I know you said you've been tweeted. This isn't a perfect bill. You were a yes on it, obviously.
 
A number of your colleagues had concerns, which I know you heard about, whether it was concerns about changes to SNAP benefits or even to, you know, to this Mountain Valley Pipeline, which was a major concession to Senator Manchin. That's been criticized heavily for environmental concerns, serious environmental concerns.
 
I spoke to Senator Merkley yesterday, who told me that that was one of the main reasons he was voting against the bill. Did any of those issues give you pause?
 
CLYBURN: Yes, quite a few of them gave me pause. But when you have negotiations taking place, and you're trying to find common ground, it means you're starting out from different places. The work requirement, for instance.
 <br>[08:10:08]
 
I've always had serious issues with that. But when you saw what President Biden was doing here, agreeing to increasing the work requirement for able-bodied people by five years in exchange for expanding to bring in more veterans, to bring in people out of foster care, and to bring in homeless people, that, to me, was a pretty good trade off.
 
And so when I saw that, I talked with people in my caucus, Lauren Underwood, Gwen Moore, people had real good experiences with these programs. And we saw in it a way to offset whatever that raise about five years may have been. So I was very comfortable voting for it.
 
HILL: You've said that a lot of what was agreed to will require some -- require rather some additional action in the CBO analysis to get some of these, you know, cuts that are promised in the deal. There will need to be other votes. Do you have any concerns about that process?
 
CLYBURN: Sure. When you get into the appropriation process, there's always a lot of give and take on leave from the Appropriations Committee. I know that process very well. Very laborious, it takes a long time sometimes to find common ground. And so you are going to go through a process here that all of us are concerned about. But hopefully we can get all this done by Labor Day and people will feel comfortable that we'll have a good budget to work on starting the fiscal year October 1.
 
HILL: As we mentioned, you're the co-chair for the President's reelection campaign. We saw that hard fall. Then we saw, as our Phil Mattingly said, his little jig when he got off the plane making a joke. Have you been in touch, though, with the President, excuse me, in terms of how he's doing this morning, how he's feeling?
 
CLYBURN: I have not talked to the President this morning. I plan to talk with him later today. I saw him arriving back at the White House last night doing his little jig. And I think that irrespective of whether it took him two hours to come up with it, given sandbag was a pretty good way to respond to this.
 
HILL: So you would endorse that joke. Look, he's going to get a little pushback. There has been much made. I don't need to tell you of his age. Are you concerned at all that this will have an impact on the campaign?
 
CLYBURN: Yes, I've been saying all the time, age will have an impact. But whether or not it's determinative, I think will determine -- be dependent upon whether or not he responds going forward and the way he responds.
 
Look, I'm more than two years older than the President, and I do just fine. I don't want to have a fall, but if I do, I hope I get up as good as he did.
 
HILL: All right, we'll look for your joke afterwards, too.
 
Congressman Clyburn, good to have you with us this morning, sir. Thank you.
 
CLYBURN: Well, thank you for having me.
 
SOLOMON: New details this morning on what happened in the days leading up to that partial building collapse in Davenport, Iowa. Newly released documents reveal repair work beginning just four days before the wall came crashing down, and engineers warned that parts of it could crumble.
 
The work was intended to rectify a recently discovered separation between the facade and the interior wall. Photos taken May 25 by city inspectors' show crumbled bricks in the space between. The section of the wall being repaired ultimately did become the section that fell. Three people who lived there remain missing.
 
Joining us now, Greg Batista, he is a structural building engineer. Greg, welcome to the program. I just have to start with this. How is it possible that engineers could warn parts of it could crumble, but people were still allowed to live there?
 
GREG BATISTA, STRUCTURAL BUILDING ENGINEER: It all comes down to the laws that are in place. Now, building departments, depending on your jurisdiction, have a lot of say or don't have a lot of say into how they're going to manage these things. Because you're always going to have these structural engineers, and I'm one of them that can go to a place and say, look, there's a problem here.
 
And it's up to the building department and the authority having jurisdiction to say, look, we need to get these people out of here, or, no, they can stay. Sometimes it's a very complicated issue because, of course, you have people that live in these buildings. But as these buildings keep failing, like what happened at Champlain Towers, people are starting to understand that it is indeed a very serious and life safety issue.
 
HILL: A serious life safety issue. I understand, as you point out, there is a process. There are bureaucracies. But when we see that dire warning, when we see these pictures, I mean, does that give you pause that, in fact, those details were known four days before and nothing did happen? Does that look serious enough to you to push something through?
 <br>[08:15:15]
 
BATISTA: Well, having inspected thousands of buildings in South Florida, there's -- you're always going to see telltale signs. Now, when I inspected the Surfside collapse before it collapsed at the Champlain Towers, I saw some telltale signs of there was, you know, cracks in certain places.
 
But it was a far cry from what I would consider somebody, you know, having somebody to tell to the building, look, you need to get rid of all these people because there's a lot of things that come into play. Now, the pictures that I saw in the news, yes, there were some very serious issues of, you know, some of the main walls of the structures had some major cracks and deflections on it, something that would, you know, give you serious pause as a structural engineer.
 
But then again, it all comes down to, you know, what the engineer says and how the people in charge of getting rid of these people are going to react to that. And hopefully, you know, the tragedy like this, people will learn, as what happened in Florida. Now new laws have come into play that make it more difficult for people to kick the can down the road.
 
SOLOMON: And Greg, I'm not sure if you have a monitor and you can see what we're placing, but guys in the control room, if we can specifically pull up the picture of the bricks that had crumbled behind the facade. Greg, if you can see this, can you explain to me how this would happen and what this does to the stability of the building?
 
BATISTA: As a structural engineer, you're basically a -- you know, we don't have X-ray vision, but a lot of times, you know, if you have enough experience and I have 30 years of experience doing this, you see certain telltale signs and red flags. And when you have certain items, such as what you're seeing on the screen, that helps to paint a picture.
 
Sometimes the picture is painted where you have definite serious issues like the ones that we are -- we're looking at here. And sometimes you have, you know, something that is not something that's serious. It all comes down to the experience of the engineer and those professionals taking a look at the building.
 
SOLOMON: Greg Batista, thank you. We are expecting another update today from officials in Davenport, so we will wait to see what comes of that.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
SOLOMON: But thank you, Greg. We appreciate the time today.
 
BATISTA: Thank you.
 
HILL: A Texas cheerleader who was shot, you may recall this story. Her friend opened the wrong car door. She is now speaking out for the first time. You're going to hear where her recovery stands as well.
 
SOLOMON: Plus, water rescues. Yes, water rescues in western Texas after devastating flash flooding. We will show you the dramatic footage of how bad it got in some parts of the state.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: See that dire warning when we see these pictures. I mean, does that give you pause that in fact, those details were known for days before? And nothing did happen? Does that look serious enough to push something through?
 
GREG BATISTA, STRUCTURAL BUILDING ENGINEER: Well, having inspected thousands of buildings in South Florida, there's, you're always going to see telltale signs. Now, when I inspected the Surfside collapse, before it collapsed at the Champlain towers. I saw some telltale signs of there was, you know, cracks in certain places. But it was a far cry from what I would consider somebody, you know, having somebody to (INAUDIBLE) of the building. Look, you need to get rid of all these people. Because there's a lot of things that come into play. 
 
Now, as the pictures that I saw in the in the news, yes, there were some very serious issues of, you know, some of the main walls of the structures had some major cracks and deflections on it. Something that would, you know, give you serious pause as a structural engineer.

 <br>[08:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) SOLOMON: Now, a heavy rain in Northwestern Texas triggering their chaos and dangerous flash flooding, shutting down highways and streets near Lubbock. Water pushing this heavy truck and several vehicles off the roadway. Just incredible, take a look at this dramatic water rescue.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, this is West Texas.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to get wet buddy, hop on.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my god.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) I got this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here bro, I got you. All right come on, let's go this way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON: Crew's they're working to rescue several people who were stranded on this flooded highway that. I mean, based on this video looks more like a river. The picture is really just incredible. Officials say nearly seven inches of rain fell in a two-hour timeframe near O'Donnell and drivers should expect detours. Clearly as roads are shuttered.
 
HILL: Yes, well, tough stuff there. Meantime, in Arizona, that critical water shortage is hitting new lows. Officials now say the state will no longer grant certifications for new developments, because the groundwater in the Phoenix area likely won't be able to meet development demand in the coming century.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. KATIE HOBBS (D-AZ): That's why as required by law, we will pass approvals of new assured water supply determinations that rely on pumping groundwater. Ensuring that we don't add to any future deficit.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Now, as you likely know, there has been a homebuilding boom in the outer suburbs of Phoenix. This, of course, would threaten that. This area is one of the fastest growing in the United States. Joining us now with a closer look at why it's all happening. CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir. Bill, this isn't the first time that we have talked about Arizona's water issues. Not the first one we talked about in relation to new housing developments. What's interesting though, is that the officials seem to be much more public in this case, and actually talking about the fact that they're going to stop the permits, why?
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Katie Hobbs ran really on a platform of water a transparency, an accountability, in an age when, there's a lot of water math that goes on behind the -- behind the scenes. Shutting down construction is a big hit on jobs in the near term. So, that's usually a last resort thing that most governors don't want to talk about. But they're trying to get out in front of this. And the bottom line is, this is sort of the result of the Wild West Days for generations. They were able to pump whatever groundwater they wanted in Arizona without any sort of regulations.
 
They tightened the cities in recent years. But this is sort of a moment in time were realizing that the days of a developer going out into raw desert and said, I'm going to build a thousand homes right here. And transform this place are over, unless you can guarantee that you have the water for those those homes for the next hundred years. Plenty of cities around Phoenix have that guarantee, and they can continue to keep growing. But this is sort of a line in the sand forgive the pun, that endless desert sprawl just doesn't work in the age of climate change and mega drought.
 
SOLOMON: And Bill, as you say, the report does state that no new certs will be issued, no new certification will be issued unless communities and developers can find alternative water sources. But is that really feasible?
 
WEIR: It is, you could buy it from farmers who have the rights or figure out a way to tap some of the salt river, they have three rivers in Phoenix in addition to the Colorado there. And you also have to keep in mind where the most water use goes. For example, the Colorado River that almost 2 trillion gallons that goes in there. The vast majority 56 percent goes into Cow food, for dairy and cattle farms another quarter. So, for other crops only 15 percent or so goes to cities, and cities like Vegas and others have shown models of conservation recycling.
 
Mark Kelly, the senator of Arizona is a big fan of desalination, which right now that technology it's super energy intensive, to turn the salt water into fresh. But that technology is getting better just like everything else. So, who knows? That just means a different thinking, it doesn't mean as Katie Hobbs says that we're running out of water, we're going to shut down. But you have to think differently about conserving every drop in this new age. And that can be done.
 
HILL: Right. 
 
WEIR: That can be done. 
 
HILL: So, how does this impact it at all this report, not just from a housing perspective, but other existing issues in Arizona. Whether it's Alfalfa crops or Golf courses, does that come into play at all in terms of how they're using the water?
 
WEIR: I think it's all big of a part of a hole, absolutely. Golf courses are the most obvious water users. But at the same time, like an average semiconductor factory uses about 10 million gallons a day to make the little chips that go into all of our devices. And again, it's the Alfalfa thirsty crops in the desert, we got to rethink that idea. Maybe move cattle food crops closer to big water sources in the Midwest. That's, you know, cold comfort for if you are raising Alfalfa cattle out in the desert but this is the new era that we're living in. So, it could be that it could mean denser cities, like Phoenix, where they built -- where they build up instead of outs. So, you know, it's living in this -- living with this is all possible, but just not the old-fashioned way that people did it for generations lot of really thinking about it.
 
HILL: Yes, which is more creative. Which is -- which is what we get from you because you bring us these fascinating stories of how people are thinking more creatively to combat these issues. Bill, appreciate it, as always, thank you.
 
SOLOMON: Thanks, Bill. And staying in Arizona now, a key Arizona Republican County Supervisor Bill Gates says that he will not be seeking reelection in 2024. He and his family you might remember face a series of violent threats, doxing and online harassment by people who deny the results of the 2022 midterms and 2020 Presidential election. Gates publicly pushed back against those suggestions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BILL GATES (R) MARICOPA COUNTY SUPERVISOR: Those behind this, they don't have reverence for democracy. They are trying to sow doubt, so, that down the road, they can again question elections if they don't turn out the way they wanted them to.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON: In a statement Bill Gates said, quote, "As this chapter comes to an end, I rest well, knowing that I led with integrity, compassion and dignity." He did not mention the threats, but a source close to Gates tells CNN that this does not signal of the end of his political career.
 
HILL: New this morning, one of the Texas cheerleaders who was shot after her teammate accidentally opened the wrong car door is now speaking out. Officials say Pedro Rodriguez Jr. opened fire on four cheerleaders in a supermarket parking lot in April. Heather Roth and Payton Washington were injured. Roth was treated for her injuries and released at the scene. Washington though was in critical condition after being shot multiple times. Well, today, Washington is out of the hospital, and officially a high school graduate. She tells Good Morning America's Michael Strahan what happened after that attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAYTON WASHINGTON, TEXAS CHEERLEADER SHOT AFTER TEAMMATE OPENED WRONG CAR DOOR: I was trying to stay as calm as possible for the other people in the car. I could tell how sad and scared they were. The more calm you are, like, your body will stay calm as well. So, I mean, of course, it was scary, but I was -- I wasn't going to act like I was scared.
 
MICHAEL STRAHAN, HOST OF GMA: So, you're shot and you're keeping everyone calm.
 
WASHINGTON: Well, I tried. I saw blood on the seat, my passenger seat. So, I knew somewhere it was bleeding. But I had so much adrenaline, I didn't really know where. And then, whenever we pulled over and opened the door, I was like, oh, got to throw up. And that's when I like I was throwing up blood and I was like, oh, that's not normal. So, that's when I knew something, somewhere was wrong.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: And Washington says she does have permanent damage. However, she also plans to go back to cheerleading next month. She'll be attending Baylor University in the fall. Wow.
 
SOLOMON: That's incredible. It's interesting when it happened, you heard like her cheerleading supervisor believes that she is very strong.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
SOLOMON: And to hear her say tell Michael Strahan that she was worried about the other people in the car.
 
HILL: Right.
