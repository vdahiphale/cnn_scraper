ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: On Monday, the president will spend election eve up in Maryland on behalf of Wes Moore, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Maryland. Maryland being a state where Democrats are actually hoping to pick up a governor's seat on Tuesday night. The president trying to make that case and drive out those Democratic voters to the polls with each of these appearances. 
 
Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House.

MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Most of America feel Biden and the Democrat's messaging is out of touch with the current state of the country. Here is how one Democratic strategist put it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILARY ROSEN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: We did not listen to voters in this election, and I think we're going to have a bad night. When voters tell you over and over and over again that they care mostly about the economy. Listen to them. Stop talking about democracy being at stake. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: According to a recent CNN poll, 51 percent of likely voters say that the economy was their top priority, far greater than any other issue. Take a listen to what voters told CNN's Dana Bash. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR, STATE OF THE UNION: We heard from many discontented voters, especially among the working class and in rural areas, those who feel forgotten by politicians in Washington.
 
JASON FEKETE, VIRGINIA VOTER: I came up in a union household. My dad was a Teamster for 30 years, voted Democrat. But they're completely out of touch with what every day Americans want. JOE STALLBAUM, OHIO VOTER: I think there should be a lot more focus on working-class people. It seems like we always get left behind ...
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NOBILO: Let's bring in Richard Johnson. He's a lecturer in U.S. politics at Queen Mary University of London. Richard, great to have you with us. First and foremost, people keep talking about this election like it's the most consequential in a generation in terms of the next presidential election and the hot button issues, why? 
 
RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS AT QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON: Well, we hear that in every election, but I think there are certain things that are quite important in this election that we haven't seen before. And that's really about the elections that are going on at the state level. 46 states have state legislative elections going on. And many states have gubernatorial elections going on. And these are going to decide the individuals who then manage the election administration the next presidential election. 
 
There's also risk that the Supreme Court this year in a case called Moore could actually remove the role of state Supreme Courts from oversight in the allocation of Electoral College votes even if just as state legislatures. So, it's not just what happens at this election, but it's what happens at this election and then effects what happens the presidential election two years' time. 
 
FOSTER: And we're seeing movements there, haven't we, with Donald Trump very much on the campaign trail. I think looking at polling, he's actually slightly ahead of Biden. So, we're then looking to see whether or not Biden is going to run. 
 
JOHNSON: I think all signs to me at the moment suggest that Joe Biden will run for re-election. I think that he's probably the figure who can best unite the Democratic Party in all of its desperate guises, different wings of the party and so on. But, you know, this is -- Donald Trump is going to be a significant challenge for Biden. Trump runs best when he doesn't have a record to defend and he's playing the role of the critic. And so, he in 2020, of course, had to defend his record. This time, you know, he's removed from that a bit. And I think that that gives him a little more of an edge than he had four years ago. 
 
NOBILO: And Richard, incumbents tend to lose big in midterms in their first term. I think about Obama and Trump. So, do you think it's potentially looking too much into it? Obviously at the moment we're looking at the races in terms of President Trump's possible influence like the candidates he's endorsed and his electoral viability for 2024. But obviously midterms always do come with this caveat that the incumbent government is likely to take a beating. 
 
JOHNSON: That's right. And every midterm election since the Second World War except in 1998 and 2002 saw the president's party lose seats. So, if Joe Biden loses seats tomorrow in the House and also perhaps in the Senate, that's very much within the historical norm. On average, a president loses about 26 seats in the House of Representatives. Barack Obama lost over 60 seats in the House of Representatives in 2010. Then was re-elected two years later. 
 
The electorates are different, right. There's higher turnout in a presidential election. And also, during a midterm election, the opposition party, so, to speak, tends to be more motivated because they're probably a little more angry that they lost last time. And the incumbent party has this record to defend and governing is difficult. 
 <br>[04:35:05]
 
So, there are many explanations why this is the case, but if Joe Biden loses seats tomorrow, it would very much be within kind of a normal, historical patterns. 
 
NOBILO: Richard Johnson, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
FOSTER: Now, in Egypt, global leaders are meeting for the U.N.'s annual climate summit. Researchers, advocates and the United Nations itself are warning that the world is nowhere near its goal of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius. U.S. president Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Friday. He's expected to tout programs he signed into law to expand clean energy and reduce pollution across the U.S. 
 
CNN's David McKenzie joins us now from Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. And there's a real chorus, isn't there, from developing nations again that they're being asked to carry too much of this. 
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, carry too much weight with the emissions drops and also big deal with the brunt of the climate catastrophe, Max. World leaders are streaming to Sharm el-Sheikh this morning. There will be I think tense negotiations behind the scenes specifically on the issue that you're talking about. 
 
If you look at the emissions goals, the planet is just not meeting them. We're going to blow well past that 1.5 degree threshold agreed in the Paris Agreement and emissions are still growing. As it stands, we are more likely with current commitments to get over 2 degrees warming, well over that. That will mean a massive species die-off. It will change the way we live. 
 
So, there is a sense of urgency amongst the delegates and a sense of urgency from developing nations. They managed to get on to the negotiating table. This issue that they call a Loss and Damage. It's a tacit understanding that the impact of climate change cannot be completely stopped. And they need a lot of money to try and save people from the worst effects. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NISHA KRISHNAN, WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE: A lot of countries are thinking this now and are realizing that it's not just in developing countries. They have the same issues. And so, if you're going to deal with this at home, you have to deal with this everywhere else, too. We are already clear on the fact that humanitarian assistance is not enough any way and that calls aren't being heeded. And the fact is that this is a reoccurring issue. MCKENZIE: Without an enormous amount of money to help countries cope
 
 with climate change, what is the scenario? 
 
KRISHNAN: I mean the scenario only gets worse, right. So right now, we are at an inflection point whether that is to reduce emissions, whether that is to deal with the impacts as they are or proactively deal with them or address them, and without that finance, I think we're at a stalemate really and we will see increasing devastation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): Well, a lot of scientist I have been speaking to say even this effort is potentially just kicking the can down the road. Countries like the U.S. and other developed nations have been very reticent to give money for those countries worst affected by the climate catastrophe because in a way they are fearing that it could open them up to massive open ended lawsuits. Because those countries who were the least responsible for getting the mess -- getting us into the mess we're in are those who will bear the biggest brunt of it. In the next few days, you'll have high-level meetings between presidents. We're expecting President Biden later this week. 
 
There will be also a view whether China and the U.S. can actually speak to each other on these climate issues. They're currently going through a diplomatic deep freeze but very important meetings here, Max, in the next two weeks -- Max, Bianca. 
 
FOSTER: And we'll come back to you with updates. David, thank you very much indeed. 
 
NOBILO: Ukraine's need for international assistance is growing as the war grinds on. What aid from the U.S. really means to one Ukrainian lawmaker just ahead.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Democrats have ripped our border wide open. But the only border they care about is Ukraine. Not America's southern border. Under Republicans not another penny will go to Ukraine. Our country comes first.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NOBILO: That was U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican who fiercely opposed sending international aid to Ukraine. So far, the U.S. has sent more than its fair share of help. Ever since Russia launched its invasion in February, America committed more than $17 billion in assistance and that includes artillery, vehicles, medical supplies and other resources. An Ukrainian MP is currently in Washington to meet with politicians and make her case that American aid will help Ukraine stand a chance. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KIRA RUDIK, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: I'm here attending both Democratic and Republican rallies, hoping to deliver my message to candidates and hoping that these statements about decreasing the support for Ukraine are just pre-election statements that people are doing in their rallies. And that at the end after the elections they would not result in the actions of decreasing support. 
 
And what we value is bipartisan support. And my goal here is to deliver the message that the war is not over and that the support from the United States will need to increase not decrease. 
 
When president Biden and President Obama are saying that we need to keep up this fight, that the fight for the democracy is crucial, I want to stand up and scream, yes, it is crucial, because this is what Ukrainian people are fighting for. This is what my country is standing for, democratic values.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: CNN international correspondent Sam Kylie joins us here in London with more. But we're going to Kyiv where Salma is standing by for us. And Kyiv preparing for a total loss of power, is that right? 
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Max. Officials here saying they have to prepare for the worst case scenario, which is essentially complete collapse of the energy infrastructure of Kyiv and other parts of the country. They're setting up emergency centers in every district in Kyiv. These would be big places that would have heating, that would have beds that would have toilets so that families could go there in case of these emergencies. The mayor even saying if you have family outside of the city, maybe consider staying with them if they have running electricity. 
 
Just to give you an understanding of the situation. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
Families here generally have blackouts that last about three to four hours. Those oftentimes go longer when the energy deficit is low and they happen a couple times a day. So, here in central Kyiv, it's not uncommon for a family to go half the day, Max, without any power, without being able to heat their homes or light their living rooms or cook any food. 
 
And you have to remember, the energy infrastructure here is extremely fragile. So, it's always a matter of if -- of when rather not if another Russian missile will land and how much damage it will create. The mayor saying President Putin wants us to freeze to death. But it's also breading here, Max, is a sense of resistance. A lot of people really coming together and finding solidarity in this moment of suffering -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, thank you, Salma. 
 
NOBILO: Sam, we were just talking about how Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene said that under Republicans, not another penny of aid would go to Ukraine? Is there concern in Kyiv about the outcome of these midterm elections?
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think there is. There's not too much concern over what people like Marjorie Taylor Greene would say. She's on the kind of very much the fringe right, extreme populist end of the Republican Party. And there has been bipartisan support historically over the last year for the Ukrainian effort. 
 
But -- and this is a big but -- they are concerned not just in the United States or about the United States, but here in Europe too, that the longer-term effects of the fuel-driven inflation on countries particularly in Europe could result in a degree of Ukrainian tiredness with the whole Ukrainian effort. It went from a romantic defense now to something quite grinding that is affecting people in their homes, in their pockets both in the United States and across Europe. 
 
NOBILO: We were talking last week about how on Russian state TV they've mentioned supporters of President Donald Trump and Republicans and are more sympathetic towards them in their discussion of the midterms. And obviously, Republicans have been associated with more hawkish foreign policy, internationalist pursuit. Can you just unpack that a little more. Why would the Russians see it as beneficial? 
 
KILEY: Well, the Trump element within the Republican Party is perceived certainly, by the Ukrainians a good deal more pro-Russian. And we saw that during the Trump administration with those very bizarre encounters between himself and Vladimir Putin. All kinds of conspiracy theories growing up around that. The fact he would have meetings with the Russian president without any American officials present, for example over a sustained period. So, there is deep suspicion about that relationship in and of itself. 
 
And then more widely, it is the Republican effort to kind of win support by saying, look, we need to focus at home, not abroad. Similar things going on in the United Kingdom with a lot of effort being switched to switch international foreign aid to a domestic expenditure agenda. But this is a really, really important issue, it's existential for the Ukrainians. If the supplied weapons, that predominantly come in terms of funding from the United States or physical donations from the United States and other Western allies, if that dries up, they could be in real trouble. 
 
They are still on back foot in terms of numbers and volume of equipment. What they have is more energy, more motivation and better kit, better coming from NATO and funded largely by the United States. Coming from NATO members rather than NATO itself, of course. 
 
NOBILO: Sam Kylie in London and Salma Abdelaziz in Kyiv. Thank you both. 
 
FOSTER: And other international headlines we're following this hour. 19 people are dead after a Tanzanian commercial flight crashed in Lake Victoria on Sunday. The airline says there are 24 survivors. NOBILO: Officials say that the plane plunged into the lake as it was
 
 preparing to land. And bad weather may have played a role in the accident as the area was experiencing heavy rainfall and strong winds at the time. 
 
FOSTER: North Korea defending a recent series of missile launches that has sparked international condemnation. The country says last week's test were in response to military drills held by the U.S. and South Korea. 
 
NOBILO: Pyongyang is claiming to have fired more than 80 missiles to counter the exercise, which he called and intolerable provocation and it's also threatening more action if Washington and Seoul hold further drills. 
 
In Pakistan former Prime Minister Imran Khan is now out of hospital days after being wounded in a shooting during a nationwide tour demanding new elections. On Sunday, he called for independent inquiry into the apparent assassination attempt. 
 
FOSTER: And he again claimed without proof that Pakistan's Prime Minister was one of the several officials behind the attack, which also left one person dead and 11 injured. Khan said he will resume his political tour on Tuesday after he was paused due to that attack. 
 
Now, some Republicans candidates already casting doubt on the legitimacy of the midterm elections even before Tuesday's vote. A closer look at one Senator's claims in Wisconsin coming up.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): What we want full transparency, full access. And if that happens and that's what needs to happen, then I'll accept the result. But we need that full transparency. I'm not sure we're going to get it. 
 
MANDELA BARNES, WISCONSIN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND DEMOCRATIC SENATE NOMINEE: I will accept the results. I say it's lawful time. It's a shame Ron Johnson can't commit to something as simple as participation in democracy. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Two very different reactions in Wisconsin when it comes to accepting the results of Tuesday's midterm elections. 
 
NOBILO: Republican Senator Ron Johnson there casting doubt on the election process, saying he's unsure there can be full transparency. A similar claim had been made by former President Donald Trump in the runup to the 2020 elections. 
 
FOSTER: Do join us on Tuesday for in-depth special coverage of the crucial U.S. midterm elections that will determine control of Congress starting at 4:00 p.m. Eastern. 
 
NOBILO: United is the latest company to pause its advertising on Twitter. The airline joins a growing number of companies abandoning the platform that's led to a sharp drop in revenue. Twitter is also delaying its new Blue Check subscription plan until after the midterm elections. 
 
FOSTER: It's interesting speaking to a big advertiser on Twitter yesterday, and she just -- I said, and she had pulled her ad plan. I said why? She said that she's just so worried about her ad appearing next to misinformation or really outlandish language. She's worried about moderation. 
 
And now if it's possible to add more stress to the college application process, UPS is just done it.

The shipper lost at least 50 completed S.A.T. tests after they flew out of the door of one of their brown trucks. Can you believe it? For those who don't know, S.A.T. stands for Scholastic Aptitude Test. I'm sure you've done them. Haven't you?
 
NOBILO: Well, it's an American thing but I did spend some good time here in America. 
 
FOSTER: And for some students the lost tests mean they can't apply for early admissions to certain schools. One student told our El Paso affiliate they want U.P.S. to make things right. Impossible to do that, I guess. 
 
NOBILO: Yes.
 
NASCAR has a new champion. Joey Logano has won this year's Cup Series title after 312 laps in Arizona. This is Logano's second career championship after winning one in 2018. Following the race, the 32- year-old thanked his team and said the victory was never in doubt. 
 
FOSTER: And 23 years into his storied National Football League career, Tom Brady is still making history. On Sunday, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' quarterback became the first player in NFL history to reach 100,000 career passing yards. Brady would help his team to a 16- 13 comeback victory over the Los Angeles Rams. He threw a one-yard touchdown pass with 13 seconds left in the game to secure the win. What a legend. 
 
Now, the Powerball jackpot is now $1.9 billion. Could reach 2 billion by tonight's drawing. There were no winners for Saturday night's $1.6 billion jackpot. 
 
NOBILO: Feels like Groundhog Day. Now, doesn't it? 
 
FOSTER: Have you said that before? 
 
NOBILO: We have a few times. This was already the largest in history. The last time anyone one the Powerball was in August and they only took home a lousy $200 million. So, what would you spend the money on? 
 
FOSTER: I think I would have more holidays. 
 
NOBILO: Where? 
 
FOSTER: Anywhere I haven't been before and super luxurious. 
 
NOBILO: Does that mean you would stop working? 
 
FOSTER: No, I would keep working. I'm quite happy with my life. I think I would just have more holidays. What would you do? 
 
NOBILO: That's very positive note to end on. I think I would have -- I'd charter my own plane and I follow might buy my own island and have my own flag. 
 
FOSTER: We'll leave it there. 
 
Thanks for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster.
