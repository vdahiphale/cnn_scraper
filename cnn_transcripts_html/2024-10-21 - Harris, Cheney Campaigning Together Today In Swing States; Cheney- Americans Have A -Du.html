(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DANA BASH, CNN HOST, INSIDE POLITICS: Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS. I'm Dana Bash in Washington. 15 days to go. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both on the campaign trail, with events as we speak in states neither can afford to lose. Donald Trump has three stops planned in North Carolina. He is currently in the western part of the state, holding an event after visiting hurricane ravaged Asheville. We're going to take you back there later this hour.
 
And then, in suburban Philadelphia. The vice president is with Liz Cheney making an aggressive push to independents and moderate Republicans. They've got three events together there today. Let's listen in right now.
 
LIZ CHENEY, FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN: -- young sons and I thought to myself, you know, in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, are they going to grow up in a country where we don't have to worry about the peaceful transfer of power? Are they going to grow up in a country where that is guaranteed? And I believe that every one of us in this election has a duty and an obligation to do what we know is right for the country, and that's to support Vice President Harris. So, I'm very honored to be here and to do that.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If I can just echo the congresswoman's point, so I've now as vice president, met over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors and kings. Many of them multiple times to the point we're on a first name basis. And the last few times I've seen them in the relative eve of this election, they are very concerned our allies.
 
Because, as you know, when we walk in those rooms around the world, representing the United States of America, we have traditionally been able to walk in those rooms, chin up, shoulders back. With the self- appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracies and rule of law.
 
But as all the role models here know, as a role model, people want what you do to see if it lines up with what you say. People around the world are watching this, and I tell you, sometimes I do fret a bit about whether we as Americans truly understand how important we are to the world.
 
I hope everyone does, really understand that we represent something imperfect, though we certainly are flawed, though we may be. We represent in terms of our ideals, the basis of our constitution. We represent a gold standard. And when we have someone who has been president, who wants to be president again, who is saying he would be dictator on day one, would weaponize our Department of Justice.
 
One of the principles of our democracy is that we say we have a justice system that is blind, that is not punitive against one's enemies. They are watching. So, this is about direct impact on the American people, and it most certainly will impact people around the world.
 
SARAH LONGWELL, PUBLISHER, "THE BULWARK": You know, I'm so glad that you brought that up, and I -- as a follow up, I would just ask Congressman Cheney to, we live in a dangerous time. I mean, I think Americans are watching what's happening overseas, in Ukraine, in Israel. Republicans, we used to be the party that would be on the side of our democratic allies like Ukraine.
 
Talk to me a little bit and all of us about why from a foreign policy standpoint, you find yourself able to endorse Democrats who wouldn't -- didn't used to be that way?
 
CHENEY: Well, it's not just able to endorse them. But if you look at the numbers of the most senior officials who served Donald Trump, his own vice president, national security advisers, as chief of staff. You know the leading generals who served him, who have all said he's unfit, and people really need to stop and think about how completely unprecedented that is.
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
And the idea when people sort of say, well, we might, you know, be tempted for some reason or another to vote for Donald Trump. If the issue is foreign policy, I would just ask everyone, think about how dangerous and damaging it is to have someone who is totally erratic, totally erratic, completely unstable, someone who has aligned himself with who idolizes tyrants.
 
He idolizes tyrants, you know, the -- again, the choice here with respect to national security policy is a man who has proven. He's absolutely proven that he will not stand up. He won't defend this nation with respect to our own constitution and rule of law. And Vice President Harris, who has been clear in terms of support for Ukraine, in terms of recognizing and understanding across the board that America cannot maintain our own freedom and security if we walk away from our allies around the world.
 
And our adversaries know that they can play Donald Trump. They absolutely know that they can play him, and we simply can't afford to take that risk. So as someone who spent a career on national security issues, again, this was not at all a difficult choice for me. The choice here is absolutely clear in terms of the necessity of supporting Vice President Harris.
 
HARRIS: And if I may emphasize, part of the backbone of our national security is our military. And let's please not overlook how someone who wants to be commander in chief and was, has talked about our service men and women. Has talked about an American hero like John McCain, was a prisoner of war. Said he didn't respect him, didn't like him because he got caught.
 
Has talked about our service members as though they are less than the most courageous of us. Those who put on the uniform who represent the United States of America, who are willing to die for the sake of everything we stand for, and he calls them suckers and losers.
 
These things cannot be overlooked. And I have said many times publicly, and I'll say it again in many, many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious.
 
There are things that he says that will be the subject of skits and laughter and jokes, but words have meaning coming from someone who aspires to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. These are the things that are at stake.
 
LONGWELL: Couldn't agree more. So, I do want to ask you another question, though, before we go to the audience. You know, you talk a lot about a new way forward. You talk about turning the page. What's on the next page? Talk to us about --
 
HARRIS: You want a preview?
 
LONGWELL: Yeah. Getting a spoiler alert. You know, just tell us -- tell us what's the rest of the chapter?
 
HARRIS: Well, first of all, I will say that it is a metaphor that is meant to also describe my intention to embark on a new generation of leadership. And needless to say, mine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration.
 
I bring to it my own ideas, my own experiences, but it is also about moving past what, frankly, I think has been the last decade of the American discourse being influenced by Donald Trump, in a way that has had the effect of suggesting we as Americans should point the finger at one another. In a way that has been using the power of the presidency to demean and to divide us.
 
I think people are exhausted with that, rightly. And it, frankly, does not lead to the strength of our nation. To tell the American people that we must be suspicious of one another, distrust one another. You know, yesterday I did a couple of church services, and there's a -- many people here, know the Parable of the Good Samaritan.
 
And there is an essence, a piece of that, in my own words, that really requires us, I think, to see in the face of a stranger, to see a neighbor, right? That's spirit. And I think we need to get back to that. The spirit of the American people is such that, you know, we are an ambitious people. We are aspirational. We have dreams. And that is productive. It is not productive of us to be a nation of people, who are pointing fingers at one another, who don't understand that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than one separates us.
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
So that's what I mean about turning the page. And then a new generation of leadership, about being ambitious, about all we have yet to do. Part of my economic policy, I refer to it as an opportunity economy was about investing in American industries, while leaving none of our traditional, wonderful industries behind, repurposing and retooling the factories that have led to America's success in industry.
 
While at the same time, redefining how we are thinking about which worker has the experience and skill to do the job and is qualified, and understanding we shouldn't be falling into a trap that suggests only those with a college degree have the skill or the experience to do the job. So, let's look at how we redefine and perhaps even reorder.
 
And in fact, I'm going to start with federal jobs. And then I'm going to challenge the private sector to do the same. Let's look at which of those jobs would benefit from a skilled, experienced worker who perhaps went through an apprenticeship program, not a four-year college, but still had a four-year degree in essence.
 
So, these are the kinds of things that are about seeing the opportunity of this moment and investing in it. I'll tell you. And I know this is a controversial topic for many of us. I love Gen Z because we have Gen Zs in our lives. We have kids who are Gen Zs. It can be complicated. I know, I love Gen Z. These young leaders are so -- they're clear eyed.
 
You know, they've only known the climate crisis. They've only known active shooter drills. I mean, we had fire drills, not our kids, right? But they also -- they're so wonderfully impatient, right? No, really. That's good. That's good. They're ready to get in there. Let's invest in them.
 
Let's -- so, for example, one of my -- one piece of my opportunity economies, we've got to deal with the reality of where we are right now. The American dream for previous generations was something that people could kind of count on, not so much anymore. Terms of home ownership. We have a housing shortage in America. We have a supply shortage.
 
So, part of my plan is, hey, let's be clear eyed about this moment. Let's invest in the future. And as a devout public servant, I also know the limitations of government. I want to work with the private sector. I have in my career, the skills, the breadth, the depth of value in those active partnerships benefit us all.
 
So, part of my plan for housing is to actively partner with building developers, with home builders to create tax credits, to increase the supply of housing in America. My estimate is, I think we can actually do it by three million by the end of my first term. Part of my approach that is about a new generation, potentially leadership and certainly a different approach. Most of my career was not spent in Washington, D.C. I say that with pride. In that, you know, most of my career spent as a prosecutor, but making decisions that had a direct impact on people's lives.
 
You know, I learned at a very young age as a prosecutor that the things that I would do, the swipe of my pen could result in someone having their liberty or not. When I was attorney general California, which is, you know, by estimates, the fifth largest economy in the world. I was acutely aware the words I spoke could move markets.
 
I like getting things done. And part of my approach, which is, I think about a new generation of leadership, is let's cut through the red tape. Let's cut through the bureaucracy, while still knowing the virtues of the work that we can do in the public sector, be it public education, public health, public safety.
 
LONGWELL: This is a perfect segue into our first audience question, which is going to come from Alexandra Miller from Delaware County. Main section, right, right there. Hi, Alexandra.
 
ALEXANDRA MILLER, DELAWARE COUNTY: Hello. Hello, madam, vice president and Representative Cheney.
 
HARRIS: Hi there.
 
CHENEY: Hi.
 
MILLER: Thank you for taking my question today. My name is Alex. I have a seven-year-old son and a wonderful 72-year-old mother who is suffering from dementia and requires full time care. My son is in second grade. My mother is in a nursing home, and I work full time.
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
The costs of childcare and of elder care are stagger, but simultaneously, the professionals that help care for both our children and our elders are generally underpaid, which makes it difficult for them to support their own families and do the jobs that they need to do.
 
How do you propose to help bridge this gap, making both child and elder care more affordable for hard working families. And also retaining and attracting quality talent for this -- these essential jobs?
 
HARRIS: So, first of all, you're dealing with a lot. You're dealing with a lot. And I just wish you strength and support. You are a part of what we call the sandwich generation, which are those parents and children who are right in the middle. They are taking care of their young children and taking care of their parents as they age. And it's a lot.
 
And so, I actually plan to address this in a substantial way because I actually bring a personal experience to it as well. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And that work is the work of trying to cook something that they feel like eating, right?
 
Trying to figure out which clothes will not irritate their skin and help them put on a sweater. It's about trying to figure out how you can say something that brings a smile to their face or makes them laugh. It's about dignity. Meanwhile, you have a second grader. You try and teach that kid how to read, spending time with them, reminding them they are special and can be anything. And in the middle of all of that, if you are working or just to have a minute to breathe. It's a lot. It's a lot.
 
So, what the way that this plays out for many people is it's one of just a couple of ways. One, if you have the good fortune of having enough extra money, you can hire somebody to come in, and then exactly as you said, you knowing what you just shared with us about yourself would pay them the value of their work.
 
BASH: OK. We are continuing to monitor the event with Vice President Harris and Liz Cheney in Chester County of Philadelphia, suburb and Pennsylvania, as well as Donald Trump's event in North Carolina. We are going to take a quick break. And our team of political reporters, including Josh Dossey. Josh Dossey's parents don't go anywhere. He is here, after a break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BASH: Welcome back. We're going to get right to former President Trump, who is speaking to reporters in Swannanoa, North Carolina, just outside of Asheville. Talking about voting, early voting, and also the damage from Hurricane Helene.
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would just say, you are special people. These are special people. These are people with heart. These are people that love your state. They love our country. Very special people. I was -- I would have been -- I mean, honestly, I would have been happy if they -- if we had 50 percent. How can it be possible? And these tend to be Trump areas. I mean, not to get too political, but they tend to be very Trump areas, and that the people would come out like that. I think it's a great sign. It's a great sign.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thing you compared to what you've seen previously.
 
TRUMP: Well, I've seen some pretty bad devastation. I've seen -- I've seen the tornado devastations, and they are pretty incredible. This is much more spread out, but you would see a line like it was cut by a razor blade of a tornado that went through an area, and it was literally a foot left. It was perfect and a foot right. It was down to dirt, big trees ripped out and thrown, you know, miles away. The power of the tornado.
 
So, I've seen that, but that was a much narrower thing, but you certainly didn't want to be in the way of it. I've seen trailer parks where they were -- they weren't even -- they were there and very nice. And they were literally, there wasn't a thing left. The pipes were ripped out of the ground. So, I've seen some pretty bad ones. I've seen some really bad ones here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, what is the devastation that you've seen here?
 
TRUMP: One second, please?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The devastation that you've seen here and that we've seen in Florida, Georgia. Does it incline you in any way toward more drastic action on climate change than you've supported in the past?
 
TRUMP: Well, climate change. You know, we want -- as I say, we want crystal clear, beautiful water, and we want clean air. And we had that during the Trump administration, but we also had the best job numbers in the history of our country. We weren't losing jobs.
 
We want in terms of climate change, because when you look at the rest of the world, and you look at China, and you look at the fact that they spent no money on climate change. I mean, John Kerry goes over, he speaks to President Xi, and they yes him, yes him, yes him, and then laugh at him as he leaves. And they do what they're doing.
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
We spend a lot of money in this country. You know, we have a -- it's a double -- it's a double entendre. But you know what? I'll tell you what. We had the best, the cleanest air on record and we had the cleanest water on record, and that's very important. And we also had the best economy in the history of our country. So, we had everything going well. And yeah, so I'm very much into that, but I really focus on the water and the air, very important. Yes, ma'am, please?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And its undecided voters here in North Carolina. What is your message to the undecided voters here in North Carolina?
 
TRUMP: Independent voters?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Undecided voters.
 
TRUMP: Oh, undecided. Well, it's hard to believe you have undecided voters. I do hear about them, but you possibly do. But I think, look, if you believe in what's happening with the polls, if you believe in what's happened, they have a new phenomenon out of the, we'll call them the betting polls. I don't know if people are gambling on them. I can't imagine that's a proper thing to do, but perhaps they are.
 
But one of them just came out, I guess the big one. We're 63 to 33 something like that. That's a pretty big margin. I don't know if they know what they're doing. I have no idea who they are, but it's a very big poll. They quote it all the time on television. And we're at 63, and they're in the 30s, meaning they, meaning her. But I don't think she's qualified to be running and I really don't. And I think she is a threat to democracy, our democracy, the way they took it away from Biden. And I'm not a fan of Biden, but remember this, she got 14 million votes. She got no votes, and she was, in fact, the first one to quit out of 22 people. And she's running. So, you know, you would call that probably a threat to democracy. But we seem to be doing very well in the polls. Thank you. Yeah, please?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just 15 days until the election, what focused going into these final questions?
 
TRUMP: Well, I've gone 52 days without a day off, which all of these people would respect, but they do it the same because it's just like, we're called workers, right? We're workers. For better or worse, we're workers. I don't know if it's the best thing. We didn't -- we didn't have to be.
 
A lot of them didn't have to be. I didn't have to be. I could have been on a beautiful beach, but I'd much rather be right here with you because we're going to turn the country around. Beyond the area, we're going to turn the whole country around.
 
Look, my message is that I've been going full blast. Yesterday, you saw that we had early in the morning till late in the evening. We left the football game. We went to a McDonald's yesterday. That was quite a stop. That was quite a stop. Thousands and thousands. They had 25,000 people around circling the building. I wouldn't say that secret service. Was thrilled, but that's the way it is. It was -- it was a love fest, though.
 
BASH: OK. We're going to squeeze in a quick break before we talk to my fantastic reporters here to talk about some of what we've heard from both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris before that. As we go to break, I should just note, just to pick one thing when he was talking about climate change. I don't think it was accurate that the water was crystal clear, and the air was totally clear when Trump was president. It would have been nice, but not accurate. Everybody standby. We'll talk to some terrific reporters when we come back.
