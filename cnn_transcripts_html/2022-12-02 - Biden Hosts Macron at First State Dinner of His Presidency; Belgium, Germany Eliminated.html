THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. I'm Paula Newton. 
 <br>[00:01:03]
 
Ahead right here on CNN NEWSROOM, enduring alliance. The presidents of the United States and France, insist that despite their differences, the two countries stand together. 
 
New backlash in China's zero-COVID policy. Residents tear down barriers meant to keep their neighborhoods locked in.
 
And another day of surprises at the World Cup. Belgium and Germany are both sent home before the knockout round. 
 
Emmanuel Macron's whirlwind trip to Washington is drawing to a close, with the French president heading to New Orleans on Friday morning. 
 
That was just a few hours ago. President Macron and his wife were honored with a lavish state dinner at the White House. Now, it was the first of the Biden presidency, if you can believe it, nearly two years in, and the first in the post=pandemic era. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Viva la France and God bless America. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: A-list celebrities and some of Washington's most prominent influencers were among the hundreds of guests. The two leaders celebrated the ties between their two nations as they delivered their toasts. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Today we're still united by the greatest of causes. Democracy, liberty, equality, opportunity and freedom. We stand together against oppression and injustice. We stick up for one another and our democratic values, to which Washington and Lafayette dedicated their lives. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: This is how to build our future.
 
 And how to work together for climates. To fight against inequality, for inclusive societies to unify our nations. Shoulder to shoulder, we do so, and we will prevail.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: Now, before the champagne and the entertainment, the two leaders spent several intense hours together in the Oval Office, trying to hash out, you know, what are very different views on some critical global events. And dominating their discussions was Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
 
CNN's Phil Mattingly has our details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On a day carefully- calibrated to elevate a critical alliance. 
 
VAUSE: Mr. Putin is -- I mean, let me choose my words very carefully. 
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): President Biden, signaling a willingness to open a line of communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
 
BIDEN: I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if, in fact, there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war. 
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): With clear preconditions. 
 
BIDEN: He hasn't done that yet. If that's the case, in consultation with my French and my NATO friends, I'll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he wants and has in mind. He hasn't done that yet. 
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): The brutal war in Ukraine, now in its ninth month, at the center of a three-hour sit down with French President Emmanuel Macron, after which Macron was explicit in his commitment, not to circumvent Ukraine in any peace talks. 
 
MACRON: We will never urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise which will not be acceptable for them.
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): Biden's first state visit underscoring the value and durability White House officials see in the relationship with America's longest-running ally, with two leaders going to great lengths to demonstrate their unity and iron out clear-cut differences.
 
BIDEN: I make no apologies. 
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): Biden moving to clearly address French concerns with sweeping subsidies included in his cornerstone economic and climate legislation. 
 
BIDEN: But there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation and that has almost $360 billion for the largest investment in climate change in all -- all of history. [00:35:04]
 
And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it.
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): And providing assurances that issue would be addressed.
 
BIDEN: I'm confident. That's my answer. 
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): For Macron, a day, and a dinner, underscoring a White House view of a relationship that has only grown in its importance in Biden's first two years. One driven, officials say, by a genuine personal connection. 
 
BIDEN: I began to refer to him privately as my closer. 
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): A connection that has become critical in a moment when geopolitical threats have rattled alliances worldwide. 
 
BIDEN: France is one of our strongest partners and historically, but one of our strongest partners and the most capable allies. And -- and Emmanuel has also become a friend, in addition to being president of that great country. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTINGLY (on camera): And while there's no question the three-hour sit-down between the two presidents and their top advisors was packed with substance, extraordinarily consequential, given everything that's going on in the world, the real capstone of any state visit, certainly this state visit, is the glitz and glamor of the dinner.
 
President Biden holding that first state visit, the first state dinner, rolling out a quite literally red carpet for French President Macron and his wife, Brigitte, welcoming a couple hundred guests out to the South Lawn in heated tents, really underscoring a relationship that has developed and only gotten stronger over the course of the last two years. 
 
It's something that's been on display for the entirety of President Macron's time at the White House over the course of the day.
 
One thing White House officials made clear: they're very happy in the wake of COVID, the pandemic, all of the issues they dealt with in the first two years, to finally be able to entertain. And of course, no bigger way to entertain than a state visit.
 
Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: With us now from Los Angeles is CNN European affairs commentator, Dominic Thomas. 
 
Dominic, glad to see that European affairs have come stateside for you to parse on this day. A touch of glamour there. That was, you know, overshadowed, of, course
 
 by the brutality of the war still raging on European soil, right? I mean, what did you make up how carefully each leader spoke about whether they would engage with Vladimir Putin to try and end this conflict? 
 
DOMINIC THOMAS, CNN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Yes, that's really interesting to see. I mean, I think that the big question, of, course is what each of these respective leaders gets out of this -- this invitation to the White House. 
 
And really, around this particular question of the conflict in Ukraine, the situation with Russia, you saw so many different parts come in that were connected to that, whether it had to do with climate and energy policy. Whether it had to do with stability in the European region, whether it had to do with the values that each of these countries and leaders have embraced. 
 
And I think that this is something, actually, that you and I spoke about extensively during the coverage of the French presidential election, is that Emmanuel Macron's commitment to engagement, to speaking to political leaders, to keeping the channels of communication open, whether or not they lead to productive deals.
 
We saw him, for example, try to engage with President Biden's predecessor but was unable to get him to move on -- on Iran, on the Paris climate accord and so on.
 
But, in this particular, case you saw him trying to lead President Biden towards being more open to a possibility of speaking to the Russian leader, rather than each of them in their respective corners, ultimately waiting for the situation to play out. 
 
And I think that that's an important distinction that we see in this particular context, Paula. 
 
NEWTON: And, likely may have been a reason why the meeting, you know, went quite a bit over time when they were in the Oval. Likely, that was a contentious issue. And perhaps, as you say, they made some progress. 
 
You know, a good deal of this visit, though, was trying to thaw the Transatlantic chill, shall we say, over trade. And issue, specifically, those American content provisions. Right? And things like the CHIPS Act over semiconductors, or the Inflation Reduction Act. 
 
I want you to listen now to what Biden said. You know, he gave his shot at diplomacy. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: We're back in business. Europe is back in business. And we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: You know, Dominic, will a charm offensive settle this? Macron has been quite strident about what he thinks about this American legislation. 
 
THOMAS: Yes, and I think that with Emmanuel Macron, as we know, his foreign policy credentials are extremely strong. Arguably, it's what drove him and returned him to -- to the presidency.
 
Because right at the moment when the election season was taking place, the conflict in Ukraine was unfolding, and it became obvious that that was important. 
 
But the domestic issues on both sides of the Atlantic are absolutely crucial. And the level of articulation and the interconnectedness of these two particular spheres is incredibly pronounced.
 <br>[00:10:06]
 
And to have, on one side of the Atlantic in the United States, this massive government investment in these particular materials and so on at a time when the dollar is so strong, when the euro has been -- has been struggling, is absolutely crucial. 
 
And when Emanuel Macron is asking President Biden to make concessions, or to at least think about these particular issues, I would argue that that's where the discussions were going during that extensive period, is to try and educate President Biden on the particular issues and the impact that this will have on the French economy.
 
And how it's absolutely crucial across the board for them to be able to coordinate and to maintain their particular economies and stabilities as best as that they can. As they both face political attacks from far-right fringes within their respective countries. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, and that is a good point, because as you said, when you and I were having those discussions, we talked about the challenges that Macron was also facing in France. 
 
You are so good at parsing this for us, and I want you to take us now to big-picture Europe. Macron is really the de facto leader of Europe, is he not now? This is a post-Merkel world. And you'll forgive me, I dare say the British leadership is not quite fit for purpose, yet. It still needs a little bit of time to mature. 
 
Do you think he's really settling into that and will put his characteristic stamp on where Europe goes from here? 
 
THOMAS: I do, Paula. I think that that's a really important component of this. It is unambiguously clear that, when President Biden is referring to an issue (ph) and actually, specifically mentioning the pillars of the French republic: liberty, equality, and fraternity, he's actually explaining why this -- this sort of relationship is so crucial, what -- that this way of life is worth defending. 
 
And, he referred to President Macron, deliberately, which would've been music to President Macron's ears, not just as the leader of France, but ultimately, as one of the main leaders of the European Union. 
 
And President Macron in return made openings in that particular regard, where he ultimately mentioned, I think, the most interesting term in these discussions was the word "resynchronization." It's this reaffirmation of the multilateral order that was weakened and undermined by President Trump and from which they all have the benefit and under a time when, as you mentioned, the U.K. is unpredictable, unreliable as an Atlantic partner. The center of gravity has shifted in Europe, and it shifted away, as well, from the German leadership since the end of the Merkel era towards Emmanuel Macron. 
 
And, to that extent, his ability to speak English is also crucial. And his ability to position himself and take the sort of inspired conference about the European leaders. It's important. And I felt that this visit to the White House was not just a visit from Emmanuel Macron, but also, as Emanuel Macron, as the representative of the European Union. And, you could argue, Paula, on the European border context, as well. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, a consequential visit in every way. And you've put it together for us quite so succinctly, given all those issues that we're dealing with. Dominic, good to see you. Thanks so much.
 
THOMAS: Thank you so much, Paula. 
 
NEWTON: So, the semifinalists from the last World Cup make an early exit. I know, shocker from this tournament. It is breaking the hearts of Belgium fans everywhere.
 
World No. 2 Belgium needed a win to reach the next phase but crashed out after a goalless draw against Croatia. 
 
And the Germans -- Germans are going home after a disappointing campaign in Qatar, as well, even though they actually won on Thursday against Costa Rica. 
 
CNN's Patrick Snell has the highlights. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: I'm Patrick Snell, and we do start with an absolutely frenetic World Cup group in Thursday's two remaining victors producing unparallel drama and excitement every step of the way. 
 
Four-time world champions Germany out of the tournament in the group stages again. The Germans knew they had to win, but despite taking the lead, Hansi Flick's men finding themselves two-one down when their opponents, Costa Rica, score on 70 (ph) minutes. Ultimately, awarded as a Manuel Neuer own goal. 
 
Germany did hit back to go on to win the match 4-2 in the end, Kai Havertz, a couple of the night's. So the Germans doing their part, but ultimately, it was not enough,
 
 given the amazing outcome of what went down in the group's other match. More soul searching now to be done for Germany's national football team, who were eliminated as defending champs at Russia 2018, as well, in the group stages. 
 
Now, Japan, who shocked Germany earlier in the tournament, looking to do the same to (UNINTELLIGIBLE) with Spain. Alvaro Morata putting the Spanish ahead. 
 
But Japan would level early in the second half, with Ritsu Doan finding the back of the net in spectacular style in a really stunning strike. 
 <br>[00:15:07]
 
And then, just over two minutes later, they get their second in a hugely controversial fashion, as Ao Tanaka sliding the ball home, despite the ball appearing to fully cross the line when it was played in initially from the left. 
 
It gets checked, and the goal is indeed allowed to stand. After a lengthy check, Japan, with a really impressive come-from-behind victory by two goals to one.
 
The Samurai Blue celebrating a momentous win tonight, just reacted the last 16. But as group winners, too. 
 
Group E with a sensational outcome there. And what a proud moment, indeed, for Japanese footballers. The 2002 co-hosts advance, as they did four years ago in Russia. 
 
Japan win the group. Spain advancing, as well, in second, but only on goal difference ahead of Germany, who are eliminated in the group stages for a second straight World Cup. 
 
Now to Morocco's triumph. They're celebrating their own special piece of history. The Moroccans through tot the last 16 for the first tie in 36 year after beating already eliminated Canada, Hakim Ziyech with a stylish finish for the opener. 
 
And just past the 20-minute mark, it's two-nil as Youssef En-Nesyri making no mistake to double his country's lead, 2-1 Morocco, the final. What an achievement for Moroccan football. Our congrats to them. 
 
Morocco through. So, that heaping the pressure on second-ranked Belgium, who knew they had to win to reach the next phase. And this would be massively disappointing for the 2018 semifinalists and their highly-vaulted generation of stars against Croatia, the finalist four years ago in Russia. 
 
Remember, Lukaku hitting the woodwork from close range there. The Inter Milan man, recently back from injury, very late on with a great chance to win it. The ball coming up his chest and then away from goal. Dukaku overcome by a whole range of emotions at the full-time whistle. 
 
Belgium, who were ranked the top side in the world earlier this year, they're out once again as a jam-packed squad full of talented stars falling short. 
 
Well, afterwards, tearful Belgium head coach Roberto Martinez teammates announcing that was his last match as manager of Les Diablo Rouge. A terrific achievement, as I said, for Morocco, who reached the last 16 for the 2nd time. 
 
And then now they're not becoming the first North African nation to advance as group winners.
 
Four more matches on tap for Friday, including a real grudge rematch from 2010 between Ghana and Uruguay. With that, it's right back to you. 
 
NEWTON: And our thanks to Patrick. 
 
Now, history of a different sort was made on Thursday. For the first time in World Cup history, an all-woman team of referees were in charge of a men's match.
 
France's Stephanie Frappart and her Mexican and Brazilian assistants presided over Germany versus Costa Rica. And gender equity seemed to win out on the pitch. No controversies; just the consummate professionalism that you would respect. And yes, the same yellow cards in off-side calls. 
 
Anti-government protesters cheered when Iran crashed out of the World Cup. And rights groups say those very public celebrations cost this man his life. 
 
Plus, we'll hear from a protestor in China, risking his life to speak out against censorship, Xi Jinping, and COVID lockdowns. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What do you think you guys achieved by participating in that protest? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you don't demonstrate, if you don't show them your voice, your ideas, they will never know. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: Protesters in China are anxious to get back to their daily lives after years now of harsh COVID restrictions. 
 
New videos from Beijing shows people tearing down those blue metal barriers used to enforce lockdowns and quarantines. And we are seeing similar scenes in Jinan and other cities. Pictures, meantime, from Hubei province show parents clashing with police who were taking COVID-positive students to quarantine facilities. Can you imagine? 
 
And take a look at this video.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

NEWTON: COVID police, in the Eastern port of Hangzhou, dragging a resident from his home to a COVID facility. They have since apologized for this. I mean, it looks brutal. 
 
China's restrictions and the crackdown on protesters are stifling investment, especially from European companies. The E.U. Council president, Charles Michel, appealed directly to Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing Thursday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHARLES MICHEL, E.U. COUNCIL PRESIDENT: On the practice, yes, we are stressed that the question, as well, and the acceptance by the societies of measures, that that would have an internal reaction by the -- by the authorities. And just to ensure that you also agree on the principle to resume the human rights there. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, CNN's Selina Wang spoke with one demonstrator who's willing to risk it all for his freedom. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Silence will not protect you. 
 
WANG (voice-over): This person, one of thousands across China willing to put their lives on the line to speak out. Years of pent-up anger over Chinese draconian COVID lockdowns boiling over into protests. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I felt like I lost control of my life because of this COVID policy. Nobody is telling you when this is going to end. We are limited physically. And now we're limited mentally. We are forbidden to express our ideas. 
 
WANG (voice-over): For some, that cathartic emotional relief spilled into calls for political changes. 
 
(CHANTING)
 
WANG (voice-over): Some even chanted for Xi Jinping to step down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The one who's responsible for this whole policy
 
 thing. But, for me, first (ph) and first, I want the zero-COVID policy gone. And if we have more freedom speech and freedom of press, of course, that would be great. 
 
WANG: What do you think you guys achieved by participating in that protest? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you don't demonstrate, you don't show them your voice, your ideas, they will never know. 
 
WANG (voice-over): And this is what happened next. China security apparatus swiftly smothered the protests. 
 
CNN is shielding the protester's identity because of fears of retribution, even conducting the interview in a car to avoid tracking from authorities. 
 
Police are calling and visiting the homes of some protesters and, in Shanghai, randomly stopping people to check their phones on streets and what appears to be in subways. 
 
Protesters say they're looking for VPNs needed to use banned apps like Twitter or Telegram, which some protesters use to communicate. 
 
Another protester told CNN, "I'm afraid we cannot hold protests like this again in the future. There are always undercover agents in our Telegram group." 
 
Every few meters on the street, there are police and police dogs. The whole atmosphere is chilling. 
 
WANG: I'm in the center of the protests in Beijing right now. They're chanting that they don't want COVID tests; they want freedom. 
 
WANG (voice-over): Less than 24 hours after this, we drove back to that spot. Police cars as far as the eye could see. 
 
Then, a few days later -- 
 
WANG: It's pretty much back to normal, like nothing ever happened. And that is precisely the goal of the Communist Party. 
 
WANG (voice-over): In Guangzhou, residents destroyed COVID testing booths. Police in riot gear immediately sworn in. They marched through a market, shouting at people to leave, firing tear gas to disperse protesters, pushing through with shields and making arrests. 
 
Authorities have gone into overdrive to censor all evidence of unrest online. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That white piece of paper actually represents the censorship and all the deleted contents. And cannot arrest us for just holding a white paper. 
 
I still have that white paper. I protested, and I put it in my diary as a souvenir to show my future generations that you should always fight for your rights and never let your voice be silenced. 
 
WANG: How does it make you feel, though, that the government even censored pictures of people holding white papers? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By doing this, they're just going to make the crowd even angrier instead of trying to silence us. They should really focus and try to think why this happened. 
 
WANG (voice-over): Authorities are silencing them. But it seems they are listening. 
 
Right after the riots in Guangzhou, the city started lifting some lockdowns, removing COVID roadblocks.
 
"Unsealed, we are unsealed!" a man screams with excitement as he bikes through streets have been opened up. 
 
But so many others are still counting down their days in lockdowns in quarantine, wondering when zero-COVID will really end. 
 
Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: Joining me now from Hong Kong is Don Weinland. He is the China business and finance editor for "The Economist." And it's good to have your perspective on this. 
 
You know, we just heard from Selina's report the frustration of protesters. And I know how closely you've been following this. In your opinion, have we reached a tipping point? Or will these subtle changes in the COVID policy be enough? 
 
DON WEINLAND, CHINA BUSINESS AND FINANCE EDITOR, "THE ECONOMIST": I think that the tipping point that we're getting close to is the number of cases, the rising number of cases in China. 
 
You know, if they continue to lower some of these restrictions, I think that we'll see a much quicker rise in the number of cases. The real problem that they face is, if they have to roll back some of these -- these loosening measures, I think that -- that could lead to a lot of frustration among citizens in China. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, so if I understand you correctly, you're seeing that the medical reality is there. The COVID reality is still there, no matter how badly the government has handled it. 
 
It doesn't have a lot of options in terms of the fact that they may set up expectations to soften some of these restrictions, and then have to go right back to square one. 
 
WEINLAND: Exactly. So a couple weeks ago, they announced some loosening measures, and you know, some places tried to implement them right off the bat. And then they had to roll them back. 
 
And I mean, looking across China right now, there's plenty of places that are just simply ignoring the central government's instruction. So, it's really a question of how they will be able to loosen COVID restrictions while they see, you know, exponential rise in cases. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, as I said, the medical reality is there. And no one can avoid that at this point. 
 
You know, when it comes to China's younger generation, specifically those under 30, they're frustrated not just by the lockdowns, right? But the feelings that their lives are stuck, really stuck, in an anemic economy, and they just feel like, when they had the issue of a lockdown on top of that, that they just can't cope anymore. 
 
Do they pose, in your opinion, a specific threat to the goal of this regime? 
 
WEINLAND: It's an interesting question. I mean, a lot of younger people in China, you know, they've seen economic growth slow over the past couple of years, you know, even before COVID. 
 
Of course, you know, the economic reality of zero-COVID is quite bleak. Unemployment among young people is high. 
 
So, certainly, I mean, I think some of the protests that we saw last weekend reflect this, you know, really strong type of frustration among younger people. 
 
Whether or not it really poses a threat to the Chinese government, you know, they've been perfecting their -- their security, their domestic security apparatus for years. It's quite hard to push back against that. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, and it's an important distinction that you make, that despite this, you know, letting off some steam, and that the regime seems to have some tolerance for people letting out some steam, that they won't tolerate it to a certain extent. And as you said, it likely doesn't threaten them. 
 
I do want to point out, though, that it isn't just the -- the subtle changes to the COVID policy. You know, we just talked about the European Council president of being in Beijing on Thursday. You know, I find that kind of significant, that China has really been, except for the Olympics, kind of a closed shop since the pandemic began.
 
Is this is a sign that Xi himself is thinking, Look, we have to reopen at some point, or we risk the economic growth that we've tried for decades to nurture here. 
 
WEINLAND: Oh, definitely. Any kind of exchange with leaders from other areas of the world, I think, is a really good sign for China. You know, we saw the German chancellor visits not too long ago, as well. 
 
So, yes, I mean, receiving guests from -- from Europe, it's certainly a sign that China wants to get back on track and be seen as, you know, a member of the international community again. 
 <br>[00:30:14] NEWTON: OK, Don, we'll leave it there for now. Again, though, a lot of developments that we continue to track by the day. And no doubt some surprises still to come. Don Weinland for us in Hong Kong. Appreciate it. 
 
WEINLAND: Thank you. 
 
NEWTON: Still to come for us, allegations that Iranian authorities killed a protester during celebrations over Iran getting ousted from the World Cup. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WEINLAND: Welcome back. You are watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Newton. 
 
Russia appears to be paying a heavy price for small gains in Eastern Ukraine. Russian troops have apparently gained some ground in the city of Bakhmut, where Ukraine is evacuating some civilians. 
 
But recent social media videos suggest Russians are also taking major losses. One video shows dead Russian troops littering the countryside in the area.
 
Some independent military analysts say Russian gains are relatively small, compared to the heavy price they're paying. 
 
Down South, Ukraine says Russian troops have pulled out of at least three settlements near Zaporizhzhia. Some pro-Russian civilian governments are reportedly preparing to follow suit. That's happening after Ukrainian strikes on Russian supply lines and ammunition warehouses in the region. 
 
A young Iranian man is dead after taking part in anti-government demonstrations on Tuesday that celebrated Iran being eliminated from the World Cup. 
 
Now, human rights groups say he was shot dead by authorities, but Iranian police deny those allegations. 
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has our story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Protests turned into scenes of joy and jubilation across Iran this week. Iranians were out celebrating their country's defeat at the World Cup. 
 
Surreal, but for many, after touting its team, it was the repressive regime that was defeated. No longer could it claim a victory while violently suppressing its own people. 
 
Mehran Samak was out on the streets of his city of Bandar Anzali in his car, honking the horn in celebration, when he was shot in the head. 
 
Activists and a human rights monitor tell CNN it was regime forces that killed the 27-year-old. 
 
Authorities deny killing Samak. They're investigating his, quote, "suspicious death." They say several suspects have been arrested. 
 
Investigations by the Iranian government into the deaths of young protesters since September lack credibility and impartiality, according to the U.N. 
 <br>[00:35:07]
 
We're not allowed to report from inside Iran. Those who speak to us face jail, or worse, making it hard for us to tell the stories of victims and those left to mourn. 
 
Samak's Instagram post is just a little snapshot of a life ended too soon, an athletic young man who enjoyed life, being with his friends and water sports. 
 
Growing up, he played soccer with Saeed Ezatolahi, now a midfielder in the national team, who shared this photo. Mourning his childhood friend, he wrote, "I wish we could always stay at the same age, without any concerns, without hate, without jealousy, without fighting to put each other down. After another bitter night last night, and with the news of your death, my heart is even more on fire." 
 
At Samak's burial, mourners chant, "Death to the dictator. Khamenei must go." 
 
Every life lost brings more heartache, more anger, more defiance and determination of a people risking it all in this bloody battle for freedom.

NEWTON: South Africa's National Assembly is set to discuss a new report on President Cyril Ramaphosa. That's next Monday. And he could be forced to step down after claims he covered up the theft of a huge amount of cash in 2020. 
 
A panel of investigators, led by a former chief justice, found that the crime was not reported to authorities. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANDILE NGCOBO, FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN CHIEF JUSTICE: There has been (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- from the people of South Africa. That they are family, that they are patients (ph). (UNINTELLIGIBLE) But after -- patience -- (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the necessary space to do our work.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: The panel says more than $500,000 in cash had been hidden inside a sofa when it was stolen from the president's private farm.

NEWTON: Wow. Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano is putting on quite a show this week, with its first eruption since 1984. 
 
There are concerns that the lava could reach the main highway linking the East and West sides of the big island, with Mount Kilauea erupting in Hawaii, as well. 
 
State officials say they believe there could be air quality issues. And that includes volcanic smog and increasing levels of sulfur dioxide.

Spain is boosting security measures in response to a string of letter bombs discovered right across the country. The sixth and latest one was detected at the U.S. embassy in Madrid Thursday, where it was safely detonated. 
 
On Wednesday, one person was injured when a letter bomb exploded at the Ukrainian embassy. 
 
Letter bombs have also been sent to Spain's prime minister and defense minister, but they were intercepted. 
 
The prime minister says people should remain calm and that there's no reason yet to raise the country's terror threat level. 
 
Britain's Prince and Princess of Wales are in Boston, Massachusetts, just hours away from presenting the second annual Earth Shot environmental award. Prince William and Catherine spent Thursday visiting environmental start-ups, as well as at-risk youth groups. And they're set to meet on Friday with U.S. President Joe Biden. 
 
But as CNN's Max Foster reports, they can't escape a controversy that's dominating coverage in the U.K.

MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A royal visit to the United States, overshadowed by accusations of racism back home. A black charity executive, Ngozi Fulani, told the BBC how she attended an event at Buckingham Palace earlier this week. It was asked again and again where she was really from. 
 
NGOZI FULANI, CEO AND FOUNDER, SISTAH SPACE: I'm really from here. Yes, but, OK, so -- I can see that this is going to be a bit of a challenge. She said, What's your nationality? 
 
And I said, Lady, I was born here. I'm British. I was thinking that would be the end of it. No. 
 
No, where are you really from? Where are your people from?
 
FOSTER (voice-over): British media identified the palace official as 83-year-old Lady Susan Hussey, the late queen's lady in waiting for more than 60 years and godmother to the Prince of Wales. 
 
Buckingham Palace responded quickly and unequivocally: "The individual concerned would like to express her profound apologies for the hurt caused and has stepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect." 
 
William and Kate touched down in Boston on Wednesday ahead of their three-day visit for the second Earth Shot Prize awards, a prize that they helped set up for advances in climate science. 
 
The fiasco threatens to overshadow any focus on environmentalism. Behind closed doors, the royals will be devastated the issue of racism within the monarchy has reared up yet again. 
 
Speaking to Oprah Winfrey in 2021, the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan, pointed to our own experience of racism inside palace walls. 
 
MEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: Concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born. 
 
PRINCE HARRY, UNITED KINGDOM: I will do everything I could to protect my family. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Incidentally, the Duchess of Sussex and her husband, Prince Harry, released the trailer for their upcoming Netflix docuseries on Thursday. 
 
And, the pair will shortly receive a human rights award from the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation for their heroic stand against structural racism within the royal family, according to organizers. 
 
Like William and Kate's recent visit to the Caribbean, when they were dogged by questions about the monarchy's colonial past, this royal tour has again felt the effects of history.
