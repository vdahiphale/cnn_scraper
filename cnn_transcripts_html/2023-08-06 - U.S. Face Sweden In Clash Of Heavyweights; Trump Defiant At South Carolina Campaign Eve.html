LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to have us here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Lynda Kinkade, good to have you with us. 
 
Coming up on CNN Newsroom, will they win or will they go home? The U.S. women's soccer team playing their first match in the knockout stage of The World Cup. Live at a New York watch party.
 
Plus.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I consider it a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you. I'm being indicted for you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Despite the growing list of legal battles, Donald Trump is rallying his supporters with his latest indictment. We'll look at what comes next for the former president.
 
And decision time in Niger as the deadline to reinstate the country's ousted leader is set to expire today. We're live in the region with the latest.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Lynda Kinkade.
 
KINKADE: We begin this hour in Melbourne, Australia where a clash of heavyweights is now underway at the Women's World Cup. Team USA, the two-time defending champions are taking on Sweden, the third ranked team in the world. And this is a do or die match for both countries with a spot in the quarterfinals on the line. 
 
CNN's Sports Analyst Christine Brennan joins us now live. Good to have you with us, Christine. This game is just about to kick off or probably has just kicked off. It is a do or die game. And of course the last time the U.S. and Sweden played Sweden won three nil back in 2021. What needs to happen today for the U.S. team to win.
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Lynda, the United States has to be a basically a whole different team. The team that we saw during group stage just -- it wouldn't be good enough to beat Sweden today. So the question is, can the U.S. raise its game? Can the U.S. look more like the U.S. from the past? Can they complete passes? Can they work as one as a team, as opposed to 11 individuals out there on the field? 
 
So lots of questions for the United States. Lots of concerns as I sit here in the U.S. among sports fans, but also I think the sense that the U.S. basically has to play better because how could they play much worse. And Sweden such a great opponent, the best soccer nation and women's soccer to never win a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal? U.S. is one-four of each. So Sweden has been knocking at that door and so deserving. And will they be able to beat the U.S. in a knockout match, get rid of the U.S. would be the worst ever defeat for the U.S. in a World Cup for Olympics going out in the round of 16, never happened before. If that happens Sweden, of course will be so joyful, and of course the U.S. will be disconsolate. But of course, there's two hours to go before we know how that turns out.
 
KINKADE: Yeah, exactly. And it could be a close game. But they, of course, have been plenty of surprises so far during the World Cup. Of course, the U.S. women's team won the last two World Cups, give us more of a sense of their overall performance do far, this World Cup?
 
BRENNAN: They really have just looked disjointed. They've looked out of sync, and everyone's trying to figure out is it the coaching? Is it a certain player? Or is it the fact that 14 of the 23 as you know Lynda 14 of the 23 members of the U.S. team, this is their first World Cup. So that great tradition going all the way back to 91 in the first World Cup with U.S. 199, The Rose Bowl full the capacity, Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain, and Briana Scurry, Julie Foudy, that tradition of the veterans well of course they're long since retired and even the people who played with them and Megan Rapinoe is basically, you know, that -- is the -- the last of that group and even she just overlapped with a few. 
 
And so now when you look at it, you say moving forward, have the veterans stood up, and Alex Morgan, people like that, and these young players have they shown a little nerve or some nerves or some kind of sense that they aren't quite settled in. That's the key question. Can the U.S., those veterans like Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe and of course Lindsey Horan, the captain who to me is the key today, can they bring those young veterans up. And if the U.S. were to score a goal first, which obviously would be a wonderful development for the United States, I think that would then raise that competence level that we have just not seen so far in this tournament.
 <br>[05:05:23]
 
KINKADE: This has been, one of those tournaments, with plenty of surprises. From your perspective, who has been the most surprising team for better or for worse so far?
 
BRENNAN: Certainly, Morocco, being able to get through it to the knockout stage, as in their first time, and Germany going out, Germany and Britain number two ranks. So right now, in this match, it's number one, U.S. against number three, Sweden. Germany paying out all the upsets, I think. The younger nations, those younger nations in the sense of it, or not being in World Cups, for as long as, say, USA and Sweden and others. And I think Japan, they won the World Cup in 2011. And they have looked just so technically efficient, as they usually are. They look like the team to be.
 
So I'd say there's some surprises in the sense of teams that went home. Another one, a perfect example of how the world has caught up, Lynda. Canada won the Olympic gold medal just two years ago, literally two years ago, right now in Tokyo. And the other day, they were eliminated by Australia, and sent home. So the Olympic gold medalist didn't even make it to the final 16 in this tournament -- 
 
KINKADE: And I have to say, I don't feel sorry for Canada. I am very much looking forward to the Australian game on Monday. I've been there, Matildas do quite well. But just finally, Christine, I want to ask you about overall the tournament, given so many surprises, is this tournament, living up to the hype?
 
BRENNAN: Oh, I think so. I think so. Because you want the women's game to be elevated to the point where whenever someone is playing someone else on the field, you're Australians obviously playing well and holding up their -- their end of the bargain as the host nation, one of the two hosts. You know, I think that's what we want to see. We want to see countries investing in women's sport. And when you -- when -- when they do that, around the world, many of these misogynistic, sexist nations in terms of women's football, when they start to invest in the women's game, look what happens. And the fact that there are 32 teams, which is equal to the man's for the first time ever in this World Cup, of course, 16 making it through, the idea that you've got equality that any day one team can beat another the upsets that we have seen, extraordinary and that is incredible sign of success, that even the U.S. players, even if they were to lose today, would be so proud of because they've been the ones who've been leading the way in many ways, with equal pay and fighting for other nations to start to care about women's soccer, women's football and look at what we now have.
 
KINKADE: Exactly that have been some absolutely extraordinary moments so far. Looking forward to see how this game plays out in the coming hours. Christine Brennan, as always, thanks so much.
 
BRENNAN: Lynda, thank you.
 
KINKADE: Well, the new deadline and you back and forth in the latest indictment of Donald Trump, the federal judge overseeing Trump's election fraud case has now responded to Friday night's court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith. Smith once a protective order after Trump posted this earlier in the day. He said, "If you go after me, I'm coming after you." Smith wants the judge to muzzle Trump and his legal team from publicly discussing sensitive evidence. The judge has now given the Trump team until 5 p.m. Monday to respond.
 
 The judge denied a request from Trump's lawyers to push back Monday's deadline. Smith had called that an unnecessary delay. 
 
Trump is also taking aim at Mike Pence unleashing his most blistering attack yet on his former vice president. In a social media post Saturday, Trump lashed out in some of his sharpest language referring to Liddle' Mike Pence, calling him delusional and not a very good person. 
 
But despite all these legal battles, the former president is slamming the Special Counsel everywhere he goes. Most recently in the early primary state of South Carolina, where Trump grossly understated the seriousness of the charges against him. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: The fake charges put forth by the Biden sham, we call it a sham indictment and, you know, the man that's doing. I really believe he's mentally ill. But these are outrageous. And it is in outrageous criminalization of political speech. They're trying to make it illegal to question the results of an election.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[05:10:04]
 
KINKADE: Well, CNN's Alayna Treene was at that South Carolina event and filed this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: The former President spent much of his Saturday night speech railing against the recent charges that he faces as well as attacking Special Counsel Jack Smith directly. Donald Trump called him "mentally-ill" as well as "deranged."
 
Now, the former president also made an appeal to Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He argued that they needed to step up and do something in order to help defend him against his recent legal matters. But one big thing that I find to be different from his speech on Saturdays, it came less than 24 hours after Jack Smith wrote in a court filing, asking a judge to set limits on what Trump's team can do with the evidence shared in the election subversion case. 
 
Now, the judge ultimately ruled on Saturday that Donald Trump's team must respond to that proposal by Monday afternoon, but there are a lot of questions going into Saturday night whether Donald Trump's team would encourage him to change his rhetoric in light of that core filing, but clearly, he did not. Alayna Treene, CNN, Columbia, South Carolina.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Well, a fourth criminal indictment against Donald Trump now seems likely this time in the state of Georgia. The case focuses on the former president's efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election result. Security around the courthouse in Atlanta has already ramped up ahead of those potential charges. More details now from CNN's Brian Todd.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TRUMP: This was never supposed to happen in America. 
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The already enormous legal pressure on the former president is likely about to intensify, a grand jury in Georgia expected to consider criminal charges against Donald Trump and his Republican allies.
 
KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: In terms of the Georgia case, it's going to add a significant burden on him to defend yet another case, these cases will all have significant trial deadlines and pretrial deadlines for hearings that he's going to have to be involved with and that will detract from his campaign.
 
TODD: A decision on whether to seek charges against the former president in Georgia will be made within the next few weeks by a team led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
 
FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: The work is accomplished. I mean, we've been working for two and a half years. We're ready to go.
 
TODD: The case focuses on the multi-pronged effort Trump launched in the wake of the 2020 election to overturn the results in Georgia. It included pressure on Georgia's governor and Secretary of State, both Republicans, to find enough votes to flip Joe Biden's win in the state. 
 
TRUMP: So what are we going to do here folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas -- I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.
 
TODD: When the governor and Secretary of State refused to go along, Trump urged state lawmakers to convene a special session to reverse Biden's victory. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This election was a sham. 
 
TODD: Trump ally Rudy Giuliani went to the Georgia House and Senate with bogus voter fraud claims.
 
TIA MITCHELL, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Rudy Giuliani is considered to have a lot of exposure in Georgia, because he spoke at those legislative hearings. And we know a lot of the information he shared was not true at the time.
 
TODD: Other Trump allies who could face criminal charges are Republican activists, the Trump campaign recruited to serve as fake electors. They allegedly played key roles in a failed plot to block the election from being certified.
 
MITCHELL: About half of them have received immunity deals which indicates they're working with the prosecution to tell them what they know.
 
TODD: CNN has reported that Fani Willis is considering bringing charges of conspiracy and racketeering in this case.
 
CHERKASKY: Racketeering charges are typically broader criminal schemes involving multiple individuals. And essentially the maximum punishment for those types of charges are typically much higher than other charges that are mentioned here.
 
TODD: Testimony has also been sought in the Georgia case from former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. Fani Willis has told local officials of threats she's received. Many of them have a racist nature during the period she has been investigating this case.
 
WILLIS: I've probably been called the N word more times in the last two and a half years then most 100 people combined.
 
TODD (on camera): Throughout the Georgia investigation, Donald Trump has vehemently denied wrongdoing as his allies, Trump has lashed out at Fani Willis calling her racist and "a lunatic Marxist." Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

KINKADE: More dangerous record-breaking heat is expected in the coming days from California to Florida, right now more than 60 million people are under heat alerts across the south and southwest, heat indices could top 115 degrees in some parts of the country. CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar breaks it down for us.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: More than 100 records are expected to be broken all the way through Monday of the upcoming week. And this stretches from errors on all the way over into Florida. 
 <br>[05:15:03]
 
Keep in mind, some of these cities could end up breaking records two if not even three days in a row, looking at the actual temperatures for Sunday. We will top out at 107 degrees in Dallas, 105 in San Antonio, 101 in Jackson, Mississippi, even Tallahassee topping out at 97 degrees. And that doesn't even take into account the humidity that's going to be factored in. 
 
The problem is in the long-term forecast that heat stays in place across the southern tier of the U.S. So there's not really much relief in sight for a lot of the cities, including Phoenix, which is expected to stay well above their average of 106 for at least the next seven days. 
 
The only cities that are likely to see some relief are the ones that are getting rain showers, and that's really going to be focused across the Midwest, spreading into the Mid-Atlantic region over the next 24 to 48 hours. The problem is it's not just some summer rain showers, you're also looking at the potential for some severe storms. 
 
The main concerns for a lot of these cities are going to be damaging winds, large hail, but flooding is also going to be a concern, especially for hard hit states like Kentucky and Tennessee, which have seen a tremendous amount of rain, just in the last 48 hours. Now, we're adding more rain on top of that. So areas like Cincinnati, Nashville, St. Louis, even stretching down to Atlanta all have the potential for those severe storms on Sunday, the forecast rainfall for a lot of these areas, you're mostly looking at two to four inches. But remember, this is compounded on top of whatever any of these communities have had in the last two to three days. Now, we're going to be adding on top of that as well.

KINKADE: Thanks so much to Allison Chinchar. 
 
Well, Russia has launched a barrage of strikes on targets across Ukraine, among them a blood transfusion center which went up in flames. We'll have that story ahead. 
 
Plus, Niger's coup leaders face pressure to cede power by today. We'll tell you what's at stake if they refuse to reinstate the president. 
 
And later, in the show how Swiftonomics is pumping billions of dollars into the economy right around the country.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:21:06]
 
KINKADE: Well, Ukraine says its air defenses held their own during a barrage of Russian aerial strikes overnight. Russia launched dozens of drones and missiles aiming at an airbase in western Ukraine, as well as some other targets. But Ukraine says most of the aerial weapons heading its way was shot down. And officials say two people were killed in a separate air strike in Kharkiv region Saturday night. 
 
Preliminary reports also show for other people wounded. And earlier President Zelenskyy said a Russian guided bomb hit a blood transfusion center in the city of Kupiansk setting it on fire. 
 
For more Nada Bashir joins us from London. Good to have you with us Nada. So let's start on the latest news just in that Russia launching this wave of attacks across Ukraine. Fortunately, most of those were shut down according to Ukrainian forces. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: That's right, Ukraine's Air Force come on scene that a total of 70 Aerial weapons used overnight in two waves of attacks. We've seen an intensification of the aerial bombardment across Ukraine's eastern region. 
 
Now, Ukrainian authorities say that the majority were either intercepted or downed by their air defense systems. We saw last night dozens of cruise missiles launched according to Ukrainian authorities from Russian territory targeting key areas in eastern Ukraine as well as further afield. And then early in the hours of this morning, further drone attacks, Iranian-made Shahed attract drones, the majority of which were also intercepted and done.
 
Now, one of the key focuses on the key targets in this aerial bombardment attack that we saw overnight was a strategic airbase in western Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities say that explosions were heard in the facility that damage was sustained by some residential buildings. But of course, this comes amid a continued exchange of drone attacks we've seen in the last few days. Ukraine using sea drones to target Russian vessels in and around the Black Sea area. 
 
And in fact, just in the last few moments, we've had confirmation from Russian state media, saying that Moscow airport temporarily face disruptions due to concerns there around a drone situation, the mayor of Moscow, saying that a drone had attempted to break through Moscow assets that it had also been intercepted.
 
KINKADE: And Nada, of course, we're learning a little bit more about this attack on a Ukrainian blood transfusion center. It happened just a few kilometers from Russia's border. President Zelenskyy calling those responsible beasts, what more can you tell us about that attack?
 
BASHIR: Well, over the last few days, we have seen the attacks on the Kharkiv region really intensifying and this is the latest in those attacks according to President Zelenskyy, a Russian guided aerial bomber was deployed used against his blood transfusion center setting the center ablaze and sadly, there have been fatalities confirmed. Among those wounded in the attack, though no official figures just yet. But we have seen it continued bombardment of the Kharkiv region. Of cause, that continued fighting among those frontlines along that enhance Kharkiv border. 
 
But of course further afield, we are continuing to see Ukraine try to push ahead with its counter offensive. We've learned from Russian backed authorities in the Donetsk region that Ukraine has carried out its own attacks there. They claim that Ukrainian armed forces use cluster munitions in some areas, including targeting a university although that hasn't been independently verified by CNN at this stage. But according to state media, citing emergency services on the ground in the Donetsk region, no people were present at the University at the time. 
 
KINKADE: All right, good to hear about that. Nada Bashir for us. Stay across all those developments. Thanks very much. 
 
Well, today is the deadline in Niger's coup leaders were given to reinstate the country's ousted president. A block of West African nations set that deadline and drafted a plan for potential military intervention if their demands were met. Niger's outside Prime Minister's hoping it won't come to that, telling Reuters that diplomacy can still prevail. 
 <br>[05:25:22]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OUHOUMOUDOU MAHAMADOU, OUSTED NIGERIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We expect President Bazoum to be released, to be reinstalled in his chair and for all the institutions that were allegedly dissolved to be restored in their entirety.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: CNN's Larry Madowo joins us now with more on all of this. Larry, good to have you on the program. So the deadline for the restoration and of democracy and of course, the reinstatement of the president is today. If the coup leaders don't adhere to that ultimatum set by the neighboring countries, what could happen?
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The coup leaders in Niger will almost certainly not adhere to that threat by ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, they have shown no sign that they are listening to any of the mediation efforts, or any of the threats from the international community or from ECOWAS, which means that then ECOWAS led by Nigeria, President Bola Tinubu, who is the chair of the heads of state has to make good on the threat to militarily intervene in the country. And if that were to happen, then that means that the country could be dragged into a protracted conflicts that would have ripple effects across the region. 
 
The Chiefs of Defense said that themselves, there's also this claimer from Burkina Faso and Mali who border Niger and who said that if there's military intervention in Nigeria, that will be a direct act of war against them that they would be banding together to defend Nigeria. So those are two situations that this regional bloc does not want. Yet, President Mohamed Bazoum, who remains under house arrest, the presidential palace has written this extraordinary op-ed in The Washington Post where he says I write as a hostage, "In our hour of need, I call him the U.S. government and the entire international community to help us restore our constitutional order. Fighting for our shared values, including democratic pluralism and respect for the rule of law is the only way to make sustainable progress against poverty and terrorism. The Nigerian people will never forget your support at this pivotal moment in our history." 
 
So he essentially says he wants this block or somebody else to rescue him from inside the presidential palace, where he's been for almost 10 days now. He is holed up there. He's not been deposed officially, like he's not been taken out of that place, and put on trial or arrested or gone to exile. And yet, these men who claim to control the country continue to make announcements about suspending their ties of France and Togo and the U.S. and dismissing people and all of that. So it's impossible, this situation and now the ECOWAS has to pronounce itself on today, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: All right, we will watch this situation very closely. Larry Madowo, from Nairobi, thanks very much. 
 
Well, still ahead on CNN Newsroom. They are fighting to stay in the running for a third straight World Cup title. We'll have live updates on Team USA's match against Sweden. Also ahead, the White House wants federal workers to come back into
 
 the office more frequently. The reasons for the policy change and much more after a short break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:31:56]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world, I'm Lynda Kinkade, and this is CNN Newsroom. 
 
I want to get back to our top story this hour. In Melbourne, Australia, one of the most anticipated matches of the Women's World Cup is underway right now. Team USA, the two-time defending champions facing world number three, Sweden in the knockout stage, and right now 30 minutes into the game, neither side has scored. Our CNN's Carolyn Manno joins us now from New York at a watch party. Good to have you with us, Carolyn, it is of course very early into this game. But what have you seen so far from both sides?
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lynda, it's been a really physical match so far, which is what we expected, these two teams are really well suited to one another. So we knew that it wasn't going to be easy. But the United States has come out with significant energy in the last couple of minutes, as we've seen here, they've had really significant chances in front of the net. Now, it's about capitalizing on those chances. And that's been the knock on the U.S. team so far, creating opportunities that connectivity for Sweden as expected their physical, the bar behind me kind of reacting with every chance the United States has, but we'll see how this shakes out in the minutes to come still early goings during the game.
 
KINKADE: And of course, Carolina, it's just up to 5:30 in the morning, clearly some dedicated fans there behind you. Give us a sense of the food from the feeling from those who have turned out this morning to watch the game?
 
MANNO: Yeah, you know, it's a bit of a mix as some people are ordering breakfast here at 5 a.m. or just after the 5 a.m. hours. Some people are drinking their breakfast at this hour. But everybody's really excited. And we've actually seen some fans from Sweden come through the doors as well. So these are the dedicated fans that are here. 
 
Around this time, normally it will be completely empty. And the manager of the bar here at Radisson Midtown said that earlier when the United States played their first game, there were thousand people here that was 9 o'clock at night. I'd say there's about 50 people here right now. But the energy is really -- there's a lot of American fans hoping that the United States can get this done and extend their stay at this year's World Cup. 
 
KINKADE: Excellent. And of course, Carolyn, the U.S. did receive a bit of criticism for that play in the group stage. I talked to us about the changes for this game.
 
MANNO: Well, sorry, Lynda. It is a little bit loud here, a rambunctious for 5 a.m. I think you were asking about some of the criticism that the United States received. They have, you know, and they haven't hit their stride. They did switch up their formation, they've got a 4, 2, 3, 1 rotation to start this game. And we're seeing them come out motivated. They want to win. They know that the expectations are high, they know that the pressure is on them. They know that they are the top ranked team in the world with the target on their back. And so this is the time to respond. Right now, it's win or go home. And this would be the earliest exit for the U.S. women's team that they've ever had at a major international tournament. 
 <br>[05:35:00]
 
So I think the focus is there. The energy is there. The intensity is there but this is a very talented Swedish side and there's a lot to still come in this game. I know the fans here will be ready for it.
 
KINKADE: Exactly. Carolyn Manno, it is good to have you there at the watch party in New York. A great place to watch the game. We'll chat soon. Thanks so much. 
 
Well, the White House says it's time for more federal employees to end your way from working from home. An email sent to Cabinet Secretaries by the White House Chief of Staff is pushing that measure. Work From Home became popular of course during the COVID pandemic, but as CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak reports, administration officials say going back to the office has benefits.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: The White House is making a major new push to get federal workers back into the office now that the National COVID Emergency has ended, the White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients saying in an email obtained by CNN and sent to the heads of cabinet agencies, that this is a priority of President Biden's to get federal workers back into the office. He says that it will increase productivity. But he also cites the importance of these face- to-face interactions in developing younger federal workers. 
 
Now, the White House had been coming under pressure both from Republicans but also from the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, who had voiced increasing concern about the number of vacant office spaces in her city. 
 
Now, of course, this is an issue that has been going on in workplaces across the country and the federal government is no different. Some workplaces have struggled to convince workers to come back into the office after they had structured their whole lives around working from home. But President Biden says that this is a priority and in that email, Jeff Zients directs cabinet heads and agencies and departments to work and aggressively execute this shift over the coming months. 
 
Now Jeff Zients doesn't say that work from home will be eliminated entirely. Instead, he says he wants to work to develop a solution while ensuring we have the in-person time we need to build a strong culture trust in their personal connections. Kevin Liptak, CNN in Wilmington, Delaware. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Well, we now know the identity of the man accused of shooting two Florida police officers following an hour's long manhunt. The Orlando Police Department said the 28-year-old suspected gunman Daton S. Viel is now dead. He apparently exchanged gunfire with a SWAT team while he was barricaded in a hotel yesterday morning. The two officers were shot while conducting a traffic stop on a Friday night for a vehicle wanted in connection with a homicide. Officials say the suspect had an extensive criminal history.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHIEF ERIC SMITH, ORLANDO POLICE DEPARTMENT: This is a tragedy for a department and in that good officers shot. These officers out here every day protecting our community. They put their lives on the underline every day to keep us safe and for some piece of crap to do this to them because they don't want to go back to prison is ridiculous. And we're not going to put up with it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: And last check the two offices remain in critical condition.
 
While Israel's Parliament maybe on a long summer break but that hasn't called the weekly protests over the government's plans to reform the nation's cause. We'll have that story when we return.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:41:47]
 
KINKADE: The U.S. State Department is condemning Friday's fatal shooting of a Palestinian man by Israeli settlers calling it a terror attack. A funeral for the 19-year-old victim was held Saturday. According to Israel's military, Israeli settlers and Palestinian villages had been throwing rocks at each other when some of the settlers fired their weapons towards the Palestinians, killing one of them. Israeli police say two Israeli settlers are being held for questioning. 
 
The U.S. is also condemning as a terror attack the fatal shooting of as an Israeli police officer in downtown Tel Aviv. Police say two officers were on patrol in the financial district when a Palestinian man fired a pistol striking one officer Saturday. The suspect was then shot by the second police officer. Both the gunman and the wounded officer were later pronounced dead at hospital. 
 
With just hours after that shooting. Israeli protesters again flooded the streets of central Tel Aviv calling on the government to stop its contentious overhaul of the nation's judiciary.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Israel's parliament, the Knesset may be on its long summer recess. We may be in the midst of summer holidays. But as you can see, there is still no let up to these protests against the government's judicial overhaul once again, more than eight months and there are still tens of thousands if not more people on the streets protesting against this judicial overhaul, which these protesters say will irreparably damage Israeli democracy and they will be no less up they say until the government either reaches a compromise or until it backs down.

 <br>[05:50:08]
 
I've certainly heard little girls screaming all day long here, just waiting, waiting on Simone. And folks are so excited, in fact, that they sold out every single seat 7200 of them, all of them here to witness the greatest of all time back in action. And this meat is so important because it is the last chance to qualify for the U.S. nationals in San Jose. And then later on in the fall for the World Championships. And all that leading of course to the Olympics.
 
Biles has been registered for all four events, and people keeping a close eye on how she does after this two-year hiatus. And that's the last time we saw Simone Biles compete was in Tokyo, where she shocked the world by withdrawing from all of her events after suffering from the twisties. That's a spatial and a mental block that gymnasts can suffer from where they can't tell what's up and what's down when they're flipping in mid-air. So certainly problematic for an elite gymnasts. She, after Tokyo -- after the Tokyo Games disappeared from competitive gymnastics now, so many people are excited to see her back.

That that is just not reality. Biles, 26 years old, recently married. And now getting back on the mat again. Isabel Rosales, CNN Hoffman Estates, Illinois.
