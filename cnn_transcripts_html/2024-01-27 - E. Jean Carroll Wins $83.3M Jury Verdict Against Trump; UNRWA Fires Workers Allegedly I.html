ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to all of you watching in the United States and around the world. I'm Anna Coren. Ahead on CNN Newsroom. Donald Trump and his main rival for the GOP nomination react to a stunning verdict in his civil defamation suit. 
 
The Governor of Texas makes a stand when it comes to handling control of the U.S.-Mexico border back to the federal authorities. 
 
Plus, a United Nations Agency working in Gaza responds to allegations that some of its workers may have helped Hamas carry out the deadly October 7th terror attack. 
 
Well, Donald Trump says the verdict in his latest legal loss is, quote, "absolutely ridiculous" and he is looking to appeal. A jury says the embattled former U.S. president should pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation. 
 
In 2019, Trump made disparaging public comments about Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault. Carroll's attorney tells CNN's Anderson Cooper that her client is overjoyed with the verdict.

ROBERTA KAPLAN, E. JEAN CARROLL'S ATTORNEY: She cried. She showed more emotion, and I've known her for a long time now that I've ever seen her show. She feels that she got justice from the jury today. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Well, CNN's Kara Scannell has more from outside the courthouse. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: After about three hours of deliberations, the jury returned its verdict, awarding E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages. That's a significant win for Carroll, who has been pursuing Trump for years in this defamation case for statements he made in 2019 when he was president. The way the jury broke down this verdict, they were awarding Carroll
 
 $7.3 million for emotional harm, $11 million to repair her reputation, and $65 million in punitive damages. That is the punishment phase for Trump, which they send a clear message to Trump and agreeing with Carroll's attorneys closing arguments in their closings. 
 
They said that the only way to hold Donald Trump accountable was to hit him in his pocketbook to make him stop repeating the defamatory statements that a previous jury had already found to be defamatory. 
 
They argued to the jury that Donald Trump had disregarded that verdict, didn't respect it, and has repeated those defamatory statements ever since. It was at that moment in closing arguments that Donald Trump stood up, walked out of the courtroom. 
 
Now, he did later return for his lawyers closing arguments. They made the case that Donald Trump couldn't be held accountable for mean tweets, and that E. Jean Carroll had asked for some of this attention. 
 
Obviously, the jury of seven men and two women disregarding Donald Trump's argument and awarding Carol this significant amount of money. She had asked initially for more than $10 million, this verdict sending a message to Donald Trump. 
 
Now, he responded by calling it ridiculous. His attorney said it was a witch hunt. Take a listen. 
 
ALINA HABBA, TRUMP'S LAWYER: So many Americans are so proud that he is running again and so excited to run to the ballot box, but don't get it twisted. We are seeing a violation of our justice system. This is wrong, but we are in the State of New York. We are in a New York jury, and that is why we are seeing these witch hunts, these hoaxes, as he calls them. 
 
SCANNELL: Trump's attorney Alina Habba also said that they would appeal the verdict. The judge said he would enter a final judgment in this case over the next few days. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: Well, Trump's immediate political rival is giving her thoughts on the multi-million-dollar verdict as well. After citing the $83 million in damages, Republican Presidential Candidate Nikki Haley says in a social media post, quote, "Donald Trump wants to be the presumptive Republican nominee and we're talking about $83 million in damages. We're not talking about fixing the border, we're not talking about tackling inflation. America can do better than Donald Trump and Joe Biden." The question is, will this work in Haley's favor? 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEE CARTER, PARTNER, MASLANSKY, + PARTNERS: I think her point is well made with her supporters. And you look at Republicans by and large, there's really two sets of them. There's those that are going to support Trump no matter what, that are right now enraged, that are rallying behind him, that are going to say that no matter what, this was unfair, and then those that are saying, I cannot believe this is the candidate. 
 <br>[04:05:01]
 
And those, you saw in New Hampshire about 35% of those -- those that voted that were Republicans. New Hampshire said they would never, ever vote for Donald Trump. And I think she's trying to go after those folks. 
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Why is she mentioning Biden at the tweet? I get it that like eventually she wants to be up against him. I mean, that makes perfect sense, but he doesn't really have anything to do with the fact that a jury of nine people found Trump responsible for defaming someone. 
 
KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yeah. I mean, look, this is a pretty weak broadside from her. And, you know, I think it's also just too little, too late. I mean, you could see a world where had she taken on the substance of what we're now kind of seeing play out about Donald Trump, that he's mired in these legal cases, that he's chaotic, that he cares only about himself. 
 
You know, if she had made that case from the beginning, frankly, if a lot of the Republican candidates had made that case from the beginning, maybe we would have seen a different outcome. Maybe not, but certainly the strategy that they employed of essentially not touching him didn't work, because here we are. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Well, in regard to Trump's legal troubles, Haley's campaign is saying this week is just a small taste of what's to come if Trump wins the nomination. 
 
Israel is calling for an urgent investigation into U.N. workers. It says we're involved in the October 7th attack. They were staff members with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the group that helps Palestinian refugees in Gaza. But now those staffers have been fired. 
 
Well, CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson has more on the allegations and the impact it could have on aid to Palestinians. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, this is a very significant development for UNRWA. They are the principal U.N. organization delivering humanitarian aid inside Gaza, providing shelter for all those hundreds of thousands of displaced people inside Gaza. And this will have an effect on their funding, it's not clear how much. But what we understand at the moment is that, an Israeli authorities told UNRWA that they were aware that a number of their workers have been involved in Hamas' brutal October 7th attacks. 
 
UNRWA said that they investigated this. The U.N. Secretary General was made aware in a statement he said that this was horrendous, that he said that there would be a thorough investigation. He also spoke, the U.N. Secretary General also spoke with the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who said that he was pleased to see that the U.N. was going to have a complete and independent review of what happened, of an investigation into the events around this. 
 
We've heard also from the defense minister here saying this is vital to have clarity on international funding for humanitarian aid in Gaza in the future so that this sort of thing can't happen again. 
 
The Foreign Minister in Israel has also said that this mustn't happen again, that it's important for it to be investigated thoroughly. We don't know from UNRWA themselves how many people were involved, but both the U.S. State Department and the defense minister here have said that 12 people were involved. 
 
Now, UNRWA in its totality has about 30,000 employees across the region. It has 13,000 people working inside of Gaza. So as far as we understand at the moment, this involved 12 people who have now been terminated. But it is triggering now a big review and investigation, and it has triggered the U.S. State Department to put a temporary pause on additional funding at the moment. We don't know what impact this will have on the humanitarian aid, when it might have, but I think the indications are there will be no immediate effect, but of course a great concern going forward. Nic Robertson, CNN, Tel Aviv, Israel. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: The U.N. Secretary General says he hopes Israel will duly comply with the International Court of Justice ruling, ordering it to take action to prevent genocide in Gaza. Well, that's being echoed by South Africa, the country which filed the case. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NALEDI PANDOR, SOUTH AFRICAN FOREIGN MINISTER: I live in hope that Israel will act in accord with the decisions and will show the court that it does take the court seriously. If it doesn't, what happens is we are opening up room for all to act with impunity against innocent people. And I certainly don't wish to live in a world like that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: For its part, Israel has also been welcoming the interim decision, especially because it stops short of calling for a ceasefire. Well, our Scott McLean is live in Istanbul with more. Scott, how is Israel responding to the ICJ ruling? 
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Anna. First, it's important to point out that this is not a final ruling. The final one could take years to actually litigate, but what this is, is a temporary injunction, you can call it, or a ruling on whether or not the allegations leveled by South Africa of genocide are plausible enough to warrant these measures. And in six of the nine requests made by the South Africans, the court granted that. So this is broadly being welcomed by Arab states. 
 <br>[04:10:12] And when it comes to the Israelis and the Palestinians, while the Palestinians, obviously we're hoping that the court went further, they are also hailing this as a victory. The Israelis, they don't think that this should have been in court in the first place, but they are also praising this ruling. 
 
So the Palestinian authorities, foreign minister said that this was a ruling in favor of humanity and international law. And Prime Minister Netanyahu himself said that this was a rejection of discrimination against Israel. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people. Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself. The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected. The charge of genocide level against Israel is not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCLEAN: So this ruling by the court, Anna, is binding, and it cannot be appealed. But the difficulty for the court is that it actually has no mechanism to enforce this. Case in point, this same court ruled almost two years ago that Russia needs to stop its invasion of Ukraine. But as we all know that war is still very much underway. 
 
You had civil society groups like Human Rights Watch, and the C. International calling for the Israelis to actually implement these measures against them. There is no immediate indication that the Israelis are going to significantly change tack at this point. But if you ask the South Africans, they believe that while this ruling didn't explicitly call for a ceasefire, they believe that Israel were to actually implement these measures that they would, in practice, need to stop the fighting, Anna. 
 
COREN: Scott, let's talk about the situation on the ground in Gaza. What are you learning there? What's the latest? 
 
MCLEAN: Hey, and yeah, so we're talking about now day five and to day six of Israel's siege on Khan Younis. And the situation in the hospitals is particularly dire. At Al-Amal Hospital, for instance, the Palestinian Red Crescent actually uses that building as its headquarters. And they said that there was a house targeted just outside of the gate. And some of the shrapnel actually came through the walls. That is the force of the fighting that we are talking about. 
 
We also have video from inside of the Nasser Hospital. And I should warn our viewers that it's pretty difficult to watch because the situation there is pretty miserable to put it lightly. One described -- one doctor described it as a real horror. He says that they are out of food. They are out of painkillers. There are still some 150 staff there, though many of the doctors have left the area. There are hundreds of patients there. And of course, there are people who are taking shelter inside that area as well. 
 
And many people have left that entire neighborhood as this siege by the Israelis continues. They have been told to take the main route elsewhere. But we have videos showing an Israeli tank watching over this steady stream of people. 
 
We also have some reports from Palestinians who say that, look, the Israelis are not discriminating between or distinguishing between actual fighters and civilians. Some people say that when they're trying to move around, they're being shot at. We have put those claims to the IDF. We don't have a specific response to that just yet. But the situation inside the hospitals as this siege continues, Anna, as MSF or Doctors Without Borders describes it, they say that medical services have absolutely collapsed. The WHO says that it is extremely challenging to get supplies into the area. 
 
All the while, the IDF continues to insist that this operation is being very precise. They are using snipers. They are taking out only fighters. Obviously, many of the Palestinians on the ground, though, would beg to differ, Anna. 
 
COREN: Scott McLean in Istanbul, we appreciate the update. Thank you. 
 
We are getting reports that a British oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden was hit by a missile on Friday after it transited the Red Sea. It's the latest in a string of attacks along the key shipping route. 
 
The U.S. says one of its warships and other ships have responded to a distress call from the burning tanker. There are no reported injuries at this time. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the strike, saying it's in support of the Palestinian people. 
 
Well, meanwhile, Houthi run media is reporting that two air strikes hit the western coast of Yemen near Hodeidah a few hours ago. Well, that statement comes after the U.S. said it destroyed a Houthi anti- ship missile that was aimed into the Red Sea and prepared to launch. 
 <br>[04:15:14]
 
We'll still ahead, with the Biden administration in a standoff with Texas over jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration laws. 
 
Plus, the U.S. Senate is circling a deal on immigration reform but what chance does it have of passing the House? That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN: The U.S. government is demanding access to areas along the border with Mexico that are currently being blocked by the State of Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that federal border patrol agents can proceed with removing razor wire erected by the Texas State government. 
 
But the state is preventing federal agents from accessing parts of the border. Well, CNN's Rosa Flores has details on the standoff. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There are two separate issues that are following on the U.S.-Mexico border in the Eagle Pass area. First of all, the ruling issued by the U.S. Supreme Court and then standoff that's going on between Texas and the Biden administration in Shelby Park and in an area that encompasses about 2.5 miles of river.
 <br>[04:20:09]
 
About the Supreme Court ruling first. What that says is it gives Border Patrol authority to cut razor wire in that area. According to a law enforcement source, the U.S. Federal government does not have a plan to remove all of that razor wire and instead what the federal government plans to do is exercise discretion whenever that wire needs to get cut for medical emergencies or operational needs. They plan to cut the wire.
 
As for the standoff on Shelby Park and the 2.5 miles of river, Texas has been doubling down erecting more razor wire barriers and also more fencing, which keeps migrants out and also border patrol out of that area. That's what's so extraordinary about this is that the State of Texas is keeping border patrol from an area where border patrol normally would be enforcing federal law. 
 
And that is what is so remarkable here because Governor Greg Abbott and Republicans have been accusing the Biden administration of not enforcing federal immigration laws were in this area of Eagle Pass in Shelby Park and in these 2.5 miles of river, border patrol can't enforce federal law, well, because they don't have access. Rosa Flores, CNN, Houston. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: Returning to one of our top stories, the International Court of Justice in the Hague has ordered Israel to, quote, "take all measures to prevent genocide in Gaza." Well, this follows South Africa accusing Israel of violating international laws on genocide in its war in the territory. 
 
Ronen Bergman joins us now live from Tel Aviv. He's a staff writer for the "New York Times" magazine. Ronen, great to have you with us. What did you make of the ruling? 
 
RONEN BERGMAN, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Well, I think it's far from the worst that some Israeli experts expected which would be in order to stop the fighting and basically acknowledging that the fighting consists of operations, actions from Israel that could be seen as genocidal war crimes. 
 
Yet, the majority of the judges, all but two, the Israeli judge, which is, you know, one of the -- first of all, one of the most important judges in the history of the country of a Supreme Court president and the Ugandan representative, they voted against. But most of the judges did order Israel to do whatever it can to stop
 
 or to prevent the acts of genocide. It's not fully recognizing the South African claim, but I think it does draw a line that should make Israeli authorities quite worried, especially when they're not quoting in their ruling, they're not quoting some of the most ultra-right representative, the parliament, but they are quoting the Minister of Defense and the President to that are consider moderate. And I think the judges knew what they're doing using the quotes from those, and not from the extremists. 
 
COREN: Yeah, Ronen, it may be a stinging rebuke to Israel's war in Gaza, but the fact the court didn't order a ceasefire means that this ruling is largely symbolic. So what effect will it really have? 
 
BERGMAN: I think that it will have, first of all, an effect on the statements of Israeli seniors and elected officials that will be very, hopefully, much more careful in what they say because they understand that what they say has a meaning that could be interpreted as calling for genocide. That's one. 
 
Second, I think Israel took this, as Israeli authorities, took this very seriously. They understand the meaning, they understand the impact, they understand, and even if South Africa didn't win, it can still be used against Israeli next time. 
 
So I think that they will probably put more obstacles and more oversight over the IDF actions in Gaza. At the same time, I think the judges also devoted place, though they didn't have to, to the atrocities of Hamas, the murder, the rapes, the killing of children in the abduction of civilians on October 7, and also, which was also out of the expected realm of their verdict, they called for the immediate release of the of the hostages. 
 
I think that they tried to do something that would be balanced, but also be some kind of flag to Israel to be more careful in the land, the incursion, the ground operation in Gaza.
 <br>[04:25:03]
 
COREN: While international pressure is growing on Israel to reduce the death and destruction in Gaza, we've heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu in a statement. He said, the very notion that Israel is perpetrating genocide is not only false, it is outrageous, and the court's willingness to discuss it is a mark of shame that will last for generations. I mean, this sounds like a leader that's doubling down. 
 
BERGMAN: Yeah, well, first of all, I'm referring to my colleague, the "New York Times," David Leonhardt, who three days ago published the numbers of people being killed in Gaza, both Hamas or gunmen and militants and civilians. That is declined, of course, any civilian that is killed is significant, but the number has declined to one- third to what it was in December. So I think Israel is looking quite seriously on the international pressure. 
 
Netanyahu, of course, has his own policy, and he will say that Israel will continue until the full victory. I think that Netanyahu -- that Mr. Netanyahu, also acknowledges the dis-synchronization of the different watches. While the IDF says that it needs at least two years to finish dismantling Hamas and destroying the subterranean network. The watch of the internal pressure from the public, who some of it doesn't see the -- or doesn't understand why this war continues, why more and more soldiers are being killed, the international pressure about the civilians being killed in Gaza. 
 
And of course, the lack of ammunition because Israel needs to save a lot in case there's another front in the north. I think those watches will become crucial much earlier than two years. And I think that Mr. Netanyahu, you hear the tone from him. I think he also acknowledges the fact that Israel will not stay in Gaza enough time to dismantle the whole military infrastructure of Hamas. 
 
COREN: Israel has a month to respond to the court on the steps that it will take. Ronen Bergman, good to speak to you. Thank you for your time. 
 
BERGMAN: Thank you. 
 
COREN: Well, a new twist in the war of words over a deadly plane crash in Russia. Ukraine corroborates a list of passengers but says that still doesn't prove the Russian version of events. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:30:58]
 
COREN: Welcome back to our viewers in the United States, Canada, and around the world. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong. This is CNN Newsroom.
 
Updating you on our top story, a jury is ordering the front runner for the Republican presidential nomination to pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation. 
 
The courtroom drama stems from 2019 when Donald Trump was president and made disparaging public comments about Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault. Well, CNN's Kristen Holmes has more from Washington. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump was not in the courtroom when that verdict was read, just his attorneys, where he instead was sitting on an airplane -- in an airplane on a tarmac, getting ready to leave New York and go to a political event where he's going to speak later Saturday. 
 
And that's when he fired off a series of posts on "True Social," one of them, not surprisingly, immediately linking this to the political, saying, absolutely ridiculous, I fully disagree with both verdicts and will be appealing this whole Biden-directed witch hunt focused on me and the Republican Party. Our legal system is out of control and being used as a political
 
 weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment rights. This is not America. He went on to post again, "There is no longer justice in America. Our judicial system is broken and unfair."
 
A couple of things to note here, of course, there has been no evidence of any link in this case to President Biden, but this is something that he routinely does. He links all of these legal cases together. And then says that they are election interference. And I will tell you from going to various campaign events, this is a strategy that works among his supporters. 
 
The other thing to point out in the statement is there is absolutely no mention of E. Jean Carroll. This comes after weeks and especially days of him posting routinely about E. Jean Carroll. So perhaps the message that the jury sent him, that $83.3 million message is getting through. 
 
We also heard E. Jean Carroll's lawyer saying, if you continue to lash out at her, we will continue to sue. One thing about Donald Trump, he cares deeply about his finances and his money, and he does not want to part with his money. 
 
Now, of course, as we've noted, they are going to appeal this, but I can tell you from sources that he has been absolutely livid. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: Well, the White House now has new guidelines for Cabinet members who are unable to perform their duties for one reason or another. The new rules come after U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was out of touch with the President and even much of his chain of command during major surgery in December. 
 
Austin underwent general anesthesia and then had severe complications from an invasive procedure for prostate cancer. Austin is expected back at the Pentagon on Monday after nearly a month-long absence. The House Armed Services Committee is calling on Austin to testify about his failure to notify key government officials. 
 
The Biden administration told the U.S. Congress on Friday that it plans to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. The move comes after Turkey approved Sweden's NATO membership. The $23 billion sale caps off more than a year of behind-the-scenes negotiations, which also include the sale to Greece of nearly $9 billion in F-35s. 
 
Congress is expected to approve both sales. Sweden still needs approval from Hungary before it can become a NATO member. 
 
Ukraine says there's still no evidence its prisoners of war were on a plane that went down in Russia, despite corroborating a list of passengers released by Russia. 
 
Kyiv says the names on the list match the POWs scheduled for a prisoner swap on Wednesday. But Ukraine says that still doesn't prove they were actually on the flight. Moscow claims Ukraine shot down the Russian plane knowing that its POWs were on it, which President Putin doubled down on yesterday. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We weren't just bringing them there, but the main intelligence Department of the Ukrainian Armed Forces even knew that we were taking 65 servicemen there. While the plan number was, I think, 190. And knowing this, they struck that aircraft. I don't know whether they did it by mistake or thoughtlessly, but it's obvious that they did it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Ukraine is not saying whether it fired at the plane or not, but it denies receiving any notification from Russia that POWs would be on that flight. 
 
CNN has learned that a 6.1 magnitude earthquake has struck Guatemala. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake hit near a city on the Pacific Coast at a depth of about 108 kilometers or 67 miles. Earthquakes happen relatively often in Guatemala because the country is located in a major fault zone. We'll have more information as it becomes available.

COREN: Denouncing the horrors of the Holocaust. That was the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism at the U.N. Memorial to honor victims and survivors of the Holocaust and other genocides. U.N. General Assembly delegates also observed a moment of silence on the eve of today's International Holocaust Remembrance Day. January 27th is also the anniversary of the 1945 Liberation of Auschwitz, the largest Nazi concentration and death camp. 
 
As the world pauses to reflect on the atrocities of the Holocaust this weekend, one woman's journey to escape the reach of the Nazis as a young girl is being shared on the big screen. Hundreds of children made that trip to safety with the help of a British businessman. CNN's Isa Soares has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is your passport?
 
Vera Schaufeld was just nine years old when her parents sent her to England. 
 
VERA SCHAUFELD, KINDERTRANSPORT REFUGEE: It was totally bewildering. 
 
SOARES: It was May 1939 after Adolf Hitler's Nazi troops invaded her homeland. 
 
SCHAUFELD: Slovakia wasn't a safe country for Jewish people. These are some of the pictures.
 
SOARES: Now age 93, her journey and her escape from Hitler's wrath is being retold in the motion picture, "One Life." 
 
SCHAUFELD: We are working to evacuate these children by train to safety in Britain. 
 
SOARES: Vera was one of 669 children who made it to England, thanks to the work of British stockbroker Nicholas Winton. Moved by the horrific situation he had seen in Prague, Winton organized a rescue operation for children in what's now known as the Kindertransport Program. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ordinary people wouldn't stand for this if they knew what was actually happening. 
 
SOARES: He managed against the odds to get eight train loads of children out. The ninth one never made it. 
 
SCHAUFELD: We just looked out and waved goodbye and that's the last time I saw my family. And I felt really scared. I thought, you know, nobody's going to come and collect me through our darling. 
 
SOARES: Vera was hopeful she'd be reunited with her family, until she and the world learned the true extent of the atrocities under Hitler, the slaughter of six million Jews in concentration camps. 
 
SCHAUFELD: I heard from the Red Cross that my parents and my grandmother and all my family weren't alive anymore. 
 
SOARES: How old were you at that point? 
 
SCHAUFELDL: I was 14. 
 
SOARES: A teenager with only words and memories to hold onto. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is there anyone in the audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton? Vera and the other Kindertransport children had no idea who saved them until a TV show nearly 50 years later. 
 
SCHAUFELD: I didn't know that somebody had organized and made it possible for me to come and for all of us. 
 
SOARES: Despite the trauma she had lived through, Vera committed herself to a life of service, sharing her story to preserve the memory of the Holocaust. 
 
SCHAUFELD: I hope that that would mean end of genocide. You know, people kept saying never again. But yes, I mean, it's gone on and on. 
 
SOARES: Do you think humanity has learned from it?
 
SCHAUFELD: I wish I could say I feel it has, but when you look at the world I don't think we have learnt very much. 
 
SOARES: You would have seen also after the horrendous attacks committed by Hamas on October the 7th that we saw a sharp rise in antisemitism -- 
 
SCHAUFELD: Yes.
 
SOARES: -- across Europe? We've also seen such a horrendous death toll in Gaza?
 
SCHAUFELD: Yes.
 
SOARES: Who's responsible for this? 
 
SCHAUFELD: Well, I think Netanyahu and the government, Hamas really started it, planned it, and that was horrendous. But this is a reaction that goes, I think, very far. 
 
SOARES: A clarity many leaders struggle to formulate. A wisdom Nic shared with Vera before he died. 
 
SCHAUFELD: People who listen learn history and people don't learn anything from history. They learn when they have empathy for other people. That's when they understand.

MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: We knew the King was going into hospital, we just didn't know when but we got a brief statement from Buckingham Palace saying he has been admitted for this scheduled treatment. Also saying his majesty would like to thank all of those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and that the king is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness. What he is referring to there is that the palace didn't necessarily
 
 need to reveal that he had an enlarged prostate because it didn't have a huge public interest as head of state. But the king wanted to release that information to encourage other men to go and get themselves checked and it did have that effect because there was a large increase in inquiries to the National Health Service about enlarged prostates off the back of the king's announcement. 
 
A source has told me that the king has gone to visit the Princess of Wales who is in hospital for abdominal surgery. She's in recovery at the moment. The king went to see her before his own surgery. We believe they're in the same hospital. 
 
I don't think we're going to get any more information. A source saying they're not going to reveal any more details about the treatment that the king is receiving. Whilst they accept they need to reveal some medical details they do think there's a line there and at some point they start invading their privacy. Max Foster, CNN London.

JURGEN KLOPP, LIVERPOOL MANAGER: If you ask me, "Will you ever work as a manager again?" I would say now, no. But I don't know obviously how that will feel because I never had the situation. What I know definitely -- I will never, ever manage a different club in England than Liverpool, 100%. That's not possible. My love for this club, my respect for the people, is so big I couldn't.

KLOPP: So I'm a totally normal guy. I'm the normal one maybe if you want this. 
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Not the special one, but the normal one. Yet there was certainly nothing normal about the impact Jurgen Klopp would go on to make at one of the most famous and iconic football clubs in the world. Liverpool adding to their impressive European Cup collection in 2019 after Klopp led them to victory over Tottenham in an all-English Champions League final.

KLOPP: Let's talk about six baby, let's talk about you and me.
 
SNELL: But it's the triumph you oversaw in 2020 that will be forever cherished by all at Anfield. Liverpool winning their first top flight title in 30 years. It was the club's first ever Premier League crowned two, albeit amid lockdown stadia due to the global pandemic. 
 
KLOPP: Being here in this club where football means pretty much everything to the people is obviously big. Consistency is probably the most difficult thing to reach in life and in sports especially, and -- but that made us champions this year.

This season, the Reds are still in the mix for four trophies. Klopp says he'll next take a break from management, but he can promise Liverpool fans one thing. 
 
KLOPP: I will never, ever manage a different club in England than Liverpool, 100%. That's not possible. 
 
SNELL: But despite all he's achieved at Liverpool, it's that enduring bond with the City that will be forever special to Klopp. 
 
KLOPP: Being an honorable Scouser, I didn't know before, but that's probably one of the best things I could have achieved in my life.
 
SNELL: When it comes to all things Liverpool Football Club, we can be sure of one thing. Jurgen Klopp will never walk alone. 
 
KLOPP: It's not so important what people think when you come in. It's much more important what people think when you leave.
