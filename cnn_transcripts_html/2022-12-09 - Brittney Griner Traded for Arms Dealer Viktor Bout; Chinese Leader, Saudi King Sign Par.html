JOHN VAUSE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. You're watching CNN. 
 <br>[00:00:09]
 
The Merchant of Death, back home in Mother Russia, released from a U.S. prison, the price Putin demanded for Brittney Griner, the American basketball star jailed by a Moscow court for possession of cannabis oil. 
 
Money talks. Thirty-four investment deals with almost $30 billion, and that was just day one of Xi Jinping's visit to Saudi Arabia. 
 
And revelations a migrant worker recently died in the World Cup in Qatar treated with disdain by senior officials, dismissed us a little more than a distraction. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with JOHN VAUSE.
 
VAUSE: Right now Brittney Griner, American basketball star and former Olympian, is on a long flight home after almost ten months behind bars in Russia. 
 
The flight is expected to touch down at a U.S. military base in San Antonio, Texas, shortly. And from there, Griner will be taken to an army medical center on the base, which specializes in treating survivors of torture and other trauma. 
 
Russia agreed to her release, in exchange for Viktor Bout, one of the world's most notorious arms dealers, who was found guilty of and convicted for conspiring to kill Americans. 
 
The two briefly crossed paths while on the tarmac of a runway in Abu Dhabi, where the swap took place. 
 
Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison, what was seen as a harsh punishment for possession of a small amount of cannabis oil, which was found in her luggage at a Moscow airport. Her attorneys argued it was medicinal use, prescribed by a doctor to relieve chronic pain. 
 
News of the prisoner swap came hours earlier, with the U.S. president making the announcement from the White House. And, alongside Joe Biden was Griner's wife, Cherelle.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Make no mistake about it. This work is not easy. Negotiations are always difficult. There are never any guarantees. 
 
But it's my job as president of the United States to make the hard calls and protect American citizens everywhere in the world, anywhere in the world. And I'm proud that today we have made one more family whole again. 
 
CHERELLE GRINER, BRITTNEY GRINER'S WIFE: Over the last nine months, you all have been so privy to one of the darkest moments of my life. And so today, I'm just standing here, overwhelmed with emotions. But the most important emotion that I have right now is just sincere gratitude. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Well, Griner is expected home any moment. Another American who has spent far longer in a Russian prison has been left behind. 
 
Moscow refused outright to include U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan in the swap for Viktor Bout. Whelan has already spent four years behind bars in Russia and has another 12 years left on his sentence for espionage, the crime he says never occurred. 
 
Whelan spoke exclusively to CNN producer Jennifer Haslow (ph) by phone on Thursday and says he's greatly disappointed the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAUL WHELAN, AMERICA DETAINED IN RUSSIA: I'm happy that Brittney is going home today and that Trevor went home when he did. But I don't understand why I'm still sitting here. 
 
My bags are packed. I'm ready to go home. I just need an airplane to come and get me. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Whelan's sister, Elizabeth, tells CNN her brother is probably unaware of all the efforts made by the U.S. to secure his freedom so far. She says her family is always careful what they say to Whelan, because they assume Russian authorities are always listening. 
 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.S. made every effort to bring Whelan home and will continue to do so. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This was not a choice of which American to bring home. The choice was one or none. We will never relent until Paul, and for that matter, every other U.S. national held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad is free and coming home and joining their families. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: As for Viktor Bout, the man they call the Lord of War or the Merchant of Death, his release is seen as a big win for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. And the Kremlin will likely take full advantage of this P.R. win. 
 <br>[00:05:10]
 
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has interviewed and corresponded with Bout several times over the past few years. Here's his report. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He's the Lord of War, according to this fictional movie starring Nicolas Cage. 
 
NICOLAS CAGE, ACTOR: Say what you like about warlords and dictators. They always pay their bills on time. 
 
WALSH (voice-over): Or, the Merchant of Death, per a book about his alleged life. But despite much evidence, Viktor Bout has always denied being one of the biggest arms dealers of the '90s, fueling civil wars and bolstering Moscow's interests. Yet, he still never really wanted to be a nobody. 
 
WALSH: Why did the Americans want to so badly? 
 
VIKTOR BOUT, CONVICTED ARMS DEALER: Go and ask them. Go and ask the Bush administration, the Obama administration. Go and ask Mrs. Clinton why they need me. I don't know. I have no clue. 
 
WALSH: Mr. Bout, Mr. Bout, good morning. 
 
WALSH (voice-over): He gave me his last interview in a Thai jail 13 years ago when he denied the worst charges against him. 
 
BOUT: This is a lie and just bullshit. I never supplied arms as such at all, and I especially didn't have any deal with al-Qaeda. 
 
WALSH (voice-over): In the noisy, packed visiting area, as he sat behind the glass, the bit I remember most was his mother interrupting. 
 
BOUT (through translator): Thanks, Mum. We're trying to talk. Why do you come here every five minutes?
 
WALSH (voice-over): And, that he admitted he had worked for the Russian government. 
 
BOUT: Yes, but look but I don't want to say now this or that.
 
WALSH: Have you ever worked for the Russian government? 
 
BOUT: Sometimes, yes. We did the flights. WALSH (voice-over): In the end, he was not superhuman and arrested in
 
 Thailand after a U.S. sting operation. And, while his decades of life in the shadows had left him full-effaced, he was always just a pilot courier, he insisted, even as he was led into this Bangkok courtroom. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today, in Manhattan federal court, accused arms dealer Viktor Bout begins to face American justice. 
 
WALSH (voice-over): The U.S. sting was complex, over many months and countries catching him offering weapons to U.S. agents, pretending to be Colombian terrorists. 
 
He was eventually extradited to face a New York trial for conspiring to kill Americans. It saw him sentenced to 25 years in prison in a medium-security facility in Illinois. 
 
There, he told me in emails, he was in good spirits, brushing up on his many languages. And in 2019, very glad when his wife and daughter visited. 
 
But he was slowly edging towards the end of his sentence, perhaps a reason his role in a swap was more appealing. 
 
But the biggest mystery about Bout was why the U.S. wanted him so fiercely. Yes, he had allegedly dealt arms to a lot of bad people across Africa in the '90s, but that was known and exposed. 
 
Observers searched for another weightier reason and wondered if he had served alongside any Kremlin siders (ph) in his long past overseas. That remains a huge question mark. 
 
Is he a pilot in the wrong place at the very worst times, or, as so many have said, a profiteer and policy tour (ph) for Moscow in the world's nastiest wars? 
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: With me now from Washington, Jill Dougherty, adjunct professor at Georgetown University and former CNN Moscow bureau chief among her many roles here at CNN. 
 
Good to have you with us, Jill. 
 
JILL DOUGHERTY, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Hello, John. 
 
VAUSE: So once Brittney Griner was in the air and heading home, cue the criticism. Here it is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I'm glad an American is coming home, and she was arrested for a trumped-up charge. But to exchange the Merchant of Death for this? It's made us weaker. It's made Putin stronger, and it's made Americans more vulnerable. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: You know, when you look at the deal, a star basketball player for the Merchant of Death, it does look like Putin has come on top. And some Democrats have agreed, saying that Americans living or traveling abroad now are at much greater risk of being detained and used as leverage. So are they right, and does it matter? 
 
DOUGHERTY: Well, I mean, this is a debate that you always get. You know, do you try to get people out? And if you do, then does it encourage, you know, governments or people or organizations to take more hostages? 
 
I think what Biden was faced with here was a chance of getting one person out. As he said, one or none. And, that seems to be the dilemma. 
 
But you are absolutely right, John, that right now, in the United States, it's already become a debate just, you know, hours after they were free -- as she was free. 
 
And I noticed, also, on Russian television hey are beginning to jump on that and say, you know, Why did Biden want to free, you know, a basketball player? And a lot of very demeaning language coming out on the Russian media, at least some state media. 
 <br>[00:10:04]
 
So it's unfortunately, now, going into another realm that I think we have to pull it back and say, even in the midst of the worst relations that we can imagine, between the United States and Russia, this deal did take place. So, that's one thing, at least. 
 
Brittney Griner did get out a few months ago. We were thinking she might never get out. And then also, there were people behind the scenes. 
 
These are the diplomats on both sides who do the negotiating. So, at least there was some type of communication. I know these are not big wins for the world right now. 
 
But at least something has happened. And, we'll see if there can be more in the future. 
 
VAUSE: And, there are important points to make, because there are some positive spots here, Jill. It's good to point them out. But as you mentioned, one Merchant of Death will only get you so far, and that is an Olympic basketball star. 
 
So the U.S. Marine, Paul Whelan, is still in that Russian prison on trumped-up charges of spying. He is disappointed. This is what he told CNN. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
P. WHELAN (via phone): The president and his team are going to have to look at what they have that is valuable, that these people want. And, hopefully, give it to them, or I'll be here for a long time. And to be quite honest, in these conditions, who knows how I'll come back or if I'll come back? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: It's hard to imagine what day this has been four Whelan, how difficult it's been. And, to his point, how many more merchants of death or the equivalent are in U.S. jails right now? And is it even known that Putin might want any of them? 
 
DOUGHERTY: That's the problem. I mean, all of this depends on President Putin and -- and what he thinks is in his interest or maybe in Russia's interests. 
 
So, you have to figure, you have to climb into his mind and figure, OK, who is worth it? Who could they, you know, get out in another deal for Paul Whelan.
 
But I think that is very difficult to say because, you know, the circumstances, there are a lot of things, obviously, that go into this. It is politically what's good for Putin; internationally, domestically in Russia. 
 
I mean, there is this domestic component that we don't talk about that much. But Putin has to placate groups right now, especially in the context of the Ukrainian war. Placate groups either want a more virulent war or -- or are criticizing him in some way. The hard- liners. 
 
So there are a lot of factors going on. And at this particular moment, this deal came together. Who knows what will happen in a few weeks or a month? 
 
VAUSE: Well, earlier on CNN, John Kirby, spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, he explained why a deal for Whelan's release is proving so difficult. Here he is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: They put Paul Whelan in a different category. They treat him separately. They treat him differently. Because of the sham espionage charges that they've levied against him. 
 
The -- we tried many different permutations to try to get both of them out at the same time, as you might expect. But the Russians really put Mr. Whelan in a different category. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Can you explain the Russian point of view here about why the spying charges, as trumped-up as they may be, raises the bar so much? And, again, Putin's strategy of playing hardball and why it seems to work. DOUGHERTY: Well, I mean, if you're accused of being a spy, it's
 
 already a smaller group of people that you're dealing with. And they have these charges the Americans definitely say were trumped up. But he is now in a category, and he described it to CNN in that interview, John, where he said, as you hear him, you know, I'm treated differently.
 
So there's something about his situation that they feel they -- they want to up the ante, presumably to keep him there until they can get something else. So what's that something else? We simply don't know at this point. 
 
VAUSE: Jill, as always, it's so good to have you with us, so good to have your point of view and experience. Thank you. 
 
DOUGHERTY: Thanks, John. 
 
VASE: Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested Ukraine is to blame for Moscow's ongoing air offensive on the country's power grid. He appeared to speak off the cuff during an awards ceremony in the Kremlin on Thursday about the strikes, which have left millions of Ukrainians cold and in the dark. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Right now, there's been a lot of uproar about our attacks on the energy infrastructure of our neighboring country. Yes, we're doing it, but who started it? Who hit the Crimean Bridge? Who blew up the power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Putin was referring to an explosion in October, which temporarily crippled the strategic bridge linking Russia with Crimea. Moscow blamed Ukraine for the explosion, but Kyiv did not claim responsibility. 
 <br>[00:15:00]
 
Still to come here on CNN, China's president, Xi Jinping, gets that lavish welcome in Saudi Arabia, then goes down to strike a lot of deals worth billions of dollars, and the U.S. is watching very closely. 
 
Also ahead, shocking new allegations of human rights abuses by Nigeria's military, this time, allegedly forcing thousands of rape victims to have abortions. A special report, just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Welcome back. Peru's now former president is considered a flight risk. So he will spent at least the next week in police custody. 
 
Pedro Castillo was impeached and arrested on charges of rebellion after attempting to dissolve Congress Wednesday. The Mexican government has confirmed receiving an asylum request from Castillo prior to his arrest. 
 
The political turmoil saw clashes on Thursday between riot police and Castillo supporters were demanding the former president be released. 
 
Meantime, Castillo's successor was seen dancing outside the presidential palace on Thursday. The new president said calls for early elections were respectable, but she would consult with other political leaders before making any decisions. 
 
China's president, Xi Jinping's, visit to Saudi Arabia is already producing results in the billions of dollars. The two countries have signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. That includes plans to cooperate on the kingdom's Vision 2030 program, as well as China's Belt and Road Initiative. 
 
The Chinese leader will meet with other Gulf leaders over the next two days as part of the China-Arab states summit. 
 
CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang, following all of these developments from Beijing. He joins us now live. What was it, 34 deals, almost $30 billion? That was day one. What else can we expect? 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: That's right. The Saudis literally rolled out the royal -- purple carpet for -- for Xi and has been shelling him with lavish reception, which, some would say, is in contrast to the rather modest or even frosty reception Biden got when he visited Saudi Arabia in the summer. 
 
But when it comes to this fast-evolving and growing relationship between Beijing and Riyadh, I think it's best to be described as it's about more than just oil, but nothing matters more than oil. 
 
Because, China, as the world's second largest economy and the world's biggest oil importer, they really need reliable and diversified sources of energy, especially at a time when Xi Jinping was trying to jump-start the sluggish economy because of the impact of his zero- COVID policy, which by the way, is finally easing. 
 
So Saudi Arabia is really playing a very crucial part of this strategy. And, for the most part, Saudi Arabia has been the biggest source of transporting oil in recent years. 
 
But that -- that changed earlier this year when Russia started to flood the global market with cheap oil after its invasion of Ukraine to counter the Western sanctions. 
 
Now, Saudi has since regained its top spot in August. So I think they very much want to keep it this way to make sure China remains a loyal big customer, even when competitors are offering cheaper prices. 
 <br>[00:20:06]
 
But even when it comes to oil, there is already a geopolitical dimension here, as well. Because there were reports saying both sides have agreed to conduct some transactions in the Chinese currency, yuan, instead of the U.S. dollar. 
 
That obviously could pose a challenge to -- to the so-called petrodollars system, which is critical to the U.S. dollar's position as the international reserve currency. 
 
But that also very much, in a way, speaks to Xi Jinping's desire to reshape a U.S.-led world order. I think that's something the Saudis are keeping aware of and trying to adapt to. 
 
It's very notable that, in the Chinese readout after the summit between MBS and Xi, they noted Saudis' firm support for China's deradicalization effort, and the Saudis' firm opposition to oust that interference in China's internal affairs in the -- in the name of human rights.
 
All of these are thinly-veiled references to China, to China's policy on Xinjiang, which of course, the Washington has accused Beijing of committing genocide, even though China has long denied that. But that kind of support from one of the world's major Muslim powers is very important for Xi and something he certainly could use -- John. 
 
VAUSE: Steven, we appreciate the update and all of the details. Steven Jiang there, live for us in Beijing. 
 
Well, there has been widespread condemnation after the first known execution of an anti-government protester in Iran. This video shows the trial of a 23-year-old demonstrator, due to stabbing and hurting a paramilitary officer. 
 
His execution was announced Thursday. Now, the U.S. is calling it unjust and cruel; says it's an attempt to intimidate other Iranians. 
 
Well, the U.N. high commissioner on human rights says that executions after unfair trials constitute an arbitrary deprivation of life. 
 
Nigeria's military has denied media reports that thousands of Nigerian women and girls were forced to have abortions after they were rescued from Boko Haram militants. 
 
One Nigerian commander slammed the Reuters report as a fabrication. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAJ. GEN. CHRISTOPHER MUSA, NIGERIAN ARMY: It has never happened. It is not happening. And it will not happen. It is not in our character. We are highly professional. We're human beings, and these are Nigerians that we're talking about. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Despite those denials, Reuters claimed the secret military operation began a decade ago in the country's Northeast, where the militant group is most active. 
 
Amnesty International and other rights groups have called for investigation. We get the very latest now from CNN's Nima Elbagir. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The details are absolutely horrifying, Reuters news agency in a new investigation says that they have evidence that at least 10,000 pregnancies were aborted. Pregnancies carried by women and girls who had been rescued from the Boko Haram militant terrorist organization and who were carrying the children of their captors. Forced by Nigeria's own military to abort these pregnancies. 
 
This is what one girl who spoke to Reuters had to say. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): In the beginning, we were in our town. Boko Haram came and attacked. They grabbed us and took us away to the bush. After that, we were in the bush, in their hands. Soldiers came and took us. After that, they took us to their (ph) barracks, and they aborted our pregnancies. 
 
ELBAGIR: This is not the first time that Nigerian authorities, that the Nigerian military has been accused of human rights violations. A CNN investigation into the incidents at Lekki tollgate, two years ago, found that the Nigerian army had fired live rounds into protesters who were protesting with demonstrating against police brutality. 
 
This is not only an issue for Nigeria and the condemnation that they are receiving from the Nigerian public for these allegations of human rights violations. 
 
It's also an issue for the United States of America. Over the last two decades, Nigeria has been the recipient of hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. military assistance, of U.S. training. 
 
Also, they have been approved for U.S. arms sales. 
 
Any allegations of human rights violations causes great concern to the United States, because it would place the U.S. administration, itself, in violation of U.S. law, of the Leahy Act, which prohibits the United States to give military assistance to foreign governments accused of human rights violations. 
 
A year ago, when the judicial panel investigating what happened at Lekki tollgate found that CNN's investigation had actually been true, that the Nigerian authorities, that the Nigerian army, was guilty of firing live fire into demonstrators protesting police brutality, we asked the U.S. State Department.
 
And they say that, if this was true, that they would want the perpetrators held to account. And that it would call into question U.S. military support. 
 
Two years later, nothing has happened. The question remains whether these latest allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Nigerian military will have an impact on the U.S.'s support. 
 <br>[00:25:06]

VAUSE: A lot more to come here on CNN, including -- including the unbelievably callous and dismissive response from senior World Cup organizers in Qatar to the death of a migrant worker. 
 
Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone. I'm John Vause, and you're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
More now on our lead story this hour. And we are still waiting for the arrival of American basketball star Brittney Griner after nearly ten months in Russian custody. 
 
She's expected to land at San Antonio, Texas, anytime now. 
 
Russia agreed to swap Griner for Viktor Bout, who was serving a 25- year prison term in the United States for conspiring to kill Americans. 
 
The notorious arms dealer was known as the Merchant of Death and the Lord of War. 
 
Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport in February this year with cannabis oil in her bag. Her lawyer says it was prescribed by a doctor. Her wife was on hand at the White House when President Biden announced the prisoner swap. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
C. GRINER: B.G. is not here to say this, but I will gladly speak on her behalf and say that B.G. and I will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul, whose family is in our hearts today as we celebrate B.G. being home. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: But, amid the joy, there's also regret. And that regret comes from the United States president that another American is not coming, former U.S. Marine, Paul Whelan. 
 
Joe Biden vowed that the U.S. will never give up on Whelan. He says Moscow is treating Whelan differently than Griner for, quote, "totally illegitimate reasons." 
 
Whelan spoke with CNN Thursday after Griner was released and says he was surprised that he'd been left behind. 
 
CNN's Jim Sciutto has our report. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Paul Whelan's odyssey in Russia's criminal justice system began on December 28, 2018. A former Marine, he was arrested in Moscow during a trip for the wedding of a fellow Marine to a Russian woman. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He ended up taking a group of them, as part of their tour, through the Kremlin. And then that evening, he disappeared. 
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): Russia's federal security service accused him of being a spy. 
 
Whelan had visited Russia before, including as early as 2006 while on a two-week lead from a deployment to Iraq. Born in Canada to British parents, Whelan moved to the U.S. as a child. He has U.S., Canadian, British and Irish citizenship. 
 
Whelan joined the Marine Reserve in 1994. He did multiple tours in Iraq. And, during the 2006 deployment, he was accused by the military of attempting to steal more than $10,000. 
 <br>[00:30:08]
 
He was court-martialed and discharged for bad conduct two years later. After the military, Whelan worked in corporate security. First, as a senior manager in the global security firm Kelly Services. And in 2017, he began working for automotive component supplier, BorgWarner, eventually becoming director of global security. 
 
According to his brother, Whelan was a world traveler with friends in Russia. He was also active on Russian social media. 
 
After his arrest, Russia claimed Whelan was caught, quote, "red- handed" with a flash drive, with state secrets. Whelan maintains he was set up. 
 
DAVID WHELAN, BROTHER OF PAUL WHELAN: One of the friends that he had in Russia visited him the night of the wedding, right before the wedding happened, right before the wedding happened, and gave Paul a USB, just a USB stick and said that they were photos from a previous trip that they'd been on to another part of Russia. And as soon as he was given the USB stick and put it in his pocket, his door was opened by the FSB, and he was arrested and that was it. 
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): On June 15, 2020, Whelan was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years of hard labor in prison. 
 
In the years since his arrest, the U.S. government has also maintained Whelan's innocence and made repeated attempts to secure his release. Today, CNN's Jennifer Hansler spoke to Whelan by phone from the penal colony where he's being held. 
 
P. WHELAN: I have to say, I'm greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release, especially as the four-year anniversary of my arrest is coming up. I was arrested for a crime that never occurred. 
 
I'm happy that Brittney is going home today and that Trevor went home when he did. But I don't understand why I'm still sitting here. 
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): Jim Sciutto, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: In Germany, the investigation continues into a far-right plot to overthrow the government, with authorities expecting to conduct more raids and make more arrests. 
 
Police say more than 50 suspects have now been identified. Twenty-five alleged members and supporters of a far-right group were arrested in overnight raids on Wednesday. 
 
Police also confiscated weapons, ammunition and equipment, like protective vests. 
 
On Thursday, FIFA confirmed the death of a migrant worker at a resort used by Saudi Arabia during the group stages at the World Cup in Qatar. 
 
Circumstances concerning the death aren't clear, but a company official told CNN the incident is being investigated. 
 
Human rights groups have criticized Qatar's treatment of migrant workers, saying they can face forced labor and unsafe conditions, unpaid wages, employer intimidation, and often have the inability not just to leave their jobs but to leave the country. 
 
Christine Brennan is CNN's sports analyst, as well as a sports columnist for "USA Today." Good to see you. 
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Great to see you John, thanks. 
 
VAUSE: OK, so two soundbites coming out, both of them in the "you've got to hear them to believe them" column. The man speaking is Nasser al-Khater, chief executive of Qatar's World Cup. This is what he said when he was asked about the death of the Filipino worker. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NASSER AL-KHATER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, QATAR WORLD CUP: We are in the middle of a World Cup, and we have a successful World Cup. And this is something that you want to talk about right now? 
 
I mean, death is a natural part of life, whether it's at work, whether it's in your -- in your sleep. Of course, a worker died. Our condolences go to his family. However, you know, I mean, it's strange that this is something that you wanted to focus on as your first question.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VAUSE: Wow. You know, if nothing else, at least he was open and honest about what seems to be first his utter contempt for the question, utter contempt for the media, only conceded by a total lack of empathy, sympathy, and a total disregard for the worker who died. 
 
He kind of exposed to the world, in a way, the reality about how migrant workers are treated in Qatar. 
 
BRENNAN: Oh, absolutely, it's awful. It is just awful. You know, I've covered sports a long time, John, around the world. That's one of the worst things I have ever heard. Ever. 
 
That's one of the worst, most tone-death, most ridiculous, most heartless, just revolting comments, quote, soundbites that I've ever heard in sports.
 
And I have heard some duties over the years. This is a person that died. A worker working at the World Cup held at the Saudi Arabian training facility, fell and hit his head. 
 
And that's how the leader of the Qatar World Cup is treating this? It's appalling. It should be remembered forever. I think it will be remembered forever. And it -- you're right, it does shine a light in exactly what he thinks. But what a terrible, terrible way that this man thinks. 
 
VAUSE: But, wait, there's more. Here's soundbite No. 2.

AL-KHATER: Everything that has been said and everything that has been reflected about workers definitely has been absolutely false. This -- this theme, this negativity around the World Cup has been something that we've been faced with, unfortunately. 
 <br>[00:35:11]
 
And you know, we are a bit disappointed that they have been exasperating this false narrative.

VAUSE: If the narrative is wrong, correct the record. Whining and complaining doesn't mean the media reports are wrong. 
 
I've reported from Qatar, from UAE, from Kuwait, from around the region. It doesn't take Woodward and Bernstein to find out how appallingly bad migrant workers are treated. 
 
This just seems some kind of arrogant delusion by Qatar officials. How do you explain this? 
 
BRENNAN: Well, when you give the World Cup to Qatar, this is what you're going to get. So FIFA deserves this. Worldwide soccer deserves it. Sad but true. 
 
This is the kind of attitude you're going to get when you give this treasure, this great gift to a nation that is completely ill-prepared to handle life in the 20th Century, much less the 21st Century. 
 
VAUSE: But, well, FIFA on the other hand, they at least have a P.R. team which seems to be on the ball, in the wake of the death of the worker, this statement was issued. 
 
"FIFA is deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and sympathies are with the worker's family. FIFA will be in a position to comment further once the relevant processes in relation to the worker's passing have been completed." 
 
Slight problem with all of this. It seems FIFA's general secretary may not have gotten the memo. Listen to this.

FATMA SAMOURA, FIFA SECRETARY GENERAL: Well, I think that we are here for the conference. If you want to elaborate on the contracts, I'm ready. If it is about anything else, I'm sorry. 
 
We are talking about things that we have already discussed. Months and months and months, time and time again. Sorry.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: You know, this happened just a week ago, not months ago. And Fatma Samoura doesn't seem to be particularly sad. It doesn't seem that there's a lot of sympathy for the family of the dead worker. 
 
It is shocking, this sort of insensitivity. But it's not really surprising. 
 
BRENNAN: Well, that's right, John. And I think we clearly see here that FIFA and Qatar deserve each other. They're made for each other. 
 
Their lack of empathy, lack of understanding, completely obtuse behavior. Above it all, acting as if the death of another human being is -- is nothing; it's a distraction. It's bothering them that we're -- that journalists are asking those questions. Wow. 
 
I mean, talk about being completely out of touch. And I'm sure people watching this and seeing the one clip after another, after another. I mean, it seems like something surreal out of the most crazy movie you'd never think that this could be said. 
 
One of those soundbites, much less the next, much less the next. And here we are. 
 
And as I said before, you know, it is -- it is just unconscionable that this is happening. As I said before, I can't believe it. You, know, if all the things that I've covered in sports, I don't think I've ever heard that much of a completely out-of-touch heartless cruel, frankly, reaction to the death of a worker who is involved in the event. 
 
But, even then, even if it was just a human being that had nothing to do with the event, I don't know that I've ever heard soundbites and comments quite that bed, that many of them all put together by the very people running the event. 
 
So, what a -- what a sad state of affairs. But, yet, quite an illustrative series of comments to show us exactly what these people are. 
 
VAUSE: Yes, it didn't even try to sugarcoat anything. They just put them all out there. And Christine, so good to have you with us. Thank you.
 
BRENNAN: John, thank you. 
 
VAUSE: So far, it seems the docuseries of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has failed to produce any jaw-dropping moments. But Buckingham Palace cannot breathe easy just yet. Three more episodes stream next week and details on that when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:41:08]
 
VAUSE: Well, the verdict is in on the first three episodes of the Harry and Meghan docuseries. It's been kind of a big yawn. No exclusive details, which many were hoping for, just the usual whining about the media. 
 
But if you're hunting for dirt, don't give up. There's still three more episodes to go. 
 
CNN's royal correspondent, Max Foster, picks up the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The first three episodes have dropped, and the verdict is in. Harry and Meghan's Netflix docuseries hasn't had any major bombshells yet. But there was a targeted attack on the media. 
 
PRINCE HARRY, UNITED KINGDOM: No one knows the full truth. We know the full truth. The institution has the full truth, and the media know the full truth because they've been on it. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Suggesting the royal press pack is simply an extension of the palace's P.R. team. And the family is afraid of challenging the media. 
 
The series shines a light on their childhoods. Harry talks about his mother, her battle with the press, and the difficulty he had growing up as a royal child in the spotlight. 
 
KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL HISTORIAN: For them, this is very much all tied together. How he feels he's being chased by the press ever since he was a child. It's continued into his marriage, and it was unsustainable. And that's why he had to leave the royal family. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Then, there was Meghan's perspective, learning to live in the royal fold. The first senior royal she met was the queen. MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: I remember, in the car and driving up and
 
 he said, you know how to courtesy, right? And I just thought it was a joke. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Then there was this anecdote, when he first met Kate and William. 
 
MEGHAN: I remember, I was in ripped jeans and I was barefoot. It was like I was a hugger. I've always been a hugger. I didn't realize that that is really jarring for a lot of Brits. 
 
I guess I'd started to understand very quickly that the formality on the outside carried through on the inside. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): The episodes are peppered with intimate moments in what was billed on an inside look into their relationship from the start. And it includes moments like this. 
 
MEGHAN: Oh, my God, Jess. It's happening. It's happening, it's happening. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Videos and pictures never made public before --
 
MEGHAN: He told me not to peak.
 
FOSTER (voice-over): -- of the moment Harry proposed. 
 
PRINCE HARRY: There's leaking, but there's also planting of stories. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): There was the trailer teasing dramatic moments that weren't included in the first three episodes. Any bombshells the palace fears may be still yet to come. 
 
Max Foster, CNN, London.
