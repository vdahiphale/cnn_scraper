JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: While we don't know all the results yet, at least I don't know them all yet, here's what we do know, while the press and the pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn't happen. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: A little victory lap. Maybe a little bit of gloating there. The president taking a small victory lap. The red wave that most expected, turning out, trickle maybe. So, Congress still hanging in the balance at this hour. Looking increasingly likely for Republicans that they're going to gain the House of Representatives, though. And that means that partisan gridlock could get a little worse. 
 
So, this is what the president had to say about working with Republicans. Here 's it is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Under no circumstances will I support the proposal put forward by Senator Johnson and the senator from down in Florida, to cut or make fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare. That's not on the table. I will not do that. I will veto any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion. But I'm ready to compromise with Republicans where it makes sense on many other issues. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: We'll see if there's anywhere for them to compromise. 
 
Let's talk about this with CNN contributor Dr. Abdul El-Sayed and Scott Jennings, CNN political commentator and former special assistant to President George W. Bush.
 
Thank you both for being here. LEMON: Good morning. 
 
You guys know I have nothing to say about this, so I'm just going to sit here. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, Don, we know better.
 
Scott, though, you had a tweet that went viral, shall we say -
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, he did.
 
COLLINS: Where you were talking about -- 
 
LEMON: That tweet. 
 
COLLINS: What we've heard from so many Republicans, what I have heard from so many Republicans over the years, but now people are really saying publicly, which is this unusual blowback to Trump following Tuesday night and what happened there. The question, though, is whether or not this criticism is going to last.
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, good question. I think it's his weakest moment politically since January 6th. And on January 6th there were some of us who thought at the time, if you were going to move on someone, now would be the time. I mean there was all the reasons to do it and the Republican Party hesitated and he sort of filled the void. 
 
And I think the reason is because there was no obvious alternative. Like, who's actually going to lead the party. There was no, you know, pending election. 
 
Now, there is a pending election. 
 <br>[06:35:01]
 
The '24 election is here. But, more importantly, there's someone to fill the void. 
 
The only great thing that happened to the Republican Party Tuesday night was Florida. Ron DeSantis had a crushing victory, sent a huge message about what a governing coalition could look like. He turned a purple state red. And so I think for the first time Republicans are actually seeing the next lily pad on which to hop. And they've never been able to see that before. 
 
Time will tell. And we'll see if DeSantis gets in and makes a go of it. But his instincts are really good. And he may be the next evolution of what Republicans are looking for, which is some of the fight you get with Trump, but also none of the baggage and the drama.
 
COLLINS: Can I just ask you one more question, because I know, obviously, you're close to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell right now. He wanted to become Senate majority leader. Yesterday when he was asked what he thought about Tuesday's results, he said, I don't deal in feelings. JENNINGS: Yes, that's accurate. He - he does not. I mean he -- he
 
 deals in reality. And dealing -- and just playing the hand he's dealt. 
 
But I will tell you, if you look at all of the polling, and the CNN exit polling and just the, you know, the mood of the country, the way people feel about the economy, people don't love Joe Biden either. If we don't find a Senate majority here, it's a travesty. It is an absolute travesty. All the indicators were there. The whole thing was there to be won, and we didn't win it. And I know -
 
HARLOW: But McConnell said candidate quality. 
 
JENNINGS: Absolutely. Mitch tried to tell them. And if you look in some of these races, it was - it was laying there to be won and it wasn't. And so, you know, we'll see if the party learns some lessons here. Sometimes we do. Sometimes we don't. 
 
LEMON: There's also a doctor in the room. 
 
DR. ABDUL EL-SAYED, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, they say that admission is the first step toward recovery, and this - this definitely was an addiction. So --
 
LEMON: Do you - let me ask you because I was out and about last night and people are saying, I'm so glad Trump is over, Trump is over. And I'm like, I'm not so sure about that. 
 
Listen, we're here in what was a blue bubble in New York. I'm not so sure anymore considering what's going on with, you know the changing demographics here. So, what do you think? Is this the beginning of -- is it a blow? What is this? 
 
EL-SAYED: So, you know, if admission is the first step, there are 11 more steps. And the worry I have is, I don't see the choreography that ends up with Donald Trump not being the Republican nominee as it has to go through an entire primary process. I mean this man has called into question an entire general election. What's going to keep him from calling into question the outcomes of a primary that's in a party that's in his thrall. And so I don't know that I see that. 
 
I also think that, for the country, Donald Trump will continue to be a hanging question over the head of the Republican Party and, therefore, our politics until he is soundly, clearly, 100 percent beaten, you know, by 10, 20 points. And I think if he does run, and he is the nominee, that's likely what's going to happen. 
 
He is not a popular politician. You could see people running away from the stench of Trump in almost every single election that he put his finger in. But the thing is, I - the one person who cannot see that, who needs to see that, is Donald Trump himself. 
 
HARLOW: You ran -
 
LEMON: I think a lot of other people try to tell you -
 
HARLOW: You ran for -- you were once a candidate for governor of Michigan, so you know what it's like to run for governor. What Ron DeSantis did in Florida was remarkable. Not only the spread, but who he got. 
 
EL-SAYED: Right.
 
HARLOW: Latino -- the Latinos on board. Miami-Dade. Do you think that he can repeat that across the country? Because that's a question, was it just Florida, or is it bigger? 
 
LEMON: Are we getting ahead of ourselves on this whole DeSantis? I just feel like it's --
 
HARLOW: But that's not what I'm asking. 
 
LEMON: It's -
 
HARLOW: What I'm asking is, does he have the power to repeat that? 
 
EL-SAYED: What I think the DeSantis playbook looks like is, competent, local, technical leadership, which can't take that away from him. He has competently led in terms of the fundamental basics of governing. And then a very good instinct for figuring out how to weaponize a culture war in a way that redounds to particular communities that he's trying to up. And so the way that he's played a sort of fear of change when it comes to schools, for example, I think has been important in his ability to make an argument to a Latino community, for example, in Miami-Dade. 
 
The bigger question, I think, that means for Democrats is, we've got to start asking big picture questions about, why are we losing communities like this when we have been long advocates for the issues that should unite many different kinds of people around the bread and butter issues that we've always talked about. And I think that's as much a question for whether or not DeSantis can scale that brand to politics and whether or not Democrats can address it. 
 
The last thing I want to say about this is that, I worry a lot about where our country goes under DeSantis. I think a lot of folks think that the exit of Donald Trump means that all of a sudden this spell is broken. I actually see Ron DeSantis as a far more efficient version of what Donald Trump has done. And I worry a lot about the ways that it tells us that we ought to be tearing each other apart, that we cannot accept one another for who we are. 
 <br>[06:40:04]
 
COLLINS: Scott, you -
 
HARLOW: Why does it make you laugh? 
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
JENNINGS: I - I - this is - this is so expected. Like, you know, here's the Republican Party saying, well, maybe it's time to move on from Trump, and - and my friend has come along to tell us, well, you know, DeSantis is much worse than Trump. And - and what I - what I - what I predict -
 
LEMON: Both can be true, though, Scott. 
 
JENNINGS: What I predict is going to happen is - and, hey, the Democrats' tactics in this election, it paid off. They helped a bunch of really bad Republican candidates get nomination and they defeated them. They will - they will judge Trump as being the easiest person to defeat. So I expect a lot pf punditry around, you know, everybody else is much worse than Trump. Maybe you should just nominate him one more time. We should not nominate him again. We do need a new nominee. We have to move on from this. 
 
EL-SAYED: If - if I may. 
 
I don't think that DeSantis is worse than Trump. I think he's more efficient at Trumpism than Trump is. I think Trump is caught into his own narcissism in a way than DeSantis is.
 
JENNINGS: But you - you think that's better then? 
 
EL-SAYED: But the point that I'm trying to make is this, if we continue, as a country, to pedal in the politics of division, there is going to be a cost in the country that is bigger than who is an elected official in the country. And what I don't see, right, what I don't see is a conversation about whether or not this kind of politics that tells people that some people are less human than others, that don't deserve the same freedoms as others, whether or not that politics itself should continue to be a valid form of politicking on the Republican right. 
 
And this is the conversation I really wish you all would have. Whether it's Trump, or DeSantis or anyone else, that's the conversation. 
 
HARLOW: I - I - 
 
LEMON: This is really good conversation.
 
HARLOW: Yes, I love this conversation because you disagree civilly. And, by the way, you gave some props to a Republican governor. So, you know, therefore we can, from other parties, see good things and bad things in others. 
 
JENNINGS: Well, and I have to congratulate - I mean the Michigan Democrats, where you come from, had a really good night. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
JENNINGS: I mean for - for Republicans, Florida was a big -
 
COLLINS: Which they were not expecting. 
 
JENNINGS: Michigan was a real bright spot, I mean, in a - and a pretty good night. 
 
EL-SAYED: (INAUDIBLE).
 
HARLOW: I'm going to help the control room and get to commercial break.
 
LEMON: But, hang on one second, I find - I find it interesting that you -- 
 
HARLOW: Usually -- or I'm not. I'm not.
 
LEMON: I find it interesting that you - you talk -- when you talked about the messaging, because the whole time before you were saying, Democrats have the wrong message. And now you're saying Democrats have the right message. 
 
JENNINGS: When - well, I - look, I looked at the exit polls. Biden was unpopular. Most people thought his policies were hurting not helping. Yet the independents -
 
HARLOW: Broke for Dems.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
JENNINGS: They broke - so, independents misbehaved. They did not behave the way you would expect. And the way I interpreted that was, I don't love Biden, but I like him a little bit more than the people who are affiliated with Trump. Hence, time to move on. 
 
LEMON: All right.
 
Poppy's going to beat me up. I'm going to shut up. 
 
HARLOW: Just trying to help the team. 
 
Thank you.
 
COLLINS: Thank you both for being here.
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Doctor. 
 
Thank you, Scott.
 
LEMON: Take care. Thank you.
 
HARLOW: Next, because we want you to see this too, our own Christiane Amanpour sat down with the president and the first lady of Ukraine. What President Zelenskyy is saying about Russian-occupied Kherson and the battle to retake it. She'll join us live with that interview.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:47:01]
 
LEMON: In an exclusive CNN interview, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the first lady sat down with our very own Christiane Amanpour. She joins us now live from Kyiv. 
 
Good morning to you here and hello to you there, Christiane. What do they have to say? CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, it's really
 
 interesting. Sat down with them as the midterm results were coming in. Of course, it - really they're dependent on U.S. help. They both said, especially the president, that he really hopes that this valuable U.S. help continues. He believes it will. They have talked to many U.S. senators, bipartisan groups, the national security adviser, et cetera, and they are assured that this vital U.S. help and NATO Help will continue. 
 
I'm here in Kyiv. For the last several days the Russian cruise missile and Kamikaze drone attacks on the cities, on energy infrastructure has abated and, therefore, they're really trying to fix this energy infrastructure before the devastating cold and dark of the winter. And I did start by asking them how they're coping nine months in and they both looked extremely tired but they were happy to talk certainly to the American and global audience. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): You asked whether I thought this war would last so long. No. Because I didn't start this war. And I'm sure there isn't a single Ukrainian who knew what this will be and what tragedy this would bring to every home in our country. Because, I repeat, we did not start this war. But Ukrainian society united and showed that it was ready for what, unfortunately, was such a tragedy, showed that it was ready for these challenges. 
 
I was really impressed by the power of one nation and was impressed by the swiftness of the response of Europe, the whole world, and the whole international community that rallied around Ukraine for this challenge. 
 
AMANPOUR: First Lady, what motivates you to get up in the morning? How do you feel tat you've endured this war? 
 
OLENA ZELENSKA, FIRST LADY OF UKRAINE (through translator): Well, thank you. It's a big question. It covers many spheres of my life. And what helps me get up in the morning, surely, as you said, it's my husband's example. I know if he endures, then I have to endure. If the day is begun, then we have to keep fighting. That keeps me going. 
 
AMANPOUR: Mr. President, what is the status of Kherson and the impending battle to retake Kherson? 
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): That's a very serious question. And I'll be frank with you. I'll try to answer in a way that doesn't give you an answer, to be honest. Because these planned military actions, they're discussed in a small circle but then they're executed in silence. And I really want to have an unpleasant surprise for the enemy and not something they're prepared for. So I'd like to apologize. 
 <br>[06:50:00]
 
But at any rate, our people and our public needs to know that we're working on some very serious steps with a positive outcome for the citizens of Ukraine and all those communities that support peace in Ukraine. 
 
AMANPOUR: Is it true that you said to President Biden when they offered to evacuate you at the beginning that you said, I don't need a ride, I need ammunition. 
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): Yes, that's right. Nothing changed. You know, my answer is still the same. 
 
AMANPOUR: What strength do you get from each other? 
 
ZELENSKYY (speaking in English): That is my love and that is my best friend. So that is my energy. I wanted to answer your question at the very beginning. When Olena told you like she prepared breakfast for the children in the morning and prepare our clothes and et cetera and what -- what I wanted to tell you that I have no such possibility so nobody gives me breakfast in the morning. I mean, that is such - such - such difficult period. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR: So, they live apart because of security. And so just a little bit of humor and humanity from this first couple thrust into the midst of a war that clearly they didn't anticipate. 
 
Don.
 
LEMON: Fantastic interview, Christiane. Good to see you. And thank you so much for that. 
 
Make sure you go to cnn.com to see more of Christiane's interview. 
 
Poppy.
 
HARLOW: Great. Alex is -
 
OK, President Biden says Elon Musk's relationship with other countries is, quote, worthy of being looked at. Kaitlan and I were just talking about that. What exactly is raising this concern and will he say more, what will happen, especially as he goes to the G-20?  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: That is a significant statement from the president as Elon Musk's Twitter takeover has really the world's attention. What do we know about the foreign entities also that invested in Musk's new venture. Saudi Arabia one of them. [06:55:00]
 
Let's talk about it with CNN media analyst Sara Fischer. 
 
So, there's the investors' part of it, right, whose money is in this, and there's all of these positions he's taken and comments he's made on big global issues like China/Taiwan, like Iran, like Russia/Ukraine. 
 
SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST: I'm less concerned about the investments, Poppy, than I am about the positions.
 
HARLOW: OK, why?
 
FISCHER: And the reason being, the White House already said it wasn't going to do a national security review on this particular deal. If they thought that there was too much foreign investment, they would have had the committee of foreign investment of the U.S. look into it. They are not. 
 
Also, Twitter has always had foreign investors. Saudi Arabia, you mentioned at the top, has been an investor in Twitter since 2011, and it hasn't been a foreign national security issue thus far. 
 
But Elon's positions, I think, are a little bit more problematic. He's a huge global leader who's developed a populist following of over 114 million on Twitter. And what he says has major sway in terms of international affairs. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, and he's also involved, you know, when it comes to Ukraine and the Starlink satellites there. There's been questions about Iran, but that was like, he's also dabbling in all of these major geopolitical issues. 
 
Another question we have for you, though, this morning is about the layoffs that we're seeing. We, obviously, saw the ones with Twitter. Those are the questions about what that management was looking like. We're also now seeing them with Meta, the parent company of Facebook, as well. 
 
FISCHER: Huge layoffs at Meta. I mean, 11,000 people, 13 percent of that company. 
 
LEMON: Geez.
 
FISCHER: And why it's a big deal is because, it's not just Meta in a vacuum. It's Meta. It's Twitter. It's Snapchat. It's Stripe (ph). It's so many big tech companies that this is actually reminiscent to me of the dot com bubble 20 years ago. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
FISCHER: What this represents for the economy could have major implications for how we think about potentially moving into a recession. Meta, for so long, represented the most optimistic view of capitalism in the U.S. And to see a company that hasn't stopped growing for a past decade fall like this, it should send shivers, not just down the spines of people in Silicon Valley, but really across the business in the United States. 
 
LEMON: Do you foresee regulations coming? 
 
FISCHER: Of course. I mean we know that regulators are particularly looking at Meta and Google in terms of anti-trust. But the challenge is always that, in order to get things done, Congress really needs to come together. And we have not seen Congress been able to move on things, even with there's bipartisan support. Things like a national privacy law. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
HARLOW: We have Senator Klobuchar on later. This has been like her thing for a long time. 
 
FISCHER: Oh, yes.
 
HARLOW: So, we'll see.
 
Sara Fischer, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
 
FISCHER: Thank you.
 
COLLINS: We'll definitely be asking her about that.
 
All right, 64 votes, that is all that separates one House race in Colorado. 
 
LEMON: What?
 
COLLINS: It is going to be a figure that you know very well. Lauren Boebert. We're breaking down all the races, including hers, that are right now, this morning, as of 6:57 a.m., still too close to call. 
 
LEMON: Awesome. On the nose.
 
HARLOW: For the - for the record.
 
LEMON: With 22 seconds. 6:57: 23, 24, 25.
 
COLLINS: I'll say the time on my iPad is so tiny.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
LEMON: Good morning, everyone. Not to worry, Poppy's here. 
 
COLLINS: We didn't get rid of her yet. 
 
LEMON: She's just not sitting here. She's going to be along in just a second. It is Thursday. It is -- there she is. 
 <br>[07:00:00] It is Thursday. It's November 10th. Welcome, everyone, to CNN THIS MORNING. 
 
And we've got a lot to get to this morning.</pre>
