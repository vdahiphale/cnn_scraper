ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher in New York, and this is One World. I want to begin in Pakistan, where the onset 
 
 of darkness has led to a pause in a risky helicopter mission to rescue four people still stranded in a chairlift over mountainous terrain. The efforts 
 
 are still underway by local zipliners. 
 
Earlier, four children who had been trapped for more than 10 hours were lifted to safety. Right now, two children and two adults are still dangling 
 
 in the cable car, nearly 275 meters above a ravine. The children were headed to school when one of the cables snapped. 
 
CNN's Sophia Saifi joins us live now from Islamabad. This story is absolutely terrifying, this idea that you have children who are apparently 
 
 on their way to school, literally dangling above a ravine. I understand that several of the children have now been rescued, but because it's dark 
 
 now there, they had to pause some of the operations. Just walk us through what we know so far. 
 
SOFIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER: Yes, and it's absolutely terrifying when you think of those children, the ones that do remain, as well as the adults who 
 
 are kind of dangling in this very homemade, hokey kind of cable car, chairlift contraption that is made locally in the northwest of Pakistan. 
 
 It's a remote part of the country, and it's not uncommon for this kind of cable cars to be used to commute communities from one valley to the next. 
 
 And this kind of accidents are also not uncommon, but an accident in which a cable car is suspended about 900 feet above ground and a rescue operation 
 
 that is now closing into about 12 hours is also uncommon. 
 
So, this is a very slow and steady measured rescue operation that has been ongoing for many hours. Like you said, it's very, very dark there. Again, 
 
 it's a remote part of the country, which is why the helicopter operation has had to pause earlier in the day. The reason why it took so long to even 
 
 get those four out was because the heli's blades were causing the one cable that is holding that cable car aloft and suspended was moving very 
 
 violently because of the wind being brought up by the movement of the helicopter.
 
So, yes, there is a ground operation with torch light happening on the ground there in the Battagram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 
 
 There are locals whose expertise -- they know the terrain best. The terrain on the ground is actually very rocky. There is a stream that is flowing, a 
 
 rainwater -- canal, almost, that flows between that valley. And again, those children, it was just a regular school run. There has been a lot of 
 
 criticism about the oversight of these cable cars. Like I mentioned, they're not very well maintained, as we can see from the incident today. 
 
The prime minister has stated that he is observing and monitoring the situation very closely. There are SSG commandos on the ground and they were 
 
 up there in the helicopters, as well. So, all eyes are on that remote part of Pakistan to make sure that those children between the ages of 10 and 15, 
 
 we were told that they were nauseous, they were throwing up, they were fainting and hoping and praying that all of them are rescued and brought 
 
 back to their homes and their parents safely by the end of the day. Zain.
 
ASHER: All right, Sophia Saifi, live for us there. Thank you so much. And do keep an eye on the situation there. And let us know if there are any 
 
 updates we need to report on. Thank you so much, Sophia Saifi. 
 
All right, the world is watching as leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa meet this hour at the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg. 
 
 The nations are looking to expand their global influence, push back against the West, and potentially grow the block, as well. Russian President 
 
 Vladimir Putin is attending virtually because of an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes tied to the invasion of Ukraine. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
For more on this, I want to bring in David McKenzie, joining us live now from Johannesburg. So, in terms of what's on the agenda this time, and 
 
 obviously this is a group that is trying to push back against the West, they're trying to grow. But also, it's a group that has been certainly 
 
 tainted by a lack of a coherent vision and infighting, particularly between rivals like China and India. Just walk us through what more we know. 
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, right now, Zain, the Russian president is giving an address to the business forum 
 
 section of the BRICS Summit. It is a pre-recorded address because he is unable to attend, because of the arrest warrant out for him at the 
 
 International Criminal Court. It is significant, though, that he is having his voice heard. 
 
Of course, Russia is a founding member of BRICS. He's already railed against what he calls unfair sanctions and blaming that on economic wars 
 
 relating to the Ukraine war. You've had a lot of talk in this opening day of BRICS of the world system, a push in the words of BRICS leaders to a 
 
 more multipolar, multilateral world where it's not just groups like the World Bank and the IMF that provide lending and monetary support to 
 
 developing nations. Even Cyril Ramaphosa touched on that when he spoke just a few moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT: We require a fundamental reform of the global financial institutions so that they can be more agile and 
 
 responsive to the challenges facing developing economies. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: Now, the BRICS grouping does have a lender in the new BRICS, the new development bank, Zain. But there is some very significant progress 
 
 that might happen during this particular summit. And that is the possible expansion of BRICS beyond its five core members. That's something that 
 
 China in particular is very much looking to push. They see this, I think, explicitly as a counterweight towards the G7 and wealthy nations. 
 
And whether Russia and India in particular and Brazil are on board with that remains to be seen. This is a consensus organization. But you do get a 
 
 sense after fading from view a little bit that BRICS has returned in terms of its potential voice on the world stage. And with more than 20 countries 
 
 officially trying to join this grouping. It is significant as their populations grow and as their economies grow. BRICS countries will, in fact 
 
 the G7 in terms of sheer economic muscle, whether they can join together and form some kind of unifying block is another matter entirely. Zain.
 
ASHER: Yeah, you've got the likes of Iran, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, several countries looking to become potentially, members, as well. 
 
 David McKenzie, live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, BRICS comprises five major emerging economies of the world. Brazil, Russia, 
 
 India, China and South Africa. Together they account for 26 percent of the world's land mass and 42 percent of the global population. The BRICS make 
 
 up 25 percent of global GDP and 16 percent of global trade, as Dave McKenzie was just touching on there.
 
As BRICS leaders meet in Johannesburg to discuss increasing their political influence, separately the head of Wagner mercenaries is offering up his own 
 
 suggestion. A video circulating on pro-Russian military blog shows Yevgeny Prigozhin standing in a desert in camouflage with a rifle in his hand, 
 
 claiming to be in Africa. In the clip, Prigozhin talks about making Russia greater on all continents. It's his first video since leading the short-
 
 lived Russian mutiny nearly two months ago. 
 
All right, we're getting new images that appear to show an attack on an airfield deep inside Russian territory. Take a look here. You can actually 
 
 see it. A fireball. There it is with smoke billowing high into the air on what looks like a military base runway. Moscow blames Kyiv for the weekend 
 
 drone strike on the air base, which houses long-range strategic bombers. 
 
Meantime, on the battlefield in Ukraine, the southern region is coming under relentless Russian bombardment, especially along frontline villages. 
 
 CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins us live now from Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine. So, Zaporizhzhia saw significant shelling overnight. Nick, what more can you 
 
 tell us? 
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR: Yeah, look, our firefighters were dealing with a huge blaze on a factory. We heard 
 
 ourselves hear a drone passing overhead and there were flashes on the skyline. Frankly, like there are for many Ukrainian cities every night. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
And it's important to remind people that even if the numbers shock you, it is still part of the daily experience of civilians in this country. We've 
 
 been speaking particularly to one firefighter in a town called Orikhiv, which is very much in the path of the current counteroffensive, a place 
 
 that has been heavily destroyed by Russian intense airstrikes over the past month or so. 
 
And that firefighter, Dima, that we spoke to, has not only experienced loss on the frontlines dealing with horror in his job, but also in his personal 
 
 world, as well. And that replicates the experience of so many Ukrainians. Here's what he had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WALSH (voice-over): The aftermath is not always easier. These are the firemen of the most bombed city on earth, Orikhiv, in the throes of the 
 
 counteroffensive. And this is a normal day for them. Here's the story of one we've gotten to know, Dima. 
 
DIMA (through translator): Sometimes, it feels we were born in this war. In two hours, there were 300 incoming. We were in the basement saying goodbye 
 
 to life. The fire moved through the balconies. (BEEP) the bomb just landed!
 
WALSH: Pain here doesn't just come from the flames. Away from the frontlines, Ukraine is suffering in ways we don't see. Dima has lost nearly 
 
 all his family since the war began. His wife left for Europe as a refugee just days after the war started with his son. And he doesn't know if they 
 
 will ever come back. The emptiness of their family home is a crippling constant weight on him. 
 
DIMA (through translator): I'm going insane. Silence. The silence is killing me. When I'm working, I feel better than here. I got so used to 
 
 being there. I can't sleep at night when I'm here at home. Sometimes, I might sleep one hour in the day. At work, I feel more at home and I can 
 
 sleep despite the shelling. WALSH: The gaps between the horror, harder than the horror itself and 
 
 sleep, when it comes is sometimes worse. 
 
DIMA (through translator): These days, I can barely sleep. When I fall asleep, I dream about my family. I'm coming back from my shift and my 
 
 family is here waiting for me. My wife is back, we are together again. I'm so happy to see them after such a long time. I didn't see my family for 
 
 nearly a year. It's a painful subject.
 
WALSH: Orikhiv has been ground dust in the last two months, but Dima's grief here came immediately with last year's invasion. His father died in 
 
 its first days, before his wife left, from a heart attack. He says because of shelling. In that chaos, Dima had to bury his father himself.
 
DIMA (through translator): His heart just stopped from fear. When it explodes, everything shakes inside you. So, he died in my mother's arms. 
 
WALSH: Now, he only has his mother left. She won't leave the house where his father died and where Dima was born, and where the flames may strike 
 
 again. 
 
DIMA (through translator): I have my own war with my mother. One day, I will just tie her up and bring her here because I only have her. As soon as 
 
 I see an air-raid alert, Orikhiv, a gliding bomb. As soon as I see Orikhiv, I call her, Mum, hide! Mum, hide! She says she's hiding herself but I don't 
 
 know, my Mama is a tough one.
 
WALSH: Nearly every Ukrainian home has holes in it from people who won't come back and emotions forged in a war with no end in sight. 
 
DIMA (through translator): I want all the Russians to live in a place like this. After all they all did to my town. Make them live in these conditions 
 
 to the end of their lives. I don't want them to exist at all as a nation. I agree, there are normal, people everywhere on each side. 
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
But I will hate them until the end of my life.
 
WALSH: There's three of you now.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WALSH (on-camera): And so, even though I think it's possible sometimes to perceive the war in Ukraine as a transitory event that will eventually end 
 
 in some way, when you hear someone like Dima express the damage done to him, to his family, to the town where he grew up, to his father, to his 
 
 mother's life going forwards, you understand the scars that are going to exist in Ukraine for decades now. 
 
And it also I think provides an insight if you're trying to work out exactly why Ukraine should, at some point, feel diplomacy is a wise, 
 
 imminent option. There's a deep anger and you can see that in the town of Orikhiv itself that in the last two months has not been reduced to rubble 
 
 but is now so heavily pockmarked by extraordinarily large craters that it is unrecognizable from May. 
 
ASHER: That was a very powerful piece. Nick Paton Walsh. Thank you so much for bringing us Dima's story. We appreciate it. All right, turning now to 
 
 Greece, where devastating wildfires have been burning out of control for a fourth straight day. Eighteen charred bodies, possibly of migrants, were 
 
 found on Tuesday near a village in the northern part of the country. Hundreds of firefighters are struggling to contain dozens of blazes 
 
 nationwide amid blistering, hot, dry, and windy conditions. Some residents desperate to keep their homes from being destroyed are even using branches 
 
 to try to distinguish the flames. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell joins us live now from Paris. So, eighteen charred bodies, possibly of undocumented migrants. At this point, what more do we 
 
 know, Melissa? 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. We're talking about this region of Evros along the border between Greece and Turkey. It's a popular 
 
 migrant route, Zain. And what the firefighting authorities are saying is that because no one has been reported missing in this particular area 
 
 that's been badly damaged, those wildfires spread across driven by those gale force winds across those very dry conditions, it all happened very 
 
 quickly. 
 
They've now discovered these 18 charred bodies. An investigation is going to get underway. A team is on its way to try and figure out what went on. 
 
 But the initial suspicion is these may well have been migrants trying to make their way across northern Greece, having crossed the Evros River from 
 
 Turkey. 
 
Now, that is what's been happening to the north of that area, further south, also still in the northeast of the country, that port city of 
 
 Alexandroupolis that has been heavily impacted by those fires that have been raging towards the town city itself with the in-patients, some 200 or 
 
 so in-patients of the hospital there having to be evacuated onto a ferry just off the port to try and rescue them. Very small infants, the elderly -
 
 - this happening in very difficult conditions that some hospital workers have described that as warlike conditions.
 
And this really what we've seen over the course of the last few days, the wildfires picking up over the course of a 24-hour period, saying starting 
 
 in dozens of different parts of Greece, those terrible conditions that we saw, remember back in July when the country had been ripped by wildfires, 
 
 as well. Rhodes had seen its largest ever evacuation as a result. Then, there's been the country's largest ever evacuation as a result. Then 
 
 there's been this lull in both the temperatures and the winds, and now it's picking up again with Greek authorities fearing that this could be just a 
 
 start for the time being.
 
Many of the fires far from being under control with the European civil protection mechanism now having been evacuated. It is Romanian 
 
 firefighters, those from the Czech Republic, as well. Germany also lending a hand, not just with men and women there to help fight the fires, but fire 
 
 engines, helicopters as well, bringing in those Canadairs that can bring the water to the fires themselves. 
 
For now, though, very little sign that they're anywhere near under control. Fires also in southern Spain with those conditions also. Very high 
 
 temperatures across the continent, dry conditions that have been there for weeks and fears that this could be the start of another season of wildfires 
 
 as we head into the back end of the summer here in Europe. Zain.
 
ASHER: All right, that's about life for us. Thank you. All right, coming up, as we've been reporting, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China 
 
 and South Africa are meeting right now for a major summit. In fact, Putin has just addressed the summit via video link. All of this, just in terms of 
 
 their goals here, revolves around an effort to push back against the West and grow their own power, even expansion. We'll talk about what's at stake, 
 
 next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:22:17]
 
ASHER: All right, right now, leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are meeting for their annual BRICS Summit to determine the 
 
 future of the bloc and how it pushes back against the West. The group is also entertaining formal bids from nearly two dozen countries to expand. 
 
 And let's say changes to the bloc and a bid to rebalance global power would have significant implications and threatens to escalate tensions with the 
 
 West, as well. Change within BRICS may not come easy. Existing members
 
have differing views on how to grow the bloc, and they also have competing agendas, as well. For example, China favors expanding bricks to shore up 
 
 its own global influence, while India and Brazil prefer a much more cautious approach because of their relationships with the West. 
 
And the disputed border between China and India has long been the source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing. For more on this, let's bring in 
 
 Zane Dangor in Johannesburg. He currently serves as the Director General of South Africa's Development and of International Relations and Corporations.
 
Zane, good to have you on the show again. Let's talk about BRICS expansion, because that is obviously a key part of the agenda this time around. You've 
 
 got countries like, for example, Iran, Argentina, eyeing to join the bloc. Just walk us through what they bring to the table, and if the bloc does 
 
 indeed expand to include, for example, those countries, how does that change the dynamic within the bloc, do you think? 
 
ZANE DANGOR, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, DEPARTMENT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND COOPERATION, SOUTH AFRICA: So, the big discussions, part of the discussions 
 
 that we're having is what are the criteria for expansion? What are the kinds of values and commitments to development, democracy, et cetera, is in 
 
 the developing south that will enable expansion on an agreed basis. So, essentially what we're looking at is to ensure that underrepresented 
 
 regions, for example, Southeast Asia, get a seat at the table. 
 
But as you said in your introductory remarks, you know, we've just started the discussion. The Shope has been negotiating. And as it stands, we still 
 
 haven't finalized the modalities for expansion. But hopefully by the end of this week, we would have agreed on the criteria and perhaps if there's an 
 
 agreement on one or two countries, full membership that will be announced as well when in, you know, in the closing session by the leadership of 
 
 which -- the residents here. 
 
ASHER: Because there are obviously competing viewpoints and competing agendas, which we've touched on and I will circle back to that. But just 
 
 explain to us how the bloc's mission has evolved since its inception. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
The first BRICS Summit was held about 14 years ago, back in 2009. The world was a very different place back then particularly regarding Russia's 
 
 relationship with the West. Just explain to us the BRICS mission's evolution over the last 14 years or so. 
 
DANGOR: So, I think the evolution of BRICS hasn't changed that much. And I do -- I do hear people saying that, you know, they see BRICS as a 
 
 counterweight to the West. We -- we don't see it that way. It's worth pointing out that all the BRICS members are members of the G20 and so as 
 
 much as we engage in BRICS, we also engage in the G20. 
 
We see BRICS as a particular voice for countries from the developing South with a particular focus on development and mutual growth. And in fact, the 
 
 theme for this summit that South Africa's hosting is BRICS and Africa Partnership for mutually accelerated growth, sustainable development, and 
 
 also, inclusive multilateralism. 
 
So, these are the key issues that BRICS has been concerned with. So, what we're debating, for example, is how do we change global governance to 
 
 better represent the world, you know, and particularly the Security Council to ensure that underrepresented regions from Africa, Latin America and Asia 
 
 get better represented? How do we ensure that you have mutually beneficial growth and economic systems? 
 
So, this is still the key focus on BRICS, it's not a peace and security establishment. We really don't, in the formation, talk about geopolitics 
 
 from a military perspective. We talk about geopolitics from a developmental perspective, and that hasn't changed much. Despite the changes in the 
 
 global arena, we still try to stick to that agenda. 
 
ASHER: But the fact that the two sort of heavyweights, China and Russia, are now much more isolated from the West than they were sort of 10 years 
 
 ago, doesn't that at all change the dynamic within the BRICS? 
 
DANGOR: Look, it influences the dynamic. And I think what we're engaging with, and especially the various platforms at South Africa, Brazil and 
 
 India are part of as well, is that we're making the point to big powers outside of BRICS as well, that with big power comes big responsibility. And 
 
 instead of engaging in containment strategies, that could, you know, that makes -- it makes the world more vulnerable. We're pushing, for example, 
 
 China, Russia, but we're also engaging with the U.S. about ensuring that we work together with, you know, big powers work together to benefit the 
 
 entire globe. 
 
So, this is the discussion we're having in BRICS. It's the discussion we're having in the G20. It's a discussion that we have with the U.N. So, it's 
 
 not, you know, so BRICS on its own is not going to solve these matters, but BRICS members working in together, but also working with other countries 
 
 and other fora working for a safer, more inclusive world is what the emphasis should be. And that's the emphasis we're putting on our -- the 
 
 summit that we're cheering. 
 
ASHER: And in terms of working together, I mean, what efforts are there being made just to ensure that all the members are sort of singing from the 
 
 same hymn sheet? I mean, you talk about the various viewpoints when it comes to how the BRICS countries will expand, the terms for expansion and 
 
 that sort of thing. We've touched on the rivalry, for example, between China and India. What efforts are being made to ensure that these countries 
 
 are singing from the same hymn sheet?
 
DANGOR: I think singing from the same hymn sheet stems from the kinds of discussions that we hold. I think the more we discuss, the better the 
 
 understanding, and then agreements follow. So, you know, the focus that we've been having in the run-up to the summit in the meetings and in other 
 
 preparatory meetings with ministers is to ensure that we engage in areas where we differ, whether it's on economic policy, whether it's on changes 
 
 to the U.N. Security Council, whether it's on reform of the financial systems. 
 
We move towards a position where we look at what is the basis for change and not focus on the differences. And that's been very important, 
 
 especially in the last two years in a fractious global environment. And it's something that we have the BRICS countries and interestingly, IBSA, 
 
 which is India, Brazil and South Africa -- are the next chairs of the G20. And we will also be taking some of the lessons and the issues that there 
 
 are a lot of concern for countries in the developing South into the bigger multilateral forums, such as the G20 and the U.N. So, we don't see BRICS as 
 
 an isolated formation that is anti-West. It's not anti-West, not at all. 
 
I think that it's pro-development, it's pro-developing South. We need to engage with countries in the West at all the fora that's available to us 
 
 and also at the bilateral level. 
 
ASHER: All right, Zane Dangor, live for us. Thank you so much. All right, still to come, a closer look at the situation in Niger. A month after a 
 
 coup is crippling the country. We'll speak to a U.S. Senator about the crisis next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:34:05]
 
ASHER: Hello and welcome back to One World. In just a moment I'll be speaking with a U.S. Senator, with Chris Coons, about the military coup in 
 
 Niger, as well as his recent meeting with Kenya's President William Ruto. But first, let's catch up on the headlines. Much of Southern California is 
 
 a muddy mess as people attempt to clean up from the record-breaking rain brought by Hurricane Hillary. The storm brought a year's worth of rain in 
 
 one day to many traditionally dry areas of the western United States. 
 
After three years of being closed off from the outside world because of concerns about COVID, North Korea is again allowing its planes to fly 
 
 outside the country. The first international commercial flight from North Korea since January 2020 landed in Beijing on Tuesday. North Korea plans to 
 
 also begin flying to Russia later this week. 
 
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced plans to begin releasing treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Nuclear Plant as early as 
 
 Thursday. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
The International Atomic Energy Agency, says that this will have, quote, "a negligible impact on the environment". 
 
All right, I want to take a closer look at the political chaos in Niger. Just hours ago, the African Union announced that it was suspending the 
 
 country from the group until it restores constitutional order. The A.U., which consists of 55 member states, is also calling on its members and the 
 
 International Community to avoid any action that might legitimize an illegal regime in Niger. 
 
The West African nation has been engulfed in political chaos since late July. That's when a military junta ousted the democratically elected 
 
 President Mohamed Bazoum. The regional bloc ECOWAS has been trying to negotiate with the junta, but it says it's ready to send troops into Niger 
 
 if diplomacy fails. 
 
The coup has alarmed several African states, who fear it could allow Islamic groups active in the Sahel to expand their reach. The African 
 
 Union's move comes a day after the general who ousted the president proposed a three-year timeline to organize elections and return to 
 
 democracy. That call has been rejected by ECOWAS. 
 
Time now for The Exchange. We're going to talk about Niger and other issues on the continent as well. U.S. Senator Chris Coons is joining us live now. 
 
 He's a Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has just returned from a trip to Kenya. 
 
Senator Coons, I want to touch on Kenya in just a moment, but first let's start with Niger. So, the African Union is suspending Niger until 
 
 constitutional order is restored there. They're urging their members not to take any action that legitimizes the military junta in that country. But 
 
 obviously, in terms of reinstating President Bazoum, their ability to do that is somewhat limited. Just give us your thoughts on this. Does the U.S. 
 
 support military intervention in Niger, as has been possibly proposed by ECOWAS? 
 
CHRIS COONS, U.S. SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: Zain, I think it's important that we continue to support African solutions to this challenge 
 
 in Niger. I think ECOWAS and the African Union have spoken clearly and forcefully that they are going to do everything they can to restore the 
 
 democratically elected leadership of Niger, and they are putting increasing pressure on the junta. 
 
The offer that was made recently, you just referenced, for a three-year transition back to a democratically elected government has been rejected as 
 
 it should be. I think it's important that before the United States takes any strong action, either cutting off assistance or engaging more 
 
 forcefully in the region, that we allow time for diplomacy to play out, although that window is rapidly closing. 
 
ASHER: Right. Many people believe that it is. It's almost closed, if not the fact that it has already closed. The U.S. has paused some assistance to 
 
 Niger at this point in time, just in terms of financial aid. Just walk us through, once it becomes increasingly clear that President Bazoum is not 
 
 going to be reinstated, the chances of President Buzum being reinstated is next to nothing. Once that becomes crystal clear, how does the U.S. change 
 
 its financial relationship with Niger, and also, what happens to U.S. troops who are based in the country? 
 
COONS: Well, we provide literally hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance to Niger. One avenue is through the Millennium Challenge 
 
 Corporation's Compact, a multi-year development partnership between the United States and Niger. That might very well be suspended. We have other 
 
 programs that focus more on humanitarian relief, on support for PEPFAR, for example, an important public health program, other development programs, we 
 
 would review those closely to see which ought to continue in the interest of sustaining humanitarian engagement and which we would need to suspend or 
 
 cut off altogether.
 
In the United States, when a country has a coup that overthrows a democratically elected government, we will make a determination the U.S. 
 
 State Department would, and following that, then each of the different agencies would make a determination. Niger has been a critical partner in 
 
 work against jihadists, against instability in the region. There's roughly a thousand U.S. troops there at two different facilities. And it would be a 
 
 critical loss to both Niger and the Sahelian region to no longer have us able to do counterterrorism partnerships there. 
 
I suspect we will continue to explore ways that we could either relocate those forces and resources elsewhere in the region, provide more support 
 
 and a backstop to the critical coastal states, countries like Ghana, Kotebora, Togo and Benin.
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
Or continue to work to find a path forward with the leadership in Niger, hopefully restoring President Bazoum or getting a quick timeline towards a 
 
 next election. 
 
ASHER: Let's turn now to Kenya. You just returned from a trip to Kenya. We've covered on our show several times, the amount of protests happening 
 
 in that country because of tax hikes, because of rising prices. Ordinary Kenyans simply cannot afford basic foodstuffs. And that has created chaos 
 
 in the country. I understand that you've met with President William Ruto. 
 
A lot of these protests have been organized by William Ruto's political foe, Raila Odinga. Just explain to us what came out of, I don't know if I 
 
 should call it potential mediation efforts that you made, but has there been any progress in terms of mediation on either side? 
 
COONS: Zain, there has been real progress. A national dialogue process has been initiated by these two political parties. Kenyans need to find a path 
 
 forward and a solution to the challenges of their economy, their electoral democracy. I was simply meeting with the support and assistance of our very 
 
 capable ambassador Meg Whitman there with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, with President William Ruto and representatives of their factions, 
 
 their government, in order to try and encourage and support a peaceful resolution to the disputes that have led to the protests you're 
 
 referencing. 
 
I was in Kenya roughly a year ago in the week between the election and the decision by the Supreme Court to recognize William Ruto as the duly elected 
 
 president of Kenya. I returned last April for a one-day conversation with a number of the critical players, including former President Kenyatta. And 
 
 during the week that I was there as a part of a bipartisan congressional delegation that was looking at other humanitarian and development issues, I 
 
 took advantage of that opportunity, Zain, to also meet with President Ruto and former Prime Minister Odinga. 
 
I am encouraged that there is a path forward. There's a menu of things they need to address and resolve. Kenya is a promising development and security 
 
 and democracy partner for the United States, and if they can move forward through this process, through this national dialogue, I think there is a 
 
 stronger and deeper relationship between the United States and Kenya possible on the other side. 
 
ASHER: Let's talk about the BRICS Summit that is happening right now. When you think about the agenda, I mean, many people sort of see it as some kind 
 
 of counterweight to the G7. Some people see it as a way for the Global South to have a larger say in world affairs. You know, you have Cyril 
 
 Ramaphosa, the President of South Africa who has come out and said yes, South Africa has been sort of caught in the middle between the U.S. and 
 
 Russia, but he sees South Africa as a neutral party between both of those spheres of influence. Do you buy that? I mean, does Cyril Ramaphosa's 
 
 actions show neutrality, or does his actions sort of show a leaning towards Russia, do you think? 
 
COONS: Well, it's pretty striking that Putin, Vladimir Putin, was invited to the BRICS Summit. Russia is one of the key partners in BRICS, but 
 
 declined to attend so that he wouldn't put President Ramaphosa in the awkward situation of having to decide whether to enforce the law and to 
 
 arrest him because he is indicted under the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Ukraine. President Xi of China is there. President Lula 
 
 of Brazil. Prime Minister Modi of India, this is an important gathering. 
 
And I do think, Zain, that it's important and valuable for the voices and the concerns of the global South to be heard and engaged and respected and 
 
 responded to in other settings at the United Nations, at the G7, the G20. And so, I don't think it's inherently a bad thing for this BRICS Summit to 
 
 be occurring in South Africa. And I do think they are raising issues that deserve to be addressed. 
 
President Ramaphosa has said that South Africa does not want to be caught between the great powers of the United States and Russia. Obviously, there 
 
 was a liberation struggle history between the former Soviet Union and the current ANC government in South Africa. 
 
But as I've conveyed to President Ramaphosa and to other leaders in South Africa, it's my hope that they will remain genuinely neutral in this 
 
 conflict and not choose to come to the aid of Russia in its ongoing illegal, brutal, and unjustified invasion and occupation of a significant 
 
 part of Ukrainian territory. Saying when I was in Kenya this past week, I got to see firsthand the impact on refugees in a refugee camp of the war in 
 
 Ukraine. 
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
There's been a reduction in the food available in dozens of countries because Ukraine is the country that provides about three-quarters of the 
 
 grain that the World Food Programme relies on in order to feed millions of hungry refugees around the Middle East and East Africa. Russia's aggression 
 
 is the critical reason why fertilizer and food throughout the region is more expensive, is harder to access, and President Putin's refusal to renew 
 
 the Black Sea grain arrangement that allowed for the export of grain is a key cause of growing hunger throughout that region of the world. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, and when you think about the Kakuma refugee camp, which you just got back from, I mean, they have suffered so much when it comes to 
 
 failed rainy seasons and drought, water scarcity, as you point out, malnutrition as well. They rely heavily on grain from Ukraine, and 
 
 obviously that has been severely interrupted because of this war. Senator Chris Coons, live for us there. Thank you so much. We'll be right back with 
 
 more.

ASHER: Several of Donald Trump's co-defendants accused of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 elections have turned themselves in to authorities in Fulton 
 
 County, Georgia. Among those who have been arrested in the past couple of hours is John Eastman, one of the leading attorneys advising Trump in the 
 
 wake of the 2020 election. Eastman posted a $100,000 bond and has been released. Trump says he will turn himself in on Thursday and he will be 
 
 processed and released on a $200,000 bond. 
 
CNN's Senior Crime Justice Reporter, Katelyn Polantz is live for us outside the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta. So, Caitlin, Trump turning himself 
 
 in on Thursday. Just walk us through how we expect the day and that process to unfold. Well, between now and then, Zain, there are a lot of moving 
 
 pieces with these 19 different defendants. They are negotiating their bond, just like Donald Trump did yesterday. 
 
And some of them have already been arrested and gone into that jail for a period of time so that they could have their mugshots taken, fingerprints 
 
 taken, and potentially be searched, and just have their information about themselves put into the criminal justice system as defendants awaiting 
 
 trial.
 
That is what is expected of Donald Trump. We don't know yet if his mugshot will be taken, but it is quite a serious thing that is happening here in 
 
 Georgia, even compared to these other cases that Donald Trump faces, two in the federal court system, as well as one in the state of New York scene, 
 
 because in those cases there weren't as strict terms placed around Donald Trump. 
 
There weren't as many defendants. And the terms that Donald Trump now has to abide by is that he does have to post $200,000 in bond or at least 
 
 assure that that money is reachable in the case that he wouldn't show up for his future proceedings. 
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
He also is being told that he can't intimidate witnesses or other defendants in this case. That is a very large group of people who were 
 
 working around him after the 2020 election, not just the co-defendants, but people on his campaign, people in his White House, people he's still in 
 
 touch with to a certain extent. And so, he is being told by the judge he could have to go to jail if he were to violate the terms of his release, 
 
 including posting on social media in a way that's intimidating. 
 
ASHER: Well, we'll see if he's able to abide by some of those terms. Katelyn Polantz, live for us there. Thank you so much. We'll be right back 
 
 with more.

ASHER: Spain's World Cup team is being celebrated for their victory against England, but some of the actions by Spanish football leaders off the pitch 
 
 are coming under fire. This video, take a look here, is surfacing of Spain's manager, Jorge Vilda. After Spain's only goal during the final, it 
 
 appears Vilda inappropriately touches a female staff member. When he embraces her, let's see if we can actually roll this video again, when he 
 
 embraces to her chest. He keeps it there. Watch closely. He keeps it there for a moment and then lets go.
 
And separately, the Royal Spanish Football Federation president is apologizing for a kiss that he planted on Spain star Jennifer Hermoso 
 
 following their World Cup victory on Sunday. Luis Rubiales says he made a mistake during a very spontaneous moment. However, Spanish Prime Minister 
 
 Pedro Sanchez says that the apology is not enough. The Association of Spanish Footballers wants Rubiales to be held accountable under the law. 
 
CNN's World Sports Coy Wire joins us live now. Coy, so much to talk about here. You know, watching this Women's World Cup, I felt so proud because I 
 
 just thought to myself, wow, we have come a long way, just in terms of the amount of interest that this World Cup had gone. The fact that it was the 
 
 most watched Women's World Cup ever, the fact that we were talking more about equal pay and gender parity and that sort of thing. And then lo and 
 
 behold these videos come out and you realize, and it's such a wake-up call for all of us because you realize just how much work there is to be done. 
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
Take us through it, Coy.
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, it really was, Zain. To your point, a kind of a slap in the face despite all the progress we've seen from the record 
 
 TV viewership to the increase in prize money that was offered this time around. And this really should have solely been about this historic moment 
 
 for Spain, celebrating these women, their hard work, their accomplishments. Instead, here we are.
 
A lot of the focus is turning to two separate men appearing to have inappropriate contact with women. And Luis Rubiales there on the left, the 
 
 President of the Spanish Football Federation, was seen grabbing the head of Spain star, Jenny Hermoso, kissing her on the lips during that team's medal 
 
 ceremony. She reportedly said afterwards she did not like it. Rubiales had this apology in an issue the day after the match. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LUIS RUBIALES, SPANISH FOOTBALL FEDERATION PRESIDENT (through translator): Everything that has happened between me and the player with a magnificent 
 
 relationship between the two of us, as well as with other players. I was surely wrong. I have to admit it because at a moment of maximum enthusiasm, 
 
 emotion, without any bad intentions, without any bad faith, well, what happened, happened. Outside it seems that a commotion has formed and, of 
 
 course, if there are people who have felt damaged by this, I have to apologize. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Now, Zain, on Tuesday at the presidential palace, Spain's Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met with the team. And as you can see, 
 
 Rubiales, as well. It must have been some tension because just a bit later, Sanchez slammed Rubiales' attempt at an apology.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PEDRO SANCHEZ, SPAIN ACTING PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I believe that what we saw was an unacceptable gesture. I also believe that the 
 
 apologies made by Mr. Rubiales are not enough. I even believe that they are not adequate and that therefore Mr. Rubiales must continue to take steps to 
 
 clarify what we all saw through the media. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Now, of course, the focus has also turned, as you mentioned, to the team's coach, Jorge Vilda, appearing to grab a female staff member's chest 
 
 inappropriately after Olga Carmona's historic goal, which won them that World Cup title over England. CNN has reached out to comment -- for comment 
 
 from Vilda from the Spanish Football Federation, and the woman have not yet heard back. 
 
ASHER: All right, Coy Wire, thank you so much for bringing us this story. Such an important reminder about how much work needs to be done and where 
 
 we are. All right. Before we go, an update on our top story. One more child has been rescued from that cable car in Pakistan. One child and two adults 
 
 remain trapped. It is dark there. They've been trapped for more than 10 hours and rescue efforts to continue. We'll be following this story very 
 
 closely in the coming hours. And thank you so much for watching One World. I'm Zain Asher. Amanpour is up next. You're watching CNN.
