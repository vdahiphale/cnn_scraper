BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: New this hour, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he's now calling a deadly strike in Rafah a "tragic mistake." 
 
The Gaza Health Ministry says that airstrike hit a refugee camp in Rafah yesterday, killing at least 45 people. Some 200 others were wounded in the strike. 
 
The Israeli military claims that it did kill two senior Hamas officials. 
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: Now that strike is happening just as hostage negotiations are set to resume in Egypt tomorrow. 
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live in Jerusalem. 
 
Jeremy, what is the latest that you're learning about the situation with all these different components to it? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the sights and sounds of this strike last night in east -- in western Rafah are just absolutely horrific. Forty-five people working killed, hundreds more were wounded in a strike that hit a displaced person's camp in western Rafah. 
 
This is not one of the areas that the Israeli military had ordered people to evacuate. That was eastern Rafah. So, indeed, many people have been fleeing to this area and the surrounding area as well.
 
And very quickly, people in this displaced person's camp found out that there is truly nowhere safe in Gaza. 
 
The sounds of women shouting as flames were just absolutely engulfing this entire camp last night. Children among those killed and injured. Horrific images, including one child with burns all over his body. 
 
But the Israeli government and its military, in a very rare admission, are now calling this a "tragic mistake." That's the Israeli prime minister. 
 
And the Israeli military is going a step further, saying that they are going to investigate this incident with the Israeli military s top lawyer launching an investigation in a very formal manner.
 
In a statement, the Israeli military actually said that they had conducted a pre-strike assessment and believed that no civilians would be harmed during the course of this the strike.
 
Which was designed, and successfully, according to the Israeli military, to take out two senior Hamas members responsible for coordinating Hamas activities in the West Bank. 
 
Now, amid all of this, of course, there is growing international outrage at Israel's actions in Rafah. In particular, just days ago, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to stop its military operations in Rafah.
 
Clearly, that is not something that the Israeli government is choosing to do. 
 
But now Qatar, one of the key mediators in these ceasefire negotiations, says that they are concerned that this latest strike in Rafah could hinder further negotiations.
 
For now, at least, though, we expect that negotiations are set to resume tomorrow in Cairo. That's according to an Egyptian official.
 
But it's not clear yet whether the gap between Israel and Hamas has been bridged yet. Major differences, including whether or not this -- these negotiations will lead to an end to the war still very much remain.
 
SANCHEZ: Jeremy Diamond, live for us in Jerusalem. Jeremy, thank you so much.
 
Let's discuss now with CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger. His new book, "New Cold Wars, China's Rise, Russia's Invasion, and America's Struggle to Defend the West," is out right now. 
 
David, thanks so much for being with us.
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing this airstrike as a "tragic mistake." The IDF says it's now investigating. What do you predict will be found?
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it was pretty clear, if the prime minister is coming out and saying right off it's a tragic mistake, then obviously they have early evidence that they hit the wrong space.
 
And given Jeremy's report, they may have had a space where previously Gazans had been told was going to be a safe place for them to retreat to. Remember, this was a camp for people who had already been displaced, probably from the north. 
 
But this is a pretty familiar pattern now, Boris. We saw it a number of weeks ago when we saw Food International food aid workers who were killed in a convoy that should not have been targeted. That led as well to an investigation. It also led to some disciplinary actions against individuals in the IDF. But they've gone forward.
 
And I guess the question you have to ask is, if, in fact, the Israelis did what they said they did, which was kill two terrorists who were part of Hamas, which Israel has vowed to destroy for understandable reasons after the October 7th terror attack, if that's the case, is it worth these numbers you're getting of the terrorists if the collateral damage is this high?
 <br>[13:35:07]
 
And I think the question pretty well answers itself. It's why the international Criminal Court ordered Israel to stop the operation.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, and David, as you alluded to, this is one of many mistakes, a long line of mistakes by the IDF, not only killing aid workers, but even Israeli hostages at one point.
 
Do you think that there will come a time when these mistakes add up to Netanyahu reconsidering how this war is being carried out?
 
SANGER: There's no evidence so far that it has. Obviously, he has been pressed by President Biden on this, by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, by other international figures. We just saw condemnation today by the top European Union official Josep Borrell. 
 
So we're seeing a number of cases of people around the world urging him to stop. And of course, the prime minister himself said that even if there is a ceasefire order, it's not sure in his mind that that would stop the operation in Rafah.
 
So, no, he considers this central to wiping out Hamas. I understand why he views it that way. He's probably right about that.
 
The question is, is it worth the humanitarian cost? That's the cost benefit analysis. And that, of course, would go to the center of these threatened prosecutions as well for war crimes. 
 
SANCHEZ: So hostage and ceasefire talks are -- are set to resume tomorrow. Aside from this strike, there was also an incident at the border with Egypt. A security personnel with the Egyptian military, a group of them, at least one person was killed there in a shooting incident.
 
How do these kinds of incidents now complicate negotiations? Do you think there's still a real chance at a deal, given that so many of the players are furious at each other?
 
SANGER: Well, it does certainly make it harder, Boris. I think there are two things to vie for (ph). First, Egypt started off this effort in October after the terror attacks, fundamentally, on Israel side. 
 
Remember, Egypt was the first Arab state to reach an agreement with Israel, a peace agreement years ago. And so having their cooperation was critical. Now we're seeing firing across that border. 
 
And while I don't think this is going to turn into a full-scale conflict, it's pushing in that direction.
 
The second thing to remember, Boris, is that it was six weeks ago that American officials thought they were this close to an agreement on a ceasefire, and the blame for the fact that didn't happen primarily falls on Hamas. 
 
But it's hard to believe that if Hamas wouldn't reach this deal six weeks ago that they're going to reach it today. 
 
Because I think their leader, Sinwar, among others must come to the conclusion that the Israelis are doing so much damage to their own reputation internationally that maybe it's in his benefit to let this continue on. 
 
And so it's a really hard complication -- calculation for the Hamas leadership.
 
SANCHEZ: David Sanger, appreciate your perspective as always. Thanks for being with us.
 
Again, his new book, "New Cold War, China's Rise, Russia's Invasion, and America's Struggle to Defend the West," is out now. 
 
Thanks again, David.
 
So were watching developments in Massachusetts where a man is in custody after allegedly stabbing four girls in a movie theater. Ahead, what police are saying about his possible connection to a murder in another state.
 <br>[13:39:00]
 
And watch this. A small plane coming dangerously close to homes before a crash landing. What prompted this slow-flying maneuver? Next on CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: We're getting our first look at the suspect in a Massachusetts stabbing spree today. And 26-year-old Jared Ravizza is in custody, suspected of stabbing six people on Saturday. 
 
DEAN: Police say the victims include four young girls. They are all expected to survive. 
 
CNN's Athena Jones is following the story for us.
 
And, Athens, these are some pretty disturbing details, and especially those young girls that were stabbed in the movie theater. What more can you tell us?
 
ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Jessica. Exactly. Frightening incidents unfolding. These four young girls were between the ages of 9 and 17. They were attacked without warning, without provocation at an AMC movie theatre in Braintree at around 6:00 p.m. on Saturday night. The mother of three of the girls spoke with our affiliate, WCBS.
 
 Here's what she had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LISA DEMBOWSKI, CHILDREN STABBED: Nope. So they were the only four people in this movie theater. They had just sat down. They had just got their concessions.
 
And I guess he came up behind them in the row. They were like in the second row and he came up behind them. My oldest was leaned over to get something. He got her in the back. And then my other daughter in the top chest. And then my last daughter across her arm. Laughing the whole time. And then got their friend and ran off. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
JONES: So really a chilling account here. 
 
What now these -- these four girls experienced non-life-threatening injuries and were treated in hospitals in the Boston area. 
 <br>[13:45:01]
 
Now, about an hour later, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at a McDonalds in Plymouth, Massachusetts. That's about half-an-hour's drive south of Braintree. They were also taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
 
But police say this suspect, Ravizza, was arrested 15 minutes later after fleeing the scene of the McDonalds. He faces multiple assault charges, according to the Plymouth County district attorney's office.
 
Those charges include assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. 
 
He, too, was treated for non-threatening injuries at a hospital. He's expected to appear in court on Tuesday.
 
But some of the details of this second incident are also very, very concerning and chilling. Prosecutors allege -- allege Ravizza arrived at the scene of the Plymouth McDonalds in a black Porsche Macan SUV. This was similar to a vehicle that had been seen leaving scene of the movie theater.
 
Surveillance footage from the McDonalds appears to show Ravizza reaching through the drive-through window to stab the male victim with a large knife. And then the video shows the suspect parking his car, then entering the restaurant and stabbing the female victim before fleeing in the car. 
 
So within minutes, state troopers were able to track down the vehicle, Mr. Ravizza's SUV. He refused to pull over, so they gave chase. That chase ended in a crash. 
 
Braintree police say that while these two incidents took place, about an hour -- an hour apart from each other and some distance away from each other, it appears as though the crimes are related. 
 
And we have new information on a little bit of Ravizza's past. He was arrested on Martha's Vineyard for assault and battery of a family member back in April. 
 
And "The Boston Globe" reported the father told police he had just had a mental break and attacked him, saying this of his son.
 
So certainly more to be learned about this suspect. The preliminary investigation connects -- suggests a connection, but yet this investigation is active and ongoing. And we'll have to see how this unfolds. But very, very frightening -- Jessica, Boris? 
 
DEAN: It sure is.
 
Athena Jones, thank you so much for that reporting. 
 
Let's turn now to some other headlines we're watching this hour.
 
A man has been arrested for allegedly setting a stranger's shirt on fire on a New York City subway. Police say this aspect threw a cup of flaming liquid on a passenger before running off the train. 
 
The victim did suffer burns on his upper body and is now listed in stable condition. Police believe the suspect carried out a similar attack on a subway platform back in February.
 
Aerial footage captures an incredibly close call in Sydney, Australia. This small plane lost power and just barely missed several rooftops and brushed a tree before crash landing at an airport.
 
SANCHEZ: The pilot says he kept the landing gear up the whole time, knowing he had just inches to spare on the way down. Both people on board walked away unharmed.
 
And a milestone in the recovery process at the port of Baltimore. Two cruise ships set to sail over the weekend for the first time since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after being struck by a cargo ship back in March. The state government says the cruise industry added $63 million to Maryland's economy last year. 
 
DEAN: And up next the NBA is grieving the loss of a basketball legend, a player, and broadcaster unlike any other. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:52:47]
 
DEAN: We are following breaking news. Basketball legend, Bill Walton, has died at the age of 71. The Hall of Fame center in two-time NBA champion passed away after a prolonged battle with cancer. 
 
Matt Winer joins us now. Matt is the host of "TNT Sports Tonight." 
 
Remind us about his legacy in the world of basketball. MATT WINER, HOST, "TNT SPORTS TONIGHT": Yes, Boris and Jessica, if there were a Hall of Fame within the basketball Hall of Fame, something set aside for the truly elite players the game has ever seen, Bill Walton would be a part of that.
 
One of the greatest college players ever. A three-time national player of the year, twice a national champion at UCLA where his teams won 88 straight games at one point. 
 
He had one of the greatest national championship-game performances of all time back in 1973. Hit 21 of 22 shots and scored 44 points to help beat Memphis State.
 
That was before he landed in the NBA where he was a two-time NBA champion, once with the Portland Trailblazers, still their only title, back and 77. And again, as a sixth man coming off the bench with the Boston Celtics in 1986. 
 
He was a league MVP, was a six man the year, very different roles. And despite the fact that he was plagued by injuries, had a great pro career as well.
 
Truly, one of the elite players in the game's history.
 
DEAN: And it wasn't just on the court. He was a legendary broadcaster as well. You worked with him. And we're so sorry for the loss of your
 
 colleague. What was he like? 
 
WINER: Bill is unique. That word is tossed around way too much. Bill was unique. One of one, as they say now. There was no one like Bill Walton. 
 
He was anti-establishment, in some ways, going back to his days in college when he would protest the Vietnam War, whereas Coach John Wood (ph) had to bail him out of jail. 
 
Walked to the beat of his own drum. During a broadcast, famously could quote a Grateful Dead lyric, drop that into a basketball game because he was a noted Dead Head. He might speak about Che Guevara. He -- you never knew what was going to come out of Bill's mouth.
 
But part of that justice also extended to the way he viewed the game. If you played the game the right way, if you did the hard work, you're likely to get the results you deserve. And I think that's the way Bill looked at basketball as well. 
 <br>[13:55:08]
 
And on top of that, really just loved his life. He was the superstar who appreciated what life had given him, what his talents had afforded him over the course of his career and his life. 
 
I'll read you just a brief quote from the last text he sent me after the basketball Hall of Fame in August. It says, "Thanks for our lives." That's one of the things he wrote to me in August. Last I ever heard
 
 from Bill Walton. He really loved life and it is crushing for me personally to see that taken away from him.
 
DEAN: For sure. What a legacy he leaves? And again, we're sending love to friends like you and colleagues and so many people that he clearly touched on and off the basketball court.
 
Matt Winer, thank you so much. We appreciate it. 
 
WINER: Sure. No one like him.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
Still ahead on CNN NEWS CENTRAL, Israel's prime minister says a strike on a camp for displaced Gazans was a mistake. We have more on the strike and reaction to it from around the world. 
 
And after weeks of testimony, the criminal hush money trial of Donald Trump enters a new chapter tomorrow morning. Closing arguments are expected in the case. So what does each side need to do to prevail? That's straight ahead.
