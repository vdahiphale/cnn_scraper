ANNOUNCER: Live from London, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Max Foster. 
 
FOSTER: It is Monday, October 17th, 9:00 a.m. here in London, 11:00 a.m. in Kyiv. 
 
Where at least four explosions have rocked the Ukrainian capital and officials say Russia's latest attacks have been carried out by kamikaze drones. The city's mayor says rescue operations are under way at one site where two people remain under rubble and 18 others have been rescued. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia's attack on Ukrainian cities, quote, won't be able to break us. CNN's Clarissa Ward in Kyiv and also Clare Sebastian is here in London. Clarissa first to you with the very latest.
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Max. That's right. We're at the scene of one of those blasts. You can probably see behind me quite a lot of smoke still coming from that area where, according to Ukrainian authorities, a residential building was hit. The mayor Vitali Klitschko of Kyiv saying that 18 people were rescued from that building. That two people are still believed to be trapped beneath the rubble. 
 
And that's why you're seeing this ongoing, significant rescue effort. There are police here. There are paramedics here. You've got the fire department just over here trying to get more water to put out those flames which have been burning now for several hours. These blasts were the result of the so-called kamikaze drones, these Iranian drones that have really been wreaking havoc on the battlefield here in Ukraine for just about a month now. 
 
And while there were at least four explosions of drones that successfully hit targets, though not necessarily the intended targets, Ukrainian authorities are saying that another 15 were intercepted inbound for the capital alone and 26 around the country. So just giving you a sense, Max, of the scale of the battle that Ukrainians are now up against, really using the full power of their air defense systems to try to stop these kamikaze drone attacks and desperately pleading today with the international community to supply more in the way of air defense to help them in the fight against these drones -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: Why do you think we're suddenly getting these attacks on the capital and not on the front lines in the areas they're trying to keep control of? 
 
WARD: So, it's a really interesting question. It started primarily last Monday when you saw that barrage of missile strikes, particularly here in Kyiv. And the goal or the target appears to be civilian infrastructure. Because while I'm showing you the wreckage in the background there of a residential building, there are -- we're right in central downtown Kyiv. There are several key civilian infrastructure buildings right in this area. And so, it seems that Russia is choosing to target more and more those types of facilities. The hope is to maximize the challenge for Ukrainian authorities, especially as we head into the winter, targeting power, targeting heating, things of that nature to make it as painful and uncomfortable as possible for people on the ground here in Ukraine -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: Clarissa, thank you. Back as we get more, of course. Of course, stay safe, as is always the case. Clare, in terms of NATO response here, we're not getting an immediate one, although this has just happened. 
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
But more broadly how are they responding? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, NATO has said it would need
 
 to provide defense systems to Ukraine, which of course as Clarissa was pointing out, have been calling for more in the wake of these strike in Kyiv this morning. But what's also happening this week, Max, starting today is that NATO is carrying out nuclear exercises over northwest Europe involving 14 countries, 60 aircraft, including U.S. B-52 bombers. No live weapons of course, but it's expected that before the end of the month, Russia will also carry out its own nuclear exercises. 
 
These are planned. These are not new, but obviously comes a at a very delicate moment in this conflict when we've seen an uptick in Russian rhetoric around its nuclear capability. Just two weeks when ago Putin announced the annexation of these four territories which continue to be heavily contested. He said he would defend them with all means. Extremely delicate. The U.S. is going to be watching along with its NATO allies for any deviation from the normal behavior from Russia. 
 
FOSTER: When we talk about nuclear weapons, we're talking about tactical smaller ones, aren't we, in case people are worried about large bombs headed in any particular direction. 
 
SEBASTIAN: And I think the thinking among Western officials has been that that would be initially what Russia could do if it was to go down this path of using its nuclear capabilities. There's no evidence. This is something the U.S. has been stressing that they started preparing their nuclear forces. There's no intelligence that they are planning to do this. 
 
But of course, given the rhetoric, they are, you know, really watching very closely in particular when these exercises take place. The national security adviser, Max, over the weekend on CNN's "STATE OF THE UNION," did say that he didn't want there to be any gray areas. That he didn't want anyone to think that any type of nuclear weapons, deployment or any, you know, method of doing it was any less dangerous than any other type. It would still be a nuclear weapon.
 
FOSTER: Clare, thank you. 
 
We're just about three weeks away, meanwhile, from a crucial U.S. midterm election where the battle for Congress is on the line. Democrats are fighting to keep the control of the majority in both the House and the Senate, but their chances could be pretty slim. A CNN Poll of Polls finds Americans are almost evenly divided over which party should control Congress. Analysts say that a Republican red wave is very possible. The Democrat's majority in Congress is very thin with a 50/50 split in the Senate and all 435 seats in the house are up for grabs. 
 
This year, key issues like abortion rights after the Supreme Court's decision Roe versus Wade may tip that scale and the current state of economy with recession worries and inflation skyrocketing remain a top factor. It's a lot to take in with local officials also running. So here 's what you should probably keep an eye on. 
 
There are six states at the center of the race. President Biden flipped five of them or turned them blue in 2020. These states all have multiple races that will determine who takes control of the Senate, the House and State departments -- State governments rather. Meaning what happens in these states will impact the entire country. Early in-person voting starts across several states this week including some of those states that we're very closely watching. 
 
Now polling places will open in just a few hours in Georgia, a state where there are two highly anticipated heated races. First, Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is trying to hold on to his seat against Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Donald Trump and has been engulfed in abortion scandal. Over the weekend Warnock hammered walker in a debate about that, while Walker denied those claims and tied Biden's low approval ratings for his opponent. 
 
And in the governor's race, Democrat Stacey Abrams is challenging Republican Governor Brian Kemp in a repeat of their battle four years ago. Abrams is running on abortion and voting rights. She is behind Kemp in the polls. 
 
In Arizona, Trump endorsed Kari Lake is running for governor. Lake refuses to admit Joe Biden won the 2020 election. Take a listen to what she told CNN's Dana Bash.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
DANA BASH, CO-ANCHOR, CNN STATE OF THE UNION: If leaders like you and President Trump are saying that the election was stolen, aren't you participating, contributing, even causing the idea of people thinking that the election is not safe and secure? 
 
KARI LAKE, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR ARIZONA GOVERNOR: No. We are going to make sure elections are safe and secure for Democrats, independents and Republicans alike. We want to know that our legal vote counted. We want to know that our legal vote counted. We want to know the winner on election night. We don't want to be counting for 10 days.
 
BASH: But isn't it...
 
LAKE: And we want everyone to know, Dana -- Dana... 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BASH: But shouldn't -- don't you want your votes counted in...
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
LAKE: Dana, I have been on the campaign trail.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BASH: Don't you want your votes to be counted, no matter how long it takes, in 2022?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Well, Lake on the right was asked if she would accept defeat against her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs who is also facing criticisms of her own. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH: Let's look forward, then. Will you accept the results of the election in your election? Will you accept the results?
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
LAKE: Can we talk about issues? I came on here thinking we were going to talk about the issues facing Arizonans right now.
 
BASH: We did. Let's talk about the 2022 election. Will you accept the results of your election Ms. Lake?
 
LAKE: I'm running against a twice-convicted racist who cost the state taxpayers $3 million because of her hatred for people of color.
 
BASH: My question is, will you accept the results of your election in November?
 
LAKE: I'm going to win the election, and I will accept that result.
 
BASH: If you lose, will you accept that?
 
LAKE: I'm going to win the election, and I will accept that result.
 
KATIE HOBBS, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR ARIZONA GOVERNOR: Look, Kari Lake has made it clear time and time again that she's not interested in having substantive, in-depth conversations about the issues that matter to Arizonans.
 
BASH: If you think she's as dangerous as you're saying to democracy, is it your responsible as a candidate who wants to run Arizona to show and explain who their alternative is? 
 
HOBBS: That is exactly what I'm doing right now. And there is a lot more ability to have a conversation with you without her interruptions and shouting to do that. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Low public approval ratings, President Biden is hitting the campaign trail trying to boost the prospects of Democratic candidates. CNN Joe Johns has more on that story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: With November's midterm elections looming, the White House says the president will pick up this week where he left off over the weekend, pushing his midterm election messages on the economy, women's reproductive rights as well as social security, Medicare and of course, prescription drugs. The White House says the president is expected to go to events in and around the Washington, D.C. area in the early part of the week that could also include Maryland and Virginia. Then later in the week he is expected to go out to the city of
 
 Pittsburgh as well as Philadelphia where he's expected to attend a reception for John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor there, who is also the Democratic candidate for Senate. His health became an issue when he had a stroke back in May. Also, the Republican candidate in that election is Dr. Mehmet Oz who was endorsed in the primaries by former President Donald Trump. 
 
Joe Johns, CNN, the White House. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: The Oath Keepers trial is now entering a third week. On Friday, prosecutors began connecting messages including cell phone data between the defendants. While prosecutors argue these messages show how defendants conspired to stop the peaceful transfer of power from then President Donald Trump to Joe Biden on January 6th, 2021. Some of these messages included discussions of a civil war and killing politicians. All five defendants have pleaded not guilty to seditious conspiracy charges. 
 
Still to come, we are learning much more about a fire that killed at least eight prisoners inside a notorious prison in Iran. Details just ahead. 
 
In the next gathering of world leaders of the G-20 is a month away, but the talk right now is who Joe Biden won't be meeting with. Stay with us. 
 
And some U.S. states could see rain this week as prolonged drought grips much of the country. 
 
PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: In a few moments we'll talk about the extreme cold in store across parts of the United States. As many as 70 record low temps possible in the coming days. And Upwards of 60 million plus Americans dealing with cold temps in store. Seasons are changing. We'll break it down coming up in a few minutes. 
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: The U.S. Fraternal Order of Police reports 50 officers have been killed by gunfire so far this year. Two of them were killed on Friday in a shootout in Connecticut. A warning the video you're about to see is disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shots fired. Shots fired. More cars. Send everyone. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Officer shot. Officer shot. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Well, the state released this body camera footage from the only officer to leave the shootout alive. Authorities responded to an emergency call at the suspect's residence only to have him fire well over 80 rounds at officers, killing two before the third was able to take the suspect down with one shot. Police say it was a deliberate attempt to lure police to the scene. 
 
Iran's president is accusing U.S. President Joe Biden for fomenting the recent wave of protests following the death of a 22-year-old woman in police custody. Teheran has responded to the protesters by unleashing a brutal and deadly crackdown. 
 
On Friday, President Biden told Iran citizens the U.S. stands with them and called on Tehran to end the violence against its own people. Mr. Biden's remarks sparked an angry response from Iran's president who said the president was inciting chaos. 
 
At the same time, we're learning more about a fire inside an Iranian prison. Iran's state media say eight prisoners have now died and dozens of others were injured in Saturday's blaze. More on this I'm joined by CNN's Nada Bashir. Some criticism of the response but also questions about how it all started. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, absolutely. It is still somewhat unclear exactly what caused this fire. We are hearing different accounts and this is of course a very well-known prison, it's known for the detention of political prisoners, human rights activists, notable writers, professors, lawyers and journalists. And there is significant concern around what caused this fire. 
 
We've already heard over the weekend from the pro-reform news outlet IranWire, which says it has been in touch with sources within the prison who described a revolt taking place on Saturday evening that a fire had subsequently ensued. They've also been in touch with other prisoners who have been speaking to their families. They've been in touch with those family members who have described the use of tear gas within these prison complexes, within the walls against prisoners. Max, some were forced to break their windows just to be able to breathe. So, you can imagine the real sense of chaos taking place there. 
 
But we also heard from Iranian officials speaking over the weekend. 
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
They were very quick to assert that there was no such revolt but that it has been brought quickly under control and they blame the fire on so-called thugs, who had set ablaze to a clothing warehouse on the complex. 
 
But of course, there are still real questions around the verification of these details. CNN isn't able to independently verify what caused the fire. We heard from the husband of Niloufar Hamedi, who is one of the first journalists to report on the death of Mahsa Amini. She was detained and imprisoned shortly after. She described to her husband the chaotic scene. She said it was terrifying, although she was in a different ward from where this fire took place. And of course, as you can imagine, the international community has
 
 expressed concern over this fire. We already heard from the U.S. State Department's spokesperson Ned Price speaking over the weekend saying that the U.S. government is watching what's happening and even with a sense of urgency. 
 
And also, a reminded the Iranian government they are responsible for the safety of foreign nationals detained in the prison. Of course, we also heard from Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser who issued a pretty clear message on the actions and the measures that the U.S. government is taking against the Iranian regime as we continue to see protests up and down the country. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We have sanctioned the so-called morality police. We have sanctioned senior officials who had participated in the brutal crackdown and repression. We've sanctioned the communications minister who is responsible for trying to cut off the internet from Iranians communicating with one another. And then we've taken steps to try to make it easier for brave Iranians the women and citizens of Iran standing up for their dignity to be able to talk to one another and to be able to talk to the world. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: Response we heard from the Iranian president as he no doubt said, blaming the unrest that were seen on U.S. government, on foreign actors. We also heard from the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson in response to this. They said that the Iranian regime is unfazed by any intervention by foreign politicians. And he had said that the U.S. government's cruel sanctions and absurd threats would not be something that the Iranian regime would give into. 
 
But despite that brutal and deadly crackdown that is of course still going on across the last four weeks continues in response to these nationwide protests. These protests are gaining momentum. We are still seeing demonstrations taking place up and down the country. Many, of course, taking place at universities. Students being at the forefront of this movement. But despite the crackdown they are continuing and of course, these were once very much focused on the movement against the repression of women, movement against the severe restrictions of women's rights but this morphed into something much more, looking at regime change according to some protesters. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Nada, thank you. 
 
A drought in the U.S. Midwest is causing the Mississippi river's level to drop significantly in some places. In some areas, hikers are able to walk to islands previously not reachable by foot. The water level has fallen so low in the state of Louisiana that it revealed a shipwreck believed to be from the early 1900s. CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri has more on the weather across the U.S. 
 
JAVAHERI: Yes, good morning, Max. The conditions across parts of the Mississippi River certainly been dire. You notice just how dry this landscape has been. Areas across Arkansas, Jonesboro in particular, just dust devil across that region kind of showing you the arid landscape and of course the Mississippi River you see some of these images where water levels receding quite a bit. 
 
And just got to go back a few months here, July 22 percent of the state of Oklahoma was dealing with drought conditions while about half a percent of Arkansas had experienced drought conditions. Those numbers up to 99 percent of Oklahoma and now 70 percent of Arkansas experiencing drought conditions. So, a dramatic increase in just how dry this landscape has been in recent months. 
 
Good news in the last couple of days, some of the wettest weather in the country, it's not much, but it is some rainfall there across portions of Arkansas, parts of eastern Oklahoma as well, getting in on some beneficial rainfall. So, at least a brief change in here that area. 
 
Now another change in store is going to be the significant cold air for a large area of eastern United States where as many as 70 record temps possible across the eastern United States and 60 million Americans dealing with these temps that could get as low as 18 degrees. It's not unheard of. Of course, we're transitioning into the cold season, but you're going to get a shot of at least wintry temperatures for a couple of days across this region. 
 
You'll notice what happened, as we transition into colder air Tuesday into Wednesday, warmth right back behind it begins to push right back in. The battle, the seesaw trend between warmth and cold this time of year. And in fact, looking ahead to next week, temperatures expected to be well above average across a large area of those exact same spots. Atlanta depicts it well, 76 degrees, drops to 55, climbs right back up to 78 degrees in the course of seven days. So, Max, lots of changes and the seasons are certainly one of them that are changing in the coming days. 
 
FOSTER: Thank you to Pedram. 
 
Now, frightening scenes as a grass fire broke out at a fall festival on a farm in Texas. 
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
No one was injured, but more than 70 vehicles were destroyed. Fire officials believe it started when someone dropped a cigarette on the ground. They're still investigating and looking for whoever was responsible. The area is under a burn ban because of dry conditions. 
 
The British Prime Minister looking to reassure the public that the market in the markets of the economy is in good hands. Still ahead, the efforts to combat the soaring cost of living here in the U.K. 
 
And U.S. gas prices are on their way back to up to $4 a barrel. We'll look at why the Biden administration says it can provide relief for Americans at the pump.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) FOSTER: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM I'm Max Foster. If you're just
 
 joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
Ukrainian officials say Russia carried out at least four attacks in Kyiv with kamikaze drones. The city's mayor says rescue operations are underway at one site were two people remain under rubble and 18 others have been rescued. 
 
And in early in-person voting that will begin in just a few hours in Georgia and in other states later this week with midterm elections just three weeks away. Democrats are hoping to hold on to their majority in both the House and the Senate, but a recent CNN poll shows they have a slim lead ahead of Republicans. 
 
All eyes on the markets this hour. It's just hours to go until the opening bell on Wall Street. We're keeping an eye on the U.S. stock futures and they're all currently up. So, some good news there for Wall Street as it starts the week. 
 
And the new trading day is already under way across Europe. Here is how the markets are faring so far today. They are all up. The FTSE 100 currently up despite concerns ...
