UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The New York Jets select Jaylen Key, a defensive back from Alabama. Good luck, Mr. Irrelevant. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: The Jets making Jaylen Key the final pick of the 2024 draft, a choice which has endeared itself to fans and become known as Mr. Irrelevant. Thankfully, he does not appear to be taking it as a slight, saying afterwards he wants to lean in to every bit of this. 
 
And Fred, magical things can happen when you're drafted last. Just look at Brock Purdy, the 49ers' quarterback who is Mr. Irrelevant in 2022. Since that time, he has led the 49ers to a Conference Championship and a Super Bowl. 
 
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News. 
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. 
 
And now to this breaking news, tensions running high at UCLA as a pair of dueling protests face off on campus. A pro-Israel group is demonstrating against pro-Palestinian protesters. It's just the latest example of nationwide protests over the war in Gaza that have swept through college campuses. 
 
CNN's Camila Bernal is live for us on the campus at UCLA. 
 
Camila, tell us more about these demonstrations as it sounds like it's heating up. 
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Fred, so the event in support of the Jewish students here at UCLA is coming to an end. But as you see here behind me, people are not leaving any time soon and there's still a large group of people. And so you're seeing this side is the side where you see the supporters of the Jewish students. And then if I walk over to this side you're going you see the pro- Palestinian supporters. They are linking hands at trying to stay together as these protests
 
 continue. As I've mentioned throughout the day, they have been violent. There have been altercations, both physical and verbal. We have seen a lot of people with passions very high in terms of what they want to see here. We had the students who have been at the encampment say that they are doing everything they can to get transparency from the university in terms of where their money is invested and divestments. 
 
Now we did see today a lot of people who came in support of Jewish students who say that they feel harassed, that they feel unsafe here on campus. And it's when these two sides collide that you start seeing more of the confrontations and you start seeing the shouting back and forth. And a lot of the pushing. So the sides are trying to stay separate. But again, there are many people who try to get the other side to react. 
 
And we've seen it on both sides of these protests. Everyone trying to stand firm and organizers say they're trying to be peaceful. Take a listen to what people on both sides of this issue told me earlier. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AHMAD HASAN, PALESTINIAN YOUTH MOVEMENT: The community here is just here to support the students who are -- have been keeping this encampment up for days now. They've been applying pressure to the university and the university has not even come to meet their demands yet. So the community is here to make sure that the students' voices get heard on their campus, and that they disclose their financial investments and divest from war, from genocide, and from weapons manufacturers. 
 
ELI TSIVES, FRESHMAN, UCLA: We are for peace. I can tell you that right now. We have come here to demand for the release of our hostages. We are coming here to show them that we're not afraid. The only people that are calling for aggression are the people hiding behind those masks because they are too afraid to show their face. Do you see anyone here with a mask on this side of the protests? No, because we stand with what we believe in. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: So again, you're seeing that passion from both sides here. I also want to point out that we have not seen police officers engaging with the protesters. What you're seeing is these security officers here, men and women who have done a great job trying to keep things under control. The university saying that they're not going to bring in police officers until they feel it is absolutely necessary for the safety of the students. 
 
But I have seen these security officers also get involved because they're trying to push them at times, as people are trying to make their way through these barriers. So, again, they're trying to do the best they can, but it has definitely been tense and violent at many points here throughout the day. You're seeing them more security officers over on this side as they're trying to keep these two sides separated. 
 
It has been extremely difficult for them. Well, you do see L.A. police officer here, but we have not seen a lot of them. Theres not many police officers. We're waiting see what happens, then they're trying to keep these as protests as peaceful as possible. But again, there is a lot of people who are not necessarily being peaceful and who have caused a lot of disruption throughout the day -- Fred. 
 
WHITFIELD: And so I wonder, Camila, is the plan that this is singular, it is today only to have these dueling protests or is there a larger picture, you know, that's coming from the campus on allowing these two sustained protests? 
 <br>[16:05:17]
 
All right. It looks like we've been having some audio problems with Camila. It sounds like she still can't hear me, but that's OK. So she and her team are doing a great job there. These dueling protests there on the UCLA campus. 
 
All right, now to a critical conversation on the war in Gaza, the White House says, President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke earlier today. And it's been quoted that they reiterated a very clear position on the potential invasion of Rafah. 
 
Let's find out what that means from CNN's Priscilla Alvarez at the White House. 
 
Priscilla, tell us what you know. 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we did receive that readout from the call that President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had earlier today where they discussed multiple issues, including this potential operation into Rafah, that is an area that has over a million displaced Palestinians. 
 
It has been a top concern for U.S. officials who do not believe that at this point, given how many people have fled there, it would be tenable for Israel to move in in an operation in that region. And so this was one of the topics of conversation that the two engaged in, and according to the readout, it says, quote, "The leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clear position." 
 
That is a position that National Security Council John Kirby -- National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby offered some insight in earlier today. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: Well, look, I think, again, we have to have a better understanding from the Israelis about what they want to do. As a matter of fact, we've had several staff talks with them. We intend to do that more. They have assured us that they won't go into Rafah until we've had a chance to really share our perspectives and are concerns with them. So we'll see where that goes. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVAREZ: Now, since that interview that the spokesperson had an Israeli official told CNN that preparations are still underway for this potential operation, but there is no doubt that there is still ongoing conversation about if this does happen, what that looks like and whether it happens at all. 
 
Now, of course, the timing of this conversation is important. It comes amid these ongoing hostage talks, which have been a monthslong process. But we saw some developments this week with the president joining 17 leaders from other countries calling on Hamas to release the hostages. It was a rare joint statement. And we also know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed to the region, perhaps in hopes of advancing some of these talks. 
 
So clearly, a lot at top of mind here at the White House. That was part of this conversation between President Biden and the Israeli prime minister earlier today. 
 
WHITFIELD: And Priscilla, more on Antony Blinken's trip. So we know that he was heading to Saudi Arabia. But now we are just now learning that he is likely to make a trip to Israel in this overall Middle East trip. What's the significance of the timing now? 
 
ALVAREZ: That's right. And the secretary has been traveling to Israel multiple times since the October 7th terrorist attacks, but these trips are important because these meetings are happening face to face. They happen in these pivotal moments that they hope are inflection points to move towards a hostage deal, which multiple U.S. officials have been working on and also traveling to the region to work with the other parties to try to find some type of agreement. 
 
So look, the White House is hoping that there will be a deal soon. Of course what they always caution is that it's unclear whether it is finalized until the moment that it is. It can really fall apart at any moment. So we'll see what comes out of that trip. But as you mentioned, Fred, we are learning that he is just adding another stop to this trip overseas. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Priscilla Alvarez, at the White House. Thanks so much. 
 
All right. Coming up, a new tornado watch has just been issued for parts of Texas. One of several states at risk for severe for storms right now. Our team is tracking all of it. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:13:59]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. More on our developing weather story. Four people including an infant have died and more than 50,000 customers are without power across Texas and Oklahoma after a tornado outbreak on Saturday. This outbreak was the latest in a series of storms that first hit the Central Plains on Friday, causing widespread destruction across Nebraska and Iowa. And we're just learning emergency officials in Iowa are reporting one fatality from the storms. 
 
And now a new tornado watch has been issued for parts of Texas. It's one of several states under risk for severe storms that includes more than 50 million people. 
 
Here with me now for the latest is CNN correspondent Rafael Romo and meteorologist Elisa Raffa. 
 
All right, so, Rafael, to you first. What are official say? 
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Fred, in the last couple of hours, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt increased to four the number of storm-related deaths in his state with one county alone reporting at least four injuries, but there could be many more. And officials had earlier said there's an infant among the dead. 
 <br>[16:15:03]
 
The governor said two people died in the city of Ada located about 85 miles southeast of Oklahoma City. A third person died in Marietta, Oklahoma, which is located on Interstate 35, about 115 miles south of Oklahoma City. The fourth person died in Sulfur, a city the governor visited earlier today to assess the damage. 
 
Earlier today, Governor Stitt had declared a state of emergency or an emergency disaster rather in an area that includes Marietta. All together the governor's declaration includes 12 counties. A declaration states that severe storms, tornadoes, straight line winds, hail and flooding affected different parts of Oklahoma. The damage in Sulfur, the governor said, was hard to watch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. KEVIN STITT (R), OKLAHOMA: We got early reports. They think this is an F-4, just kind of blowing right through downtown here and I just haven't seen this much destruction from my time as governor. You just can't believe the destruction. Like it seems like every business in downtown has been destroyed now. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said it has received reports of injuries, property damage, flooding, and downed power lines and trees across several counties. We're also getting new images of severe flooding in the city of Tonkawa located about 90 miles north of Oklahoma City. 
 
And this all happened in the wake of yet another series of powerful storms that left a devastating trail of destruction in Nebraska. An Omaha resident described to CNN affiliate KETV what it was like to hear a tornado coming. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JASON SUNDAY, OMAHA RESIDENT: Just like the movie state, it was like a -- just a freight train. The noise was so loud. I'm not too afraid to admit it. I was crying like a baby because it's just the scariest feeling in the world yet is helpless. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: Elkhorn, Nebraska, was one of the hardest hit areas in the state, and Fred, and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen said, this weekend, it is a miracle there were no deaths. 
 
WHITFIELD: I mean, it's extraordinary, but, you know, they're still -- I mean, this has been an incredible system because there's more coming. 
 
ROMO: Right. 
 
WHITFIELD: Elisa Raffa is here with more about that. 
 
ELISA RAFFA, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, new tornado watch has just issued since the last time I saw you. You've got the storm stretching up to Omaha where they're still recovering from Friday's storms and then the line of storms stretches south. This is where we have that new tornado watch. It's in Eastern Texas. It's just outside of Austin, San Antonio and Houston, kind of in that area right between. 
 
Right now it does not include the city centers, but we are looking at storms, just really blowing up. We've got multiple tornado warnings in effect right now where we've got some storms that are spinning. The atmosphere in this area is refueling, it's recharging, and it is allowing these storms to blow up once again. 
 
So here's the risk for today. It stretches from De Moines down to Houston. You see that orange bulls' eye, that's that level three out of five enhanced risk. That's where we could find the threat for a couple of more tornadoes. The tennis ball-sized hail and 70-mile-per- hour winds, just incredible, plus the heavy rain. You saw some of those pictures of cars and undated in Oklahoma. Flash flooding continues to be a threat in that same area. 
 
So storms blow up as we go through the day today. They could organize into a line that would bring you that damaging wind threat and it continues to push east as we go into Monday. This coming after an incredibly active 48 hours, nearly 120, tornado reports, a lot of damage to go through to figure out how many tornadoes and what the damage looks like and how strong the tornadoes are. 
 
Like I said, there's that risk for today. A lot of the same areas under the gun, just a little bit farther to the east. And when you look at all the warnings that were issued in the last 48 hours, it is remarkable. In Omaha that weather service office issued 42 warnings on Friday. That is the most that they have ever issued in a single day. 
 
Yesterday, Norman, Oklahoma, did the same thing, 59 warnings. That was the most that they had ever issued for their office as well. And we've heard so much, especially from the people in Omaha how it's really saved countless lives. So if you see those warnings today where you're at in eastern Texas, or really anywhere, just take them seriously because we have seen it this weekend at (INAUDIBLE). 
 
WHITFIELD: It's really important. This is a pretty aggressive season so far. 
 
All right. Elisa Raffa, thank you so much. And Rafael Romo, appreciate it. 
 
All right. Still to come, new CNN polling found that more than 60 percent of voters saying Biden's tenure as president has been a failure. What that means for his reelection campaign, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:24:05]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had a great stretch since the State of the Union but Donald has had two tough days lately. You might call it stormy weather. What the hell? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, boy. All right, that was President Biden poking fun at Donald Trump's legal troubles during last night's White House Correspondents' Dinner. 
 
Joining me right now to talk about this and more Scott Jennings. He is a CNN senior political commentator and a former special assistant to President George W. Bush. Also with me, Ashley Allison, a CNN political commentator and a former White House senior policy adviser under President Obama. 
 
Great to see you both. 
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Hey. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Where are you up late last night? 
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Good to be here. 
 
WHITFIELD: A little tucker this morning? 
 
ALLISON: Yes. 
 
WHITFIELD: I know. It was fun to watch and I'm sure even more fun for those who were there. 
 
All right. So, Scott, to you first, you know, the president has avoided commenting on the trials that Trump has been enduring when asked by reporters. 
 <br>[16:25:07]
 
So instead he took this opportunity. How do you assess President Biden's attempt at making light of Trump's legal problems at the dinner? 
 
JENNINGS: Yes. Well, I think he gave a short which was smart, but really partisan speech. It was -- usually you don't get that out of the president at these things, but he went right after his opponent, called him by his first name. And then I think the comedian Colin Jost largely followed along and, you know, sort of kid gloves with Biden and went harder after Trump. 
 
So if you're the Biden people, what did you get out of last night? You got, you know, Biden was pretty well received on his remarks. Jost then endorses Biden, so, overall, I suspect they judge this to be, you know, a successful night. People in Washington, D.C. laughing it up with the president. The elite from Hollywood laughing it up with the president, I guess, I guess that's his constituency. 
 
WHITFIELD: OK. Well, Ashley, I mean, the president also made a little fun at himself. I mean, he poked fun at his age by taking a lighthearted approach, you know, to such a sensitive topic, usually, on the campaign trail and in everyday life. I mean, is that the right way for Biden to kind of, you know, break the ice on something that just is not going away? 
 
ALLISON: I think the president did a really good job yesterday. He did take a couple of jabs at himself and others, and I think Colin did as well. I think comedy, there's truth in all of it, and that's what is so unique about the dinner, is that you can bring comedy to the actual issues that are plaguing the American people. 
 
And so we all know the issues that people are talking about, particularly the president's age. And he is not ashamed of how old he is and his experience. And so whether it was a State of the Union, even last year, he did some jokes about himself and his age. And this year is no different. You can't hide from that fact. And so why not meet it head on and make a joke about it, turn into business? 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Well, that's the fun stuff. And now the other stuff that the White House may not be really laughing about. The CNN polling, a new CNN poll showing Donald Trump sustaining his lead over President Biden in the lead up to the 2024 election. They're in a head-to-head race according to this polling, 49 percent of registered voters say they would pick Trump for president compared to 43 percent for Biden. 
 
Add in third party candidates, and Trump's lead jumps even more. Trump with 42 percent to Biden's 33 percent. And Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., well, he gets 16 percent of the vote. 
 
So, Scott, I mean, this must give, you know, Trump and Republicans some encouragement. Sometimes you don't want to embrace the polling, but this one they might. 
 
JENNINGS: It was all fun and games last night and then they woke up this morning with this hangover, and had to pick up this polling. I mean, the number that jumped off the page to me was 33 percent. You put all the candidates in, all the third parties, and the sitting president of the United States down to 33 percent. He's closer to 25 than he is 45 right now. I mean, this must have alarm bells going off. 
 
What is interesting about the poll and what's really plaguing Biden is that you have two presidents that people are experiencing and one they can remember. And they're comparing them and people are judging in our survey the Trump presidency to be successful for them personally and the Biden presidency to be a failure, and the Biden people have not yet found a way to argue that poll result into something else. 
 
You see it time and again, people thought they were better off under Trump than they are under Biden. That may be the crux of this campaign. Can the Biden folks find a way to convince people that no, my president is more successful than Trump's? They have failed at that so far. 
 
WHITFIELD: So, Ashley, last night the White House may have gone to bed, you know, on a high after the White House Correspondents' Dinner. And do you think this polling, you know, is sobering? Do you think it's invoking some real fear or concern? 
 
ALLISON: I think the campaign and the White House understand where they are in the polling and they should not ignore it. Again, I am somewhat skeptical in polls in how people and the questions that you ask to get the results, but you can't ignore it. And this is a real challenge. No one in the campaign world, whether it's directly working with Biden or other social justice groups that are doing work to defend democracy think that this election is going to be easy. 
 
There is a messaging challenge that the Biden campaign does have to figure out because when you actually sit down and have a conversation with a voter, and you remind them, where you were four years ago and where you are now, when you dig a little deeper, they do think that their life is better now than under President Trump. But there is some nostalgia that I think the campaign needs to go directly at, remind people where we were. 
 
We were all trapped in our house because of COVID. Donald Trump did a terrible job handling that. Many communities felt under attack every day. Somebody else he would target, sometimes twice in one day, and we can't forget that. And so this campaign is going to be about issues, but the Biden campaign needs to take it directly to Donald Trump. The president did that a little bit in his speech, and I think the campaign will continue to do that.
 <br>[16:30:14]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, we'll leave it there for now. Thank you so much, Scott Jennings, Ashley Allison, appreciate it. 
 
JENNINGS: Thank you.
 
ALLISON: Thank you. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Coming up, the new warning from the World Health Organization on the global crisis -- the global rise in measle cases.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:35:10] WHITFIELD: All right, the number of measles' cases reported around the world nearly doubled last year to more than 300,000, according to the World Health Organization. The highly-contagious airborne disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000.
 
Well, today, the rapid rise in case -- in cases, poses a threat to the disease's elimination status. More than 100 cases have been reported in the U.S. so far this year, which is the highest number since 2019.
 
Measles can lead to serious health consequences or death, especially for young and unvaccinated kids.
 
And a second journalist has now been arrested in Russia for allegedly preparing content for the "Navalny Live" channel on YouTube. A channel associated with the late opposition leader, Sergey Karelin, is accused of participation in an extremist organization. That's how it's being classified.
 
These are the same charges faced by another Russian journalist arrested Saturday. Karelin worked for a number of outlets, including "The Associated Press." A photo shows him Saturday sitting in a glass cage in a Russian court.
 
Conspiracy theories and online misinformation are affecting this year's presidential campaign, including the rise of Christian nationalism in politics.
 
Here's a preview of tonight's newest episode of "THE WHOLE STORY," where CNN's Donie O'Sullivan does a deep dive into a conspiracy theory about Taylor Swift and the 2024 race.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): By now, everyone knows Taylor Swift is a government psyop. You don't believe Taylor Swift is a government psyop?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know what to believe about Taylor Swift.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): This is Joe Black.
 
(on camera): CNN.
 
JOE BLACK, VOTER: That's what we thought.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Yes.
 
BLACK: Are you guys going to cover it accurately?
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): I met Joe at a Trump rally in Las Vegas back in January. 
 
(on camera): Well, it's CNN.
 
BLACK: Yes.
 
O'SULLIVAN: You don't think it's accurate?
 
BLACK: Not really. I think you guys do sound bites.
 
O'SULLIVAN: You think Trump won last time, I take it?
 
BLACK: I do firmly believe that there was some election interference. 
 
O'SULLIVAN: Enough that it lost them the election? 
 
BLACK: Absolutely. And all people have to do is a little research to figure it out.
 
Hello.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Hey, Joe, how're you doing? 
 
(voice-over): I stayed in touch with Joe after Vegas. I wanted to find out more about why Joe doesn't trust someone like me, a journalist from the so-called mainstream media. So, we went to visit him in Grand Junction, Colorado.
 
(on camera): Here we are.
 
BLACK: In Grand Junction.
 
O'SULLIVAN: What happened to what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?
 
BLACK: Yes, why didn't you stay there? 
 
O'SULLIVAN: Some guys come home from Vegas with a new bride. You come back from Vegas with a bunch of CNN guys.
 
BLACK: Everybody makes mistakes.
 
O'SULLIVAN: So, if you want to find out what's going on in the world just right now today, what do you do? 
 
BLACK: I check out different platforms that I feel that I can trust.
 
O'SULLIVAN: One being Telegram? 
 
BLACK: Telegram is definitely one.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Yes.
 
(voice-over): Telegram is a platform first developed in Russia that has very few rules.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: All right, we've got some more breaking news coming in in "THE SITUATION ROOM" right now.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President's Twitter account has been suspended. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLACK: I feel like that's an insult to people to not be able to look at information and to discern it themselves. They're basically calling that person stupid.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Telegram surged in popularity after the January sixth attack, when major social media platforms cracked down on conspiracy theories, and banned people like Trump and banned some of his supporters like Joe.
 
BLACK: I turned on my phone one day, and, all of a sudden, it's been deactivated.
 
O'SULLIVAN: How does that feel? 
 
BLACK: It was horrible. I like Facebook. You know, I've got a Social Marketplace. You can do business. You can find things. So, it's like being cut off of a part of life.
 
O'SULLIVAN: So, what's a channel you follow on Telegram, if I'm going to see some of the news for today? 
 
BLACK: My favorite one, it's called Patriot Memes.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): I visited Joe a couple of weeks before the Super Bowl. It was just as the conspiracy theory that Taylor Swift was helping rate the game (ph) to help Biden started circulating online. It was one of the first things that popped up on Joe's feed.
 
BLACK: Let's go to something that's like news, though.
 
O'SULLIVAN (on camera): Yes. So, this is from Benny -- 
 
BLACK: This is from Benny Johnson.
 
O'SULLIVAN: -- Johnson.
 
(voice-over): By now, everyone knows Taylor Swift as a government psyop and this is exactly why corporate media is having a meltdown about it.
 
(on camera): You don't believe Taylor Swift is a government psyop?
 
BLACK: I don't know what to believe about Taylor Swift. It's good to keep your mind open. Could she be? Could she not be? Because we're a few weeks from the Super Bowl.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Yes.
 
BLACK: And they're seeking the endorsement from Taylor Swift.
 
O'SULLIVAN: They are, yes. Yes.
 <br>[16:40:00]
 
BLACK: They, the Biden Administration. And then, who's going to win the Super Bowl?
 
O'SULLIVAN: I'd call that a conspiracy theory, OK?
 
BLACK: Sure, yes. 
 
O'SULLIVAN: What I find most difficult to believe about the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce Super Bowl conspiracy theory is that you think the Democrats could be so organized to pull all this off? 
 
BLACK: Very organized.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Do you think?
 
BLACK: I do, yes.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Rigging that together (ph) as well as rigging the Super Bowl, and Taylor's going to back Biden for president. That's just so much stuff. Like, that is so much organization. But -- 
 
BLACK: Not that hard to do.
 
O'SULLIVAN: You don't think?
 
BLACK: No.
 
O'SULLIVAN: Yes.
 
BLACK: Rigging the election, that would be a lot more complicated. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: All so interesting. Be sure to tune in to an all-new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY" with Anderson Cooper, airing tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, only on CNN.
 
All right, up next. He was considered one of the fastest men in the MLB but disqualifying for their pension by one single day. Now, former Atlanta Braves' outfielder, Gary Cooper, is hoping that could change. He joins me live, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:45:51]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. In 1975, the Atlanta Braves drafted Gary Cooper, an outfielder once considered one of the fastest men in baseball. He spent 42 days with the team. Cooper was then sent to the minor leagues, missing the threshold for earning an MLB pension by one day. He appealed it twice but was rejected.
 
Fans are now hoping a change.org petition will help Cooper get a one- day contract with the braves so that he can get his pension. Joining me right now is Gary Cooper.
 
Mr. Cooper, great to see you.
 
GARY COOPER, FORMER OUTFIELDER, ATLANTA BRAVES (via Webex): Thank you, ma'am.
 
WHITFIELD: So, what are your emotions, knowing that more than 15,000 people have signed that petition, supporting your effort for just one more day in the major leagues? 
 
COOPER: It's explainable. It's why -- you know, it's overjoy.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, you're getting a lot of love and a lot of attention. I know you were -- also had your, you know, hall of fame moment in Savannah last year. People have been, you know, hoping that this day will come. 
 
I know you've, kind of, replayed in your mind, right, all these years, you know, what happened? You were celebrated as one of the fastest outfielders people can remember.
 
After being drafted in the third round in 1975 to qualify for mandatory MLB pension. You've got to be in the league 43 days. So, then, on your, you know, 43rd day, the game was rained out. I mean, do you remember, at that time, what you were thinking or even thinking about pension or what was at stake?
 
COOPER: No, it never really crossed my mind, you know, that -- no, I -- from my thought, any time you play in a major league, you can play one day, you can get a pension. You know, and that's what was I was told. And I was thinking of that for the last, oh, since I left MLB.
 
And then, when I did file for my pension, they said I was a day short. I couldn't understand because it was a rainout and the season still was on. The season wasn't over until October the fifth and I'd still be on the Major League roster.
 
This was, like -- you know, it's just crazy how the time changed.
 
WHITFIELD: That has to be so incredibly disappointing, you know? And that really hurts, doesn't it? So, after --
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: -- that rainout, yes, you went to the Minor Leagues. So, that 43 MLB game or day never came. So, what has life been like without that pension? 
 
COOPER: It was up and down, mostly down, you know. But -- you know, but I just keep one foot ahead and just keep moving.
 
And one day I decided to talk about it. It was me and Mr. Jonas. I said, Robert, man, I was trying to apply for my pension, and they say I was short. You know, like, I was told I only needed one day to get a pension and that was 43 days.
 
But I had my 43 days as I'd still be on the roster, you know? I remember the day it rained, September 29, 1980. You know, and I decided to apply for it, and I got denied twice. (INAUDIBLE.) But that stayed in my mind about that one day.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
COOPER: And anybody that I've talked to, you know, there's -- but I remember the old -- the Major League Player Association executive director, Mr. Marvin Miller, which he passed, he came to spring training at West Palm Beach in 1980. And he explained to us, it don't take but one day to get your pension. You know, and I -- it's something a whole lot, you know, different. You know?
 <br>[16:50:00]
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. Yes, it certainly doesn't sound fair. Like you said, you were on the roster. You were there, you know, for the game on the roster on that 43rd day.
 
So, then, I'm wondering if you could, you know, help people understand. You know, how would an MLB pension change or reshape your life today?
 
COOPER: Oh, it would, you know, really help with -- you know, if it happened. You know, and I'm just hoping and praying, you know, it does. You know, and -- I had one other guy I played with and he asked me, Mr. Coop -- he said, Coop, you done got your money? And, you know, I thought he was talking about Social Security. I said, man, I ain't at that age yet.
 
He said, man, you played Major League Baseball. You're supposed to get a paycheck. I got mine. You know, he only played a year. But he gets his up to now, as we speak. You know? I'm just hoping I -- you know, it happened and, like I said, I'm just hoping and praying. You know, and I hope, you know, that something that will break. But I feel like something is going to happen and come out of this.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, I love your optimism. Yes, you have tried to appeal twice, you know, without success. And now, there is this petition, 15,000 signatures thus far. Hopefully -- and I, you know, surely you'll be getting more because a lot of folks are still talking about it and thinking and hoping the best for you. 
 
Gary Cooper, I hope -- I hope that the luck changes, right? I hope things change for you and you're able to get some more affirmative, positive, you know, response from your ongoing requests.
 
COOPER: Thanks much.
 
WHITFIELD: Gary Cooper --
 
COOPER: I sure would like --
 
WHITFIELD: I'm sorry, go ahead, Gary.
 
COOPER: I said, I appreciate you all having me on.
 
WHITFIELD: Well, so glad you could be available. Thank you so much. And, of course, CNN has contacted the Braves for comment. The team has not responded. The MLB says they are unable to comment. And the Players Association says they won't comment. We'll let you know if we hear anything otherwise.
 
We'll be right back.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The two lookouts on duty at the time in the crow's nest were Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was what the lookouts described as a slight haze all around the horizon. That's called a refraction haze. And that delayed the sighting of the iceberg.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They didn't see the iceberg until they were just practically right upon it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It kind of rose up out of the ocean.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The lookouts described it as a dark mass that came through that haze.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They realized it was an iceberg and rang the warning bell, three rings on the bell for an obstacle directly ahead. And then, telephoned the bridge.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fleet called down and said, iceberg dead ahead.

JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is your captain speaking to the woman he loves. Prepare for turbulence, the emotional kind.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated): On today's flight, there is a very special person. 
 
MOOS: lot Polish Airlines pilot, Conrad Hans, was referring to his flight attendant girlfriend, Paula. A year and a half ago --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I met the most wonderful person that completely changed my life. 
 
MOOS: He met her on a flight to Krakow, Poland. So, on a similar flight to Krakow, the pilot, with eyes brimming (ph), let fly the question.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are my greatest dream come true. This is why I have to ask you a favor. Honey, will you marry me?
 
MOOS: It had all the trappings of a rom-com.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Yes. Yes, she will marry you.
 
MOOS: And, yes, the flight attendant will marry the pilot.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): Of course I will. I don't know if this is the right hand for this.
 
MOOS: In the golden age of flying, flight attendants once parted the waters.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I should've been a pilot.
 
MOOS: LOT Polish Airlines posted the video on Facebook. Commenters posted romantic gifts. Love is in the air. Although the plane was actually on the ground the entire proposal. But these two were walking on clouds with or without the airplane.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come fly with me. Let's fly. Let's fly away.
