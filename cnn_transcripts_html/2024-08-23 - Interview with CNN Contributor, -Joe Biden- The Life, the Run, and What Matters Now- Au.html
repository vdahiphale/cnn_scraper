BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone, and welcome to "Amanpour." Here's what's coming up.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Together, let us write the next great chapter in the most 
 
 extraordinary story.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA:  Kamala Harris' big moment. The VP takes center stage in her quest to become America's first female president.
 
Then, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison talks to Walter Isaacson about the historic week in Chicago and the challenges Democrats face ahead of November.
 
Plus, where Broadway meets the internet. I speak to the talents behind the hit play "Job," a tense thriller about the digital world wreaking havoc in 
 
 our lives.
 
Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour.
 
Well, in the end, history may have been made in record time. Just over one month since President Biden reluctantly dropped out of the race, Kamala 
 
 Harris has become the first woman of color to become a major party's presidential nominee.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  On behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on 
 
 their own unlikely journey, on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one 
 
 another, on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the 
 
 United States of America.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA:  But amidst the euphoria on display among Democrats this week, there has been a tangible strain of caution threaded throughout the DNC. 
 
 Speaker after speaker reminded viewers that the race will be close, with polls showing that it's still a tossup.
 
So, what did last night's speech teach us about how the rest of this story -- this short campaign will play out and what do the Republicans need to do 
 
 to recapture the momentum? Let's get some insight from Evan Osnos who wrote an acclaimed biography of President Joe Biden. Welcome to the program from 
 
 Chicago, Evan. It is good to see you.
 
You know, we had our show meeting this morning and we all joked, but I think there's some seriousness to this, that this has been a year that 
 
 actually has been just a month. I mean, it has been insane what has happened in just the course of four weeks. I'm wondering if you've ever 
 
 experienced something quite like this in your career.
 
EVAN OSNOS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, AUTHOR, "JOE BIDEN: THE LIFE, THE RUN, AND WHAT MATTERS NOW" AND STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER:  No, we're doing 
 
 politics and history at light speed at this point, Bianna. I mean, it's -- it is really just sort of staggering to think how different this convention 
 
 might have been had Joe Biden still been the nominee. I think you saw at the beginning of the week, a tremendous outpouring of gratitude to him, not 
 
 only for the foundation upon which now Kamala Harris is building this last 70 days of the campaign.
 
But also, let's be honest, it's also for him stepping aside for making that rarest of political choices to give up power. And just the sheer pace of 
 
 that transformation and everything that it implies about how you run against Republicans, how Donald Trump will respond, it has all been turned 
 
 upside down.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And while Donald Trump has been depicting Kamala Harris as not only aligned with the Biden campaign and all the flaws that they've been 
 
 elaborating on that they say emanated from this administration, but also, he's trying to paint her as a communist, socialist, radical leftist.
 
And last night and this week, I would say, we've really seen from all of those who we heard from and then ending with Kamala Harris herself 
 
 describing herself as the change candidate, but also the moderate candidate who is the sane candidate of these two. Do you think she was effective in 
 
 doing that?
 <br>[13:05:00]
 
OSNOS:  It was very noticeable, Bianna, that essentially, the portrait that she was presenting of herself and of the party was in stark contrast to 
 
 what is increasingly a set of policy positions that Trump and J. D. Vance hold that are just wildly out of step with where Americans are.
 
Take last night the way she talked about abortion and reproductive rights, the idea that Republicans would come in and institute the plans they've 
 
 talked about that would require a child, a victim of rape or sexual abuse to have to carry a child's term because of where they live and things like 
 
 that, it just strikes people as offensive to how we perceive our system to work.
 
And I think the subtle subtext, and in some cases, the explicit goal was to say to people, I have lived a life like yours, I live a life like yours 
 
 today, I have a blended family. We are a story of America that is relatable and that we are not operating in some esoteric world of ideology and policy 
 
 that feels that feels unapproachable.
 
And, you know, I think that you -- there was a powerful clip that you ran earlier, just a moment ago, about how she said, together we will turn a 
 
 page to write, essentially, a new chapter in the American story. That's three big ideas. Together, one, is a very unifying concept. She's not just 
 
 speaking to Democrats. In fact, she never mentioned the Democratic Party in her speech. She talked about America over and over again. She also said 
 
 this is an American story, reclaiming, in a sense, the idea that a Democratic candidate can speak on behalf of America and patriotic values.
 
And then, of course, the key idea is a new chapter. You know, this is not only just a reference to Donald Trump as sort of a return to the experience 
 
 we all had four years ago, but also, a recognition that by supplanting Joe Biden on the ticket, that she has really begun this process of a new 
 
 generation stepping in.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And we've seen a slight refocus from her campaign as opposed to what we saw with Biden's campaign really focusing on democracy. It seems 
 
 that Kamala Harris is more focused on freedom and specifically reproductive rights for women. And that's -- the way she characterized Donald Trump, not 
 
 necessarily as a threat to democracy. she called him an unserious man who could do serious harm to the country, given some of his policies, 
 
 specifically as it relates to freedoms, including freedoms for women and reproductive rights. I want to play some sound for you from what she said 
 
 about that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS:  He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. Simply put, they 
 
 are out of their minds.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA:  What do you make of that strategy? We heard it from the Obamas in a sense too, mocking Donald Trump. Kamala Harris saying he's not a 
 
 serious person, calling the Republicans at his agenda and his strategy they're out of their minds. Do you think that's going to work?
 
OSNOS:  You know, this idea of using freedom as a central -- as the central idea of the campaign, in fact, does predate Kamala Harris' rolled the top 
 
 of the ticket. In fact, if you go back and you listen to the very first word in the first ad that Joe Biden ran in this campaign, the first word 
 
 was freedom. There was this feeling among his political advisers that this was an opportunity for Democrats because of these kinds of intrusions into 
 
 private life that Americans were seeing from Republicans.
 
But the truth is, and this is -- gets to the core of the political moment we're in now, the messenger matters as much as the message. And when it 
 
 comes from Kamala Harris, the way in which she can talk about abortion with a full-throated sense of credibility on the question, in a way that Joe 
 
 Biden frankly could not, it is more powerful, and it has just landed very differently with the public.
 
And, you know, I think it is not as much about raising the sense of alarm about Donald Trump, that is still very much a part of her message, but 
 
 she's actually saying to Americans that it is OK to laugh at this man. It is OK to say that he's not normal to say that he's weird, to use the term 
 
 we've all been hearing for weeks now. That has turned out to be very powerful combination to point out both the unseriousness of the person and 
 
 the seriousness of the consequences.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And that seems to really have gotten under Trump's skin. He still hasn't been able to find an effective attack on Kamala Harris on this 
 
 ticket yet and flailing, really? I mean, you have his advisers who are really desperate for him to stay on message and focus on the policies and 
 
 specifics, and he still is looking for that lane to where he can go on the personal attack, and it's not working in the way that it may have in the 
 
 past.
 <br>[13:10:00]
 
I also noticed this week, and I'm not the only one, a difference in how Democrats are embracing patriotism and joy and the future of the country. 
 
 You saw many nights where you -- there were chants repeatedly USA, you heard Kamala Harris talk about how exceptional this country is, and yes, 
 
 there are still problems that need to be addressed, but only in this country could the daughter of two immigrants now be the candidate for the 
 
 Democratic Party for president.
 
And Peggy Noonan even picked up on it today. She said, they still, traditional Republican themes of faith and patriotism and claimed their -- 
 
 claim them as their own. How do you think that's going to be viewed specifically among those targeted voters, the undecided, and the 
 
 independents?
 
OSNOS:  Yes, it's turned out to be really an important theme here. I had a conversation with somebody on the sidelines of the convention who is 
 
 looking at voter attitudes, studying focus groups, doing polls. And what she said was that there was this reservoir of energy of people particularly 
 
 out in these suburban areas who felt as if patriotism had been taken from them, there was a monopoly on it. The language of patriotism on the right.
 
And instead of being able to fly an American flag at your house and saying, look, I am doing this on behalf of a centrist position or a center left 
 
 position, it had almost been sort of weaponized by the Trump MAGA Republican movement. That's how it was being described.
 
And so, there was this effort to reach out and say, we can turn how that feels. And, you know, you're hearing from Republicans, and you saw some of 
 
 them up on the stage during the Democratic Convention, these are Republicans like Adam Kinzinger who, after all, has spent, you know, 12 
 
 years in Congress as a Republican saying out -- reaching out explicitly to his fellow Republicans and saying to vote for a Democrat this year is not 
 
 to betray your values. It is, in fact, to cement your values and to do an act of patriotism. That's a theme that it turns out to have been available 
 
 but hasn't been taken up until just now and is proving powerful.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And finally, Evan, a really touching display of gratitude and appreciation for Joe Biden Monday night. We heard from the president as 
 
 well, we saw the embrace and the chemistry between he and Kamala Harris, telling him how much she loves him and how much she appreciates everything 
 
 that he has done.
 
What are you hearing in terms of how he is doing right now and how he sees the next five months for him? I know he's on vacation in California with 
 
 his family now.
 
OSNOS:  You know, that was an important moment, I think, both for him personally and then, also for the party in a way to make vivid this 
 
 transition from him now and to her. Look, privately, personally, this is a very difficult time for him. I mean, as one of his -- somebody who's very 
 
 close to him said to me, the truth is, he's still sort of flummoxed about how things turned out the way they did.
 
And that goes back to something we talked about at the very beginning, which is how fast this is all transpired. Remember two months ago, of 
 
 course, he was going to be the nominee and they were all planning for that. So, he is still at this moment trying to come to terms with it.
 
He is aware of the idea that perhaps people think that he's angry, they're pushing back a bit against that. Somebody described him to me as 
 
 disappointed, but not depressed. And I think that is, in some ways, the combination of experiences and it'll take time, as he knows from having 
 
 lost in his life, to be able to begin to see this with some perspective.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Indeed. Evan Osnos, thank you so much for joining us once again. What a year this month has been. Thank you.
 
OSNOS:  Thank you. Thanks, Bianna.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Well, now, when the DNC kicked off on Monday, party chairman Jaime Harrison was first at the podium. The South Carolina native reflected 
 
 on the moment, writing on Twitter, only in America could a round headed boy raised by a single mother end up gaveling in a historic convention to 
 
 nominate our first black woman president.
 
Well, Harrison, you may recall, burst onto the national scene in 2020 when he launched a surprisingly competitive Senate campaign against Lindsey 
 
 Graham. Walter Isaacson spoke to Harrison about the week that was, and what challenges his party faces between now and November.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WALTER ISAACSON, CO-HOST, AMANPOUR AND CO.:  Thank you, Bianna. And Chairman Jaime Harrison, welcome to the show.
 
JAIME HARRISON, DNC CHAIR:  Thank you so much for having me.
 
ISAACSON:  Congratulations. It was a pretty crisp, clear convention with a whole lot of themes. And let me go through them. One of them was freedom. 
 
 He used the Beyonce song, the John Batiste song. Every speaker hit it. It was a shift from the theme of democracy that Joe Biden was using. Important 
 
 theme, but sort of a less personal one. Tell me about the shift to the theme of freedom.
 <br>[13:15:00]
 
HARRISON:  Well, freedom, is just -- you know, that's what we're fighting for in this country. And we have seen a full fronted assault on the 
 
 freedoms of the American people. I mean, you take a look at women in this country. For the first time in 50 years, women don't have the freedom to 
 
 control their own bodies all across this country.
 
You know, I'm 48, and all of my life, up until just a few years ago, we've been gaining more freedoms in this country. You know, folks gaining the 
 
 right to vote, because all of us did not always have it. My grandparents did not always have it. Women gaining the right to control their own 
 
 bodies. And for the first time, because of Donald Trump and the people that he appointed to the Supreme Court, and because of the Roberts Supreme 
 
 Court, those freedoms have been ripped away. The Voting Rights Act gutted under Roberts. Roe versus Wade destroyed under Roberts.
 
And then, you hear in the dictum of some of these opinions from folks like Clarence Thomas that said, we're not done in terms of going after other 
 
 freedoms. And that's why we had to -- Democrats had to move forward in terms of marriage equality. Because Clarence Thomas and his yoke were 
 
 talking about going right at that particular freedom that has been gained over the course of the past few years.
 
So, freedom is a really, really, important component. And it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat, Republican or independent. America is built on 
 
 freedom. And we need -- and somebody has to protect it. We don't see that protection coming from the Republicans that we see an assault on and 
 
 Democrats are going to be those joyful warriors, those hopeful warriors that will do everything within our power to protect America's freedom.
 
ISAACSON:  You know, one of the things I noticed last night as I'm sitting there in the hall seemed somewhat unusual for my days of covering 
 
 Democratic Conventions, everybody had an American flag, people chanting USA, the flag's marching down, the speakers are all talking about USA and 
 
 patriotism. Tell me about the decisions you all made to recapture the notion of the flag, the country, and patriotism.
 
HARRISON:  Well, it's important to understand, you know, when you say that you support the United States of America, then that means supporting what 
 
 our constitution says, supporting what the Declaration says. We have had and heard from Donald Trump, his own words, not mine, that he wants to be a 
 
 dictator on day one. That he's OK with ignoring and sometimes pushing off the constitution of these United States.
 
Joe Biden said this also clearly, you can't just love this country only when you win. This is about loving America all the time. And the Democratic 
 
 Party looks like America. We represent the diversity and the strength and the values of this country. We believe that everybody, everybody, 
 
 regardless of your race, your religion, who you love, how you love, how you identify yourself, should live, be able to live their American dream. I 
 
 can't say that for the other side.
 
You look at Donald Trump, look at that convention where you saw -- our convention, where you saw such unity, some happiness, and joy. I mean, it 
 
 was like a big family reunion, right? People are dancing, they're crying, they're hugging. You look at the Republican Convention, these people had 
 
 signs chanting for mass deportation. This country built by immigrants, right? So, that's the stark contrast right now between the parties. They're 
 
 doom and gloom and fear. We're hope and joy. And I think hope and joy beats doom and fear every time.
 
ISAACSON:  Another thing that struck me, which seemed different from some previous Democratic Conventions, was the emphasis last night in particular 
 
 on national security. Having veterans in the party up there. Having Leon Panetta as sort of an unexpected, in some ways, primetime speaker, with one 
 
 of the toughest speeches on the need for American defense, and the vice president said it herself in her acceptance speech.
 
Tell me how you were thinking through the need to project that a woman, like Kamala Harris, we've never elected a woman before, can be a commander-
 
 in-chief strong on national defense and the military?
 
HARRISON:  Well, you know, one of the things that we were thinking is, listen, we knew how strong the VP is, and I think a lot of world leaders 
 
 know how strong the VP is. And we wanted to make sure that we demonstrated that. This is someone who is respected on the world stage.
 <br>[13:20:00]
 
You remember early on in this administration when there was some friction because of, you know, contract -- submarine contract with Australia and 
 
 France. Well, you know, Kamala Harris early on in this administration was seen as an emissary to soothe over some of the frustrations over in France. 
 
 And she and the president of France have now become very close, and she actually helped to rebuild and strengthen that relationship with this ally 
 
 that has been an ally for such a long time.
 
And so, she's met with hundreds of world leaders. This president is extremely strong, but she's also very empathetic. She understands -- you 
 
 know, she comes -- she's a progeny of immigrants. And she understands the hardships and the struggles that some face in many countries.
 
Her visit to Africa didn't get a lot of coverage. But it was so amazing to see and to witness, particularly as a black man. And so, I can't wait to 
 
 see her on that stage as our commander-in-chief because she's going to be strong, but she's also going to have a heart and understand the trials and 
 
 tribulations that so many face.
 
ISAACSON:  You know, as party chair you had to make a pretty strong pivot about four and a half weeks ago. Suddenly you're planning for this 
 
 convention of renominating Joe Biden and, boom, you got something totally different. Tell me about that pivot, what you all scrambled to do to change 
 
 the convention.
 
HARRISON:  Well, you know, some of it wasn't really a big pivot, to be quite honest, because when you think about it, in 2020, Joe Biden and 
 
 Kamala Harris really did not get a traditional convention. You know, we were online via COVID. They didn't get the traditional inauguration. They 
 
 actually didn't have all the pomp and circumstance for an inauguration.
 
And so, we went into this convention, one looking for a host city that could help tell their story and the story of this administration and the 
 
 achievements, but most importantly, we went into this convention thinking about how do we tell the story of Joe Biden, of Kamala Harris.
 
And so, when the switch happened, we knew that we were already preparing to tell the story of Kamala Harris, but now, we also needed to be able to tell 
 
 the story of Governor Tim Walz, and then shift how we told Joe Biden's story, not as the nominee, but as the transformational president that he 
 
 has been.
 
I will go down saying that Joe Biden is the most transformational president of my lifetime. When you look at his legislative achievements, it is hard 
 
 to find any comparison outside of Lyndon Baines Johnson, in terms of the sheer number and volume and impact of those legislative achievements. And 
 
 what gives him even a little notch more is he did it with the 50/50 Senate on a good day and a less than five-seat majority, the same majority that 
 
 Republicans have.
 
And so, we wanted to make sure that then we could do that. We give the person thoseflowers, but tell the story of Kamala Harris.
 
ISAACSON:  When I was walking to the hall, you know, we'd see the Palestinian protesters and that was one of the things that Vice President 
 
 Harris had to navigate. And I want to read you from her speech, because she did a very careful navigation of it.
 
She said, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself. And then she said, but what has happened in Gaza is devastating, desperate, 
 
 hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.
 
To me, that was a shift of tone, a noticeable shift of tone from President Biden to just really empathize with the heartbreaking plight of many 
 
 Palestinian civilians, how is she going to try to keep the party together on those issue -- this issue, especially when so many Palestinians feel 
 
 disenfranchised now?
 
HARRISON:  Yes. Well, you know, that's what I mentioned earlier about strength, but empathy. And those two things can coexist at the same time 
 
 and they can be in the same person. And I think that's what -- you know, I thought that section of the vice president's speech was just absolutely 
 
 spot on. It was beautiful in many ways because that's where we have to be. We can stand with our allies and at the same time, we can also see the hurt 
 
 and the pain and want to and to actively lean into doing things to address that as well.
 <br>[13:25:00]
 
Those, -- you know, it doesn't have to be black or white, right? There's that room in the middle in order to really pave that path. And I believe 
 
 that this is the -- this is a person who can do it in Kamala Harris. And I hope we get it done before she becomes president. You know, because the 
 
 need right now is tremendous and it's great. And so, I know that she's feverishly working with President Biden and the national security team day 
 
 in and day out to try to make progress here and to go and secure a ceasefire.
 
ISAACSON:  One of the decisions that you all who were organizing this convention had to make was whether or not to have a speaker from the 
 
 uncommitted delegates who were representing the Palestinian cause. To what extent did you have discussions about having a Palestinian speaker? And 
 
 why, in the end, did you not have a pro-Palestinian speaker during the convention?
 
HARRISON:  Well, that section of ours -- of our program, I wasn't actively involved in. But, you know, what we tried to do is to make sure we brought 
 
 folks on that stage that are respected and opinion points in all perspectives. And there were folks on that stage who had those reflections.
 
I mean, the requests from folks in the various groups and pockets, you know, we're a very diverse party. It is our strength, but also, it can 
 
 also, at times, create difficulties because there's the sheer volume of groups that make up almost -- you know, in some fashion, we're a little 
 
 coalition like, you know, and when you think about the Democratic Party. Similar to what you find in Europe and what have you, you have all of these 
 
 segments and these groups that -- 
 
ISAACSON:  But let me get back to that issue of whether or not to have that speaker, because it was a two- or three-day discussion. Are you worried 
 
 about, especially Michigan, Minnesota and other places, by deciding not to have a pro-Palestinian speaker? What are you going to do to reach out to 
 
 that community?
 
HARRISON:  Well, I think the vice president's speech laid the foundation for that. She spoke her truth. And I think her truth -- and when you talk 
 
 to folks in those communities, I think you see some semblance of all of that right in those communities. And so, she'll continue to go and reach 
 
 out to those communities. We will continue to go and get -- go to those areas. We'll go to where people are and have the discussions.
 
And not only will it just be about words, because, you know, I'm a firm believer that it is not about just telling people about where you are, it's 
 
 about showing them. And I think the most powerful thing that we can do over the course of the next few weeks as we get to November is not just tell 
 
 people about our position, but to actively show them with our actions. And that's what the vice president along with the president are working on day 
 
 in and day out, to show folks that we are committed to getting a ceasefire. We're committed to protecting, you know, the Israeli people as well as the 
 
 Palestinian people. And I think our actions are going to be a much more powerful than our words.
 
ISAACSON:  A while back, you said his DNC chair, one of your big goals would be to reengaging and winning back Latino and black men who have 
 
 drifted away from the party. Trump just yesterday was bragging that he's getting black men Latinos for him. Tell me what you're doing and what 
 
 you're seeing in that regard.
 
HARRISON:  Well, I think Donald Trump continues his delusion because he's not getting black men and Latino. We have been actively for -- the last 
 
 three and a half years, I've been going around into the communities, making sure that we have conversations with black men and Latino men so that they 
 
 understand that we don't take them for granted, that we see them, that we hear them, but most importantly, we value them, and we're going to fight 
 
 like hell for it.
 
And, you know, everybody wants to be seen and heard, everybody. And they want to know that you have an agenda for them. That you understand the 
 
 hardships that they're facing. And I think, you know, the vice president, well, is rolling out things because that economic anxiety is still a really 
 
 present thing.
 
You know, black men and Latino men want to take care of their families. They want to make sure that there's security, not only personal security, 
 
 but economic security as well. And so, it's the most dehumanizing thing for a man is to feel as though he cannot protect. He cannot defend. He cannot 
 
 take care and produce for his family. And so, we understand that, and we're making sure that our messages are rooted in that. And we're making sure 
 
 that the outreach that we do is also rooted in that.
 
ISAACSON:  This was a historic nomination, first black woman, South-Asian woman. We're seeing history being made, but one of the things that struck 
 
 me is that Vice President Harris didn't dwell on that in her speech, the historic nature of it. Tell me about what you see as historic nature and 
 
 perhaps why she didn't talk about it more.
 <br>[13:30:00]
 
HARRISON:  Well, you know, I think what's really important for folks is to understand that, you know, regardless of her background, this is a person 
 
 who is ready on day one to be the commander-in-chief. There's probably no one more equipped to be so.
 
She has been the Vice President of these United States for the last three and a half years. She's helped, showed -- stood shoulder to shoulder with 
 
 Joe Biden to pass some of the most transformational legislation that we have seen in the last few decades to bring America out of the darkness and 
 
 despair of COVID, to help rebuild our relationships overbroad so that people respected America again, to protect and defend the constitution of 
 
 the United States. And she happens to be a woman and she happens to be a black and Asian-American descent.
 
But it is groundbreaking, because like I said, people will get an opportunity to see who she is and many people will get an opportunity to 
 
 see themselves in her. And that's the most amazing thing. This is a historic moment. And you know, this picture that I've been painting for 
 
 folks all week at this Democratic Convention was this image -- because again, we're a future thinking party, this image of January 20, 2025 on the 
 
 steps of the United States Capitol, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson standing there, holding the bible of Frederick Douglass, and Kamala Harris stepping 
 
 out, putting her hand on that bible and taking a pledge to protect and defend the constitution of the United States.
 
They're standing on the steps of a building built by the hands of slaves. That is what America can do. I mean, it just gives me chills just thinking 
 
 about it time and time again. That is what America can do in this election. It's all within our power, and we will do that. And we will rejoice in the 
 
 joy of our ancestors as we move forward with that.
 
ISAACSON:  Jaime Harrison, thank you so much for joining us.
 
HARRISON:  Thank you so much for having me.

GOLODRYGA:  Well, now from deep fakes to misinformation, social media is already proving that it has the power to disrupt and destabilize the 
 
 upcoming election. Well, our next guests are using the Broadway stage to shine a spotlight on exactly that the dark side of the Internet.
 
In the new play, "Job," an employee at a tech company tasked with scrolling through unsavory content, is put on leave after a video of her having a 
 
 breakdown goes viral. Now, it's up to her new crisis therapist to give her the all clear to return to work. I sat down with the two stars, Peter 
 
 Friedman and Sydney Lemmon, alongside the playwright, Max Wolf Friedlich.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA:  OK. Well, thank you all for joining us. Really blown away by the show. So, I'm excited to be having this conversation with you.
 
Max, we'll get to where this concept came from, but let's jump into the plot and Sydney's character, Jane, her life is really shattered as a 
 
 content moderator at a Facebook like social media company. I'm wondering if you personally had any type of life altering or experiences with content 
 
 that stood out to you as disturbing online.
 
MAX WOLF FRIEDLICH, WRITER, "JOB":  Nothing directly. I'm a chronically online person and someone raised on the internet. So, I think a lot of 
 
 horrible things normalized to me very quickly from a very young age. And it wasn't until years later that I sort of was able to realize that those were 
 
 strange things to have seen.
 
And I'm not an outlier. I think a lot of people grow up that way in the modern world. But I had a very strange tech job when I first graduated from 
 
 college where I worked for this company that built fictional influencers. So, that was my most direct related experience to what Jane goes through, 
 
 where I wasn't looking at awful content on the internet, but I was living life as this like fake famous person called Lil Miquela.
 
And so, I was getting sent, you know, messages about how much people loved me and how much they hated me. And that was more disturbing than anything I 
 
 had ever seen. And that was the most direct sort of inspiration for the play.
 
GOLODRYGA:  So, Peter, without it being shoved down a viewer's throat, this is based a lot on generational divide.
 
PETER FRIEDMAN, ACTOR, "JOB":  It really is, yes.
 <br>[13:35:00]
 
GOLODRYGA:  So, as the older, wiser of the people here I'm interviewing in the panel, I'm just curious when you hear, even what Max just said, the 
 
 idea -- 
 
FRIEDMAN:  It's insane. I don't know what you people are doing.
 
GOLODRYGA:  I could just watch you guys talk about the show because I do want to get a sense of how you first felt when you read the script, when 
 
 you were first approached with it. And I know for you, Sydney, it frightened you.
 
SYDNEY LEMMON, ACTRESS, "JOB":  Oh, yes, it terrified me. It contains things that reflect our world in a real way, and then they're dark. And I 
 
 think that's kind of what connects with people. It really speaks to the present moment, and it leaves people grappling with a lot of things that 
 
 are maybe the underbelly of tech or the internet, but that are true. And, yes, it frightened me for sure.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And we should note that the show is based on your character being a content moderator at a Facebook like technology company, going in 
 
 for a therapy session. You are the therapist, Peter, and you had a nervous breakdown in the office and that went viral. It was caught on tape and 
 
 video, as so many of these moments are in present day and thus, to keep your job, HR sends you first to be analyzed by a professional. And again, 
 
 trying to grasp this new concept of social media in a world where no one can live without it. What is your relationship with social media?
 
FRIEDMAN:  As the representative of the older generation in this I just don't see the purpose of going that deep into all these other worlds, the 
 
 Instagram and the sharing, and it doesn't make sense to me personally. My wife has dabbled a little bit, but I don't get it. And I -- and every day 
 
 you read about somebody who's been online and something terrible happens, you go, I don't need a presence there. What's the deal? But this gang does.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And so, how much of your own research did you have to do in preparing for a role as a therapist, for this specific topic?
 
FRIEDMAN:  Nothing. We've all, we've all been to therapy a zillion times. So, you know, I know what the deal is, how they behave and, you know, been 
 
 through a lot myself. But it's what the character is dealing with that we don't hear about, until later, that sparks how I do what I do. And the idea 
 
 is to talk this person down, talk this person down from the ledge.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Max, do you view the role of social media specifically as it's portrayed in this play as a useful tool or as something that ultimately is 
 
 more harmful to society?
 
FRIEDLICH:  I think we are still grappling with the fact that it's just a ubiquitous part of society. And there's this sort of now false dichotomy, I 
 
 think between online and offline that doesn't really exist anymore. We're always online. We're all, you know, these -- what happens on the internet 
 
 has profound resonance with our lived reality. I think most directly and saliently with like the 2016 election, right, where like anyone, I think on 
 
 Twitter or 4chan or Reddit could have told you that those polls are wrong.
 
So, I think that whether it's good or bad isn't really for me to say, but we need to start understanding it on a deeper level, and we need to start 
 
 modeling what a healthy relationship with it looks like. And you can see it repeating itself with A.I. now, where people are still having this 
 
 conversation of whether we should use it or not, it's too good a technology for people not to use it, and that's not an opinion. We're going to use it.
 
So, we need to, you know, put blocks in place and try to, again, model what a healthy relationship with this technology can look like, because I don't 
 
 think we have that for contemporary social media. It's either good or bad, and I don't think that's the question anymore.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And, Sydney, I think it's safe to say that your relationship with social media, your character's relationship with social media is not a 
 
 healthy one. You though are insistent on going back to your job. I'm wondering how much in your life and how much in studying for this role, 
 
 have you ever been in a situation where you're so committed to a job or a part of your life that you just can't quit even though perhaps it's not the 
 
 best for you?
 <br>[13:40:00]
 
LEMMON:  Well, I think that a life in the arts is not always the easiest one, and it's a certain calling. I think to when you're feel calling in you 
 
 to be an actor, maybe echoes the calling that Jane, my character, feels to what she does. And so, it's something that, yes, it's not always easy, but 
 
 you feel a drive that you must continue on that path. So, I guess I do feel those things have similarity.
 
GOLODRYGA:  I mean, you really get a sense from your performance and your character that your job is urgent and much needed.
 
LEMMON:  Yes. Yes, I think that she can -- she does content moderation. She sifts through the filth of the internet. It's not an easy job, but in the 
 
 play, she says somebody has to do it. And that's really the truth. People - - you know, A.I. can help with this job. This job can be pushed off into different countries, but ultimately, someone has to sift.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Yes. And it's funny, because watching the play, I didn't even - - I've never thought of the job of a content moderator. Obviously, somebody has to do it, and it's an important job. But you actually spent some time, 
 
 I've read, with a content moderator at a real company, right, at a party and got a sense of what that entails.
 
FRIEDLICH:  Very briefly, yes. I also had no idea about what it was, but, you know, the internet is so fascinating because it's, again, all around 
 
 us, it affects so much of our lived reality, but we sort of engage with it like it's magic. We don't understand -- we sort of conceptualize it as like 
 
 floating in the air. We don't think of it as being as, you know, cloud storage, as being like real servers that actually exist and need cooling 
 
 and have an energy expenditure.
 
And I think off of that, like content moderation, there's a human labor cost to us mindlessly scrolling on TikTok, and that's so fascinating to me 
 
 that we do this thing that gets sort of portrayed as being without thought. And really, there's someone sitting behind the screen having to do this 
 
 terrible labor so that we can do this.
 
And I think if there's one social message of the play, which I don't really love when there isn't in -- at least my work, so much, I think it's just 
 
 trying to get people to think a little deeper about what makes it possible for them to be on their phones.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Here's a constant question that you get for anybody on a Broadway show or show that you're repeating nightly to a different 
 
 audience, is it harder or easier for you to repeat such a dynamic and, you know -- 
 
FRIEDMAN:  That's the question.
 
GOLODRYGA:  It's a hard role to play. And to do it every night. How do you do that?
 
LEMMON:  There's freedom in the structure that we've built. We've built something and when people like how -- when people ask, how do you do it? 
 
 How do you keep it fresh? A lot of it is that we're still figuring it out, even though we've performed this off Broadway, twice now on Broadway, we're 
 
 still working to uncover the truth of what these characters are living through. And a lot of it doesn't come from effort, but from release sort 
 
 of, just releasing into the story.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Do you notice a difference in their performance each night?
 
FRIEDLICH:  I do, but also, I -- and there's such a solid core and such a solid foundation. I think the beauty with live theater -- the process, I 
 
 think of producing a play is all about, similarly, like a releasing and like a giving it away. So, I think the thing that changes every night is 
 
 the audience. And sometimes it's a very laughy vocal audience and that changes the texture of the play in really interesting ways.
 
I mean, no one gets to watch it the way that I do, which is like with a -- you know, a fine, fine, fine tooth comb. And I think that makes me enjoy it 
 
 more when I do get to see it, because I'm like, oh, they found this, like, minute moment that no one else is going to notice, but, like, that's never 
 
 been there before. Like, this one gesture, this one, you know, pushing the hair behind the ear, that changes the dynamic of the scene for me. So, it's 
 
 very exciting.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And I love how you've woven comedy throughout as well. I mean, I just wonder when you're sitting there -- 
 
FRIEDMAN:  That's this guy.
 
GOLODRYGA:  -- on stage and hearing the audience laugh at times. You know, I wouldn't necessarily describe this as a comedy, but the writing itself. I 
 
 mean, how hard, how long did it take you to get it to this point?
 
FRIEDLICH:  I started writing the play -- I started outlining it in 2018. So, it's been a minute. The comedy, I just like -- I can't really engage 
 
 with anything that takes itself holistically seriously. It was a little -- I think a lot of the comedy is accidental. I would put it right back on 
 
 these guys. I think they've found a lot of comedic moments.
 
And I think there's this interesting psychological thing that happens, is like, once people start laughing, they kind of don't stop. And then, in our 
 
 play, there comes a moment where like they really have to stop and that's a very satisfying thing as a writer to be like, oh, we've kind of tricked you 
 
 and lulled you into thinking it's this thing and it's actually this other thing.
 <br>[13:45:00]
 
GOLODRYGA:  I was there for opening night and it was quite an emotional speech you gave that night at the end of the show. I mean, you're a first-
 
 time playwright, you're not even 30. Your director is his first time directing as well.
 
FRIEDLICH:  Crazy.
 
GOLODRYGA:  You were introduced to this by your daughter, Sadie. I mean, what does it say for the future of theater, especially Broadway theater to 
 
 have such a young ensemble? And it's not just the writing, the directing, the producers too, I mean, it has this very fresh, young next generation 
 
 vibe to it.
 
FRIEDLICH:  Yes. Yes, it's really exciting. It's it feels like we're representing a community that's rapidly ascending from downtown. And it's a 
 
 real honor to be in this position, sort of, in some respect, representing them and representing the people that we came up around.
 
And I think the most exciting newness has to do with the audience. I mean, we've been sort of a disproportionate hit amongst younger people, and we've 
 
 talked to a lot of people for whom this is like the first play that they've ever seen in New York, and that's the most exciting and gratifying thing to 
 
 me as a writer to get new young people in to see theater.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And it's obvious that it resonates with so many people of all ages.
 
FRIEDMAN:  Differently, between the ages, but it resonates, yes.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And, Peter, your last appeared on Broadway in "12 Angry Men" 20 years ago.
 
FRIEDMAN:  Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And there's a connection here, because in the film version, "12 Angry Men," Jack Lemmon, your grandfather starred. Just wondering what this 
 
 -- 
 
LEMMON:  You never talked about that.
 
FRIEDMAN:  Well, I never did.
 
GOLODRYGA:  What this experience has been like for the two of you and the relationship that's come out of it?
 
LEMMON:  We're besties.
 
FRIEDMAN:  Go ahead.
 
GOLODRYGA:  That's awesome.
 
LEMMON:  It's just been a privilege, first and foremost, but really a joy to get to work with somebody as skilled and good and kind as Peter. And 
 
 it's just been fun. We really like each other.
 
FRIEDMAN:  Yes. And it's been easy. And I -- you know, there's -- Syd says quite a lot in the show. And I've seen this thing a million times, and it's 
 
 always different, it's always a different thrust from the very beginning. And I love seeing how it takes her through the entire 80 minutes. It's just 
 
 what you want.
 
GOLODRYGA:  It's fantastic, the chemistry between the two of you, the dialogue, hang on every single word sitting in the audience.
 
LEMMON:  Thank you.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And I just -- I know we'll see a lot more of you in the future. I imagine an award or two, perhaps specifically for this role. I know the 
 
 play has been extended through the end of October. So, congratulations.
 
FRIEDLICH:  Thank you.
 
FRIEDMAN:  Thanks. Thanks very much.
 
LEMMON:  Thank you for having us.
 
GOLODRYGA:  It's a wonderful show. Thank you so much for joining us.
 
FRIEDLICH:  Thank you.
 
LEMMON:  Thank you so much.
 
FRIEDLICH:  I really appreciate it.

AMANPOUR:  I loved that show and I loved that conversation.
 
Well, this week, Taylor Swift wrapped up a record-breaking run of shows in London. And amongst her surprise guests was singer-songwriter, and producer 
 
 extraordinaire Jack Antonoff. He's famous for producing many of her biggest hits, along with many other artists, and is a major musician in his own 
 
 right with his band Bleachers.
 
They are touring with their new self-titled album and Christiane caught up with Antonoff in London ahead of their appearance at Reading Festival. 
 
 Here's a sneak peek of that conversation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Jack Antonoff, welcome to the program.
 
JACK ANTONOFF, MUSICIAN, SONGWRITER AND PRODUCER:  Thank you for having me.
 
AMANPOUR:  I have a lot to ask you, but I do actually want to start by your appearance on the stage with Taylor Swift, which was pretty amazing. Did 
 
 you expect it? What was it like?
 
ANTONOFF:  I mean, it's the -- I'm the least nervous the more surreal it gets. I'd be more nervous talking to you than being in front of that many 
 
 people.
 
AMANPOUR:  You seem to be a seriously cool guy when it comes not just to music, but who you produce. And especially you produce a lot of very 
 
 powerful women. And I don't know whether you started by identifying women or whether it was just something that came to you. How did it start with 
 
 Taylor Swift, for instance?
 
ANTONOFF:  That started as organic as possible. It literally met completely outside of even anything really industry like kind of through friends, I'm 
 
 just playing music that we liked. One thing leads to another.
 
AMANPOUR:  Look, you've worked on 11 of her albums, but beyond that, you've won a lot of Grammys. And particularly, you've won producer of the year for 
 
 the last three years.
 
ANTONOFF:  Yes, it's bananas.
 
AMANPOUR:  What is -- I don't even know whether you can, but can you say what is more satisfying, what you like better? Is it producing? Is it being 
 
 a musician? Is it being a performer? Is it doing your own stuff?
 
ANTONOFF:  I've never experienced any of them without each other. So, I don't know. I know for other people, they're very different. You know, I 
 
 have a lot of friends who love being in the studio and despise being on the road, or some people get exhausted by the studio and need to perform.
 <br>[13:50:00]
 
I -- they're very much one thing to me. I've never been in the studio and not thought about live. I've never been on stage and not imagined what I 
 
 was going to do next in the studio.
 
AMANPOUR:  You seem quite shy in your interaction. And you are -- I mean, maybe you're not. But you have associated yourself, both in your 
 
 professional life and in your personal life, with what I said earlier, with some very strong, prominent women, and not just famous women who are 
 
 incredibly -- women of substance, whether it's the musicians we've talked about, whether you've dated people like Scarlett Johansson, Lena Dunham, 
 
 you're married now to Margaret Qualley, who's in an amazing new film called "The Substance," which is not yet out.
 
ANTONOFF:  Yes, "The Substance" is outstanding.
 
AMANPOUR:  Yes, I'm waiting to see it. It's really, really edgy. You feel totally secure with very strong women and successful women?
 
ANTONOFF:  I think so. I don't know. I mean, I'm not -- I don't feel -- 
 
AMANPOUR:  What attracts you to that lot?
 
ANTONOFF:  I've always felt very comfortable around people who are comfortable with themselves and that's usually people who end up having 
 
 some power because that's a nice trait. But yes, I just like -- I like people who know what they want to do and hear what they hear and just want 
 
 to go find it and then we can have our big crisis of the day over what we should have for lunch, not about what we want to say to the world.
 
AMANPOUR:  One of the things you did say to the world through your profession was the "Getaway Car." You have that song, it went viral, and it 
 
 was part of the joint appearance the other night. And I'm just going to play a little bit of it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONOFF:  I'm in a getaway car, and losing my -- something.
 
TAYLOR SWIFT, SINGER:  I'm in a getaway car, and you're in the motel bar, or like -- 
 
ANTONOFF:  Yes, I'm in the getaway car. Left you in the motel bar. Took the money -- 
 
SWIFT:  Took the money in the bag and I stole it -- 
 
ANTONOFF:  Took the money -- 
 
SWIFT:  Took the money in the bag and I stole the keys. That was the last time you ever saw me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR:  You were super energetic in that clip that we just showed.
 
ANTONOFF:  Yes.
 
AMANPOUR:  You -- it's the story behind the story, right?
 
ANTONOFF:  Well, I think the reason why that clip has had such a big life is because, you know, there's a everyone wants to tell the story of the 
 
 studio. You know, we see it in film and TV all the time and often the story is sensationalized and there's, you know, candles and heroin and the -- 
 
 that version. It's not really true that, you know, the studio is an interesting place, but it's a place that you plant yourself in and you -- 
 
 almost like fishing or something, you're like waiting to catch something and you're trying all these different things.
 
I think the reason why that video has such a big life is because it's one of the few videos I've ever seen and I happen to be in it, but that really 
 
 captured the moment when two people get the idea for a thing. And I don't know why she was recording that, but she was. And it's the only video I've 
 
 ever been a part of where I'm like, yes, that was really the moment. That was it. When we put this together and this, and it speaks to that one plus 
 
 one equaling a billion. You see two people kind of one upping each other. And those are those moments when you really get the song.
 
AMANPOUR:  I'm going to play another one, your song "Modern Girl," which is on your new album. You kind of joke, I think you're joking, there's 
 
 certainly New Jersey lyrics. We're going to play that.
 
ANTONOFF:  I think you're joking.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR:  It's really danceable. What's pop music hoarder?
 
ANTONOFF:  Oh, well, that whole -- you know, I was sort of -- so that song started as me trying to take the piss out of the world. And then, whenever 
 
 I'm going like that, I always think I should go like that. So, I started writing it -- 
 
AMANPOUR:  Do you get that criticism?
 
ANTONOFF:  Pop music hoarder?
 
AMANPOUR:  Yes.
 
ANTONOFF:  Oh, not in that way. But I wanted to create a just a half a verse that was sort of like, all, like, the ways you could take the piss 
 
 out of me. So, like, New Jersey's finest New Yorker seemed funny to me.
 
AMANPOUR:  Yes. We -- 
 
ANTONOFF:  It just seems like an absurd statement. Unreliable reporter that speaks to, like, all the hypocrisy of being a writer. You know, in my 
 
 version of writing, there's no fact checking. And there shouldn't be. It's whatever I feel, whenever I feel it. And some of the stories are brutally 
 
 honest and some of them are utter distortions.
 
Pop music hoarder, I think that -- I was, you know, taking the piss out of the idea that as like people who, you know, feel like I keep popping up in 
 
 all these places. And then, some guy playing quarters just speaks to like, hey, I'm just some person also.
 
AMANPOUR:  Jack Antonoff, thank you very much.
 
ANTONOFF:  Thanks for having me.
