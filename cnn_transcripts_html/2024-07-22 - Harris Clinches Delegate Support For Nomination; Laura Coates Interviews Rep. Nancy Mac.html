<br>[23:00:00]
 
BOMANI JONES, PODCAST HOST, WAVE SPORTS + ENTERTAINMENT: And the only conclusion that I can draw from this is the West Wing stunk.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Oh, (INAUDIBLE).
 
JONES: It can't be (INAUDIBLE). But this is -- this is you all was giving Emmys to. This is what you all giving awards to. Martin Sheen spent his time being the president on this. You've got to be kidding me. If that was what the script was looking like, that was correct.
 
DOUG HEYE, FORMER RNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Politics is not West Wing, it is (INAUDIBLE).
 
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN HOST: Okay, three of us at this table upon a political panel haven't seen West Wing. I don't know --
 
GRIFFIN: Oh, I love it. I stand with Aaron Sorkin.
 
VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Aaron Sorkin is taking a dip, but West Wing --
 
PHILLIP: All right, guys, everyone, thank you.
 
BOMANI JONES: Was this reflective of what?
 
VAN JONES: No.
 
PHILLIP: Thank you very much, everyone. And thank you for watching "NewsNight" state of the race. "Laura Coates Live" is starting right now.
 
LAURA COATES, CNN HOST: Breaking news tonight, Kamala Harris appears to all but wrap up the nomination. So, what will her campaign actually look like? Plus --
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): You're full of shit today.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) COATES: Congresswoman Nancy Mace rips into Secret Service director and joins me in studio for her plans to remove her.
 
And there is disturbing bodycam video released in the death of a woman holding a pot of hot water. Shot and killed by a deputy who is now charged in her murder. Victim's father joins me tonight on "Laura Coates Live."
 
Well, and just like that, Democrats seem to have flipped the script. They're done nudging, they're done hand-wringing, and are now rolling up their sleeves, working to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris. If you thought that was going to be a slow process, think again.
 
Just tonight, she has already secured enough endorsements from delegates to win the democratic nomination. And remember, these delegates, they belonged to Biden. It's up to them and their prerogative whether they wanted to support Harris or maybe anyone else. It seems though they've already made up their minds, and it's her.
 
It caps a day that saw her rack up a number of endorsements and money as fast as President Biden, the candidate, was losing them. More than 240 members of Congress now say they are with her. That includes former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And Harris has raised a whopping $81 million bucks in just 24 hours.
 
And forget what Biden once said about maybe party elites putting their thumb on a scale. These are voters who are also giving a big thumbs up. Look at this new poll that we have out today. Seventy-nine percent of Democrats want Harris. Just 21% want someone else. You know who is raising their hand to throw their own name into the ring against her? Buehler, Buehler.
 
And no one else has dared to stand in her way. Delegates could now formally vote her in as the party's nominee as early as or maybe even before August 7th, and that is before the Democratic National Convention.
 
She is wasting no time making the case against Donald Trump. Here she was today not only thanking her staffers, but also very clearly reminding everyone in that room that they now have a former prosecutor running against a convicted felon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Well, President Biden, who is recovering from COVID, he actually called into the meeting. It was his first verbal remark that we've all heard since he announced that he was stepping away from the race. He thanked staff, and he urged the team to rally around the vice president.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (voice-over): I want to say to the team, embrace her, she's the best. I know yesterday's news was surprising and it was hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: But here's the thing about politics that we know in Washington, D.C. and really where you are as well, knowing that all politics is local. Becoming the party's nominee, that may be the easy part for Harris. Beating Trump and the campaign ahead and against her, something else entirely. The big question is, is America ready to elect a woman as president? A woman of color? Kamala Harris in particular?
 
Well, with me now, somebody who thought Kamala was ready back in 2019, Congressman Al Green, a Democrat from Texas. He's actually the first black man in Congress to endorse her when she ran for president back in 2020.
 <br>[23:05:00]
 
Congressman, I'm delighted that you're here tonight. Thank you for joining.
 
REP. AL GREEN (D-TX): Well, it's an honor to be with you, and you've done your homework.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
COATES: I certainly have. And, you know, you not only were the one of the first to endorse, I mean, that was five years ago this summer.
 
GREEN: It was. It was.
 
COATES: A lot has changed since then. She has four more years of experience. Is she the right choice for today?
 
GREEN: Without question, she's the right choice, and I'm proud to be with her now as I was with her then. And I would say to people who are going to be involved in this process, let's let her be herself. We didn't ask Michael Jordan to become the next Dr. J. We said, be the first Michael Jordan. Let her be the first Vice President Harris to become president, and she will do well.
 
COATES: Well, I'm sure she'll have to rock her own support and name on her jersey. If it's 23 or not, we don't know.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
But there will be a lot of people who don't want to say that herself is good enough. There are some who are looking at her campaign and concerns about that phrase, electability. The same concerns people had five years ago, they'll be raised again. She has, obviously, been elected as a vice president at this point in time. But I do wonder, how do you think she can address the concerns about who she is, separate and apart from Joe Biden?
 
GREEN: Well, separate and apart from Joe Biden, she has been a prosecutor, as we all know, and she did exceedingly well, not just in locking people up, but also in setting people free, because one of the jobs of a prosecutor is to go through those cases and determine who should go to trial and who should not. And she has a reputation for being fair. I think she should do this.
 
But I also think that she should just campaign on who she has been. There's no need to try to do a remake right now. Realize that what she has been has brought her this far, and I think it can take her to the finish line.
 
And if I may say this, we ought to be thankful to Joe Biden. This man gave it all up so that she could be on the ticket. I mean, it was a risk to put a woman on the ticket. No one has ever done this and succeeded. He did it. I think that he -- but for him, we would not have her in a position to do what she's doing now. So, let her do what she has done before. Rest on your laurels. You were a great senator. You were a great prosecutor. Become a great president, and that's available to her.
 
COATES: I remember at the time she ran the first time, the political climate, the justice climate, was different. Justice was on the ballot, she said. But some were concerned that she would run away from her prosecutorial chops at a time when it was perhaps most needed. We're in a new era. I do wonder if she will embrace it in a different way.
 
But one thing is certain, congressman. Some Republicans are attacking her. They're not pointing to qualifications in the way that you have laid it out. They are instead attacking her, saying she got the job because of her race, because of her gender. And, in fact, Trump called Harris, and I'm quoting him -- quote -- "dumb as a rock." And then listen to your colleague, Congressman Tim Burchett from Tennessee, who had this to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Biden said, first off, he said he's going to hire a Black female for vice president, and he just skipped over it. What about -- what about white females? What about any other group? Just -- when you go down that route, you take mediocrity, and that's what they have right now as a vice president.
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Are you suggesting she was a DEI hire?
 
BURCHETT: One hundred percent. She was a DEI hire.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: What's your reaction to a statement like that?
 
GREEN: Well, that is a level of insidious prevarication that borders on racism, to be very candid with you. I would hope that my colleague would reconsider those words. She has demonstrated her worth with her education. She has demonstrated her worth by being elected to the Senate and then becoming an attorney general in California. Those kinds of comments are out of place. It's a kind of fatuous folly that you expect from Republicans, but I didn't expect it from him because I know him, and I would hope that he would reconsider what he said.
 
But I do think this: There will be more to come. The Republicans now deal in campaigns associated with character assassination. They're not interested in being truthful about people. They're interested in having the vote turned down, not out. They want to make sure that it's an election where in the basis of running against each other, the independents say, I don't want anybody in the race. Well, now we have somebody that they have to now try to destroy, and that's what they'll do.
 
So, we've just got to be on our defense, best defense and offense. We don't let them destroy her. We've got to stand up for her because she is a credible candidate and will make a great president.
 
COATES: I am curious as to how she will respond to what is most assuredly ahead. Congressman, thank you so much for joining me this evening.
 
GREEN: Well, thank you. It was an honor to be with you.
 
COATES: Thank you.
 <br>[23:10:00]
 
Well, CNN is learning tonight that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, are all being considered as potential V.P. choices for Vice President Kamala Harris's ticket.
 
According to people familiar with the process, they've all been asked to submit personal information, including about their finances and family histories. But those three, well, they're part of a group of 10 names, and nearly all of whom are elected officials. So, how would these folks help Harris electorally is the big question.
 
Let's get to Harry Enten, CNN senior data reporter. Harry, always good to see you. So, let's get down to the nitty gritty. Let's get down to this list. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, what's he bring?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: I would argue he's perhaps my favorite choice for Kamala Harris, and the reason why is a few. Number one, Pennsylvania, big swing state, arguably the most important swing state on the map. More than that, he has a strong electoral record. If you go back to last time around, back in 2020, when he was running in a presidential year, he actually outran Joe Biden on the ballot and, in fact, did best, did the best for any Democrat running statewide.
 
What about some cons? Well, let's talk about the big con. Some liberals think he might be a little bit too moderate. You know, Kamala Harris has really energized the base after Joe Biden left the race, and there is some question about whether Josh Shapiro would, in fact, bring down that enthusiasm. But overall, the clear pros for him, he's from the state of Pennsylvania. You can't do better than that if you're picking a V.P. and want a swing state effect.
 
COATES: And let's talk about maybe one other swing state.
 
ENTEN: Hmm.
 
COATES: Let's talk about Arizona for a second. I mean, Arizona, Senator Mark Kelly, he has been mentioned. What would he bring to the ticket?
 
ENTEN: What would Mark Kelly bring to the ticket? Well, you mentioned it, right? From the key swing state of Arizona, won by the smallest of margins last time around, won by actually less by Joe Biden, less than he won in Pennsylvania, and he only won in Pennsylvania by a little bit more than a point. How about this? A great biography. I mean, my goodness gracious, can you do better than an astronaut? I'm not sure that you necessarily can.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
But what about the cons, right? He lacks executive experience. So, Kamala Harris really doesn't have much executive experience either, right? She, obviously, was the attorney general out in California, she was the D.A. in San Francisco, she was a senator from California, but she doesn't -- she hasn't ever actually led a state. And neither is Mark Kelly. He's somebody who was an astronaut, and then basically became a senator. So, I'm not quite sure he fills out the ticket in terms of the way that we normally do in terms of a V.P. where one is normally a member of Congress or a member of a legislative branch and the other one perhaps being a governor.
 
COATES: I wonder, his platform, whether it's with respect to being immigration and the border state or gun violence, two key areas that many people are concerned about that he has experience in.
 
ENTEN: Absolutely.
 
COATES: Harry, what about the North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper?
 
ENTEN: All right. So, we've talked about two folks from two certain swing states. Roy Cooper, though, you know, if we talked about someone who perhaps lacks some executive experience in Mark Kelly, that is definitely not the case with Roy Cooper. In fact, he is the one who is arguably the most experienced in the field, at least when it comes to these three V.P. -- potential VP choices, in terms of executive experience, in terms of running on the ballot, being on the ballot. This is obviously -- he's completing his second term as North Carolina governor.
 
How about this? He has won twice. He has won twice. And it is potential swing state that Dems lost in the presidential races in North Carolina. Of course, Joe Biden lost it last time around. Of course, Hillary Clinton lost it back in 2016. But perhaps the one con, if we know for sure that Arizona and Pennsylvania are going to be key swing states, is North Carolina.
 
I know a lot of Democrats want to play there but, in fact, if you are going to get a swing state effect by choosing a V.P., and that's one of the few measurable things that we know about VPs, is that it does tend to boost the president in that particular state. North Carolina is sort of on the edge of being a swing state, and adding Roy Cooper may help Kamala Harris. But if she's going to lose the state by five or six, it doesn't really help her too much if instead she loses it by two or three.
 
COATES: I wonder how much -- how known he is compared to the others that you've listed more recently. But Harry Enten, a lot of food for thought. Thank you so much.
 
ENTEN: Thank you.
 
COATES: Well, there's actually -- speaking of Vice President Kamala Harris, she just issued a statement just moments ago on becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.
 
I'll read a portion of what she has just released, saying, "When I announced my campaign for president, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination. Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee. And as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon."
 
She went on to say, "I am grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people."
 <br>[23:15:02]
 
She concludes by saying, "I fully intend to unite our party, unite our nation, and defeat Donald Trump in November."
 
We're here to discuss, two Democratic strategists who know a thing or two about presidential campaigns and winning them. Chuck Rocha, former senior advisor to Bernie Sanders's presidential campaigns, and Alencia Johnson, former senior advisor to Biden's 2020 campaign. Excuse me. Glad to have both of you here. First of all, if you thought it would be a long process to get this, there are 3,000 plus delegates, she's now a presumptive nominee, you're smiling already, how would one accomplish this in what? It has been just about 24, 36 hours?
 
ALENCIA JOHNSON, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, the only way an accomplished Black woman who is overly qualified to do this. I am smiling because, one, yes, Democrats are extremely excited right now, but this moment, we were talking about this in the green room, honestly, the calls that I've been getting beyond the beltway, this really feels like Obama 2008 when my dad was running around saying fired up and ready to vote.
 
The coalitions that are already swelling. We all have talked about the Black woman. Well, the Black men have just been texting me. They had 36,000 people on the call, raised 1.1 million in three hours. The Latinos are organizing. The AAPI groups are organizing, self- organizing. The excitement is here.
 
And when she talks about unity, it is bringing these factions together. I think there are so many factions of our party, progressive, moderates, who are like, look, we're going to disagree after we get her in office because we know who we have to beat, but we also know the platform that we can run on, and folks are confident with her at the helm.
 
COATES: Speaking of unity, I mean, she's going to have to bring someone onto her ticket as a presumptive nominee. We've been talking about the Trump veepstakes for a long time. We now know who's on that ticket. Chuck, who is going to be her partner?
 
CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: You know, I saw you all talking about this earlier, and there's a reason why you see all these governors and all these folks that are already elected in these swing states because it's important. What I find ironic is in the democratic movement, the white men are having their moment again.
 
JOHNSON: They are.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ROCHA: Right? So, don't be surprised. And I think what you all have said tonight is really important about Roy Cooper because of North Carolina, because of Shapiro in Pennsylvania. The rule with VPs, and we all know this, is do no harm. She does not want to be outshined. She wants to find someone who's safe. So, somebody who's had an election or two elections has been fully briefed.
 
We have run campaigns. The first thing you do is a big opal research book on whoever that is, and that means they've been through all that opal research so they're safe. So, I think any of those picks would be a real good asset to add to a very talented Black woman who I think can be president.
 
COATES: Why are they all white men?
 
ROCHA: You've got to be able to go talk to white men in Pennsylvania that are steel workers, Michigan that are auto workers. Not that Kamala Harris can't, but you've checked that box. You're going to be having Black women go through the roof with excitement just like you're going to have white women in the suburbs who care about Dobbs and abortion. You need somebody who can go and have a conversation with these white men because they're white men. JOHNSON: And to that, you know, I think you're alluding to this conversation of folks that believe that a Black woman can't win. Let's be very clear. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, a woman. Barack Obama won the popular vote twice, a Black man. But our elections come down to key swing states that we actually have to persuade some of these voters that Chuck talked about. And we know America is not quite ready for two women at the helm yet. And so, these white men could be an asset, which is interesting for us to talk about, that white men are having a hot boy summer.
 
COATES: Bad news for Kaitlan, Abby, and me in a row. But anyway, I'm thinking about this idea of people at the seat, at the table. How about the idea of independence, though? Because Senator J.D. Vance, who we know is the running mate of Donald Trump, he said that Democrats are actually threatening democracy. And I'll restate that. He says that Democrats are threatening democracy because Biden stepped down. Listen to what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The idea of selecting the Democrat Party's nominee, because George Soros and Barack Obama and a couple of elite Democrats got in a smoke-filled room and decided to throw Joe Biden overboard, that is not how it works. That is a threat to the democracy, not the Republican Party, which is fighting for democracy every single day.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Is that persuading people?
 
ROCHA: I don't think so. I mean, I don't know your opinion, but I don't think it's persuading anybody. I don't think -- I think people understand a representative government. We have one right here in Washington, D.C. I'd vote for a congressman if I had one in Washington. I really don't. I have Congresswoman Eleanor Norton Holmes, but she doesn't have a vote. We understand representative democracy. And Vice President Harris was on the ticket with Mr. Biden that they all voted for, so I think that's a lot of democracy.
 
JOHNSON: Well, and look, J.D. Vance, he knew that Donald Trump was a threat to democracy. When behind closed doors, he was calling him Hitler until he got on the ticket. But, look, I think there's a clear contrast here and the Republican Party shook because they have a losing ticket, right? They thought J.D. Vance was going to go up against President Biden and Vice President Harris, and they're realizing that wasn't the greatest -- the wisest of choices.
 <br>[23:20:05]
 
But I will say to you today, thank you to President Biden for the way that he has put country before himself. And he will go down as one of the most important presidents of our lifetimes. And the conversation that he had today with the campaign staffers was very emotional and very important. And him passing the torch to Vice President Harris was just beautiful to see. COATES: I'll be eager to hear him address the nation as well. Chuck, Alencia, always great to have you both here.
 
Well, she's calling on Vice President Kamala Harris to remove Biden, not just from the ticket, but from office, and calling out the director of the Secret Service. Congresswoman Nancy Mace is here after this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACE: Have you provided all audio and video recordings in your possession to this committee as we asked on July 15th, yes or no?
 
KIMBERLY CHEATLE, DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICE: I would have to get back to you.
 
MACE: That is a no. You're full of shit today. You're just being completely dishonest.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:25:25]
 
COATES: Tonight, Republicans building a new case for Biden to not just retire but resign from his presidency, Saying dropping his White House bid is simply not enough.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VANCE: There's a constitutional process, the 25th Amendment. If Joe Biden can't run for president, he can't serve as president. And if they want to take him down because he's mentally incapable of serving, invoke the 25th Amendment. You don't get to sort of do this in the most politically beneficial way for Democrats. If it's an actual problem, they should take care of it the appropriate way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: You know, Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, is not alone. My next guest unveiled a resolution calling on Vice President Kamala Harris to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Biden from office, arguing he lacks -- quote -- "cognitive ability" -- unquote -- to finish out his term.
 
Joining me now, Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. Congresswoman, thank you for joining me this evening. I knew this was on the horizon, frankly, when people wondered whether he would step down away from being re-elected.
 
MACE: Uh-hmm
 
COATES: But the fact that he's not running for re-election does not actually mean that he does not have the cognitive ability. They could be mutually exclusive points. Why are you so sure that's what this means?
 
MACE: We've all seen his decline. We've all seen that he is now a diminished individual. What other reason would he not run for re- election if it weren't for his mental acuity, his cognitive decline? There's really no other option out there. And if you don't have the ability to run for re-election because of your diminished state, then who's really running the country? I think that's a fair question that the American people are sort of asking themselves. How is this even possible?
 
I do also see it as a national security issue. Who is making the decisions? Joe Biden was elected, but is he really the one running the country? I don't think the American people are buying that right now.
 
COATES: One reason to not run for re-election, he has stated, essentially. And he didn't have the support, really, of the Democrats any longer. The donors were pulling out. There was no path forward. There were reasons given totally separate from any notion of a cognitive ability. And even in his letter to the American people, he did not talk about it as an issue. And so, couldn't it be true that he would lack the support to continue running and not have something to invoke the 25th Amendment?
 
MACE: All of this started the night of his performance at the debate where it was clear that he was not all there. And don't get me wrong. I have aging parents. I have a parent with Parkinson. I mean, I really feel for folks who are going through difficult issues or have cognitive decline in their own lives or in someone in their family. We all saw that.
 
All of this domino effect started when America really saw the real Joe Biden. And I just -- the American people aren't buying what's being sold by the administration or by Biden because we've all seen it with our own eyes. We've seen it now. And I think people feel misled. I feel like the American people feel that they haven't been told the truth by the Biden family and by his administration about his abilities.
 
And now, we've seen stories since he decided he would resign from the campaign. We've seen stories from members of Congress who met with him recently or within the last year where he doesn't remember who they are. And we've heard some and read some disturbing stories of some of those examples.
 
So, I think it's pretty obvious what's going on here and why it's happening. So, let's just be have an honest and truthful discussion about it.
 
COATES: Well, for many, this seems performative given the process by which you need to remove someone through the 25th Amendment would either require the president to do it himself or for the vice president and the majority of the Cabinet to agree to do so and then try to invoke it. It's pretty clear that Vice President Kamala Harris has no intention of doing that based on what you say are the reasons that he stepped down. But I want to speak to the issue of now Vice President Kamala Harris being the person who is likely to be on the top of this ticket. And I do wonder from your perspective, um, how this might change the calculus for the campaign for Trump now that she will likely be the top of that ticket.
 
MACE: I don't think it really matters from my perspective. We're 100 days out. I don't think it matters who they put on the top of the ticket because the vast majority of people right now, the way they're feeling right now in the middle of summer is that they feel misled. They feel lied to. They feel like Biden and his family, the administration, some of those in the mainstream media, that they haven't been honest brokers about what's really been going on behind the scenes.
 
COATES: You attribute that to also Vice President Kamala Harris?
 
MACE: Yes, absolutely, to everybody in Biden's inner circle. They were all in on it. And it feels like a cover up. And so, when you talk about it in those terms and you see how they kept it hidden from the American people, how do you re-instill trust in the process? I just don't think you can trust whoever they put on the ticket. They've all been part of the cover up of Joe Biden's decline.
 <br>[23:30:01]
 
COATES: Well, they, A, wouldn't just be putting them on a ticket. The delegates, it's their prerogative to decide who they would like to be that person.
 
MACE: Open convention, right.
 
COATES: Well, the delegates could have an open convention where they could decide the majority prior to that if they were to coalesce around one candidate. They're not beholden to give it over to Kamala Harris --
 
MACE: Right.
 
COATES: -- but they very well could. But on the second issue, there has been a lot of finger pointing towards the Democrats, but there have been a number of Republicans who have met with President Biden over the course of the last year let alone months, including the speaker of the House and others who were trying to talk about whether it was immigration or any other number of issues.
 
MACE: Uh-hmm.
 
COATES: Why do you think they would be if you say meeting with him would guarantee they knew something about the decline? Why aren't they also accused similarly?
 
MACE: Well, I think that everyone on our side of the aisle has been pretty vocal about what has been going on, trying to talk about it and showing it for at least the last six months. I mean, we've been very vocal about it. But you haven't seen that from the other side of the aisle.
 
And I think, ultimately, at the end of the day, I think there are two types of people in the country. There are people who want and need to be right, and then there are people who want the truth. And, you know, I think people feel like they've been really misled by Biden, by his family, by the administration, by folks on the left who've covered it up.
 
And that's the sentiment that I feel and I see with my voters, particularly those who are unaffiliated. I have a lot of voters in my district that aren't Democrat, that aren't Republican, that are unaffiliated or independent voters, and that's the sentiment that I hear today.
 
COATES: You know, speaking of some of the confusion and frustration that voters do feel, certainly, members of Congress today express their own level of frustration with respect to a lack of transparency from the Secret Service. There was this hearing today. We've all been hearing about it. It got pretty volatile at moments when there was -- all of these opportunities for the Secret Service head to answer questions --
 
MACE: Yeah.
 
COATES: -- the most basic level of which had been already reported. You expressed your sincere frustration, let me say, when you described her as being full of shit, was the phrase that you used.
 
MACE: Yeah.
 
COATES: Tell me what got you to that point and what were you hoping she would answer.
 
MACE: Well, I had watched an hour and a half of questioning by both Democrats and Republicans alike and nobody getting an answer. She wouldn't even tell us how many Secret Service agents were on the ground at the Trump rally that day, literally. And you could hear the frustration not just in Republican voices but in Democrats, too, I was simply airing and publicizing the emotion that I think everybody was feeling. I just said aloud what everyone else was thinking.
 
COATES: It was a rare moment of unanimity. I will admit on that point. Did you get a sense as to why she wouldn't give the answers? Is it because there's an active investigation going on? She constantly referred you to the FBI. Is there some reason behind the scenes that the American public would not be privy to as to why it might be obvious to her that she cannot convey information and not obvious to you?
 
MACE: Well, she made a lot of excuses, and she would talk in generalities. Well, I can talk in general about this. It was clear that she has been coached pretty much for all of the last nine days. Coached into not answering the questions. And so, many of us called for her resignation today. If she won't resign, she should be fired. I actually just minutes ago filed a privileged motion to impeach her, and that privileged motion will force a vote in the next 48 hours, like, I'm tired of --
 
COATES: Do you have support for that from the other side of the aisle as well?
 
MACE: Well, I'm hearing from my members tonight who want to be added to it. If you called for her resignation, then you should vote for her impeachment. This isn't difficult. This isn't a gotcha moment. This is a defining moment for our country. I don't care who's president. I don't care your political party. You should be protected. Even RFK, Jr. should get Secret Service protection. This should never happen in America. It just shouldn't.
 
And so, we want to make sure that when folks do something wrong, that they're held accountable. She has not been held to account. She is not taking responsibility. She is not being transparent or forward with the Oversight Committee. She has not given a single piece of information to the Oversight Committee that we've asked for. That's wrong. She ought to be kicked out for it. And I expect to get -- I hope that we'll get bipartisan support. If us on both sides of the aisle say she's got to go, let's force her to go.
 
COATES: Congresswoman Nancy Mace, thank you for joining me.
 
MACE: Thank you.
 
COATES: Well, we've just heard Congresswoman Nancy Mace testing out attacks against Harris, but what's the Trump campaign's plan of attack? The reporter with the scoop is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:38:40]
 
COATES: So, is the honeymoon period over before it really began? The Bulwark's Marc Caputo learning tonight how the Trump campaign is planning to go after Kamala Harris, including railing against Biden's policies, accusing Harris of covering up Biden's health woes, slamming Harris's record as a prosecutor, and attacking her racist dog whistles, they say.
 
Well, Marc Caputo joins me now. Marc, good to see you. First of all, that last one, talk to me about these dog whistles you're talking about. We've heard them before but does the Trump campaign think this is a winning argument to voters?
 
MARC CAPUTO, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE BULWARK: Well, what they think and based on their polling is that if presented with a description of Kamala Harris's criminal justice record of in the Trump campaign's description of being soft on criminals, then yeah, that would be effective as part of a broader ad campaign.
 
COATES: I mean, a Trump advisor told you that they'll also be going after her record as a prosecutor, specifically, and they referred to a very controversial line of attack that George H.W. Bush took against Dukakis back in the 80's. And the advisor said they're going to go, I think the phrase was, after several Willie Horton's, in reference to some of Harris's cases. Explain to the audience what this means and why they think this could possibly work in 2024.
 <br>[23:40:00]
 
CAPUTO: Well, in 1988, when the first George Bush ran for president, an outside group attacked his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, because under Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts, a man named Willie Horton, who was a convicted murderer, was on work furlough from the prison and wandered away and wound up committing a rape and a serious brutal beating of the woman's -- the victim's boyfriend or fiance, and they use this as an attack on Dukakis as an example of him being soft on crime.
 
Now, Willie Horton happened to be Black. They showed Willie Horton's picture, and it was widely derided as racist. Jesse Jackson at the time had said that.
 
COATES: Uh-hmm.
 
CAPUTO: And nevertheless, it was an effective ad as part of a broader campaign. So fast forward now, and there are a number of different cases from when Kamala Harris was a prosecutor in San Francisco, that, in the Trump campaign's estimation, can have a similar effect in this race.
 
For instance, there was a young man who was 18. He was put on probation instead of imprisoned for a pretty brutal beating. And a year later, he wound up killing someone. And in the Trump campaign's estimation, this is an example of being soft on crime and an example of bad progressive justice policies.
 
The Harris campaign points out, look, this was a first-time offender, and he was sentenced to probation and sort of treated in accordance with the general policies of first-time offenders. So, they're going to litigate that.
 
There are a few other cases where she didn't pursue the death penalty for a cop killer and in another case, in 2020, she had supported a bail fund that later on, this was during the George Floyd period, later on had helped release or give bail to different people who went on to commit murders or were accused of murders and other serious crimes.
 
The Harris campaign points out, hey, look, she was trying to get non- violent people released from jail for protesting the George Floyd case. She wasn't doing this to release murderers. But this is campaign season, and this is what this is going to probably look like over the next few weeks or few months.
 
COATES: This is the danger when you try to paint with such a wide brush and not appreciate the -- I mean, as a former federal prosecutor myself, the idea of being accused of being soft on crime is stunning. But then, again, a Supreme Court justice, who is a known public defender, is also accused in similar fashion. It's a -- we'll be curious to see how this all plays out.
 
Mark, let me ask you. Trump insists it will be easier to beat Harris than maybe Biden. But how is he reacting to all of this buzz around her because -- I mean, the numbers are undeniable in terms of the money in the bank. I mean, more than, I think, 80 million bucks raised in a 24-hour period. Were there was an enthusiasm gap before? How is he reacting?
 
CAPUTO: He's not reacting as if this is great news. You know, Trump has taken his Truth Social media account and gone on a number of rants. Let's, I guess, say, generally speaking, he's not happy with it. Now, maybe he's taking a long view and believes that in the long term, he can beat her. He did celebrate today that polling does show him beating her in the swing states and theoretical match-ups.
 
But, to your point, it's undeniable that Vice President Harris brings a lot more energy to the Democrats than Joe Biden did. Privately, Trump advisors would admit. In fact, one of the -- I did quote him in the story, said, look, Biden was basically a vegetable. He couldn't string coherent, cogent, clear sentences together anymore. You know, anyone would have been better than him. Now, that's not to say that Kamala Harris is just anyone, but the reality is Kamala Harris is a much more formidable opponent against Donald Trump than Joe Biden was. The former president's reaction sorts of indicates that.
 
COATES: Well, if her prosecutor chops her any indication, she will have that burden of proof of proving that to the American people in the months ahead. Although truncated, are going to be very, very important to the overall landscape of democracy. Mark Caputo, thank you so much.
 
CAPUTO: Thank you, Laura. Appreciate it.
 
COATES: Up next, a deputy said that a woman charged at him with hot water. That's before he shot and killed her. But the body camera video appears to show a much different story. The victim's father along with attorney Ben Crump join me next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:49:01]
 
COATES: On July 6th, Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman living in Springfield, Illinois, called 911 for help, thinking that an intruder was inside of her home. Soon after the police arrived a little after midnight, one of them, Sangamon County Sheriff Deputy Sean Grayson, shot Massey dead. And today, we are seeing the body camera footage for the very first time. I have to warn you, what you are about to see is not only graphic, but disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEAN GRAYSON, DEPUTY, SANGAMON COUNTY: A stack right there maybe.
 
SONYA MASSEY, SHOOTING VICTIM: One second.
 
GRAYSON: (INAUDIBLE).
 
MASSEY: Let me get this. GRAYSON: We don't need a fire while we're here.
 
MASSEY: All right. Okay. Let me see.
 
GRAYSON: Okay.
 
MASSEY: Where you moving?
 
GRAYSON: Huh?
 
MASSEY: Where you going?
 
GRAYSON: Away from your hot steaming water.
 
MASSEY: Away from my hot steaming water?
 
GRAYSON: Yeah.
 
MASSEY: Oh, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.
 
GRAYSON: Huh?
 
MASSEY: I rebuke you in the name of --
 
GRAYSON: You better (bleep) not or I swear to God I'll (bleep) shoot you at your (bleep) face.
 <br>[23:50:01]
 
MASSEY: Okay, I'm sorry.
 
GRAYSON: Drop the (bleep) pot! Drop the (bleep) pot!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: What happened after this? Well, the body camera captured the other deputy saying he's going to get his medical kit to help. But Office Grayson responds, telling his partner, Massey wouldn't need medical help, saying, and I quote -- "No, she's done. You can go get it, but that's a head shot."
 
Grayson has since been indicted by a grand jury on three counts of first-degree murder, once count of aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct. He has entered a not guilty plea.
 
The sheriff's office has fired Grayson and is saying in a statement -- quote -- "It is clear the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards."
 
Now, I want to bring in James Wilburn, Sonya Massey's father. Also, with me is Ben Crump. He is the attorney representing Sonya Massey's family.
 
Sir, I'm so sorry that I'm meeting you this way. And this is your daughter, Sonya, and I'm so saddened to see what has happened. James, what is your reaction tonight to the body camera footage that we are seeing? I mean, your daughter, she had her hands up when she was shot at. What is your reaction?
 
JAMES WILBURN, FATHER OF SONYA MASSEY: Laura, I don't know. I am so glad that my doctor figured out I have bad heart. I suffered from congestive heart failure in 2022. I had quadruple heart bypass surgery.
 
COATES: Hmm.
 
WILBURN: I just don't think that my old heart can stood it. I'm just heartbroken. I can't believe (INAUDIBLE) law enforcement officer.
 
COATES: Sir, I understand that you didn't find out that it was the police who killed your daughter at first. How did you learn what truly happened to your beautiful Sonya?
 
WILBURN: My younger brother, Calvin, he said to me, what's Sonia's address? And I shared her address with him. And he said, brother, that was -- it says a deputy-involved shooting. I said, what are you talking about? A deputy-involved shooting. We were led to believe that the intruder or someone from the neighborhood may have killed her. We were absolutely shocked to find out that it was a deputy who shot her.
 
COATES: Ben, just hearing that, Benjamin Crumb, I mean, Officer Grayson says that, well, he's no longer, says that Sonia came at him with boiling water. But we watched that video just now. I mean, you can see in the video, he made no attempt to move away. This statement that she says that she rebukes him in the name of Jesus, it seemed to trigger something instead. I don't know the reaction and why it happened at that point. I mean, is there a circumstance where this would possibly be even a plausible defense that he could raise?
 
BEN CRUMP, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: I'm sure he's going to try to raise whatever justification to try to get away with this heinous killing of this innocent woman who called for help, who needed a helping hand, Laura, not a shot to her face. I mean, just like George Floyd video, he narrated what he was going to do. When she said, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus, he said, oh, no, you effing won't, I'm going to shoot you in your effing face. And then he did it, Laura. And it's so senseless. I mean, it is disturbing.
 
This video is reminiscent in the last presidential cycle in 2020 where the George Floyd video, you know, encouraged our community to act. And in this 2024 election, I believe this Sonya Massey video is going to encourage our community to act because Sonya Massey deserved better than this.
 
COATES: Um, let me speak to her father again. James, sir, I -- what can you tell me about your daughter, Sonya? Because I really want to know about who she was, not just about what has happened to her.
 
WILBURN: Sonya was a daddy's girl.
 
COATES: Hmm.
 
WILBURN: We never ended a conversation, whether by text or telephone or in person, without saying, Daddy, I love you. [23:55:03]
 
And that's the last message I have from my daughter, that saved on my voicemail, was, Daddy, I love you. But now, I know I won't see her again in this world. But there's another world that I will see her again. That's about it. You know, you're used to having to talk with boys. Now, I guess we have to talk to our girls about it. Other interactions with the police? Another loss.
 
COATES: It sounds like it's a loss to the world to have lost Sonya as well. We did reach out. CNN reached out to Grayson's attorney for comment as well. I want to thank you both. We will continue to follow this story. I'm very sorry for your loss, sir.
 
WILBURN: Thank you, Laura.
 
CRUMP: Say her name, Sonya Mason.
 
WILBURN: Sonya Massey.
 
COATES: Sonya Massey. Thank you both.
 
And thank you all for watching. "Anderson Cooper 360" is next.
