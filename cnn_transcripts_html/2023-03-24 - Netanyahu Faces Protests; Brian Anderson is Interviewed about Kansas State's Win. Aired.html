(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Those are protests following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to London. Check out the scene outside of Downing Street where Netanyahu just ignored questions from reporters. This comes after he said he is not backing down on his plan to significantly weaken Israel's Supreme Court in spite of weeks of angry protests. In a fiery speech on primetime television last night, he declared, quote, it is not the end of democracy, it is the strengthening of democracy. 
 
That is not all. His government, the parliament, yesterday, just narrowly passed a new law that limits ways to oust a sitting prime minister or declare them unfit for office. His critics are condemning it, saying it's just an effort to protect his own job. Remember, Netanyahu is still in the middle of an ongoing corruption trial.
 
So, let's bring in our Jake Tapper, CNN chief Washington correspondent, anchor of "THE LEAD" and "STATE OF THE UNION," because, Jake, you just sat down for that long primetime interview with Netanyahu. 
 <br>[08:35:06]
 
And now this, defiance.
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Yes. HARLOW: Says, I'm going to - was doing all these things that help him. 
 
TAPPER: Well, it's interesting because the attorney general of Israel has said that Netanyahu is breaking the law.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
TAPPER: Because there was a court mandated conflict of -- conflict of interest agreement when his government formed in which he agreed to not do anything related to the judiciary, given the fact that he's on trial for these separate corruption charges. And he seems to not be, at least according to the attorney general of Israel, adhering to that agreement, by actually taking steps to weaken the judiciary. The move that just happened, obviously, makes it tougher for judges, for judiciary to remove a prime minister. And actually he now, after that law passed, and Netanyahu said that his hands are no longer tied. So, there is a brazenness about this, and I guess we'll see how it plays out in terms of Netanyahu trying to weaken the independent judiciary in Israel. 
 
LEMON: Jake, I want to talk to you about something else because I can't wait to -- to see this tonight. Has this -- something that has a huge cultural impact. You sat down with the star and the co-creator of the smash hit "Ted Lasso." I mean, everyone is talking about "Ted Lasso," right. Jason Sudeikis is who I'm talking about. This is an interview that's going to air tonight, 9:00 on CNN. It's -- let's preview the conversation, then we'll get your response. 
 
Here it is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Since I've known you, you've always been very in touch with your humanity. You've always been very in touch with, like -- and acknowledging of insecurities, imposter syndrome. 
 
JASON SUDEIKIS, STAR AND CO-CREATOR, "TED LASSO": True.
 
TAPPER: I mean, you talk very openly about this.
 
SUDEIKIS: Sure.
 
TAPPER: And it's such a part of the DNA of Ted Lasso. 
 
SUDEIKIS: Yes.
 
TAPPER: Why? Like, what does that come from? 
 
SUDEIKIS: I think again this innate sense that we're all more, you know, similar than sometimes we're allowed to feel or want to feel.
 
There is something worse out there than being sad, and that is being alone and being sad. Ain't nobody in this room alone.
 
And I don't think I was always that way. Or maybe I was, but I would only share it with a few people. Sometimes maybe people I didn't know that. But I also didn't want to burden folks with it, you know? And I think any of us can feel that way where we don't want to burden our stuff with other people because we don't think we're worthy of it, we don't think they want to hear it, and I still struggle with it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: So, this is more relatable to, I think, everyone, especially coming out of Covid, right, and dealing with -- we still don't know the impact of mental health issues following Covid. But it's something that many of us on the air have been very transparent about, depression, getting therapy and so on and so forth. I don't think it was a surprise to you that Jason Sudeikis would admit that, imposter syndrome, and such and such. I think many, many people suffer from issues like that. 
 
TAPPER: Yes, and I think it's one of the reasons why Jason has been so successful in this role, taking what was kind of just a funny ad campaign idea in 2013 and taking -- and turning it into this award- winning show. It's only been -- there have only been two seasons and they've already won 11 Emmys and broken records for premieres on Apple TV Plus. And I think it's that humanity, the acknowledgement of the humanity, that comes through in Ted Lasso that is one of the reasons why, especially emerging as it did in 2020, in the midst of Covid, in the midst of a pretty nasty political season, why so many people have found comfort in it, why it has become such a cultural phenomenon.
 
LEMON: Yes. And they were just at the White House discussing the issue -
 
HARLOW: Oh, on mental health.
 
LEMON: On mental health, talking about this, I mean even elevating the issue even more. 
 
TAPPER: Yes. No, it's remarkable. And we talked about that, too. Obviously Jason, when he was on "SNL," he would play Joe Biden. I thought rather hilariously. I thought his -- I thought his Biden was the best Bidens of all the Bidens. But, of course, it was a different Biden. It was the 2008 Biden, not the 2023 Biden. But -- so that was interesting, too, that he got to -- that he had this encounter with President Biden, who he had played to hilarious effect previously. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: I can't wait to see it tonight. 
 
LEMON: Yes. My favorite Jason Sudeikis "SNL" was the tracksuit and the gold chain backup dancer. That's my favorite one. 
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
Jake, can't wait.
 
HARLOW: Thank you. TAPPER: On what up with that. What a classic.
 
LEMON: Yes, what up - what up with that. What up with that.
 
Thank you. It's good to see you, Jake. We'll be watching this weekend. Have a great weekend, all right.
 
TAPPER: See you, guys. 
 
DLL: All right, we'll be watching tonight as well. 
 
HARLOW: Bye.
 
TAPPER: Thank you. 
 
LEMON: Jake's sit down interview with Jason Sudeikis airs on CNN - CNN primetime. That's tonight, 9:00 Eastern.
 
HARLOW: Well, from one funny man to another, this weekend, only here on CNN, you can also watch Adam Sandler received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. A preview is next.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Gee, I can't wait until I go to high school.
 <br>[08:40:02]

ADAM SANDLER, ACTOR: Are you too good for your home? Answer me.
 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Shut up.

HARLOW: So many classic moments, right? Adam Sandler has created some of the most iconic movies and characters in comedy. He's an actor, comedian, producer, musician, and now he is a recipient of the 2023 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor that recognizes individuals who had an impact on American society. For more than three decades, Adam Sandler has made all of us laugh, first bursting onto the scene and quickly becoming a favorite on "Saturday Night Live."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADAM SANDLER, ACTOR: Put on your yamakawa (ph), here comes Hanukkah. So much funaka (ph) to celebrate Hanukkah. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[08:45:05]
 
HARLOW: On the big screen he was the master -- is the master at playing goofy but lovable guy next door characters, also delivers complex characters in one of my favorite movies when he was a ruthless diamond dealer in "Uncut Gems" and an NBA scout for the Philadelphia 76ers in "Hustle," also a great movie. 
 
Through it all, Sandler remains an artist his co-stars admire. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like in a great way he's already cemented his place in comedy history.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's always been very, very real. And I think that's what people really connect with. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have to have a number one, he is. Nobody's lasted this long with this big a career. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think, you know, his comedy will live on for generations. So, some day they'll be giving the Adam Sandler award.
 
ADAM SANDLER, ACTOR, COMEDIAN: My father was the man who showed me comedy growing up. He showed me the Marx Brothers and Jerry Lewis. 
 
My dad always told me I could work for him. He'd say - he'd say to me, try it out a year or two. If it doesn't go well, you become an electrical contractor with me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Sunday night you can watch Sandler receive his honor with some of his famous friends, including co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Judd Apatow, Drew Barrymore, all on CNN, 8:00 p.m. Sunday night. 
 
LEMON: Can't wait to watch that.
 
HARLOW: Cannot wait.
 
LEMON: So, it's in the name, right? There were some sweet -
 
HARLOW: Nice one.
 
LEMON: Wins during the Sweet Sixteen rounds of March Madness. We're breaking down the major wins and the mad upsets. That's next.
 
HARLOW: Do you watch (INAUDIBLE).
 
LEMON: No, I mean, I'm - I'm a sports fan. I'm just - HARLOW: I know you are, but -
 
LEMON: (INAUDIBLE) -
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:50:58]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRIAN ANDERSON, WBD SPORTS COMMENTATOR: Walker (ph). Walker, and he's stripped by Nowell. The ball is loose. Nowell comes out of the pack. Nowell dribbles and he (INAUDIBLE) it in. Count the basket and Kansas State wins it. The Wildcats are headed for the Elite Eight. What a game.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: I wonder who's mellifluous voice that is.
 
HARLOW: Whose voice was that?
 
LEMON: Who's that? Third seeded Kansas State took down seventh seed Michigan State in a thrilling Sweet Sixteen classic. I can't do it like that. The Wildcats clawing their way to the Elite Eight in overtime. 
 
Joining us now, the man whose voice you just heard calling the action is Brian Anderson, play by play announcer covering the tournament with -- just down the street at Madison Square Garden here in New York City. 
 
Hello. 
 
Do you get - welcome. 
 
BRIAN ANDERSON, WBD SPORTS COMMENTATOR: Thank you.
 
LEMON: You said you're not usually up this early, so let me get your energy up.
 
ANDERSON: We're second shifters, Don. You got me up way too early. I got it at midnight last night, but it's good. 
 
LEMON: Do you get caught up in the emotion when you're doing it?
 
ANDERSON: Oh, yes. Of course.
 
LEMON: Because you can't fake that, right? 
 
ANDERSON: No, you're in it. That's the beauty of it. That's why I wanted to do this job in the first place is to be in the scene. You know, feel the energy of the scene. And just all that comes with it. And it's -- you get totally wrapped up in it. 
 
They've been putting these cameras on us, you know? They've been showing the announcers. Kevin Harlan (ph) had one that kind of blew up on social. So, I'm a little hesitant to be seen in the moment like this. 
 
But, yes, this was some game. And one of the best games I've seen, I've been doing the tournament since 2012. This Kansas State/Michigan State game was right up there with one of the best I've ever seen and called. It was -- it was something. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: How about that moment?
 
ANDERSON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: The Wildcats star point guard Markquis Nowell. And there's this moment, let's play it as we talk about it. Why don't you walk through people, what's happening here? 
 
ANDERSON: Well, OK. So, there's two versions of it. Was it a bit (ph)? That's the question. They said after the game, Jerome Tang, the head coach, and Markquis Nowell said, no, they were actually arguing, and then he saw his teammate, backdoor cut, and he through the lob to him. But, I don't know, it may have looked like a little bit of a play, playing a little possum. You get the defense to fall asleep, and then, boom. So, its artistry. It's a beautiful play. And it was a key play in the game as well. 
 
What do you guys think? You think it was fake?
 
LEMON: Whatever it was, it worked. I mean can we -- if we can play it again because at - look, you can see a lot of things out -- things out of your periphery. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes.
 
LEMON: He doesn't exactly look over.
 
HARLOW: It doesn't look like he looks over, right?
 
LEMON: But, I mean, he's -
 
HARLOW: Barely.
 
ANDERSON: I mean this is like Broadway's right down the road, are they acting?
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Are they -- is it real? It was -- it was a monumental moment. And I think it certainly took Michigan State by surprise. 
 
LEMON: Did it surprise you?
 
ANDERSON: Yes, it did, because I'm thinking, there may be a time out here. They're -- they're - they're arguing while the point guard is dribbling up the floor. HARLOW: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: That's somewhat normal, but to be able to spring it into action that quick and then fire that lob (ph).
 
HARLOW: And -
 
LEMON: He had an amazing game.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
LEMON: But -- that's like Markquis Nowell, he had - what, he's a record all-time -
 
HARLOW: Nineteen assists.
 
LEMON: Nineteen assists. He's from Harlem.
 
ANDERSON: Poppy dropping stats.
 
LEMON: Right here in New York City.
 
HARLOW: I mean the producers wrote it on the sheet. 
 
LEMON: Yes, we're -
 
HARLOW: Can we -- are we really - are we --
 
LEMON: I'm trying to read the stats without my glasses.
 
ANDERSON: Put the glasses on, Don.
 
LEMON: I know, I'm like, wait a minute. Let me look.
 
ANDERSON: You can just ask. I (INAUDIBLE) -
 
HARLOW: I mean really - are you really going to pretend that I know what happened last night.
 
LEMON: (INAUDIBLE).
 
ANDERSON: So he set a record for assists in a game. Assists when you set up your teammate for a point. So, he scored 20 himself, but he actually assisted 19.
 
HARLOW: Did you just define assistant for me?
 
ANDERSON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: OK, I do know that. 
 
ANDERSON: OK.
 
LEMON: And he just scolded me. Put on your glasses, Don.
 
ANDERSON: Based on our earlier conversation, I thought we were going to have to peel off a couple layers there.
 
HARLOW: We need - we needed Kaitlan.
 
ANDERSON: But, anyway, so, he also had five steals. When you take a ball away from the other team.
 
HARLOW: OK, OK, OK, OK. 
 
ANDERSON: So, he had the steel at the end of the game that basically secured the game. So, one team scored more points than the other, and that's how you get a breakaway (ph).
 
HARLOW: Oh, my God, I'm leaving.
 
ANDERSON: So, anyway, that's how it ended. So, he ended up making a layup at the end of the game for a five-point win. So, if you're a gambler, that might have an effect. But -
 
LEMON: Didn't you ask -- was that yesterday or the day before -- what a transport portal was?
 
HARLOW: Yes. Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Oh, a transfer portal.
 
HARLOW: Yes. I was like -- we had this -
 
ANDERSON: Oh, you don't know about the transfer portal.
 
LEMON: It's kind of - it's kind of self-explanatory, Poppy.
 
HARLOW: I was like, what are they talking about? I hope they don't come to me next.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, they're Star Treky.
 <br>[08:55:03]
 
LEMON: Are we up for a -
 
ANDERSON: We'll get into it. 
 
LEMON: Any upsets or surprises tonight? 
 
ANDERSON: Oh, I mean, we're always up for it in the tournament. That's why it's the madness. I think, you know, Princeton's going to be fun to watch tonight. The two number one seeds are in play tonight. Alabama and Houston. 
 
So, there's been a lot of turnover. There's been teams -- mid majors teams that -- like Florida Atlantic, who won our second game last night -
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Is now in the Elite eight and will match up against Kansas State (INAUDIBLE). 
 
HARLOW: Can you say something nice about Alabama for Kaitlan, because she's gone today.
 
ANDERSON: Of course. Well, they're the overall number one seed. They are the team that is expected to win the national championship. 
 
HARLOW: To win. I -- I know what that means. 
 
ANDERSON: So, they have all the pressure.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Brian. 
 
LEMON: Thank you. Thank you, Brian. 
 
ANDERSON: Good to be here.
 
LEMON: Appreciate it. Have a great weekend.
 
HARLOW: You were great.
 
LEMON: And we'll be watching and listening, most of all. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes.
 
LEMON: Thank you so much.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, and Poppy's dialed in the stats. Nice going.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
Hey, we got some developing news that we need to get to now.
 
Moments ago, check it out, this is Trump attorney Evan Corcoran arriving to court in Washington, D.C. He was denied attorney/client privilege in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case and is being compelled to testify. OK. So, we're going to be following that and much, much more. And, guess what, it's going to happen starting next on CNN "newsroom" right after this break. 
 
Have a great weekend, everyone. Thanks for joining us all week.
