KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN HOST: Hello, and welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. Ahead on CNN Newsroom.

ANDREW HYDE, STUCK AT BURNING MAN: The man was supposed to burn actually in an hour. And right now there's no burns tonight, because there's no vehicle traffic going and there's -- you know, we're still pretty much sheltering in place.

BRUNHUBER: Thick ankle-deep mud and about two months' worth of rain has brought Nevada's Burning Man to a standstill. And it's not the only severe weather people need to look out for this holiday weekend. 
 
Plus, Canada's warning to LGBTQ plus residents about the risks of traveling to America. We'll look at their reasons why. And the death of an American statesman. We remember the life and legacy of former governor and Ambassador Bill Richardson.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber.
 
BRUNHUBER: We begin this hour with extreme weather happening across the U.S. this Labor Day holiday weekend. Blistering heat will be spreading from the plains across the East Sunday and into Labor Day. Nearly 100-degree temperatures roll reach as far north as the Dakotas and Minnesota. Record heat is expected to spread into the Northeast Monday as Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City all climb above 90 degrees. 
 
Meanwhile, monsoon rains bring the threat of flooding to the intermountain west including Oregon, Nevada, Idaho and Utah. We get more details now from CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Labor Day weekend usually marks the unofficial end of summer but Mother Nature didn't quite get that memo as much of the central U.S. is going to be dealing with above average temperatures. And then as we finish out the weekend, and start the early next week, you're going to start to see a lot of that heat begin to spread into the Northeast as well as into the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. 
 
Take for example a lot of these cities Omaha, Green Bay and Chicago, all looking at temperatures in the 90s over the next several days. And they're not the only one. Minneapolis for example, the average high this time of year is 78 degrees. The forecast on Sunday, expected to reach triple digits now not only will that break the daily record of 97 set back in 1925. It could also end up being only the second time ever in recorded history for Minneapolis, reaching the triple digits in the month of September. The previous was all the way back in 1931 when they hit 104 degrees. 
 
Now, that's one of the few spots that are going to end up reaching records. In fact, we're looking at over 100 possible records not just in the Midwest, but also spreading into the Northeast and the Mid Atlantic just over the next several days. 
 
Looking at the northeast, for example in New York, looking at the next several days, all with highs in the 90s the average right now is 81. Washington D.C. 90s, the next few days likely to top out at 100 by the time we get to Tuesday of the upcoming week. 
 
And again, you can see this trend where all of that excessive heat those above average temperatures are not really expected to last the next few days. We don't really see things cool off until we get to next weekend in many of these locations.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: All from heat to rain, bad weather has turned the Burning Man festival into a muddy mess. And now we've learned one person has died at the remote location in Nevada. But we don't have many details. Tens of thousands of people are stranded at the event and they're being told to conserve food and water as the site has become a quagmire visible even from space. Andrew Hyde is stuck there. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HYDE: When it was really wet, you couldn't do anything you just lived here. There's really no way to walk miles, you know, to get out of it. So that's a bit concerning, but it's a survival event. Like you come out here to be in in a harsh climate, you need to prepare for that. 
 
So many ways, everybody here just kind of made friends with their neighbors. It's a community event. So event about art and you just kind of went back to the roots. I think almost everybody really enjoyed having it be extremely harsh and we don't know what's going to happen tonight though, and that's the big concern because we might have just as much rain tonight. And if you couple that with last night's then we have a pretty big story and a pretty hard time getting out of the city collectively because those 70,000 people have to go out on the same road.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: Now, the ankle-deep mud Andrew just mentioned is the result of two to three months' worth of rain falling in just one day. More than 70,000 people normally attend the free spirit of counterculture event. Organizers are telling those who haven't arrived yet to turn around. Burning Man usually concludes with a figure set of flame minutes protected or bonfire. Organizers say burns at the sites are postponed the least for now.

President Biden visited storm ravaged Florida on Saturday in the wake of Hurricane Idalia, accompanied by the First Lady. Biden viewed damage and met with people who were impacted by the storm. Along with those working to help recovery efforts. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis didn't join the President's tour but another key Florida Republican did. CNN's Isabel Rosales reports from Florida.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Biden giving remarks out of Live Oak Florida community just under 7000 people in area hard hit by this hurricane Suwannee County. He was surrounded by First Lady Jill Biden and also the FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.
 
And we heard from the President, giving remarks showing his commitment to supporting the people of Florida, those in need. He said whatever they need, the federal government will supply. He also spoke about the federal resources that have been helping out residents, those who have lost or have had damage to their homes or businesses. Also talking about the national guard on the ground helping folks out with millions of meals and federal search and rescue teams that were on the ground here right after the storm hit. 
 
He surveyed the aftermath of this most powerful hurricane to hit the Big Bend area of Florida. And over 100 years, he saw that from an aerial tour. He saw thousands of homes that were damaged here in the Big Bend area. And he also did a tour on the ground. He spoke with survivors. And also met personnel and first responders who have been helping out with that recovery process including an areas like this, like this point of distribution, where we see the Florida State Guard, a newly activated forced by Governor Ron DeSantis. We're seeing them loading up these cars, and people who need a little bit of help right now with food, with water, with ice and with tarps to help out in that recovery process. 
 
And the President also thanking Republican Senator Rick Scott for keeping his office informed as to what happened. Here's what else the President had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: These crises are affecting more and more Americans. And every American rightly expects FEMA to show up when they're needed and to help in a disaster. So I'm calling on the United States Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to ensure the funding is there to deal with the immediate crises, as well as our long-term commitments to the safety and security of the America people.
 
ROSALES: Now, the one person we didn't see next to the President is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. There was a misstep here between the two potential rivals for the 2024 presidential race, with a spokesperson to DeSantis saying that there were no plans in place for the Governor, to join the President, a contradiction to earlier comments that we heard from Biden, on Friday.
 
Also the spokesperson for DeSantis saying in these rural communities, and so soon after impact the security preparations alone, that would go into setting up such a meeting would shut down ongoing recovery efforts. But FEMA Administrator Criswell, Speaking to CNN said that there was, "tremendous coordination" that had happened in multiple conversations between the White House and DeSantis' office and that they had mutually agreed on a place with minimal impacts to operations. But as we saw no Governor Ron DeSantis next to the President. Isabel Rosales in Live Oak, Florida, CNN.

BRUNHUBER: For the first time in four years a typhoon has made landfall in Taiwan. Haikui is battering the island right now. Last report from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the storm has sustained winds of 120 miles per hour, equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. It's also dumping heavy rain that could trigger flash floods and landslides. Authorities have canceled flights, evacuated residents, mobilized troops and suspended work and school in vulnerable areas. 
 
Let's get more now from journalist Andy Lee live in Taipei. So Andy, what are conditions there like right now and how bad is expected to get?
 
ANDREW LEE, JOURNALIST: Situation is securing rating as we speak. And Typhoon Haikui has already made landfall in the eastern part of Taiwan, in an area called Taitung. The eye of the storm have landed on Taiwan. And right now heavy rain and strong winds are enveloping the entirety of the island. Even the radius didn't cover the entire island where I'm standing now in Taipei, it is not within the radius. However, the cloud system has enveloped the entire island including where I'm standing. You can hear the wind and you can see the tree swaying here in Taipei City, a northern city in Taiwan. 
 
Now, 9300 households are experiencing blackouts right now and two people so far are injured. There were a couple of driving event. Van was hit by a fallen tree. Van was damaged and they were sent to a hospital. Unfortunately, the injuries were not fatal. 
 <br>[05:10:13] And as far as transportations are concerned, the high-speed train service has been disrupted. Airports are closed, 226 domestic flights canceled, 41 international flights canceled.
 
Now, Kim, in nearby Hong Kong, Typhoon Saola as of now has already died down to a tropical storm. Before then it caused 86 injuries in Hong Kong. Now, as of Saturday 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, the reports are stating that there are 1500 incidents of cases where there are fallen trees, 21 reporting cases of floods and two cases of landslides. So right now in Hong Kong, the city is in cleanup mode because Typhoon Saola is down to a tropical storm. 
 
Now before that, Kim, there were three typhoons. Typhoon Saola, Hong Kong, Typhoon Haikui right now in Taiwan and up north near Japan, Typhoon Kirogi, they're all interacting with each other. Back to you, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, thanks so much Andy Lee in Taipei. 
 
Ukraine's leaders say their counter offensive is regaining territory, but formal Russian defenses are slowing the advance. We'll have live update from London just ahead. 
 
And Ukrainian children are beginning a new school year with the threat of Russian attacks never far away. We'll have those details when we come back. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:15:24]
 
BRUNHUBER: Ukraine says its troops are continuing their slow advance in the south against Russian forces dug in along the front lines. Russian backed officials in the Donetsk region say one person was killed and nine wounded by Ukrainian shelling villages there. 
 
Ukraine's leaders are pushing back against criticism that the three- month-old counter offensive is moving too slowly. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on social media, "no matter what anyone says we are advancing." 
 
Now, drone footage shows Ukrainian forces capturing a village in the south about one week ago and as you can see, there is not much left of the town. And this is what Ukrainian forces are up against heavy anti- tank fortifications called Dragon Teeth, as well as trenches and landmines. CNN's Katie Polglase is monitoring developments for us in London. And Katie, we're getting word of two new attacks overnight in Ukraine's Kherson and Donetsk regions. What more can you tell us?
 
KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER: Well, Kim, this is another reminder that Russia really has had air superiority in this conflict. And it is why Ukraine's President Zelenskyy has been so desperate really to get more air supplies, more weaponry from their Western allies, such as the F-16 fighter jets that they finally secured from the Netherlands and Denmark and others. It is because of these kinds of attacks. Russia has continued throughout this conflict to shell and do aerial
 
 bombardment across a wide range of different parts of Ukraine. And what we've seen last night you mentioned Kherson, there was also a targeting of Odessa, the port in the South that wounded two after a fire and the port broke out. And it's also a reminder of the civilian toll of this conflict. These are civilians that were wounded and injured. One person killed in Kherson; six others wounded as well. Two people also killed in the Ukrainian-controlled area of Donetsk, two others wounded as well, a cultural center was damaged, a cemetery was also damaged. This is the civilian toll of this conflict continuing. And that is important to remember, because while Ukraine is focusing on its land counter offensive on the southern front lines, these aerial attacks by Russia are clearly continuing.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, Katie, you mentioned the counter offensive there, as I touched on a little earlier again, we heard more pushback from Ukraine on the state of the counter offensive?
 
POLGLASE: Yes, absolutely. And this counter offensive is clearly making a lot of headlines because of its pace, how fast it's going, is it going fast enough? And there's clearly been some frustration from some of the Ukrainian leadership. You mentioned comments from Zelenskyy there about that they are moving forward. They are still progressing. 
 
And he's probably referencing there, the fact that there has been some comments from Western allies, Western officials saying that the pace of this counter offensive is not as fast as they would have hoped. But it is because that this area is incredibly challenging. The land is heavily mined by the Russians, these deeply fortified trenches, this network of tunnels. It is something that Russia has great expertise in. They are very good at creating these long lines of defensive barriers. And that is what Ukraine is up against. 
 
But clearly also, Ukraine has started to make some progress in the last week or so, recapturing that village of Urozhayne, and now also continuing to press on as Zelenskyy is insisting. And I think that is really what Ukraine is trying to say that this is a difficult task on land. Russia is very well-equipped to create these defensive barriers. But yet still that they are still progressing and still moving into new territory. Kim?
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, thanks so much Katie Polglase in London. 
 
Now, the threat of Russian missiles and bombs hasn't stopped Ukrainians from sending their children back to school. But the danger is real so authorities and parents have taken dramatic steps to make students as safe as possible. CNN's Paul Newton has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Back to School in Kyiv. There are the usual jitters before any new beginning. But with mom leading the way and a backpack full of supplies, eight-year-old Alexei says he's happy to return to class. His mother Mariia says she too is excited despite the dangers from the
 
 ongoing war with Russia. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 missile strikes and artillery attacks on residential areas have become a part of daily life in Ukraine, Ukraine says 84% of its schools now have operational bomb shelters. And Alexei says he's one of them. 
 
MARIIA DOLOBAN, MOTHER OF 8-YEAR-OLD STUDENT (through translator): My child has been studying online for a year and I realized that it was very difficult for him. He felt lonely. He could communicate with other children screen to screen but it's different. There's a proper bomb shelter in our school sweating he will be safe there.
 <br>[05:20:09]
 
NEWTON: Being safe is something that weighs heavily on parents in Ukraine. UNICEF says more than 1300 schools have now been destroyed across the country. And because of frequent attacks, only a third of school aged children attend class full time and in person. That's something that was just too dangerous for many students in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, with the Russian border not far away. 
 
Recently, some children did go back to classrooms built in underground metro stations that can accommodate about 1000 students. Many parents say it's just in time as they're worried children are forgetting some of the basics.
 
VIKTORIA, MOTHER OF FIRST-GRADER (through translator): My daughter used to go to kindergarten before the war broke out. Then she attended classes via zoom for a long period of time. We decided to attend classes in the underground because we want our child to know what the school is, what a desk is. 
 
NEWTON: Back in Kyiv, Alexei shows his mother a drawing he made of a different type of basic necessities. It shows a medical kit, thermal blanket, clothes, torch, and candies. All things packed in an emergency backpack used by Alexei and his mother, when they took shelter during an air raid. Tough life lessons all around for Ukraine's children, whether it's just getting to school, or learning how to live in a time of war. Paula Newton, CNN.

BRUNHUBER: All right, coming up here on CNN Newsroom, an American statesman with a passion for diplomacy and for bringing home Americans detained abroad has died. Bill Richardson's story live next.
 
Plus, more than 100 people including almost 50 police officers are hurt in a clash in Tel Aviv, we'll take you live to Israel to explain how a controversial foreign governments holiday celebration turned into a violent confrontation. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:25:33]
 
BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom. 
 
People across the United States are honoring longtime public servant Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. died in asleep Friday. He was 75. 
 
And his long career as a statesman, Richardson is perhaps best known and revered for his work while he wasn't technically employed by the United States. He made countless trips to hostile nations like Iran, Iraq and North Korea negotiating the release of Americans detained and held hostage abroad. 
 
Now, few people know how difficult Richardson work was then my next guest Diane Foley, she created the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation in honor of her son James, who was kidnapped and killed by ISIS in Syria. The foundation works to improve the way the U.S. handles hostages overseas. 
 
And Diane Foley joins me now from Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. Thank you so much for being here with us. So just to start off, I mean, what did Richardson mean to the families of Americans imprisoned abroad?
 
DIANE FOLEY, MOTHER OF JOURNALIST JAMES FOLEY: We have truly lost hero, man who gave his years to help hopeless feeling American families whose loved ones were wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad. He -- when he started the Richardson Center, this was all pro bono work on behalf of families. So it is a huge loss for our community.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. What made him special, I mean, how was he able to accomplish so much on this front?
 
FOLEY: He had courage -- he had -- he was a man of incredible moral courage. There wasn't anyone he was afraid to approach and talk to the half of U.S. nationals who are being held by that person. So he was willing to engage with folks, whether it was North Korea, Afghanistan, Colombia. He was willing to negotiate with anyone. And he had a very good way of connecting. So it was quite unusual. He was not afraid to engage with governments that our government normally would have no interaction with at all.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, you know very well, the challenges on this front. I mean, tell us about why this type of work is so difficult?
 
FOLEY: It is difficult because our government cannot do everything. I mean there are -- particularly when countries, nation states, take our people, target us as Americans and then hold us prisoner, they seek to interfere with our foreign policy, economy and travel. So our government often cannot do what captors want in exchange for the lives of our people. But Bill Richardson was willing to go talk to anybody and see if there was any venue of, where poor or need that he could work with to free people. So he was quite incredible, never charging anything to any family. So quite remarkable.
 
BRUNHUBER: You touched a couple of times there on the government and you've often spoken about, you know, the frustration of family feels when having to work with the government to free a loved one. I mean, you -- you didn't get a chance to turn to Richardson in your particular case. Did it feel like you and -- and other families like yours, were kind of working alone there?
 
FOLEY: Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's -- it's our government has -- is working harder and trying very hard to work on this issue. But as a family, Bill Richardson gave a family hope. And he did that for over 80 families. So over the years very complex negotiations and dangerous missions if you will.
 <br>[05:30:01]
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah.
 
FOLEY: He and his Vice President Mickey Bergman whom I worked with and have very closely for years.
 
BRUNHUBER: You've noticed sometimes that there's --there's friction between people, not in government like Richardson, and, you know, the administration. Why is that if everyone should be sort of, you know, pulling together to work towards the same goal?
 
FOLEY: Well, it's -- it's difficult, you know, our government is trying to protect the interests of the American people in general. And whereas, nonprofits like the Richardson Center and Bill Richardson, are willing to do whatever it takes for an individual citizen in need of freedom. So there are inevitably moments when that's going to collide. And however, he was considered one of the most trusted partners outside of government working on these issues. So there was a remarkable report also. It's just going to happen in those situations.
 
BRUNHUBER: What do you think his legacy will be?
 
FOLEY: I truly think in spite of the fact he was Congressman, for years, he was the New Mexico governor, Ambassador to the U.N., in spite of all his years of public service, his biggest legacy is his courage and commitment to those desperate U.S. nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad. He was willing to go to all lengths to find freedom for them. So truly a hero in my -- you know, he had been nominated for the Nobel Prize many times in recognition of his heroism.
 
BRUNHUBER: And -- 
 
FOLEY: Truly a great American.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely. And his loss will be keenly felt. And you in some capacities with your foundation are helping to continue his legacy. So, so many families will thank you for that as well. Really appreciate getting your insights on -- on really an American hero. Diane Foley, thank you so much. 
 
FOLEY: Thank you, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: And for more information on Diane's work and how you can help Americans who are being held hostage and detained overseas, you can go to the James foleyfoundation.org. 
 
Israel's Prime Minister says he's formed a ministerial task force to look for illegal infiltrators after a violent confrontation in Tel Aviv between rival Eritrean groups that left more than 100 people injured. The violence erupted after supporters and opponents of the Eritrean government clashed in an event marking the country's revolution day. Police fired stun grenades, and some officers who felt their lives were being threatened fired live rounds. CNN's Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem for us. So Hadas, explain what's behind this?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this is sort of a unique story because while protests and clashes in this region are not unusual, this is actually more about another country, another country's issues that happens to be happening within Israel. We've seen similar clashes between Pro and anti-Eritrean government. 
 
Protesters take place in other countries over the last few weeks just in the last few weeks. It's happened in Sweden, in Germany and in Norway with similar results. Although what happened on Saturday seems to have been the most violent that we've seen in recent weeks. So what happens is that similar to those European countries in Israel, there are 1000s of Eritrean migrants.
 
Now, many of them are asylum seekers, Eritrea, it's been its ranks very low on human rights indexes, in the Global Press Freedom Index. It's one of the like the lowest of the three that you can get to. And so many asylum seekers if they fear going back. 
 
Now, what happened on Saturday is that the Eritrean government was hosting an Independence Day, revolution day celebration at their Embassy in Tel Aviv. Now, some of the Eritrean community had already warned Israeli authorities trying to get them to cancel the event because they said protesters were going to come and try and break this up. Many of these anti-government protests feel that it's a celebration celebrating what they call a dictator, and it's a source of anger for that. And that's what happened. These protesters came and there was heavy clashes between the pro regime and the anti-regime protesters heavy police force, I saw helicopter hovering over southern Tel Aviv yesterday. There was more than 100 people injured including dozens of police officers. There was extensive damage to property and vehicles in the area. And as of this morning, at least 15 people, according to Israeli media, are still hospitalized in serious condition at least including two police officers. 
 
Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come out saying that this was absolutely on acceptable. He called a red line that was being crossed and has formed a ministerial committee to look at potentially deporting some of those people who were involved in these riots. Take a listen.
 <br>[05:35:10]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Therefore, the first thing I do is to wish recovery to the police officers who were injured during the attempts to restore order. We asked for strong measures against the rioters, including the immediate deportation of those who took part in this. I have a hard time understanding why we would have problems deporting those who declare themselves to be supporters of the regime. So they certainly cannot make a claim of refugees.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLD: Now, other officials and other European governments that have also experienced these protesters have made similar comments about looking into these asylum seekers and whether they could be up for deportation. There'll be quite a process for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu government to go through before that could take place. But it seemed as though definitely the police force in Tel Aviv was seemingly caught off guard by just the amount of violence they encountered yesterday during these protests. Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, despite the warnings. All right, it's interesting. Hadas Gold in Jerusalem, thanks so much. 
 
All right, we have an update that prison escape we've been falling out of Pennsylvania. Have a look at this video captured from a home's doorbell camera early Saturday morning. Authorities believe it's convicted murderer Danelo Cavalcante, who escaped from a prison near Philadelphia Thursday. Officials say based on where that surveillance video was taken, they now narrow their search to within two miles of the prison. 
 
The State of Texas just passed a new law that increases punishment for some drunk drivers. Governor Greg Abbott signed the law in June but it went into effect on Friday. It says those convicted of killing another motorist while driving intoxicated will have to pay child support if the person they killed is a parent or guardian. The offender will be expected to make those payments until the child is 18 or until the child graduates from high school, whichever is later in the legislation says. If someone can't pay the restitution because they're incarcerated they're expected to make payments no later than the first anniversary of their release date. 
 
Well, Canada has a warning for residents planning to travel to the U.S. What the country wants the LGBTQ plus community to know before they step foot on American soil. We'll have that story just ahead. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:40:30]
 
BRUNHUBER: The Canadian government is warning its LGBTQ plus citizens of risks they could face when traveling to the U.S. In an updated advisory, the government warns, "some states have enacted laws and policies that may affect 2SLGBTQI+ persons check relevant state and local laws." 
 
Neither the statement nor the travel advisory single out specific U.S. states or laws. But at least 496 Anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in state legislatures across the United States since the start of the year, a new record according to the American Civil Liberties Union data. Now, that's already more than twice the number of such bills introduced all of last year. Listen to what Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland had to say about her country's new travel advisory.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: Every Canadian government very much including our government needs to put at the center of everything we do, the interests and the safety of every single Canadian and every single group of Canadians.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: And joining me now is Michael Luongo, an instructor at Purdue University's Tourism Program. And he's also the author and editor of Gay Travels in the Muslim World. Thank you so much for being here with us. So when this came out this week, I mean, did it take you by surprise?
 
MICHAEL LUONGO, INSTRUCTOR, PURDUE UNIVERSITY'S TOURISM PROGRAM: Thank you for having me, Kim. It did definitely take me by surprise in some ways. And yet, we're kind of used to hearing some of these warnings about different things going on in the United States that can be very extreme parts of the country. So it was surprising because it's our closest ally, Canada, literally and figuratively. And in warning its citizens about going to certain parts of the United States.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. I mean, just to put it in perspective, though, I mean, threats exist everywhere. Does it seem a bit extreme, especially considering the Canadian government says they haven't got any, you know, specific complaints about anyone being, you know, either charged or discriminated against -- in terms of LGBTQ travelers because of their sexual identity or orientation? I mean, you've authored a book about Gay Travel in the Muslim World? I mean, in some cases, it's illegal. In some cases, it's even a capital offense. So this -- is this just virtue signaling by Canada?
 
LUONGO: Yeah, I think we're hearing a lot of that phrasing is this virtue signaling. I will say, you know, having written and edited such a book and looked at these things in countries where it's extremely difficult, if not dangerous to be gay. The United States is not the Middle East, or Russia or other countries or, you know, certain other countries that it's as dangerous. But I think that what you're seeing is, in the same way that in parts of the world religious extremism, is driving this homophobia and making homophobia part of politics. You're seeing that in the United States with Christian extremism. 
 
It didn't state specific states that we know it's aimed at places like Texas and Florida and Alabama and Arkansas, where you're seeing anti- LGBT laws specifically aimed at the transgender, specifically banning drag shows, specifically banning education about LGBT issues. And I think what you're seeing with Canada may be warning its best friend, is that if this continues, this will continue along a path where maybe it does become very dangerous for its citizens to travel to particular locations.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, I mean, is that just did it has to be sort of very specific. I mean, as you say, we've seen many red states enacting these anti-LGBTQ laws. So we have a map there. So showing, you know, huge swaths of the country. So is it really a state-by-state basis? Obviously, it's very different traveling to say California than Florida or even I mean cities, you know, Bakersfield vs Miami, for example.
 
LUONGO: One of the things that you point out is that even in a red state like Florida, you have these iconic gay destinations like south beach in Miami, Fort Lauderdale. International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah.
 
LUONGO: So chose these contrasts within the cities. I'm in a red state teaching at Purdue. But West Lafayette is a college town. So it's very different from many other parts of the state. So, there are certain parts of places where it is safer.
 <br>[05:45:10]
 
But I think that one of the things Canada is warning us about is it's seeing in a country that is so similar to it culturally, but so much more advanced on LGBT issues, same-sex marriage was legal years before it was in the United States. That it's best friend is becoming something very, very different. And is perhaps a warning to us about what could be in the future.
 
BRUNHUBER: Finally, we only have a minute left. But this is important, I want to get it in. Seeing as, you know, it can be a bit confusing to know where to go, where to avoid, I mean, what advice would you have for Canadian LGBTQ plus tourists that are coming here to the States?
 
LUONGO: So I think it's the same advice that I gave when people are traveling internationally. So you want to read local media to know what's going on, you want to maybe connect with a community center that's there. 
 
I also recommend and Grindr, it's not just for sex anymore. You can connect with people to kind of get an idea of what is going on in communities. I'd also say to people to take cues from people that they need. So maybe you're not going to hold hands in some parts of this country. Maybe you're going to speak in code and parts of this country and not be as open. And so these are ways that a person can keep him or herself or themselves safe when they are traveling. And I think it still is important to travel and see places themselves.
 
BRUNHUBER: It is sad that it should still come to this in 2023. But appreciate all that advice. Michael Luongo, thanks so much for speaking with us.
 
LUONGO: Thank you for having me, Kim. Thanks.
 
BRUNHUBER: The death of singer Jimmy Buffett is triggering an outpouring of condolences from a who's who of the music world from country stars, Kenny Chesney and Toby Keith to pop royalty, Elton John and Paul McCartney. Everyone thought the world of Buffett. You know the only one really huge hit a long time ago, but that turned out to be enough to build a billion-dollar empire known as Margaritaville.
 
(MUSIC)
 
BRUNHUBER: Fans have been leaving mementos in Key West Florida, which Buffett called home. President Biden also offered his condolences calling Buffett the poet of paradise. 
 
All right still ahead here on CNN Newsroom, Colorado's new coach Deion Sanders and quite the debut on the football field Saturday, CNN's Sports Coy Wire joins me live to break down his first game. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:51:43]
 
BRUNHUBER: Balls quite a debut for Colorado's new coach Deion Sanders on Saturday pulling off an upset over TCU. With me now CNN's Sports Coy Wire. So I mean, what a way to start his career there, right?
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Right. He's a pro football hall of famer. And when he left the small, historically black college Jackson State to go to Colorado, he cleaned house, 86 new players. It's almost the entire team that he took there. And they only had one when a year ago. People criticize his tactics. He got rid of any old, what he called baggage. Players who didn't have that championship mindset. He said I'm bringing my own baggage and it's Louis, as in Vuitton. And it's Buffalo sure did play in a high-end fashion in the opener coach prime bringing several of his kids with him from Jackson State a year ago including his own son. Record setting performance from Shedeur Sanders, 510 yards passing school record, four touchdowns. And this is against TCU last year's national title game runner up.
 
And one of the most exciting players in the nation, Travis Hunter playing defense coming up with this spectacular interception but that's not all Kenny played offense to 11 receptions. 119 yards he played 129 snaps, almost two games worth in that sweltering Texas heat. One of the most impressive individual performance you'd ever want to see unranked Colorado pulling off a shocker 45, 42 and Coach Prime couldn't be prouder.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEION SANDERS, COLORADO HEAD COACH: Thank you Jesus. I'm so thankful right now. My son, man. My other son. Man, I'm loving these kids. Rick George for giving me this opportunity, man. This is a blessing. Everybody buff nation who supported us in the hood that had my back. I think y'all. God, this is good.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Whoa, Colorado signed Deion to a 29 and a half million-dollar deal and they didn't have the money to pay for it at first but Prime said look, they were going to figure out how to raise the money a record $28 million from -- to the athletic department was raised by Buffalo's fans and they sold out season tickets for the first time in 27 years. They host in Nebraska next Saturday, Kim, look out because they're rolling. They're for real.
 
BRUNHUBER: Unbelievable. Deion Sanders, play, you know, football, baseball.
 
WIRE: Baseball.
 
BRUNHUBER: And?
 
WIRE: To new on time. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Let's turn to tennis, the U.S. Open and amazing matchup between Carlos Alcaraz. 
 
WIRE: Yeah.
 
BRUNHUBER: You know, take it away?
 
WIRE: And when you see this kid, you could -- a kid in he's 20 years old.
 
BRUNHUBER: But he's still young?
 
WIRE: Yeah. And he's already just developing into the -- one of the brightest young stars we've ever seen in the game, so exciting to watch. Britain's Dan Evans through everything he had at the defending U.S. Open Champ Alcaraz, but dug deep and played the kind of exciting tennis that's rapidly made him a fan favorite. 
 
Look at this curling in this unbelievable forehand winner to break serve in the fourth. And he would never look back after that. Alcaraz wins in four. And he continues his quest to become the first man defending U.S. open crown since Roger Federer did it 15 years ago.
 
On the women's side, we're on number three Jessica Pegula fought off a tough challenge from Ukrainian Elina Svitolina to reach the fourth round. The 29-year-old has not gotten past a quarterfinal at a Grand Slam yet though she's made it two quarters at all four events. She'll have a tough task next against fellow American Madison Keys. 
 <br>[05:55:05]
 
Huge fourth round showdown later Sunday, Kim, six seed Coco Gauff and Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki. Wozniacki is of course that quite a story we've been following retired in 2020, had two kids but she is back and she is rolling. That's going to be must see TV.
 
BRUNHUBER: I have so much to watch tomorrow, my day off. 
 
WIRE: Yeah, enjoy.
 
BRUNHUBER: I can't wait. It's going to be good. Thanks so much. WIRE: Yeah.
 
BRUNHUBER: Coy Wire, I appreciate it. 
 
All right, NASA SpaceX Crew-6 are beginning their final preparations for the return to Earth from the International Space Station. So have a look here. These are pictures of the crew from just moments ago, which is scheduled to undock from the space station a little more than an hour from now and the Hatch has been closed and they're depressurizing. Two American astronauts and astronaut from the United Arab Emirates and a Russian cosmonaut are on board.

It's dashcam video shows a dark road in northern province for the meteor lit up the sky with spectacular camera colors, and a camera at a playground captured the burning space rock illuminating clouds from behind and brightening up the sky with green light. And luckily no reports of any damage from it.
