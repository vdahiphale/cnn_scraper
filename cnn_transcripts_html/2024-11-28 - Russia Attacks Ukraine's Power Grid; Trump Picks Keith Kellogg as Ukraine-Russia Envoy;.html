RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  8:00 in the morning in Tokyo, 10:00 in the morning in Sydney, 
 
 6:00 p.m. in New York. A very happy Thanksgiving to those of you who are joining us in the United States. Julia's off giving thanks for herself and 
 
 others, and I'm Richard Quest. Wherever you are in the world, it's your "First Move."
 
And a very warm welcome in "First Move." And here's what you need to know at this hour. More than a million homes in dark as the Russian attack hits 
 
 energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Israel and Hezbollah, the ceasefire holding, and yet, there are accusations of breaches on both sides. And 
 
 Australia becomes the first country in the world to pass a social media ban for those under 16. Also, Spectrum's battle for supremacy. I'll speak to 
 
 the filmmakers looking back at the famous '80s icon. A conversation about that computer and a lot of geekery and more.
 
But first, details have emerged about Russia's attack on Ukraine's energy grid. President Zelenskyy says cluster munitions were used in the massive 
 
 overnight attack. The Ukrainian president says the Russian Kalibr cruise missiles were particularly dangerous to civilians and the teams are at work 
 
 all day restoring power. Temperatures in Ukraine are set to drop below freezing. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports from central Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR:  This is the 11th large-scale attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure so far this 
 
 year. And throughout the night, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, 90 missiles and 100 drones fired at targets across Ukraine. 
 
 Putin saying this was a response to the use of U.S. supplied ATACMS to hit targets inside of Russia, but it's part of Moscow's persistent bid to erode 
 
 the infrastructure here, the heating, the electricity that's going to keep the lights on and Ukraine warm through what's already becoming a dark and 
 
 freezing winter.
 
In fact, Zelenskyy said that some of these Kalibr missiles that were fired and used cluster munitions, particularly harmful to civilians, to hit some 
 
 of their targets. But it was to the Kremlin head, Vladimir Putin, said a response to the use by Ukraine of U.S. supplied ATACMS missiles to hit 
 
 targets inside of Russia in the last weeks or so. Escalation here, it seems almost daily.
 
And Putin taking opportunity today, not only to refer to why this occurred because of the ATACMS but also potentially hold out a kind of branch of 
 
 some description towards President Donald Trump coming to the White House in January, calling Trump experienced and capable man and suggesting 
 
 potentially that he might be able to find a, quote, "solution."
 
Now, that is surely a nod to the diplomacy, which many believe Trump will adopt as the U.S. policy going forwards in January, a nod to that, 
 
 certainly through his appointment of a Ukrainian special envoy to Ukraine, and that is General Keith Kellogg, his former national security adviser, 
 
 who in April wrote extensively about a potential way forward for a peace plan here.
 
It would involve freezing the frontlines, taking up negotiation as the formal policy of the United States. Ask Ukraine to accept aid, but aid as 
 
 loans. And the condition for that continuing would be that Ukraine would become part of this peace process too.
 
Russia, in turn, would get slight sanctions relief for becoming part of the negotiation process. But then I think the details as to how it gets to an 
 
 end point in where Ukraine could potentially be happier and secure a little fuzzier. The plan in itself seems to accept that the amount of aid the U.S. 
 
 is currently giving to Ukraine is at its maximum and they can't produce any more, but also, seems to suggest potentially that they need to continue and 
 
 indeed supply Kyiv more to secure itself against any future Russian advances.
 
But clearly, moves towards diplomacy here and potentially a moment in which Vladimir Putin, a wily and frankly at times cynical negotiator, may find it 
 
 easier to get what he wants out of the new White House. The news from the frontlines though, inconsistently in Moscow's advantage, they're moving 
 
 forwards on multiple different directions along the eastern front, as we saw ourselves over the past week or so.

QUEST:  With me is CNN's military analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton. It is my -- I'm just looking at my computer, forgive me, it's minus one Celsius 
 
 in Kyiv and Lviv. It's minus three in Dnipro at the moment. This is exactly what Putin's banking on, isn't it? These new powerful missiles. What -- I 
 
 mean, has the calculus changed in your view?
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, Richard, the calculus has changed insofar as it's really a reality that we are reaching 
 
 that end point. And what you're seeing is, you know, as the winter progresses, and the snow starts falling in Kyiv, like it's supposed to 
 
 today, you're going to find a much more difficult terrain for the Ukrainians to move forward on, and that's not only from a geographical or 
 
 climatic standpoint, but also from a geopolitical standpoint.
 
So, from a military standpoint, they have to move forward and take something out from that is valuable to the Russians, but it's really 
 
 difficult for them to do so without the right kinds of weapons and without the ability to actually use them.
 
Now, they've gotten the ATACMS, they've gotten the ability to use those, but the problem is that that's only within a limited area. And Russia being 
 
 a vast country, as we both know, is going to be very difficult for the Ukrainians to actually thwart this Russian effort to get to the eastern 
 
 front and to take advantage there.
 
QUEST:  But do you think that Putin actually has vast stockpiles of these new missiles and weapons, or is he hurling everything? You know, it's sort 
 
 of a Potemkin attack in a sense, because it can't be followed through day after day after day. I mean, to be blunt, of course, it's not a really -- I 
 
 mean, it's something we don't really want to find out. But what do you think?
 
LEIGHTON:  Yes, I think that he doesn't have a lot of these weapons in storage. Now, he will have a lot of munitions from North Korea, for 
 
 example, but those are standard munitions. He will have some elements of missiles like that Kalibr missile that you mentioned with a Kh-101, but 
 
 those are also in limited supply. He will also have drones from the Iranians. But the problem that he has is to bring all that stuff to the 
 
 front.
 
Now, on the other side of that equation, they have the Russian economy is on a war footing right now, and that does give them a degree of advantage 
 
 in this regard, but he does not have unlimited supplies. So, he's racing against the clock, but the Ukrainians also have their clock, and their 
 
 clock seems to be in a tighter circle than the Russian one.
 
QUEST:  What do you know about General Kellogg? His plan is a clever one, or maybe what he's written about before is clever in the sense of it's not 
 
 requiring massive concessions either on the eastern front of the Dnipro region. It's leaving a lot vague but it's giving both. I mean, what do you 
 
 know about the general?
 
LEIGHTON:  So, he's, of course, has vast experience in the military, and as you mentioned, he has served in the previous Trump administration. He is 
 
 somebody who knows Ukraine well, has just spent some time there. And it seems as if he is a much more amenable than the Ukrainian position than you 
 
 would think anybody from the Trump administration would be given the pronouncements during the campaign.
 
So, what General Kellogg seems to be proposing is basically a freeze in place kind of scenario. The one difficulty with what he's proposing right 
 
 now seems to be that he is saying that Ukraine should not join NATO for the foreseeable future. That is something that really should not be left off 
 
 the negotiating table at this point, in my view. I think that is something that would need to be changed if they want to really leverage -- have 
 
 leverage against the Russians.
 
The other thing also is that he will allow for the Russians, according to this -- what we know so far of this peace proposals, you will allow the 
 
 Russians to maintain their positions within Ukraine, and that, of course, rewards very bad behavior and frankly, human rights violations. So, there's 
 
 a problem with that as well. The good part about it is that it seems to allow Ukraine to maintain its sovereignty and its current form of 
 
 government, which would, of course, be helpful for Ukraine and for the west as well.
 
QUEST:  I'm grateful to you, Cedric, as always. You've done your duty. And I'm grateful. Go on and have some Thanksgiving food. I'm grateful. Thank 
 
 you.
 
The Lebanese army is accusing Israel of already breaching the ceasefire agreement. It took effect on Wednesday. Lebanon said Israel's targeting 
 
 Lebanese territory with aerial infiltrations. Israel's not spoken about this so far. The deal includes a 60-day ceasefire to be used to lay the 
 
 foundations of lasting peace. Hezbollah is expected to retreat from the border from the IDF from Lebanon.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond takes a look at the -- a closer look at the day two of this ceasefire.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the second day of this tenuous ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was marked by 
 
 claims of violations on both sides of this agreement. Nonetheless, despite that, this ceasefire is indeed still holding up, at least for now.
 
Now, here's what both sides are claiming. The Lebanese military, for its part, says that Israel violated this agreement through the, quote, 
 
 "targeting of Lebanese territory with various weapons." The Israeli military actually admits that it did open fire on Lebanese territory, but 
 
 it says that it did so in order to enforce this ceasefire, claiming that Hezbollah was violating the terms of this agreement.
 
The Israeli military says it carried out two airstrikes in Southern Lebanon. In one case, they say they identified, quote, "terrorist activity" 
 
 at a Hezbollah rocket storage facility. In the second case, they say they struck quote, "two terrorists" that they say were arriving at a known 
 
 terrorist infrastructure site that had been used to fire on Israel. In another incident, they say they opened fire on people they described as 
 
 suspects who are arriving in areas of Southern Lebanon.
 
Now, the Israeli prime minister is actually touting these actions by the Israeli military in a new interview with Israel's Channel 14.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We enforced it already on the first day. You saw, yesterday we killed five 
 
 Hezbollah operatives. We captured four. Today, we strike more. There is no trickery with us. We enforce it forcefully. But, if necessary, I have given 
 
 directive to the IDF. If this framework, this ceasefire, is violated, it will lead to an intense war.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DIAMOND:  And you hear the threat of a, quote, "intense war" there with Hezbollah by the Israeli prime minister. One thing that's so tricky with 
 
 this new ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah is first the fact that the Israeli military is gradually going to withdraw from this 
 
 territory. That means for up to 60 days, Israeli troops could actually still be inside Southern Lebanon.
 
In addition to that, you actually have a party to this ceasefire agreement, Israel in this case, saying that it is going to unilaterally enforce this 
 
 deal and strike at Hezbollah whenever it feels like it needs to for its self-defense purposes. And that, of course, could ultimately lead to 
 
 questions about whether or not Israel is violating the ceasefire by carrying out those actions.
 
Israeli officials say that they have an understanding with U.S. officials about the actions that they can and cannot take in Southern Lebanon. But, 
 
 of course, all of this is potentially complicating additional layer on top of this agreement. The other question is whether or not this agreement 
 
 between Israel and Hezbollah, the ceasefire in the north could ultimately lead to a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
 
The Israeli prime minister also saying that he believes that is increasingly possible now, at least a deal that would free the hostages 
 
 because he believes that Hamas is feeling increasingly isolated by this deal. U.S. officials are of the same view. And President Biden said last 
 
 week that he is now going to push for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.

QUEST:  With Israel's attacks on Iranian proxies and Russia's focus on Ukraine, Syrian rebels have taken the opportunity and launched a major 
 
 offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's forces. After making small gains in recent years, these large-scale attacks began on Wednesday. The 
 
 rebels have now captured some 40 towns and villages, as well as a Syrian military base, and they are closing in on Aleppo, where Assad's government 
 
 has control.
 
Lawmakers in Australia have passed a new measure that bans social media for children under 16. Under the new law, social media companies must take 
 
 steps to prevent underage users from accessing their platforms. The fines could be more than $30 million. Earlier I spoke to the psychologist Clare 
 
 Fernyhough, the co-founder of Smartphone Free Childhood.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLARE FERNYHOUGH, CO-FOUNDER, SMARTPHONE FREE CHILDHOOD:  The word ban we tend to try to not use because it's so divisive as we know. But I think 
 
 this is a really brave, bold step from Albanese. I think it's incredible leadership. You know, and he's an absolute pioneer. We don't know exactly 
 
 how it is going to work because we haven't heard, you know, the full details yet.
 
And there will undoubtedly be a big fight with the tech companies. There will be a lot of teething problems. It's not going to be easy. I think 
 
 what's really important is he's put a line in the sand here and he sent a very strong signal to these companies that actually, you know, our children 
 
 are not the product. They're not something that can be manipulated. And they -- you know, he's done it to support parents as well. You know, he 
 
 says parents are worried sick, not just in Australia, parents everywhere are worried sick. So, you know, I think it's an incredibly bold move. And 
 
 yes, we're definitely welcoming it.

QUEST:  How this is all going to play out, as you heard just there, is increasingly difficult, but it is a brave new world in Australia when the 
 
 law takes effect in 12 months' time. Hanako Montgomery reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For all the positive connections, the joy social media can create, it can also quickly strip it 
 
 away, destroy it forever.
 
KELLY O'BRIEN, MOTHER OF CHARLOTTE O'BRIEN:  I will miss your hugs, your kisses, your laugh, your beautiful, beautiful smile.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  In September, 12-year-old Australian girl Charlotte O'Brien took her own life after years of being bullied on social 
 
 media.
 
Her parents quickly joined a political fight to protect children from online harm. The Australian government says the best way to do that is to 
 
 ban anyone under 16 from using social media.
 
ANTHONY ALBANESE, AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER:  Social media is doing social harm to our young Australians, and I am calling time on it. The safety and 
 
 mental health of our young people has to be a priority.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Under new legislation introduced to Australia's Parliament, there would be consequences for social media companies caught 
 
 systematically breaching the age restriction and other safety measures. Fines reaching tens of millions of dollars.
 
But children or parents won't be punished for breaking the new rules. Instead, the government says the ban will help moms and dads to say no to 
 
 young people who want to stay online.
 
BEN KIOKO, 14-YEAR-OLD SOCIAL MEDIA USER:  Yes. So, being autistic, I have a really, really hard time connecting with others. And, you know, doing 
 
 that online makes it a lot easier.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Some experts, too, say that a catch-all approach may not be helpful.
 
JUSTINE HUMPHREY, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY:  Even though the age is really fundamentally important that we need to get right, what we're talking about 
 
 when we say we're going to introduce a ban by age, is that it negates the fact that young people have very, very different levels of maturity.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  But advocates of the ban point to age limits on alcohol, gambling, and smoking, arguing social media can be equally 
 
 damaging for those too young to use it.

QUEST:  It's "First Move." In just a moment, turkey prices are down this year. Does that mean your Thanksgiving dinner costs less? I'll explain.
 
Also, from gaming history to global phenomenon, the legacy of the Sinclair Spectrum, in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
QUEST:  Today's Money Move. And of course, the U.S. markets were closed for Thanksgiving, but in Europe, well, it's a bit higher as France's political 
 
 situation. So, sign of easing as the French government made concessions in a bid to pass next year's budget. In Asia, Shanghai and Hong Kong were 
 
 down, following a report that the U.S. is considering escalating its crackdowns on tech supplies to China.
 
And in Africa, Zenith Bank, one of the continent's largest lenders, has marked a major milestone by opening its first branch in the E.U. in Paris.
 
CNN's Melissa Bell asked Zenith's CEO why he was coming into Europe now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ADAORA UMEOJI, GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO, ZENITH BANK:  We saw the need for our customers quests to actually have a representation outside 
 
 Nigeria as their businesses are expanding. And for us at Zenith Bank, we don't want to just be a local bank, we want to be a global brand. So, we 
 
 felt, oh, there's a need for us to actually move into Europe as a hub.
 
We are most people from Africa, most African business people as well as European business people to be able to foster trade relationship for both 
 
 of them and to be able to harness the opportunities for skill. For us in Zenith, it is very strategic because we feel Paris especially is a major 
 
 economic hub. They have a strong economy and we know they play a pivotal role to the E.U. countries as well as Africa, Francophone countries.
 
So, we felt coming here. We help to improve business relationship between the two countries as well as business relationship between customers and 
 
 individuals, as well as most of our diaspora Nigerians that live here. They need that opportunity to be able to have a bank that understands them, that 
 
 will promote their business and help them grow.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  But your clients then will not just be African diaspora, it will also be European clients.
 
UMEOJI:  Those that want to go into Africa, they will start with us. We'll give them advisory services, support their businesses, and they see it as a 
 
 starting point to be able to go into those countries while we serve them too and give them unique products and services that we have that will 
 
 interest them to even do more.
 
So, the business is not just for Nigerian businesses or diaspora, it's for European business counterparts that want to actually tastes the kind of 
 
 service we have, because we are known for quality service and exceptional customer retention.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST:  The CEO of Zenith Bank. Now, to New York, the hardy individuals here. Despite the rain thousands of people lined to watch the annual Macy's 
 
 Thanksgiving Day Parade. The winds were good. So, the balloons were able to march down the west side of Manhattan. Giant characters, balloons, that's 
 
 what -- I tell you, Spider Man, always one of my favorites. Minnie Mouse, eleven marching band. And look at that, minions galore. Yes, indeed.
 
Thanksgiving dinner, expenses are marginally lower this year. Well, it's a mixed story. For instance, turkey prices, they were down 10 percent since 
 
 last year, according to some analysis by MoneyGeek. The company says Honolulu in Hawaii is expected to have the most expensive Thanksgiving 
 
 meals, around $160. MoneyGeek's content director is Mark Fitzpatrick, also five-time champion on Jeopardy.
 
Look, what I want to say, on the one hand my turkey is cheaper, but those pumpkins and cranberries and all those dreaded sides that everybody insists 
 
 on having, that's rocketed, that's pushed the price up.
 
MARK FITZPATRICK, CONTENT DIRECTOR, MONEYGEEK:  That's exactly right. And at MoneyGeek, we want to encourage people to be financially responsible, 
 
 but also to enjoy your Thanksgiving. So, we don't want to discourage eating pumpkin pie, but in our analysis, sides are driving some of the highest 
 
 price increases in Thanksgiving this year.
 
Like you said, turkey's down 10 percent, but sides are up 4 percent. And sides are up, in our analysis, up 27 percent since 2001.
 
QUEST:  Why? Why is this the case? I mean, is it because of weather? Is it agricultural? Is it commodities?
 
FITZPATRICK:  We're just trying to dig into the data at MoneyGeek and find out exactly what the rates are. So, I wouldn't want to speculate too much. 
 
 One thing the USDA has said, right, is that even though turkey supply is down this year, would you expect prices to go up from that, turkey demand 
 
 is down too.
 
So, people are only asking for 13.9 pounds per person this November compared to last. So, that's the reason Turkey is going down. Size might be 
 
 going up for a lot of the same reasons. We've seen over the last few years, last several years since the pandemic, higher energy prices, higher demand 
 
 as people get back to work. So, a lot of the trends you're seeing in the economy, you might be seeing in your Thanksgiving table, too.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
QUEST:  What's fascinating, of course, is that we're going to see it in other parts of the world, where maybe, of course, it's Christmas and big 
 
 turkey dinners at Christmas that'll come along. We've still got that to come. And arguably, now, we've got the possibility of tariffs. You know, 
 
 once we have tariffs put on the table, then there's a -- pardon the pun, then there's a whole new set of equations we're going to be looking at. 
 
 Inflation may have been tamed, but we're not out of the woods yet, are we?
 
FITZPATRICK:  We're not out of the woods. And even as inflation returns to a more normal level, as I said, turkeys are down, sides are only up 4 
 
 percent. The inflation in the past happened, right? If sides are up 27 percent since 2001, we're not seeing economies with deflation, right? So, 
 
 even small inflation in -- for the average person feel like prices are up compared to three to four years ago.
 
QUEST:  You see, Mark, that -- you've just touched on something that's really significant, I think, and that is that there are many people who 
 
 hope that because of election promises, prices are going to fall. But there's a huge difference, isn't there, between the rate of inflation where 
 
 they're not going up as much, disinflation where they're staying the same, or deflation where they're going down. We are unlikely to see prices going 
 
 down.
 
FITZPATRICK:  Yes, as I would say, it's unlikely we'll see deflation. You know, you tend to see that in the type of environment like a recessionary 
 
 environment or a depressionary. But if the economy is humming, right, you might see disinflation, which we are seeing, lower rates of inflation. But 
 
 -- and even in -- for the turkey specifically, we did see that over the last year. But for the economy as a whole, very unlikely.
 
QUEST:  Do you like turkey?
 
FITZPATRICK:  I like turkey. A lot of people like it as a delivery device for the sides, but I think I like it on its own merits, actually.
 
QUEST:  Oh, I love that phrase. I'm going to use that. I'm using it at my Thanksgiving dinner tonight. Excuse me, can I have a delivery device for my 
 
 sides? Good to see you, sir. I'm grateful. I appreciate it. Thank you.
 
FITZPATRICK:  Thanks very much.
 
QUEST:  The weather, cold and wet this Thanksgiving weekend. And by Friday, northwest winds will bring the coldest air of the season, as well as first 
 
 significant lake-effect snow. Elisa Raffa is looking at the weather ahead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  After a soggy and snowy Thanksgiving, we have phase two of that storm settling into the rest of the holiday weekend. 
 
 We're talking about cold and lake-effect snow. We have lake-effect snow warnings in effect off of Lakes Erie and Ontario, including places east of 
 
 Cleveland, Erie, Pennsylvania, south of Buffalo, and Watertown in Upstate New York.
 
We have this very cold air coming over very warm lake temperatures. And what that does is it picks up the moisture and pumps that snow just 
 
 offshore. We're looking at winds up to 35 miles per hour coming over those warm lakes, and that will drop those temperatures quick and send that snow 
 
 pumping all weekend. I mean, look at that. Just nonstop through Friday and Saturday across the Great Lakes.
 
We're going to be measuring that snow in feet. Just south of Buffalo, we could be looking at several feet of snow. Some of those snowfall rates 
 
 could be more than two inches per hour, which would significantly disrupt travel. Road conditions would be treacherous, and the airports would have 
 
 problems with visibility.
 
So, you can see as we go through the rest of the holiday weekend, most of the U.S.is fine. We really don't have that much weather. But when you look 
 
 at the Great Lakes, we could be looking at some problems for airports in Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, again, where some of those conditions might be 
 
 hard to take off in with the visibility, the winds and that very heavy snow, and that will last through Friday and through Saturday.
 
Coming with this is the blast of cold air. Now, it's not just the Great Lakes, that frigid cold air, really stretches its legs far south. We're 
 
 talking about pretty cold below average temperatures as far south as the Gulf Coast that we're looking at temperatures below freezing in Chicago 
 
 through the rest of the holiday weekend, upper 20s Saturday and Sunday. New York City in the upper 30s. Relatively warmer for a place like Atlanta, 
 
 temperatures in the middle and upper 50s, but that's still below average for this time of year.

QUEST:  Still to come, giving chess a modern-day makeover. It's an app that wants to revolutionize the classic game. How to make chess sexy.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
QUEST:  Just a few hours from now and the 18-year-old chess prodigy Gukesh Dommaraju will take on the reigning champion Ding Liren at the World 
 
 Championship, Chess Championships, in Singapore. Dommaraju scored his first win over Liren in the third round and the score is level so far. The 
 
 tournament's been generating a buzz around chess as some of the biggest names and stars are throwing their support behind a new app, it's called 
 
 Take Take Take, which hopes to bring chess to new fans and dare I use the phrase make it sexy.
 
I spoke to Take Take Take CEO Mats Andre Kristiansen about why chess is enjoying a moment right now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATS ANDRE KRISTIANSEN, CEO, TAKE TAKE TAKE:  Chess has 600 million players globally and there's not that many following the biggest games of 
 
 spectators. I think there's still room for improvements there and there's a high interest in the game to play, but what we're trying to do is get more 
 
 fans to tune into the matches and follow the games live.
 
QUEST:  This idea is -- it's not a game, it's not a match, it's a sport. You're pumping that pretty hard, why?
 
KRISTIANSEN:  Well, chess is a fantastic game, but when you take it to the highest levels of Magnus Carlsen and Gukesh and Ding, it truly is a sport. 
 
 It happens inside the minds of two very highly intelligent people, but you need to be physical in your best shape. You need to be a true sportsman to 
 
 compete at the highest level. And we think that the sport and the game deserves to be elevated to the level of other sports.
 
QUEST:  Is it sexy?
 
KRISTIANSEN:  Well, I hope we can make chess even more sexy than it feels. And I think Magnus Carlsen is the first true superstar among the chess 
 
 players. And yes, it can be sexy, definitely.
 
QUEST:  Yes. I suppose, sort of, you want to get this into -- this app into more of a mainstream mentality rather than the geeks who played it at 
 
 school who were part of the chess club, they weren't necessarily the cool kids. But now, of course, if you can get the app, and you can get the app 
 
 to be more widely used, then you can give a coolness about it, can't you?
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
KRISTIANSEN:  Yes, I think so. An app is -- of course, that's the platform where you want to check results, follow the games live. But I think chess 
 
 is yet to be commercialized and taken into the mainframe where you could fill stadiums of fans following the match between the top grand masters in 
 
 the world.
 
I just came back from Singapore and Gukesh and Ding, they're fighting a 14- game battle in a basement. And that could easily be taken up a few notches and be presented in a way that allows more spectators to follow the games 
 
 and -- yes.
 
QUEST:  Now -- but do you -- when I think of the number of games online and the millions of people watching them, video games, people -- you know, 
 
 millions of people watching two other people play a video game. Now, admittedly, you haven't got cars running around tracks. But the potential 
 
 for getting this is quite -- what do you think it's going to take to unlock the potential to get people to try this app? Because that's really what 
 
 you've got to do. You've got to get people to try it out and then discover the beauty of what they've learned.
 
KRISTIANSEN:  Yes, I think what's exciting about chess and comparing that to other sports is that there's so many people all playing chess and 
 
 knowing the rules of chess. And if you compare that to Formula 1 or tennis or golf or other sports, there aren't that many people driving a Formula 1 
 
 car, but they love seeing it.
 
And I think that what's unique about chess is that there's so many people already playing the game. They want to get better at the game. And that 
 
 really is the perfect start for making that sport into a sort of a spectator sport.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST:  Chess, which is a game where you move things on a board. But then, we've got more games to play. Dust off the cassette recorder, we're 
 
 rewinding back to 1982. It's a mighty little machine, it's called the Sinclair Spectrum, which captured the hearts of a generation. And the 
 
 Spectrum story is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
QUEST:  Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to the early 1980s, when home computers were affordable and fun. In the United States, it was all 
 
 about the Commodore 64, a beast that dominated the American consumer market. In Britain, it was a homegrown rival that was smaller and packed a 
 
 hell of a punch.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
It was the rubber-keyed Sinclair ZX. Yes, I'm saying ZX, none of this Z nonsense. The Sinclair ZX Spectrum captured the U.K. market and spawned the 
 
 games industry and a whole generation of programmers invented by Sir Clive Sinclair, who came up with the pocket calculator, digital watch, and even 
 
 this three-wheeled electric trike called a C5. Wickedly dangerous.
 
Sir Clive is sadly no longer with us, but the Spectrum lives on with various modern incarnations. This one for instance, which went on sales 
 
 this month, has 48 built-in games. It's made by a company called Retro Games. And it's also the subject of a nostalgic crowdfunded documentary. 
 
 It's called a "Rubber-Keyed Wonder." A trip down memory lane for those of us like my husband who grew up playing games like Jet Set Willy and Manic 
 
 Miner. Here's a clip.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Spectrum was there at the time when it was affordable for parents to say, yes, we can stretch to that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Spectrum was ideal. You'd go to a shop, pick it up, you unbox it, you plug it in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought it was the coolest thing I have ever seen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The rainbow stripe on the bottom right, it's a thing of absolute beauty. And the Sinclair logo itself, the font, get out of town.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was just so successful.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST:  The documentary was written, produced, and directed by the husband- and-wife team, Anthony and Nicola Caulfield, who join me now. Let's start with you, Nicola. What was the fascination, what drove you to want to make 
 
 this documentary and take us back to those times?
 
NICOLA CAULFIELD, DIRECTOR, "THE RUBBER-KEYED WONDER":  Well, I grew up with a ZX Spectrum and I absolutely adored it. You know, it really -- the 
 
 whole thing just takes me back to the '80s, to growing up, being in my mom and dad's front room, programming away. And I actually have my Spectrum 
 
 here.
 
So, what it was, our first film that we did was called "From Bedrooms to Billions." And there came a point within that film that we could touch on 
 
 the Spectrum, but we couldn't actually go into as much detail as we wanted to. So, it was always something that we really wanted to come back, revisit 
 
 it, and do a whole film that was all about Sir Clive Sinclair and the ZX Spectrum, plus all the other things that he actually invented as well.
 
QUEST:  Anthony, the Spectrum, you know, was an -- it was a revolution in Britain. It took us into a different era, but was it typically British in a 
 
 sense of great idea, could be -- and then managed to trip over its own shoelaces?
 
ANTHONY CAULFIELD, DIRECTOR, "THE RUBBER-KEYED WONDER":  So, sometimes sellotape together. No, I think it's pretty sensitive British design and an 
 
 idea, but it's -- it also captured the imagination of the people in the United Kingdom because it was low-cost technology. It was -- it obviously 
 
 was an innovation in the fact that it was the first time we had a low-cost computer that suddenly could be at all across homes across the U.K. and 
 
 kids embraced it and they sort of wanted to create their own titles, their own games from it.
 
And I think it was more of a -- it was like a sort of rock and roll for the -- as the baby boomers had in the -- obviously, those born in the '40s and 
 
 '50s. For those of us born in the '70s and '80s, it was our rock and roll leading through the microchip revolution as it came through, and the 
 
 Spectrum was very much part of that.
 
QUEST:  Are you surprised -- either of you take this, are you surprised that the retro -- Retro Games has still -- has come up with a version, it's 
 
 still got versions of it, it's still got games on it, and don't tell Chris, my husband, but he's getting one for Christmas. But are you -- look, he's 
 
 bought it himself, he's told me it's being delivered, and he's just told me to put it in a box and wrap it up for him. I mean, that's the devotion you 
 
 end up with it, isn't it guys?
 
N. CAULFIELD:  I think it's all about the nostalgia, really. I mean, we go to lots and lots of events and that, and you see so many people just 
 
 embracing the old retro games and everything. It's just amazing. And yes, it's -- I think it's the nostalgia.
 
A. CAULFIELD:  Nostalgia is such a powerful thing because, I mean, there's so many things in the world that you have cause to worry about, but this 
 
 brings back what sort of warm, fuzzy memories. It's -- and there's a -- it's always been associated with Christmas. I mean, Christmas 1984 in the 
 
 U.K., it was pretty much number one on most kids' Christmas list. It was just such a big deal. And we even feature a part of that in the film. 
 
 Because that story came up so often, Christmas, Christmas. So, it's wonderful that there's a new version of it available at Christmas too, as 
 
 well now.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
QUEST:  And as for Sir Clive and his inventions, particularly, of course, the watch, the calculator, the Spectrum, and the C5, he was -- I met him 
 
 once, he was a genius. I mean, some would say maybe a little on the too genius side, but he was a genius, wasn't he?
 
N. CAULFIELD:  Oh, he certainly was. I mean, certainly with the with the calculators, you know, prior to him inventing his pocket calculator, they 
 
 were these great big things that sat on your desk and were plugged in. So, you know, he was very ahead of his time. And certainly, even with the C5, 
 
 it was very ahead of its time, but -- 
 
A. CAULFIELD:  But like any genius, he was -- he got bored.
 
N. CAULFIELD:  Yes.
 
A. CAULFIELD:  So, once he developed it, that was the driving force was to develop the technology. And then it was right. I want to move on to the 
 
 next thing. And obviously, you know, with Sinclair in itself is that they had a potential cash cow that they could have run on for years. And that's 
 
 obviously something that we explore in the film, the business side of it, that amazing success.
 
But obviously, then how do you maintain it? And if the person at the top is obviously just wanting to continue to invent and drive off new directions, 
 
 it's -- 
 
N. CAULFIELD:  He just wanted to keep moving on to the next thing, didn't it?
 
A. CAULFIELD:  A true inventor.
 
N. CAULFIELD:  Yes.
 
QUEST:  I constantly am amazed and certainly in Europe at the moment, whether Europe can -- Britain, Europe, however you define it, can compete 
 
 on the technology -- technological stakes. The question is really, these days, about one of innovation. And whether, in Europe, we can still 
 
 innovate to the highest levels. Can we?
 
A. CAULFIELD:  Absolutely.
 
N. CAULFIELD:  Definitely.
 
A. CAULFIELD:  Absolutely.
 
N. CAULFIELD:  Yes.
 
A. CAULFIELD:  Absolutely. It's always been there. It's -- and it always will be there. And it's -- the Spectrum is something to be very proud of in 
 
 the fact that it did actually spread out across the world. I mean, it was, there was legal versions of it and there were many, many, many clones of 
 
 it. It was off the shelf technology. So, it could be relatively -- it could be copied relatively easily, but it doesn't matter. It still was in 50, 60, 
 
 maybe even a hundred million forms of the scripture around it at one point. It's amazing.
 
QUEST:  You're never going to part with that one, are you, Nicola? I'd have to prize it. Well, you wouldn't -- I couldn't prize it out of my hands.
 
N. CAULFIELD:  I love it. Yes, I absolutely love it. And I think it's like the rubber-keys. Although. we did find out when we were filming that 
 
 they're actually electromeric. But they'll always be rubber to me. But, yes, it's just that feel.
 
A. CAULFIELD:  The electromeric wonder doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?
 
N. CAULFIELD:  No, it didn't.
 
QUEST:  It's a bit like CinemaScope. All right. Thank you, guys. I'm very grateful to you. Thank you very much for taking me back to a little bit of 
 
 my own history and upbringing. Thank you.
 
As we continue tonight, the bells of Notre Dame, they're chiming in. The cathedral is preparing for its grand re-opening after five years. "First 
 
 Move."
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
QUEST:  Welcome back to "First Move." A look at the international headlines. This -- you're looking at new video from Tbilisi in Georgia. 
 
 Pro-E.U. protesters have lit fires and blockaded streets in the Georgian capital. They clashed with police after government suspended its E.U. 
 
 application. Georgia's ruling party halted the accession talks with the E.U. after accusing it of blackmail and trying to organize a revolution. 
 
 Opinion polls suggest show 80 percent of Georgians are in favor of joining the E.U.
 
The Meta boss, Mark Zuckerberg, had dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Donald Trump. What they discussed isn't clear, but a Meta spokesman tells us Zuckerberg 
 
 was grateful for the opportunity to meet members of the incoming administration. Donald Trump previously accused Zuckerberg of plotting 
 
 against him and threatened him with life in prison if he did anything, in his words, illegal during the election.
 
And Delta Airlines is investigating a stowaway and how they managed to fly from JFK to Paris without a boarding pass on one of the busiest travel days 
 
 of the year. The passenger evaded multiple airport security checks and according to one passenger hid in the toilet on board. How the person got 
 
 on board? Still not known.
 
More than five years after a fire destroyed large parts of Notre Dame, the iconic Paris Cathedral will reopen next week. The French president, 
 
 Emmanuel Macron, is set to visit on Friday before public masses will take place. I traveled to Paris earlier this year. I got a stunning spectacular 
 
 magnificent fantastic view of the restoration from the roof.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST:  My God, look at the scaffolding. Merci, monsieur. Zut alors as they say. Did they have to put the roof back?
 
PHILIPPE JOST, PRESIDENT, REBUILDING NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS (through translator):  The oak structure known as "La Foret" burned to the ground. 
 
 It is now rebuilt. We searched for thousands of oak trees in the forests of France.
 
QUEST:  How much technical skill had to go into it?
 
JOST (through translator):  We had to find extraordinary skills and expertise but we found them.
 
QUEST:  Really?
 
JOST (through translator):  Because in France, we have an extensive heritage which we maintain. So, you have carpenters, stonemasons, sculptors 
 
 and these people work on all the monuments. In France, we didn't build such spire since 160 years.
 
QUEST:  More people come to Notre Dame than the Eiffel Tower.
 
JOST:  Notre Dame has a spirit that we don't find in -- it doesn't find in the monument as Eiffel Tower.
 
QUEST:  All aboard.
 
JOST:  And we're not just taking very important here. We have 2,250 companies and artists and 140 contracts.
 
QUEST:  I've always been fascinated by logistics. People think it's boring, but it's logistics that make the whole thing work.
 
I think what really gets you as you see it is the size and scale and the fact that it's been done in what, four years. It is an achievement to have 
 
 done this and it'll be the best part of a billion dollars.
 
As I understand it, none of the glass was actually broken. Is that correct?
 
JOST:  None of the glass, it's correct. It's correct. We had a lot of luck because all big artistic works here were not damaged by the fire. Here we 
 
 are -- 
 
QUEST:  Not just fire.
 
JOST:  Just under the spire, you see. And to rebuild the spire, we had to build the scaffold which goes through the vault.
 
QUEST:  What percentage of completion do you think you are at now?
 
JOST:  Oh, I think we are at 85 or 90.
 
QUEST:  Wow.
 
JOST:  We are finished the roof, the spire, we are all nettoyage -- 
 
QUEST:  Cleaning.
 
JOST:  Cleaning. We are -- we have cleaned all the inside, all this wood. We have cleaned the paintings in the chapel. You see that vault there, that 
 
 vault. It was crushed.
 
QUEST:  That vault.
 
JOST:  That vault there.
 
QUEST:  Yes, yes, yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was crushed.
 
QUEST:  So, it comes down.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
JOST:  It's important that if we cannot identify what has been rebuilt because it's the same stones and the same type of work. We see the respect 
 
 we owe to the monument.
 
QUEST:  You and I in our lifetime have seen projects like this taking 20 years.
 
JOST:  After the fire, a lot of people said, you will need 20 years for rebuild this cathedral. President Macron said, he spoke with General 
 
 Georges Villa and they said, we will do it in five years for 2024. And we are doing it. And we do it perfectly. Perfectly.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST:  It is the most extraordinary example. A historic snowstorm in South Korea has turned much of Seoul, including a zoo, into a winter wonderland. 
 
 You can't beat pandas even at Thanksgiving and Christmas. These are South Korea's first ever twin panda cubs seeing snow for the very first time. As 
 
 you can see, they don't -- well, they're pandas. They've got big heavy cloths and coats. But they're beautiful and -- ah, you can't beat a panda 
 
 on Thanksgiving. That's it.
 
I'll see you tomorrow. Have a good Thanksgiving or a good Friday, wherever you are, or Saturday.
