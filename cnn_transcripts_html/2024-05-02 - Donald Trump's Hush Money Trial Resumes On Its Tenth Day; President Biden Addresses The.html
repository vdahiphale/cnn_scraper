(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
ZAIN ASHER, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello everyone and welcome to ONE WORLD. Coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. President Joe Biden just addressed 
 
 the nation for the very first time since student protests have taken the world by storm.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  And I'm Erica Hill live outside Manhattan Criminal Court where Donald Trump's hush money trial has just 
 
 resumed. It is now day 10. Stormy Daniels' former lawyer on the stand. 
 
ASHER:  All right. Dissent, not disorder. That is the message from the American President, Joe Biden, who spoke last hour for the first time about 
 
 the recent wave of protests at college campuses across the country. He said students do have the right to protest peacefully within bounds. 
 
His comments come just hours after police cleared pro-Palestinian protesters from campuses across the United States, making dozens of 
 
 arrests, as you see, just like in this video this morning, UCLA. Mr. Biden told reporters that protesters or protests rather must be done within the 
 
 rule of law. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Let me be clear. Peaceful protest in America. Violent protest is not protected. Peaceful protest is. It's against the law 
 
 when violence occurs. Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down 
 
 campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations. None of this is a peaceful protest. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  A reporter asked President Biden about what effect the protests would have on his policies. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REPORTER:  Mr. President, have the protests forced you to reconsider any of the policies with regard to the region? 
 
BIDEN:  No. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  On the opposite side of the country, on the West Coast, calm has been restored at UCLA. But earlier it was chaos. These incredible scenes as 
 
 police officers swarmed pro-Palestinian protesters encampment, dismantling barricades and deploying flashbangs to force the protesters to leave the 
 
 area. 
 
That sent the protesters running. They want the school to end any investment in companies that have direct ties to the war in Gaza, direct 
 
 ties to Israel, as well. Faculty member tells CNN this protest movement is a teachable moment. 
 
Police in California say that they arrested 132 people and deployed about 250 officers. Afterwards, a larger group of protesters gathered at the 
 
 perimeter of the camp as officers formed a wall between them and the camp. 
 
We are covering this story from all angles. We've got Josh Campbell in Los Angeles for us at UCLA. We've also got Arlette Saenz coming to us live now 
 
 from the White House. Arlette, let me start with you because the President just spoke a short time ago. He simply said that there is no place for hate 
 
 speech, no place for violence, that peaceful protests are protected. But violent protests are not. 
 
The President really seeming to play it safe here. I think he said literally what everybody was expecting him to say. First of all, why did it 
 
 take him so long to come out and speak on this issue? And B, could he have gone further? 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Zain, President Biden certainly walked a very careful line when it came to weighing in on these 
 
 protests unfolding at college campuses across the country. These were his most fulsome remarks yet. Just -- it was 10 days ago where he first 
 
 addressed these protests, saying that he decried anti-Semitism, but also noting that there are those who do not understand the concerns of the 
 
 Palestinian people. 
 
And you've really seen the White House be very careful in how they have responded to these protests. It comes as he is facing enormous political 
 
 pressure on both ends. You have Republicans really trying to use this as a campaign cudgel, trying to point to disorder on these college campuses and 
 
 noting that it's unfolding under President Biden's watch. 
 
That is an argument former President Donald Trump, his GOP opponent, has been making, as he has said, pointed out that Biden has been silent on this 
 
 issue. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
The President also is balancing the concerns within his own Democratic Party, as you have seen growing discontent, especially from young voters, 
 
 about his handling of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. 
 
So, President Biden used this speech today as an opportunity to paint a very careful picture about how he is viewing these protests, saying that he 
 
 condemns anti-Semitism, condemns hate speech of all forms, but then also noting that protesters have the right to protest peacefully, that order 
 
 should prevail, and speaking out against some of the lawlessness that they've seen -- things like people breaking and occupying administrative 
 
 buildings on Columbia University's campuses. 
 
I think it's notable that President Biden refrained from weighing in on some of the law enforcement actions that these universities have taken to 
 
 try to disrupt these protests. At the very end, he was asked whether he would consider or whether he believes the National Guard should be sent in 
 
 to quell these protests, and he gave a very blunt answer saying no, even as some Republicans have called for doing so.
 
But I think what's also key here is that the President continues to face pressure from within his coalition about his handling of the conflict 
 
 between Israel and Hamas. He made very clear that he is not changing his strategy when it comes to that front, but it does come as it is expected to 
 
 be a political issue heading into this summer, heading into the Democratic conventions and potentially in the fall, as there are still a significant 
 
 chunk of voters who are very frustrated with the president's approach. 
 
But today, the President did come out after about 10 days of silence on the issue to really speak out in his most fulsome comments yet relating to 
 
 these protests, urging that the protests must remain peaceful and criticizing any attempts to break the law or break the rules as these 
 
 protesters are voicing their concerns on these college campuses.
 
ASHER:  All right, Arlette, thank you so much. Josh, let me bring you in because I can see behind you the clean-up happening there at UCLA. And 
 
 let's talk about those incredible scenes that we saw overnight, just in terms of protesters being handcuffed with zip ties, protesters donning 
 
 themselves with riot gear, helicopters overhead.
 
I mean, these scenes were incredible. And one of the reasons why the clashes at UCLA have been much more violent is because there's been a 
 
 strong counter protest presence on that campus. Just explain to us how UCLA heals from this. Where does the community go from here? 
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, look, it has certainly been a very tense several days here on the campus of UCLA, as you 
 
 mentioned, both because you had pro-Palestinian protesters who essentially took over this area behind me, set up this makeshift encampment that 
 
 continued to grow. 
 
But as you mentioned, there were also counter protesters who came in clash with these protesters at one point launching fireworks into the encampment, 
 
 throwing items against these skirmishes. We haven't seen that level of violence between both sides around the country as we've looked at all of 
 
 these protests.
 
But, again, certainly a much different scene, as you said, the clean-up now underway. This area was surrounded by law enforcement officers overnight. 
 
 We saw that starting to happen late yesterday, where officers were coming in convoys from across the Los Angeles metropolitan area, hundreds and 
 
 hundreds of police officers from various agencies.
 
They ultimately decided toward the end to make an announcement that this was unlawful, this assembly. They issued a dispersal order. There were 
 
 several students and protesters that did not leave. They moved in with force to take people under arrest. And I'm told that some of the officers 
 
 had items thrown at them. I saw one officer who was covered in powder from a fire extinguisher. 
 
So, there were certainly clashes. I'm told that no injuries to report. But, interestingly, 132 protesters were taken into custody. There were about 250 
 
 total inside this encampment, according to police. And as far as tactics go, law enforcement, as we've long reported, in the United States, there's 
 
 the First Amendment. But you don't have the First Amendment right to protest on private property.
 
And so, what law enforcement was waiting for, as this kind of went on for days, was some request by the university to actually remove this 
 
 encampment. That came yesterday. Again, Los Angeles police and a host of other agencies finally deciding to move in.
 
But as we're pointing out, we don't know what happens next. Obviously, the students who were in that camp that didn't get arrested, we've seen them 
 
 out and about protesting, chanting anti-police slogans toward officers. And so, again, we're just waiting to see whether there's another attempt to set 
 
 up another type of encampment.
 
Obviously, those -- many of those people are students here in and around the area. And we don't think that just by removing this encampment, that 
 
 that is going to, you know, deter them from continuing to protest. So, although it's certainly a different feel right now on campus, everyone's 
 
 waiting to see what happens next with these protests.
 
ASHER:  Yeah, the entire country, in fact. Right, Josh Campbell, live for us there. Arlette Saenz, thank you both so much. Okay, Israel's President 
 
 called on Jewish communities to stand strong in the face of mass protests across the United States. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
Isaac Herzog described seeing prominent academic institutions as being, quote, "Contaminated by hatred and anti-Semitism, fueled by arrogance and 
 
 ignorance." Those are his words. He said the people of Israel stood with their friends on American college campuses. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT:  In the face of violence, harassment and intimidation, as masked cowards smash windows and barricade doors, as they 
 
 assault the truth and manipulate history, together we stand strong. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  Meantime, some of the children displaced by the war in Gaza are thanking American student protesters for their support. A video shot for 
 
 CNN, the camp in Gaza, shows children holding signs that read, "Thank you so much for your solidarity" with the names of several universities, which 
 
 have seen -- been the scene of some of the protests. Some held messages that read, your voices pierce the wall of silence and reach the victims in 
 
 Gaza. 
 
All right, let's turn things over to my colleague Erica Hill, who is outside the New York courtroom where former President Donald Trump's hush 
 
 money trial is underway. Keith Davidson in the stand, Erica, Stormy Daniels' former lawyer, has been talking about some of his negotiations 
 
 with Michael Cohen. Walk us through it. 
 
HILL:  Yeah, that's right, Zain He's now at a cross-examination. It's been a fairly dramatic, fairly eventful morning of arguments and testimony here 
 
 at Donald Trump's hush money trial. So as you mentioned, Zain, right now the former attorney for Stormy Daniels back on the stand.
 
Keith Davidson has been testifying about his conversations with Donald Trump's fixer, Michael Cohen, as they arranged that $130,000 payment to 
 
 keep Daniels from talking about her alleged affair interaction with Donald Trump and their actions after that agreement. A lot of discussion about 
 
 that, as well. 
 
Davidson noting that Cohen was despondent in a call that Davidson received from him after the 2016 election, that Cohen was upset because Donald 
 
 Trump, who of course was about to become president, was going to Washington while Cohen was being left behind in New York.
 
Before that testimony, though, the day actually began with a second hearing for the former president's alleged gag order violations. Some extensive 
 
 discussion there about just how Donald Trump has responded to social media posts by Michael Cohen in recent weeks, in addition to other comments that 
 
 the prosecution alleges violate that judge's order. 
 
So, on the left side of your screen, just a reminder, we're going to put it back up for you there, you'll be able to see these key updates that are 
 
 coming in from our teams inside the courtroom throughout the trial. Our reporters, of course, are inside. We're outside bringing all this to you, 
 
 as well. So, everything that they are reporting will be on that side panel.
 
We're going to dig into some of those details a little bit more. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is joining us, tracking all these 
 
 developments in the case. Jess, let's start off, if we could, quickly with that hearing that we had this morning. So, the second time now there's been 
 
 a hearing for alleged gag order violations, no ruling. But there were, I would say, some spicy moments, perhaps? 
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, there were. You know, we're talking about four alleged violations from prosecutors, Erica. And 
 
 the core of them, the two big ones, were about Trump's comments disparagingly about Michael Cohen and then also Trump's comments about the 
 
 jury or his one comment in particular about the jury. 
 
The jury one was really problematic for this judge. Trump had said before the cameras after one of his court appearances something about the jury 
 
 being 95 percent Democrat.
 
You know, Donald Trump doesn't know what the political make-up of the jury is. He was just saying that because, of course, a vast majority of people 
 
 in Manhattan are Democrats. That's where this jury pool came from. But the judge was, you know, hammering home about how it is necessary to protect 
 
 the integrity of this jury because, of course, they are at the core of these proceedings. 
 
So, it did seem likely that the judge might find a violation about Trump's comments, even as small as the comment may be about the jury. The question 
 
 was, Erica, the Michael Cohen issue, because Donald Trump's defense attorneys really hammered home that, look, Donald Trump, first of all, he's 
 
 in campaign mode.
 
He can't -- he has to be able to talk somewhat. And then they were stressing that Michael Cohen has been going on social media repeatedly, 
 
 even trying to make money off of his appearances on social media and hammering Donald Trump. So, they said, you know, Donald Trump should be 
 
 able to respond in some way.
 
So, it seemed possible that the judge might, you know, go a little bit easier on these violations alleged in terms of Michael Cohen, the comments 
 
 that Donald Trump was making. But it is clear that, you know, the judge might not let Donald Trump get away with the jury comments because he wants 
 
 to be clear you should not be talking about the jury at all. They are at the core of this proceeding and they need to be protected.
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
And important to note, the one the initial 10 alleged violations, the judge found that he did violate those, nine of those, but the 10th one was in 
 
 response, I believe, to Michael Cohen. And he said that was not a violation. Jessica, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
For a little more legal analysis, I want to bring in now Bernarda Villalona, who is with us, a former prosecutor and criminal defense 
 
 attorney. Good to have you back with us today. Picking up on that, based on what we did here this morning and based on what we learned in that ruling, 
 
 which came down as you and I were on the air live earlier this week, how do you think the judge will find with these latest alleged violations of that 
 
 gag order? 
 
BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND FORMER NY PROSECUTOR:  Well, I believe Judge Merchan is going to sustain the violations and 
 
 sanction him again to the thousand dollars for each of these violations. 
 
In terms of what Judge Merchan may add to this ruling, I think he may enter into this ruling something having to deal with Michael Cohen, because 
 
 Michael Cohen, he can't use the law, he can't use this gag order as a sword in the sense of that he can make all these comments about Donald Trump and 
 
 Donald Trump is supposed to remain quiet if we're trying to protect you and protect your safety and trying to protect any witness intimidation. 
 
However, the prosecution has said that Michael Cohen eventually said last week that he's going to stop commenting about the case on social media and 
 
 also live. But let's see if he can actually abide by his own saying that he won't comment on Donald Trump. 
 
HILL:  So, let's move on to the testimony that we're hearing this morning. So, Keith Davidson back on the stand. There was a short break just before 
 
 noon, actually. He's back there. He's now under cross-examination. What was interesting to me is as all of the testimony this morning, a lot of that 
 
 really makes Michael Cohen look not so great. 
 
The prosecution we know wants to get out ahead of that. But even in the testimony this morning, it would seem that Davidson's testimony was really 
 
 giving the defense a lot to work with here. Would you agree? 
 
SCHNEIDER:  Absolutely. Keith Davidson has given the defense team a lot to work with in terms of the credibility of Michael Cohen. But we all know 
 
 from opening statements, because the prosecution already preluded Michael Cohen to this jury saying that Michael Cohen, you know, not a likable guy, 
 
 a person who has baggage, a person who has issues.
 
So, they're not going to be surprised by his testimony. So, by getting this testimony out of Keith Davidson, the prosecution is showing and giving this 
 
 jury the good, the bad and the ugly of Michael Cohen. And that way they can argue at the end, like, look, I'm not trying to clean him up for you.
 
I'm not trying to say that he's a good guy or a nice guy or that you have to like him or want to go out with him. The whole question for you, members 
 
 of the jury, is to determine, can you believe what he says when he was acting at the direction of Donald Trump? 
 
So, Keith Davidson, yes, he dirties up Michael Cohen. A lot that he said, especially when he said that he directly told Michael Cohen, I don't 
 
 believe what you say to me. I don't believe a word that you're saying to me. It is crucial to Michael Cohen's credibility. 
 
HILL:  Yeah, it really is. We'll continue to dig in there. Bernarda, I appreciate it as always. Thank you Zain, I'll hand it back to you. I know 
 
 you have a lot you're covering today. 
 
ASHER:  Yes, we do. Erica, I will see you in about 10 -- 20 minutes from now. All right. Just ahead here on ONE WORLD, severe weather taking a 
 
 deadly toll in southern China after a highway collapses and frantic search and rescue operations are underway in flood ravaged Kenya. We will go there 
 
 for you live. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER:  All right. At least 48 people have been killed in southern China after a highway collapsed after days of severe rainfall. Disaster response 
 
 teams are on the scene in Guangdong province. It's an area that's been experiencing quite a bit of flooding. Recently, officials say that sections 
 
 of the highway simply disintegrated, sending cars plummeting down a hill.
 
Catastrophic flooding in Kenya has taken the lives of at least 188 people. But there were moments of hope when the Red Cross said that people had been 
 
 rescued from floodwaters south of Nairobi on Wednesday. At the same time, safari camps have been evacuated as tents were swept away. And you can 
 
 actually see in this video here, a lot of cars underwater. The forecast isn't hopeful. More rain expected.
 
I want to bring in CNN's Larry Madowo joining us live now from Nairobi. Larry, authorities in Kenya have so much on their plate right now, just in 
 
 terms of the fact that you've got over 180 people who have been killed since the rainy season began in mid-March. You've got the fact that 
 
 tourists are being evacuated from the Maasai Mara. And on top of that, more bad news with more rainfall on the way. 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Not more rainfall on the way. It's raining right now, Zain. In fact, many parts of Nairobi are reported to be 
 
 flooded as we speak. And the Kenya power, that's the main power utility of the country, says because of a system disturbance, they have lost power in 
 
 most parts of the country. 
 
This is building onto the heavy rainfall that many parts of the country have been reporting. And the Kenya Met Department today warning of even 
 
 more rainfall expected here in Nairobi and other parts of the country over the next two days. 
 
So, this enhanced rainfall, as the Kenya Met Department calls it, because of the El Nino weather phenomenon, continues. And you can see the effects 
 
 like this national blackout that many people are reporting and these flooding. 
 
But I think the scenes out of the Maasai Mara National Reserve, a world- famous game park, illustrate just how serious this recent rainfall has been. When you see tourists getting evacuated out of the game reserve 
 
 there, 14 different camps have been closed. 
 
And local authorities in Nairobi County, which includes the national park, saying they will have to forcefully evict anybody who's still left there, 
 
 any tourists, any people that live around places that are prone to flooding after one of the main rivers there burst its banks. I want you to listen to 
 
 the governor of Nairobi County. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TOBIAS KORIR; JOURNALIST (through translator):  We've told camp owners that everyone should leave their properties and move to higher ground further 
 
 away from River Talak. But on the side of the Mara Triangle, we haven't had too many issues because the water levels are not too high.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO:  So, nobody out of the Maasai Mara National Reserve was severely affected. There were no casualties reported there. Everybody was evacuated, 
 
 more than 90 tourists and local staff that work at these camps.
 
But nationwide, the death toll now at 188 people that have been killed. Almost 200,000 people have been affected by heavy flooding after these 
 
 recent rainfall, heavy rainfall that East Africa is experiencing, flooding reported in neighboring Tanzania, in Burundi as well. But I think the worst 
 
 effects being seen here in Kenya. And the worst may yet be to come, Zain. 
 
ASHER:  Yeah, and as you're speaking, we were just looking at images out of the Maasai Mara, just unbelievable images we're seeing just in terms of the 
 
 flooding taking place there. Larry Madowo, live for us there, thank you so much.
 
All right, still to come here, why basketball star Brittany Griner wasn't sure she had the strength to get through her Russian prison ordeal. We'll 
 
 have that after the break. Plus, we'll explain the deal one U.S. college reached with its student protesters to get them to remove their encampments 
 
 from campus.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
{12:25:00]
 
ASHER:  All right, welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Zain Asher. We're following a dramatic series of events unfolding on UCLA's campus. Earlier 
 
 today, police cleared the pro-Palestinian encampment and arrested more than 100 people there. There's still a gathering of demonstrators at the 
 
 perimeter of the camp, but officers are calmly keeping a close eye on them. 
 
Earlier today, it was an extremely tense scene as police fired what appeared to be rubber bullets on campus as they began trying to clear the 
 
 encampment. Unbelievable scenes coming out of L.A. there. Authorities had called for people at the encampment to disperse or risk being arrested. One 
 
 student told local media that she does not agree with how the police have handled this particular situation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  I think it's kind of shameful, to be honest. I just witnessed them about ten minutes ago arrest a protester who was trying to comply with 
 
 their demands and leave before arrests were happening. And they arrested him anyways, and I think that's kind of ridiculous.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  The LAPD declared the camp unlawful. And in short time ago, President Joe Biden said students and others have a right to voice dissent, 
 
 but not break the law. While protests, f a number of college campuses across the U.S., Brown University in Rhode Island reached a deal earlier 
 
 this week with its student protests.
 
The protest group says that they agreed to disband their encampment on Tuesday after the university agreed to hold a vote on divestment from 
 
 companies that support Israel. 
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
The protest group calls it an unprecedented win that, quote, "affirms the power of our encampment and the national movement of student encampments 
 
 for Palestine. 
 
ASHER:  Time now for "The Exchange". Joining me live now is Dana Richie, a staff writer and photo chief for "The Brown Daily Herald", a student 
 
 newspaper at the university. Dana, thank you so much for being with us. So, take us behind the scenes, because a lot of people across the country are 
 
 talking about what happened at Brown University.
 
Some people saying it's a model, other people saying, well, look, Brown leadership essentially caved in here. Just take us behind the scenes in 
 
 terms of how this agreement came about, how this deal was reached. 
 
DANA RICHIE, STAFF WRITER AND PHOTO CHIEF, "THE BROWN DAILY HERALD":  Thank you for having me. Honestly, as someone who's covered the entirety of the 
 
 encampment and also demonstrations earlier in the semester, for example, there was an eight day hunger strike, 19 undergraduate students 
 
 participated in with similar demands. 
 
I can say that I think this process on Brown's campus, activism around divestment has been years in the making. In 2020, there was a Committee 
 
 proposal that recommended divestment. And since then, there has been a lot of activism around it. So, while the encampment itself, obviously, like the 
 
 negotiations were around that, I think at least on Brown's campus, it's been the product of lots of activism. 
 
ASHER:  Right. So, there's a lot of behind the scenes work that basically led to this point. So, in terms of what happens next, later on in the year, 
 
 in about six months from now, as I understand, there's going to be a vote. Brown's leadership is going to vote on divestment. If the vote is not to 
 
 divest, if that ends up being the result of the vote, will we see more protests on campus? 
 
RICHIE:  It's hard to say, I guess, at this moment what the energy will be like six months from now. But given the fact that there were sit-ins -- 
 
 there were two sit-ins that happened last semester, one in November, one in December. The first one resulted in 20 arrests and the second one resulted 
 
 in 41.  
 
Given that that energy existed a couple of months ago, I wouldn't be surprised if students were still organizing around this with energy and 
 
 galvanized to continue protesting. We'll see what the strategy is at that point and what kind of activism they'll be doing. But I would be surprised 
 
 if this just went away after the vote. 
 
ASHER:  Right. I would be, too, actually. Just in terms of the perspective from other universities around the country, I mean, some people look at 
 
 this and say that what Brown did was essentially giving in. Fox News used the term caving in, that Brown's leadership effectively caved in to the 
 
 protests. I mean, some people are of the view, listen, if you give them an inch, they'll take a mile. Why is that the wrong perspective, in your view? 
 
RICHIE:  From my perspective -- so students entered in negotiations with administration, student activists entered negotiations with the 
 
 administration starting on Monday morning, following an email that the President sent basically saying that they would consider hearing divestment 
 
 at the next meeting. Or like some corporation members would discuss it. 
 
And then they entered talks. They had a meeting later that day. They had a meeting the following morning. There was a lot of back and forth between 
 
 the two parties. And I think that just shows that both sides made compromises. I wouldn't say either side got exactly what they wanted. 
 
But I think I think both of them, both sides realized that negotiating would be a good way forward, especially, I guess, seeing how other 
 
 universities have been handling the encampments. I think no one on Brown's campus wanted there to be violence, neither the activists nor the 
 
 administration. So, it seems like both parties realized that negotiating would be a safe way to proceed.
 
ASHER:  I mean, nobody -- nobody wants to see what we saw at UCLA or at Columbia. What, as a student, what have you learned through this entire 
 
 process about the importance of collective power, about the fact that you do have a voice and it is important to exercise your right to peacefully 
 
 use that voice. If there is something in this world that you don't agree with, what have you learned from that perspective through this process? 
 
RICHIE:  Yeah, I I've been thinking about this a lot. I'm also a history major. So, I think a lot about movements of the past and how we take a lot 
 
 of the progress that they made for granted. And I think we are living in a moment that is akin to the 1960s and early 70s. We are seeing universities 
 
 as being a pivotal site of change and of activism. 
 <br>[12:35:00] RICHIE:  If anything, I showed up at the encampment most days from about 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. And I just sort of I photographed all the events and I 
 
 witnessed just a lot of camaraderie and community building within the encampment. There were art builds and singing and chanting and a lot of 
 
 things like teach-ins. There was someone built a bookshelf that had literature about colonization and about Palestinian history. 
 
I think it was also kind of inspiring to see how students showed up to protest, even if they weren't in camping. Unlike other universities, there 
 
 wasn't really a barricade around the encampment. And I saw marshals wearing neon yellow and orange vests, speaking to community members and answering 
 
 questions of people who maybe were wondering why they were in camping. So, it was a lot of camaraderie and a lot of community learning is what I 
 
 witnessed. 
 
ASHER:  So, the energy was different from the get-go.
 
RICHIE:  I mean, yeah, I mean, I can only really speak about what was happening. Yeah, I can really speak about what was happening at Brown. But 
 
 it was -- it was peaceful from the onset. And it was -- it seems like the people who are organizing it had an idea of like wanting to center it on 
 
 Gaza, as well. And so a lot of their programming was they would do art builds of like one of the for example, they painted a map of all of 
 
 Palestine on this giant piece of canvas.
 
They did Palestinian dancing in the evenings. So, there was there was a lot of conscientious decision making, I think, to make sure the programming 
 
 remained peaceful and also educational. Dana Ritchie, thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
ASHER:  All right, let's head back to the region that has been the focus of the protest we've been discussing. We'll update you now on a story about a 
 
 strike in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of several children. At this time, Israel said the incident was under review.
 
CNN has documented evidence from the scene and consulted ammunition experts as well. Jeremy Diamond tells us what they found. And we want to warn you 
 
 that some of the images in this report are disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This grainy home video is the closest Mona Odatala will ever get to seeing her 10 year old daughter. A stack of 
 
 school certificates, a wardrobe of her favorite clothes, the perfume she used to wear. All that remains of the daughter Mona poured everything into.
 
There is no Shahid now. Every time she came in, she said, Mom, I would say my soul, my soul, my soul is gone. Shahid was one of 10 children killed 
 
 when an Israeli airstrike hit the crowded street in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp where she was playing with her friends.
 
Her pink pants impossible to miss among the small bodies splayed around a foosball table in the chaotic aftermath. Two weeks later, the Israeli 
 
 military still won't take responsibility for the strike that killed her. CNN provided the IDF with the coordinates and time of the attack based on 
 
 metadata from two different phones in the immediate aftermath.
 
The IDF said they did not have a record of that strike. They said they carried out a strike at a different time than described and that the 
 
 collateral damage as described in the query is not known to the IDF. The IDF makes great efforts to mitigate harm to the civilian population from 
 
 areas where strikes are being carried out.
 
Evidence recovered and documented by CNN at the scene of the strike paints a very different picture of Israeli military responsibility. This circuit 
 
 board and bits of shrapnel, walls and shop steps distinctively pockmarked and a small crater barely a foot wide. All pointing three munitions experts 
 
 to the same conclusion. The carnage was likely caused by a precision guided munition deployed by the Israeli military. 
 
CHRIS COBB-SMITH, WEAPONS EXPERT:  I've seen these strikes so many times. There's a relatively small crater in the road. There's no large shrapnel 
 
 holes or fragmentation holes. It would have been which would have been caused by, say, a mortar round or an artillery round. The fragmentation is 
 
 consistent.
 
DIAMOND:  So, in your view, this strike was caused by a precision guided drone fired missile. 
 
COBB-SMITH:   Absolutely. This is an Israeli munition. The local militias, the local forces do not have anything with this amount of sophistication. 
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Before carrying out the strike, Israeli drones would have surveilled the Al-Mahrazi refugee camp from above. Seconds later, the 
 
 missile hits the street below, landing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away from the foosball table where Shahed and her friends were 
 
 playing that day, delivering certain death.
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
Against all odds, these children have returned to play at the very same foosball table, including some of Shahed's friends. I miss her a lot, Sama 
 
 says, wearing a necklace Shahed made her. She says she was nearly killed with her friend, going home moments before the strike to drink water.
 
Others were not as lucky. Eight-year-old Ahmed is fighting for his life, bleeding from his brain, his skull fractured. His chances of surviving are 
 
 slim, his doctor explains. He is fighting not to become the 11th child killed in that same strike. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER:  And a really heartbreaking update we want to share with you. That eight-year-old boy that you just saw now in Jeremy's report died from his 
 
 wounds this morning. We'll be right back with more. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL:  Welcome back to our continuing coverage here on CNN of Donald Trump's hush money trial.  Let's get you up to speed on what's happening in 
 
 the courtroom behind me. And it is getting a little heated inside. Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels' former attorney, is, of course, on the stand 
 
 under cross-examination now.
 
In initial questioning this morning, Davidson had gone into extensive detail about his conversations with Michael Cohen, about the deal they put 
 
 together to keep Daniels from talking about her relationship with Donald Trump. 
 
Well, Trump's legal team is now grilling Keith Davidson about some past deals prior to the one he did for Stormy Daniels, that back-and-forth 
 
 getting testy. The day, of course, did begin with another hearing about Trump's public comments and whether some of those violate the judge's gag 
 
 order. We'll have to wait on that final decision. 
 
But let's dig into a little bit more of what we are hearing in this moment from the witness, Keith Davidson, joining me is former federal prosecutor 
 
 Michael Zeldin, who's also the host of the podcast "That Said with Michael Zeldin". 
 
You and I are both following this very carefully because there really is a lot of heated back-and-forth here. And just bringing up, you know, there 
 
 was so much in the prosecution's questioning this morning that many of us were watching and saying, oh, there's a lot of fodder there for the defense 
 
 when it comes to trying to poke holes in Michael Cohen's credibility. 
 
The defense hasn't even gotten to Michael Cohen at this point. And some of the things that Keith Davidson talked about, they're going all in on Keith 
 
 Davidson and really some of his past negotiations for other clients and trying to paint him as a fairly unsavory, perhaps untrustworthy character, 
 
 Michael.
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
MICHAEL ZELDIN, HOST, "THAT SAID WITH MICHAEL ZELDIN" PODCAST:  Exactly right. They keep using the word "extortionist" to describe what this 
 
 Davidson was. You know, that's not really all that material to the question of whether or not in this case there was a deal that Trump authorized.
 
But you're absolutely right, Erica, to say that the more they make Davidson an unlikable character, the more perhaps the defense can argue in closing 
 
 argument that there is reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness of what he says. And in fact, he helps the defense a little bit when he said in answer 
 
 to one of the defense cross-examination questions that he didn't fully associate the payment with the 2016 election. 
 
Pecker did that, but Davidson has sort of walked back from that notion. So, again, room for reasonable doubt arguments from the defense. The 
 
 prosecution has to shore this guy up a little bit more. 
 
ASHER:  Does it have to be, though, is Davidson the person who's supposed to make that connection here? That he, that maybe there was a link with 
 
 2016, because we did hear earlier today he was asked about text messages, where as the election results were coming in, there was a back and forth 
 
 about, I'm paraphrasing here, but oh my goodness, what have we done? 
 
Some realization and discussion about whether their activities in securing this deal for Stormy Daniels may have in any way helped Donald Trump ahead 
 
 of the election. Do they need to show Keith Davidson wanted to do that? Or do they need to show that Donald Trump, by way of Michael Cohen, wanted to 
 
 do that? 
 
ZELDIN:  Yeah, they need to show that Donald Trump, through Michael Cohen, was engaged in this transaction in order to impact the 2016 election. 
 
 Davidson could say all he wants about the politics of it. Oh my God, what have we done? That could apply to Karen McDougal or any other things that 
 
 the "National Enquirer" did on Trump's behalf with positive stories.
 
It's not the link that they need from the prosecution standpoint, which is Trump was the one who was behind this, and the reason he was behind it was 
 
 to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, and that later on in the trial we'll see the paperwork on his business records that support that 
 
 knowledge of what this was about and the lies to the city authorities about what the repayment was all about. That's what the prosecution has to keep 
 
 staying focused on. 
 
HILL:  Former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin, always good to have you. Thank you. Zain, we'll continue to keep an eye on all the developments here 
 
 downtown, but I'll send it back over to you now for a look at some of those other stories you're covering from around the globe. 
 
ASHER:  Thank you, Erica. Basketball star Brittney Griner is telling the world about her ordeal behind bars in a Russian prison. The Phoenix Mercury 
 
 star was detained in Russia back in February 2022 and sentenced to nine years in prison on drug smuggling charges because she had cannabis oil in 
 
 her luggage. 
 
Griner tells ABC that conditions were tough, beyond tough in fact, and there were times when she wondered if she could actually go on living.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRITTNEY GRINER, BASKETBALL STAR:  There was like two, three months where we didn't get anything. 
 
UNKNOWN:  And the toothpaste had expired, what, 15 years? 
 
GRINER:  It was like 15 years ago. That toothpaste was expired. We used to put it on the black mold to kill the mold on the walls. You're supposed to 
 
 have 15 minutes outside. Fifteen minutes, sometimes it's two hours. It's a blizzard. It's cold. Like we're in winter. So, you're literally just 
 
 getting snowed on. Those days were the toughest. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  God knows what she's been through. Griner also talked about her dismay at not seeing former Marine Paul Whelan on their plane home with 
 
 her. He's in a Russian prison right now on espionage charges. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  You were hoping to see someone else on that plane. You were hoping to see Paul Whelan. 
 
GRINER:  When I walked on and I didn't see him, I was like, okay maybe I'm early. Maybe, you know, maybe he's next. Maybe they're going to bring him 
 
 next. And when they closed the door, I was like, are you seriously not going to let this man come home right now? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  Whelan has been in a Russian prison for five years, four months and three days. We'll be right back with more.

ASHER:  All right. The U.S. has had a long history of student protest on college campuses, from marching against the Vietnam War to fighting South 
 
 Africa's racist apartheid system. Students have for generations used their voices to bring about change. Preservers are asking if the current campus 
 
 protests will affect at all what is happening on the ground in Gaza. CNN's Brian Todd takes a closer look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  1968 student protesters at New York's Columbia University take over several buildings and briefly even 
 
 take the dean hostage. One of the buildings they seized, Hamilton Hall, which students occupied during recent protests at Columbia. 
 
TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  1968, the first time it was occupied, Hamilton Hall was the scene of a dramatic police action that 
 
 resulted in the arrest of 700 people.
 
TODD (voice-over):  Those protests against the Vietnam War had been taking place for years on college campuses across America and would continue for a 
 
 few more years, from Columbia to Cal Berkeley to Kent State. In 1969, student protesters at Harvard took over and occupied University Hall, 
 
 marching school officials out of the building. 
 
IMANI CHEERS, PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY:  What we're seeing right now is students really engaging and not only using their voices, but 
 
 using their bodies. And that's the way that we saw students in the 60s doing it. 
 
TODD (voice-over):  The primary difference between then and now, the scale of the violence. While skirmishes have broken out at UCLA and some other 
 
 campuses during the current demonstrations, these protests have been, for the most part, peaceful. In the Vietnam era, violence broke out routinely 
 
 and on many campuses, students often brawling with police. 
 
JULIE REUBEN, PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY:  Disciplining students, calling in the police, having protests removed. That tended to increase the 
 
 sympathy for protesters, build the size of protests, and also increase the voice of more extreme activists.
 
TODD (voice-over):  In two horrific episodes, the Vietnam era violence turned deadly. In May 1970, on the campus of Kent State University, Ohio 
 
 National Guard troops opened fire on student protesters, killing four of them and injuring several others. Days later, during racial injustice 
 
 protests at Jackson State College in Mississippi, police fired at a dormitory, killing two students and injuring a dozen others.
 
Possibly a closer comparison to what's going on now took place in the 1980s, when students across America protested against apartheid in South 
 
 Africa. They called on schools to divest themselves from companies and groups that supported the apartheid regime in South Africa, much like 
 
 students are now calling on colleges to divest themselves from Israeli- linked companies. 
 
CHEERS:  Really, when we talk about boycott, divestment, and sanction, that's what it was. We are going to use non-violent, peaceful resistance. 
 
TODD (voice-over):  Another dynamic that hasn't changed across these eras of protest? 
 
LAUREN DUNCAN, PROFESSOR, SMITH COLLEGE:  They've got a lot of energy, and they're idealistic, and they like to protest when things feel unjust or 
 
 seem unjust to them. 
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
TODD:  But the actual results could be different this time around. The protests of the Vietnam era prompted colleges and much of the country to 
 
 change their collective view of the Vietnam War. The protests of the 80s led colleges to divest themselves from doing business with South Africa, 
 
 and the U.S. government later followed suit. Right now, it's not clear if the current protests will change anything regarding the Israel-Hamas war or 
 
 the U.S. government's handling of it. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.
