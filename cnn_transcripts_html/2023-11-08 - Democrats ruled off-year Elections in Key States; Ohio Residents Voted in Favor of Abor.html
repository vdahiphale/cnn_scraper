ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to all our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world, and streaming on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead, abortion rights advocates get a major win in Ohio. We will explain how this might impact the race for the White House as we break down Tuesday's election results in key states across the U.S. 
 
Plus, Israeli forces now say they are inside Gaza City as the hostages of Hamas have now been held for over a month. 
 
And G7 foreign ministers pledge to remain united as war rages in Ukraine and in the Middle East. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH: Results from key off-year elections around the U.S. have brought glimmers of hope to Democrats ahead of next year's presidential showdown, and the power of abortion politics is becoming increasingly clear. 
 
In Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear has won re-election, making him one of the few Democratic leaders in red or predominantly Republican states. And he made abortion rights a major issue in his campaign. 
 
In Mississippi, CNN projects Republican Governor Tate Reeves has won a second term, defeating Brandon Presley, the second cousin of rock legend Elvis. 
 
In Virginia, Democrats have taken full control of the state legislatures hanging onto the Senate and flipping the House of Delegates. Abortion was not directly on the ballot, but was a motivating issue for Democrats. In the key swing state of Ohio, voters delivered a strong rebuke to
 
 Republicans trying to restrict abortion access. The right to an abortion is now enshrined in the state constitution. Ohio also voted to legalize recreational marijuana, becoming the 24th state to do so. 
 
Well more now on that historic abortion vote in Ohio. CNN's Kyung Lah reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KYUNG LAH, CNN SR. U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Abortion rights will be enshrined in Ohio's state constitution. That is the result here in Ohio. According to CNN projections, it is the first Republican state to take such a move. 
 
And this was a hard battle fought on both sides of what's known as issue one, the effort to enshrine those rights in the state constitution. When CNN called the results of this election projecting the results. I want you to take a listen to this room. It is a watch party of those who supported Issue One. 
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
You can hear the cheering for yourself. Others, I actually saw a woman burst into tears. It was jubilation as those results were read. Now, the supporters of issue one say that they won by trying to keep this as nonpartisan an issue as possible, urging voters that this was about keeping government out of their lives.
 
The group that was against Issue One said in a statement, it is heartbroken, but it will regroup and aim. to 2024 in battleground states. And in regard to those battleground states, it's sending shockwaves through states like Arizona, where abortion rights advocates there are also trying to get such a measure on that 2024 ballot. A Republican from Arizona, a consultant, tells me tonight that his party should be, quote, "scared."

CHURCH: Mississippi's Republican Governor Tate Reeves clinched his re- election after a successful campaign against Democrat Brandon Presley, Elvis Presley's second cousin. Here's what Reeves told supporters Tuesday night.

GOV. TATE REEVES (R-MS): You've heard me say it a thousand times throughout this campaign, but Mississippi has momentum and this is Mississippi's time.

CHURCH: CNN's Diane Gallagher has more details now from Mississippi. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DIANE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Republican Governor Tate Reeves declaring victory on election night, telling his crowd of supporters here in this ballroom that his opponent, Democrat Brandon Presley, had called to congratulate him on winning reelection and concede the race. 
 <br>[03:05:00]
 
Now Reeves, a Republican who'd been dealing with low approval numbers as the incumbent governor, told his supporters that he spoke with former President Donald Trump on election night and that Trump relayed a message of love to the people of Mississippi for re-electing Tate Reeves. 
 
His opponent, Democrat Brandon Presley, had run on a platform of populism, essentially telling voters that he wanted to cut grocery taxes and expand Medicaid, but also on name recognition. His second cousin, Elvis Presley, helped Democrats get that word out across the state, but again, not enough to push him over the threshold. Reeves linking Presley with national Democrats throughout the campaign and even here in his victory speech on Tuesday night. 
 
We did get a delay in results in Mississippi due in part to ballot shortages in the state's most populous county, Hinds County, the home of Jackson. The judge did delay the closing of polls for about an hour on Tuesday to allow people to continue voting as lines of voters snaked around all throughout Jackson, Mississippi. Again, though, Reeves first elected governor in 2019 here in Mississippi reelected on Tuesday nights.

CHURCH: In Kentucky, newly reelected Democratic Governor Andy Beshear celebrated his victory. He says sticking to the issue secured the win.

GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): This was our victory. It was a victory that sends a loud, clear message. A message that candidates should run for something and not against someone.

CNN's Eva McKend has more now from Louisville. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A significant victory for incumbent Democratic Governor Andy Beshear. Democrats going into election day were hopeful, but did not think that this victory would be as commanding. 
 
Several key ingredients leading to success here for Beshear. One being his name, his father served as governor for two terms, so they are a known entity in this state. Something else is that he was at the helm during several natural disasters in this state, the pandemic, other tragedies. And during those efforts, he really branded them as Team Kentucky, reminding Kentuckians that they are all on the same team. 
 
And that is a message, a message that transcended partisanship. And it seems to have resonated with some conservatives in this state that while they supported former President Donald Trump, they also supported Governor Beshear. 
 
One woman telling us, Governor Beshear, during the pandemic, he took care of us. It seems as though those voters tonight rewarding him for it.

CHURCH: We are one year out from Election Day 2024 and a new CNN poll shows former U.S. President Donald Trump narrowly leading President Joe Biden 49 to 45 percent among registered voters in a hypothetical rematch. Biden is also getting low marks for how he's handling his job as president with an approval rating of just 39 percent and 61 percent disapproving of his performance. 
 
Our poll also shows support for Biden is significantly weaker now among several groups that he previously won by wide margins. 45 percent of independent voters prefer Trump now. Black voters overwhelmingly picked Biden, while Latino and younger voters are almost evenly split between the two candidates. And about a third of the respondents say the economy is the most important issue heading into next year's election. 
 
Last hour, I spoke with senior political analyst Ron Brownstein and asked about the mixed messages Democrats are getting. On one hand, they are doing better than expected in elections, but the latest poll numbers for President Biden are troubling.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: The polls are telling us one thing that is real, and that is that Americans are dissatisfied with President Biden's leadership. They are unhappy about the economy, and they question whether he has the, you know, physical and intellectual capacity to do the job for another four years. But what these elections are telling us is that even when all of those doubts are present. 
 <br>[03:09:56]
 
When you have an actual campaign that focuses voter attention on whether they want to entrust Republicans with power, they may choose to vote for Democrats anyway, despite all those doubts about Biden. And that instinct is especially powerful in the large metro areas, the urban centers and inner suburbs that were the consistent thread in the results tonight, whether it was in Kentucky, Virginia, Ohio, or Pennsylvania, with the state Supreme Court election. In all of those cases, Democrats dominated in the population centers where the Trump- era Republican cultural agenda is pretty consistently unpopular. 
 
CHURCH: And Ron, on the other side of the political divide, what is the message for Republicans here in the wake of these big wins for Democrats Tuesday night, including of course, Ohio residents voting to enshrine abortion rights in their state's constitution? 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, look, I mean, you know, Republicans have lots of reason to be optimistic. As I said, the doubts about Biden are real. You can't just kind of wave them away from these election results. But I think the message for Republicans is that the biggest problem they have had in the last few elections, really, since Trump became the dominant figure in the party, is still there, which is that in these well-educated and diverse, populous and mostly prosperous inner suburbs, there are too many voters who question whether Democrats are delivering for their interests, who still won't vote for Republicans because they consider them a threat to their rights and their values and to democracy itself. 
 
And it does suggest that it is premature to assume that all of those doubts about Donald Trump and the kind of the Trump-era GOP cultural agenda have dissipated in those places. I think right now the polls are telling us that we are seeing a lot of dissatisfaction with Biden. That is primarily what is being registered in the polls. What these election results are telling us is that when you have campaigns that can focus voters on the choice and ask them to also consider whatever their doubts about Democrats, whether they want Trump-style Republicans in position to implement their agenda on abortion, on book bans, on voting and other issues, you can get a very different result in a broad array of states, but consistently in those big suburban and urban population centers.

CHURCH: Still to come, the latest on the war between Israel and Hamas as Israeli forces encircle and say they have entered the largest city in the Palestinian territories. 
 
And later, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken joins other foreign ministers from the G7 in Tokyo. We'll have the latest on the diplomatic meeting. Back in just a moment.

 <br>[03:15:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Now to Gaza, where Israeli forces are pressing their military offensive, tightening their grip on the besieged territory and its main city. Israel's defense minister says the IDF is at the heart of Gaza City. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israeli forces are now operating inside it and putting severe pressure on Hamas. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Gaza City is encircled. We are operating inside it. We are increasing pressure on Hamas every hour, every day. We have killed thousands of terrorists above ground and below ground. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: However, the Biden administration is once again warning Israel against occupying Gaza. That came hours after Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel will have the overall security responsibility in the territory once the war ends. But Israel's defense minister says there's only two certainties right now about who will run Gaza once Hamas is wiped out. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): I can tell you who will not govern. It will not be Hamas and it will not be Israel. Everything else is a possibility. And I want to say one more thing. At the end of this conflict, there will be no Hamas in Gaza. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Let's bring in journalist Elliott Gotkine, who joins us live from London. Good morning to you again, Elliott. So what is the latest on Israel's military operation in and around Gaza City? And of course, this warning from the Biden administration to Prime Minister Netanyahu. 
 
ELLIOT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Rosemary, as far as Israel's war with Hamas goes, as you say, it's surrounded Gaza City. It's cut the northern part of Gaza from the southern part of Gaza, and it is now inside the city. as well. It is continuing to search for Hamas militants, Hamas commanders in particular, and also, of course, military infrastructure and the like. It really sees Gaza City as a kind of fortress of Hamas and feels that if it can take control of Gaza City above and below ground presumably, then that would be a real death blow to the militant group. 
 
As far as Netanyahu's comments are concerned and the White House's response, if we just remind ourselves, Netanyahu I think, his comments saying that Israel would have overall security responsibility for an indefinite period of time. That's what he said in that interview with ABC News. 
 
I think his comments were deliberately vague for a couple of reasons. One, to ensure that Israel has as much wiggle room to decide exactly what to do after this war is over. And also because he probably doesn't really know himself. The overwhelming focus from Israel's perspective right now is to destroy Hamas militarily so that it can never again carry out an atrocity of the sort that it did on October the 7th to prevent it from continuing to run the Gaza Strip and of course to free the 240 or so hostages that Hamas continues to hold, which it abducted on October the 7th. So that's the focus right now in terms of what comes the day after this war is over. 
 
If it's not Hamas, and it's not Israel because although there may be some far-right ministers in the government that would love to reoccupy the Gaza Strip, which Israel did from 1967 till 2005, that doesn't seem to be likely. And we heard it from the defense minister himself. 
 <br>[03:20:06]
 
Perhaps the Palestinian Authority, which administers part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, could come in and take control or retake control of the Gaza Strip, something it lost violently to Hamas in 2007. But it's hardly going to be wanting to come in on the slipstream of Israeli tanks, for want of a better phrase, to take control of Gaza and be seen as some kind of puppet of the Israeli government.
 
It, anyway, lacked legitimacy in the Gaza Strip with President Mahmoud Abbas in the 19th year of his four-year term and going into Gaza immediately after this war would hardly enhance his standing with the Palestinian people. Perhaps further down the road, and Abbas actually said to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was in town when they met over the weekend, saying that the P.A. the Palestinian Authority take control of the Gaza Strip, but only if there were major strides towards an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. And that seems fanciful right now.
 
And it's really hard to see what the ideal solution or what a good solution would be for the Gaza Strip after this war. Perhaps some kind of peacekeeping force under the auspices of the U.N. or maybe friendly Arab states. But it's a very difficult situation and hard to see what precisely would transpire. 
 
For now, as I said, I don't think anyone really knows. what is going to happen there. And from Israel's perspective, the overwhelming focus remains on that military campaign, which it says is making progress. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Elliott Gotkine for that live report from London. I Appreciate it. 
 
On Tuesday, scores of Palestinians fled south from northern Gaza by foot, taking advantage of a corridor opened by the IDF. One of Gaza's primary highways was open for four hours for people to pass through. They carried little to nothing on them. Some waved white flags or held government IDs as they moved, hoping for safe passage. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): I would like to go to the South. I don't know how that can happen. Some people are saying they are checking IDs. We want a safe passage because I have little children with me and an old woman who is disabled. We don't know what will happen to us. We asked the governments and the countries to create a safe passage for us to enter. I will try my luck now. I don't know if I will be alive or dead. Will they send me back or arrest me? Only God knows. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): They told me I should make the ID clearly safe. I came from Al-Shati. We walked a lot. A lot. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: It has been one month and one day since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, killing and abducting hundreds of people and opening a floodgate of rage and pain across the country. That pain has not abated, especially for family members of Hamas hostages. 
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera shows us how they're keeping their loved ones in the spotlight. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israelis gathered at the Western Wall Tuesday night to mark the one-month passing of the October 7th attack, holding a mass prayer for the return of the hostages held in Gaza. One mother was surrounded by the families of other hostages as she pleaded for her son's return. 
 
RACHEL GOLDBERG, MOTHER OF HOSTAGE HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN: He was kidnapped, marched by gunpoint onto a Hamas pickup truck, and led into Gaza. And that was 32 days ago. The hostages have been underground in Gaza for 32 days. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): It's a sign of unity in a country still coming to terms with a terrorist attack that has once again plunged the Middle East into war. 
 
ORLY BARKIMA, VOLUNTEER: I think the country is in trauma. I think that we still don't get it, you know. It's beyond grasping. It's something that is non-human. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Every night, a group of volunteers gathers in Tel Aviv and in cities around the country handing out yellow ribbons to show solidarity with the families of hostages. 
 
BARKIMA: I want the families to feel as if all the people are with them. They're not alone in their struggle, and we won't stop and we won't take off the ribbons until they are back here in Israel. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): While the yellow ribbons are prominently waving in many places, there's an undercurrent of anger and political division simmering across the country. 
 
Much of it directed at senior Israeli government officials. A member of Prime Minister Ben Netanyahu's cabinet was shouted away from a hospital a few weeks ago as she tried to visit attack victims. 
 
To cope with the tension and the anger in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks, Scialom Zarrugh turned his anger into a volunteer mission out of his Tel Aviv restaurant with a group called Natom Titen, which means giving to help others. 
 <br>[03:25:01]
 
For weeks, they've cooked and packaged meals for Israeli soldiers and the victims of the attacks who've been displaced from their homes. 
 
(on-camera): As you do all of this work, do you think about the day that there will be peace? Is peace even possible? 
 
SCIALOM ZARRUGH, RESTAURANT OWNER: We're definitely looking forward for that. We pray every morning, afternoon, evening for the peace to come over us and all of us like all around the world. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Ed Lavandera, CNN, Jerusalem. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: The U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution to censure Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib for her comments criticizing the Israeli government and supporting Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war. Tlaib is the only Palestinian American in Congress. Four Republicans voted against the measure, but 22 of Tlaib's fellow Democrats voted in favor of the public reprimand. 
 
Tlaib posted a video to social media of protesters chanting, from the river to the sea, which the Anti-Defamation League says has long been a rallying cry for those calling for the destruction of Israel. 
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
Before the vote, Tlaib gave an impassioned speech on the House floor defending her remarks, and Democrats and Republicans also took to the floor in a heated debate over the resolution. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): I'm the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, Mr. Chair, and my perspective is needed here now more than ever. I will not be silenced, and I will not let you distort my words. 
 
REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Her voice matters. She is the only Palestinian-American in the Congress, and this is a representative body. Her perspective reflects many that she represents, especially when it's not twisted. 
 
REP. MAX MILLER (R-WA): I believe that actions have consequences and I believe that after a long string of anti-Semitic remarks and hate- filled rhetoric, censure is an appropriate consequence for the gentlelady from Michigan. 
 
UNKNOWN: Gentlemen, time has expired. 
 
MILLER: Damn it means never again. 
 
REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): To compare a modern democracy with a repressive terror state is wrong. But it is also wrong for Congress to take this action at a time when we have serious issues that we face, to take an action and take down the words, to strike the words, to censure a fellow member. No matter how incorrect we believe she may be, is wrong. We lower ourselves when we try to take action against someone else for their words. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: Tlaib has said the phrase from the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate. 
 
And still to come, much more on election night in America. Democrats scoring big wins in Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia. And the power of abortion politics is front and center.

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to our viewers here in the United States, in Canada, and all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church and this is "CNN Newsroom." 
 
An update on the latest U.S. elections now. One of the big takeaways is that abortion rights matter to many voters in crucial swing states. Democrats are celebrating key wins in Virginia where they swept the legislature, hanging on to the Senate and taking control of the House of Delegates. That's after the Virginia governor vowed to outlaw abortion after 15 weeks, in most cases, had Republicans one full control. 
 
In deeply-Republican Kentucky, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear won re-election after campaigning on reproductive rights. And in Ohio, voters have chosen to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitution. Some senior U.S. House Republicans are downplaying the Ohio ballot measure, insisting abortion won't be a driving issue in next year's major elections. But Ohio's Jim Jordan expressed disappointment with his state's decision. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I'm on the side of protecting the sanctity of human life. I'm worried that there are going to be less kids who are going to enjoy life and be able to experience the gift of life that because of this issue that's now in the Constitution. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
And here you can see all the states where abortion is banned or restricted since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade last year. Ohio is among the green states where it is legal. The orange states show where abortion is banned. CNN's Jeff Zeleny picks up the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: For the next year, as Republicans try to win the Senate, keep their narrow majority in the House, and indeed win back the White House, abortion will be front and center in their strategy. The lessons of Tuesday night's elections in Virginia, in Ohio, and in
 
 Kentucky, certainly serve as a reminder that abortion is still a very potent issue, and now it has become a motivating factor for Democrats. 
 
Of course, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade with the Dobbs decision a little more than a year ago, there are so many examples now, election after election, where Republicans are largely on the losing side of this argument. 
 
We're going to see much of this discussion at a Republican presidential debate here in Miami on Wednesday. There has been a difference of viewpoint to some degree about the way forward on abortion. Nikki Haley, for example, the former South Carolina governor, has tried to strike somewhat of a middle ground. Now, Donald Trump, for his part, will not be participating in the debate, but he has tried to not dwell on abortion. He believes it's a losing issue in the words that he has spoken to some of his advisors. 
 
But look for Democrats to try and turn this to their advantage over the next year. In fact, it could be one of their big motivating factors. So there is no doubt, as Republicans try to win control of the Senate, hold their narrow majority in the House, and win back the White House, abortion will be front and center. 
 
Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Miami.

CHURCH: Earlier, I spoke with Lindy Lee, a political strategist and the women's co-chair at the Democratic National Committee. And I asked her about Ohio voters saying yes to issue one. 
 <br>[03:35:07]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LINDY LEE, POLITICAL STRATEGIST: Issue one enshrines the right to abortion, not only abortion, but to contraception, to all sorts of reproductive decisions. And it keeps these very vital and very important, intimate decisions. between a woman and her doctor, where it should be. And it's incredible because we also have to keep in mind that this is the very state that forced a 10-year-old rape victim to travel to Indiana to get abortion care. She was denied care in her own home state. 
 
And then she was attacked by Representative Jim Jordan, who denied her story and then refused to apologize once he was exposed. And then Representative Jean Schmidt of Ohio also caught her rape in opportunity. So today is a victory not just for women, but for everyone who believes in a woman and a girl's right to have control over their own bodies. 
 
CHURCH: And Lindy, in the last couple of days, we have seen some pretty tough polling numbers for President Joe Biden, putting him behind Donald Trump on a range of issues. However, reproductive rights have, of course, become a central issue for President Biden and his party. But will Democratic voters be fired up enough about this controversial issue, do you think to turn out insufficient numbers come November 2024, given Republicans, they're also motivated by this issue? 
 
LEE: Rosemary, that's an excellent question, but I want to remind everyone today that today is a reminder that women have not forgotten about jobs. We haven't forgotten that they took away our reproductive rights. They took away our bodily autonomy. And it's been more than a year, but the pain is still there. And it's going to propel us to victory in 2024. 
 
And despite all the naysayers, despite all the doubts, this is, this rest of the heart, the core of what it means to be a woman. We're not going to soon relinquish the importance of that. This is something that lights a fire under the butts of women, young people, allies, everybody. 
 
And this isn't just about women's rights, but it's also about having, it's also about gay marriage, it's about privacy, it's about making decisions, it's about birth control, it opens the floodgates to everything. So this impacts every facet of American life. 
 
CHURCH: And Lindy, ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade, Republicans have been pushing through restrictive anti-abortion legislation in some red states. But Democrats have won in all six states that put abortion on the ballot, and now of course, Ohio can be added to that list. So how might these wins change the trajectory of the fight for reproductive rights at the state level? 
 
LEE: I think this is a model that we can replicate in many different states. We saw this in Kansas where pro-force birth interests spent $3 million and more trying to ban abortion. They lost. We saw this in Ohio just today. They lost. So we're going to keep doing this again. And one should also be aware that Glenn Yonkin, the governor of Virginia, promised to pass an abortion ban if he were able to win a trifecta in Virginia.
 
Tonight, he was denied that trifecta. And so he's not able, he will not be able to implement the abortion ban that he promised. Governor of Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear, who is in a ruby red state, promised to keep abortion legal, which demonstrates that wherever Democrats run on abortion, they win.

CHURCH: Well it appears the U.S. Supreme Court could rule in favor of a federal law that bars people with domestic violence restraining orders from possessing a gun. What's before the High Court is considered the first serious second amendment case to come before justices since last year's landmark ruling expanding gun rights nationwide. 
 
CNN's Jenn Sullivan reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENN SULLIVAN, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Outside the Supreme Court Tuesday, advocates for domestic violence victims demanding protection from abusers, one woman sharing her personal story with the crowd. 
 
UNKNOWN: The only person the gun was used on was me. 
 
SULLIVAN (voice-over): Inside the high court. The justice is hearing roughly 100 minutes of arguments on the Biden administration's appeal of a ruling striking down a federal law that bans people with protective orders against them from owning a gun. 
 
ELIZABETH PRELOGAR, 48TH SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE U.S.: Guns and domestic abuse are a deadly combination. 
 
SULLIVAN (voice-over): The challenge to the law was brought by Zachy Rahimi of Texas. He's currently in jail for other gun related charges. But in 2020, a restraining order was issued against him following a violent altercation with his then girlfriend. Because of that restraining order, he's banned from owning a gun. 
 <br>[03:40:00]
 
JAMES WRIGHT, FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER IN AMARILLO, TEXAS: It is possible that it would be unconstitutional to deny people the right to purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer. 
 
SULLIVAN (voice-over): Lawyers arguing in support of the law said a woman is five times more likely to die from a domestic abuse situation if a gun is involved. In 1994, Congress passed a measure to ensure domestic violence victims could be protected from their abusers under federal laws. Rahimi's lawyer says that violates his second amendment rights to bear arms. 
 
JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SR. SUPREME COURT ANALYST: Domestic violence was not even an issue. You know, two centuries ago.

On Tuesday, lawmakers welcomed some family members of hostages on the one-month anniversary of the Hamas attacks. Here's what one Republican leader had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): This is not a time to be talking about ceasefires, pauses.

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A family, a village is in mourning. Samira Ayub and her three granddaughters, Ilyan 10, Talin 12, and Rimas 14, were killed in an Israeli drone strike on their car Sunday afternoon near the border with Israel. 
 
Their uncle, Samir, was in the car in front of them. 
 
Their mother was screaming, he recalls, I want my children, where are my children, as she watched her children burning inside the car. 
 
The Israeli military told CNN the vehicle was a, quote, "suspected transport for terrorists," adding they're looking into claims there were civilians in the vehicle. Clearly there were only civilians in the vehicle. 
 
Every day the border area is rocked by incoming and outgoing fire, enough to keep the area on edge. Not enough, yet, to set off a full- blown war. 
 
The ancient city of Tyre lies just 20 kilometers or around 13 miles north of the frontier. Pulling in his nets, Dieb says now is not the time to take risks. 
 
Us fishermen aren't going far out to sea, he tells me. We stay close to shore just in case something happens. 
 
The normally bustling port, the heart of Tyre, is subdued. 
 
Usually this place is full of people, Mohammed, also a fisherman, says. No one is going out. Everyone is staying home. 
 
Ilyas's family has been making fishing boats for generations. He lived through all Lebanon's wars and doesn't want to see another one. 
 
Everyone is scared, he says. Many people have gone elsewhere. Who wants to stay here and be bombed? Until or unless that happens, the fishermen mend their nets. Life must
 
 go on.

CHURCH: Foreign ministers from G7 countries are wrapping up their meeting in Tokyo. The group discussed several issues, including reiterating their support for Ukraine amid Russian aggression and condemning North Korea's repeated ballistic missile launches and arms transfers to Moscow. 
 
CNN's Marc Stewart joins me now live from Beijing with more on this. So Mark, when we spoke last hour, we were talking about the G7 foreign ministers trying to agree on a joint message on the war between Israel and Hamas. Presumably as they wrap up this meeting, they have completed that. 
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, Rosemary, about 20 minutes ago we got the full statement from the G7. I've been looking through it and perhaps the biggest takeaway, the biggest headline, is that the G7 nations are calling for humanitarian pauses in the Israel-Hamas war. They are not calling for a ceasefire and that language is very important. 
 
They feel that these pauses will allow for civilians to get the help that they need. They also feel it will help Israel be able to free some of the hostages. 
 
But let me put this into context for you. The G7 nations are economic superpowers. We have the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, and Canada. Their words certainly carry weight. And this idea of humanitarian pauses and not a ceasefire is in direct conflict. It is not in accord to what their Arab counterparts would like to see. So it's going to be interesting to see how this is all digested. 
 
In addition, not a surprise, they have gone on to say that Israel does have its right to defend itself. And then, broader speaking, Rosemary, they would like to see a full-on peace process that can lead to a two- state solution. But the big headline here, G7 nations. calling for humanitarian pauses, not a ceasefire in this war between Israel and Hamas, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: Right, that is very important. We get that to our viewers. And of course, Marc, what did the group say about Russia's war on Ukraine? 
 
STEWART: Right, there are other hotspots around the world that the G7 is certainly concerned about and caring about. As far as the war with Ukraine, we saw a very elaborate statement offering their support to the Ukrainian people, continuing to offer the support from the G7 nations. They say it is necessary to advance the process of a peace formula. That's their long-term view. 
 <br>[03:50:08] CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Marc Stewart bringing us that live report from Beijing. I Appreciate it. 
 
And still to come, nearly a year after being released from a Russian prison, Brittany Griner is reflecting on her future in basketball. What she's saying about a possible return to the Olympics. Back with that in just a moment.

CHURCH: Welcome back everyone. Well there were no games in the NBA on Tuesday by design as the league took the day off to urge fans to go out and vote on election day in the U.S. NBA teams and stars from around the league put together their own initiatives encouraging fans to cast their ballots.

LEBRON JAMES, LOS ANGELES LAKERS FORWARD: I think vote is very important. creating change, I think we control our own destiny, and to be able to get people out to the polls, be able to learn about who's up and running, it can really change the trajectory of history. 
 
J.B. BICKERSTAFF, CLEVELAND CAVALIERS HEAD COACH: We can't be out there complaining that things aren't working for us, or things are working for other people, but not in our favor if we don't participate in the process. So it's extremely important for everybody to participate in the process, and it's important for everybody's voice to be heard. 
 <br>[03:55:07]
 
ERIK SPOELSTRA, MIAMI HEAT HEAD COACH: It's one of the few times where you have an opportunity to be an active participant and have a say in what you think should be happening at a higher level politically. And so many times you just feel helpless but you do have an opportunity to vote.

CHURCH: Brittany Griner, the American star basketball player who was detained in Russia for nearly 300 days last year, says it will be emotional if she plays in the Summer Olympics in Paris next year.

BRITTNEY GRINER, TWO-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST: It's just a different feeling, you know, when you're playing with USA at the Olympics, representing the whole country, everybody's tuning in. And then there was a lot of times a year ago, you know, a while ago where I didn't think that I would play ball. I didn't think I would ever wear this jersey again. That moment, watching, listening to our anthem, watching the flag go up. It's gonna be a lot of emotions. I probably won't be able to hold that one back.
