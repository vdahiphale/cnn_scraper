BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Here are some of the top stories that we're following on CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
This 84-year-old Kansas City, Missouri, man is now charged with two felonies for allegedly shooting 16-year-old Ralph Yarl, who showed up at his door by accident.
 
Andrew Lester is quoted by police as saying he shot Yarl after he rang the doorbell and then pulled on the door handle. He also said the two never exchanged any words.
 
Yarl, who is now home from the hospital, told police he never pulled on the door before he was shot. 
 
And in Upstate New York, 20-year-old Kaylan Gillis was shot and killed after her friend accidentally turned their car into the wrong driveway. Officials say a man fired two shots at their vehicle from his front porch while they were leaving. 
 
65-year-old Kevin Monahan faces second-degree murder charges. And the local sheriff told CNN he's shown no remorse over what happened. 
 
And the 12 jurors are now seated in the defamation trial against FOX News. 
 
Dominion Voting Systems are seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the network, accusing it of perpetuating false claims that its machines rigged the 2020 election against Donald Trump. 
 
FOX denies the accusations and calls the lawsuit a political crusade. 
 
Boris?
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Investigators in Dadeville, Alabama, have still not named a suspect or revealed a possible motive after four young people were shot and killed last Saturday night at a Sweet 16 birthday party. And 32 others were injured. At least 15 of them were teenagers. 
 
This is 18-year-old Phil Stavitski Dowdell. He was attending his own sister's birthday party when he was shot. 
 
His mother, LaTonya says that she was struck twice when shots rang out. And when the venue turned the lights on after the shooting, she saw her son on the floor soaked in blood. The high school senior died just minutes later. 
 
Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LATONYA ALLEN, VICTIM'S MOTHER: It was a nightmare. A nightmare. I just -- just something a nightmare I don't wish on any parent. I was supposed to go and I see my baby laying down. You know, in a pile of blood. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: CNN's Isabel Rosales has been following the story from Dadeville, Alabama.
 
And, Isabel, you had the chance to speak with Phil Stavitski Dowdell's mother and sister. What did they share with you? 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Boris, LaTonya Allen, that is Phil Dowdell's mother, she told me that, earlier in the night, she was warned that somebody -- there were rumors flying around that somebody might have a gun. 
 
So she cut on the lights. She got on the microphone and warned the kids, if anyone's got a gun, you got to leave. She said nobody left. 
 
Then she told me that there wasn't any sort of commotion or fight before the gunfire erupted. And in the chaos of this mass shooting, neither her nor her daughter could tell just how many shooters there were. 
 
Allen tells me that they've gotten very little from investigators but have been told that there is nobody in custody. 
 
Alexis Dowdell, it was her Sweet 16th birthday party that they were celebrating. And she tells me that her brother died saving her life. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEXIS DOWDELL, VICTIM'S SISTER: And then all I remember is my brother grabbed me and pushed me down to the ground while they shooting. And I just fell in the hole full of blood.
 
And I had ran in and I had picked my brother up and I turned them over and I was telling him -- I was like you fine, like you going to make it, you strong. 
 <br>[13:35:01]
 
ROSALES: And Allen tells me they haven't had a chance to even plan a funeral. That's because Phil Dowdell's body has not been released to the family. Allen tells me that he's undergoing an autopsy -- Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: What an incredibly painful thing for that family to have to deal with. 
 
And, Isabel, it's fascinating that she was warned that somebody at the venue might have a weapon. I'm sure that investigators are interested in that detail. 
 
Have they said anything about a potential suspect? 
 
ROSALES: Boris, they have released very little details, so far. That's been a point of concern and frustration to many here that have spoken within the community.
 
We know from the Dadeville police chief that they have, quote "strong leads." Moving forward in their progress is into figuring out answers here.
 
Now LEAH, the Alabama law enforcement agency that is leading the charge here, they say that there is no public safety concern. But they have not named a suspect. They have not named a motive. They will not answer any questions about if anyone is in custody. 
 
They are, however, asking for patience as they work to piece together this investigation. 
 
They're also asking for folks to send in pictures and videos, anything that might help investigators. 
 
We did get this statement real quick from officials. Special agents did not recover any high-profiled rifle ammunition at the scene. However they did recover numerous shell casings used in handguns. 
 
Agents right now they're completing interviews. The statement also says, "In an effort to solidify a motive and potential suspects -- Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: Important to keep that context in mind. Dozens of people hurt from a handgun, not even an assault rifle it appears.
 
Isabel Rosales, from Dadeville, thank you so much. 
 
Jim? 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Still to come this hour, the U.S. is warning Russia not to touch American technology at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant in Ukraine. I'm going to discuss that and other topics live with national security spokesperson, John Kirby. That's next.
 
And later, local officials in Oklahoma are facing growing pressure to resign after the release of a recording in which they allegedly make racist remarks about lynching black people. You will hear those shocking remarks just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:41:44]
 
SCIUTTO: Right now, as the Pentagon launches a massive review of its classified document protocols and rules and scrambled to determine if other intelligence materials are still circulating online, America's closest ally says some of the information leaked onto an online gaming chat room is just flat-out bogus.
 
Britain's top defense official told myself, Alex Marquardt, other reporters the leak contains, quote, "significant inaccuracies or manipulation of information."
 
He added, quote, "There are definitely things in there that I've seen that I know not to be true."
 
Here to discuss, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, Admiral John Kirby.
 
Good to have you on. Thanks for joining us on the show. 
 
ADM. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: Thank you, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: So first, I wonder do you share that assessment that Ben Wallace told us this morning? Listen, he's seen a lot of false stuff there. He says that he's not too worried about it. Do you share that assessment? 
 
KIRBY: We know that some of the documents have been sort of doctored or manipulated in some way, not all of them, but some of them. So certainly there is a case to be made that not all that information is valid.
 
And we've also said that some of this information that's out there is sort of time sensitive. In other words, it's snapshot in time that the intelligence assessments and events, quite frankly, have moved beyond what some of those documents say. 
 
But look, Jim, no bones about it, we're taking this seriously. We still don't know the full scope of what's out there, what has been disclosed inappropriately. And we want to get our hands around this matter a lot better. 
 
SCIUTTO: One thing that strikes me is that it is -- it's several of the things leaked deal with issues today, right, potential Ukrainian offenses, the state of its air defenses in that -- in that timing.
 
And then you look at Taiwan, the state of Taiwan's defenses as there is great concern about China's plans -- plans there.
 
On Ukraine, does this affect at all Ukrainian calculations about when to launch this expected counter offensive?
 
KIRBY: I point you to what the Ukrainians themselves have said, that they don't see any impact to their future defensive and offensive operations in the weeks and months ahead.
 
Only they can decide sort of how they're going to conduct those operations or what changes they want to make to that. 
 
What we're going to stay focused on, aside from trying to get, you know, a better sense of the national security implications here, changing the protocols and practices as best we can to deal with this and supporting the criminal investigation is to continue to support Ukraine in the battlefield. 
 
You're going to see continued security assistance coming from the United States. We know that the weeks and months ahead are going to be critical for Ukraine, and we want to make sure that we're getting them the kinds of capabilities that they're going to need. 
 
SCIUTTO: Let me ask you this because, as I've covered this story, and I, like others have covered previous leaks -- I look at Chelsea Manning, I look at Edward Snowden, and it's the common threads here.
 
In that you have someone at a relatively low level who had a clearance but had access to materials that seemed far beyond their duties or at least the ability to do so. 
 
And I know this particular person had a had a cyber role that gave them perhaps capability to do that. The DOD has tried to correct, to plug these holes after previous leaks. 
 
When you look at Chelsea Manning, they clearly have not plug those holes. Why not? And why aren't there greater restrictions on what people can access beyond their actual day to day duties? 
 
KIRBY: Well, Secretary Austin at the Pentagon is doing that right now. The president directed both he the intel community as well as the State Department to take a look at the protocols and procedures that are in place for access to classified material. 
 
And just as importantly, the distribution of that classified material. So we're going to -- we're going to learn more. 
 <br>[13:45:03]
 
SCIUTTO: I get -- I get that. But why not before, right? I mean, the vulnerabilities have been exposed before. 
 
So, for instance, why wasn't there a better way to track --
 
KIRBY: Look --
 
SCIUTTO: -- when someone downloads and prints documents?
 
KIRBY: There was. I was at the Pentagon in the wake of the Manning disclosure, and there were changes made. Now what happened in the intervening years I can't speak to. 
 
But look, I think it's important to remember that security protocols, when it comes to classified materials, it's never a static thing. It doesn't just sit -- in stasis. We're constantly reviewing it. We're constantly trying to make it better. 
 
And clearly, we're going to take a look at this incident to see what kind of changes need to be made. 
 
SCIUTTO: I want to talk about an issue also on the ground in Ukraine, and that is this us warning to Russia, saying in effect do not touch any u. S technology at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. 
 
Why that warning now? What's the level of urgency? And are you confident that they have not yet accessed such -- such technology? 
 
KIRBY: Look, I think you need to take a couple steps back here. First of all, they shouldn't be there. There's no reason for Russian forces to be at that nuclear power plant. 
 
It should not be militarized. That needs to stop. And we want to make sure that it can maintain its safety and security. 
 
And I think the warning you're talking about is in the context of maintaining the security of the nuclear facility. We have not seen any sort of radio activity or leaks or any damage in that regard. 
 
But look, I mean, it's still getting shelled. and Russian forces are still there. It needs to be demilitarized. We agree with the director general of the IAEA that the forces need to move out. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes. Well, retired Admiral John Kirby, always good to have you on the program. You're welcome to come back --
 
KIRBY: Thanks. Good to be here.
 
SCIUTTO: --to be with us. 
 
Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: Still to come, growing pressure in Oklahoma for this sheriff and other local officials to resign after being caught on tape allegedly making racist remarks, talking about lynching black people. You're going to hear those recordings when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:51:32]
 
KEILAR: The governor of Oklahoma is calling for the resignation of four county officials, including these two here, McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy and district commissioner, Mark Jennings, after audio surfaced allegedly capturing them making extremely racist remarks as well as threatening to kill two journalists. 
 
McCurtain County is in southern Oklahoma. And the local paper there says this all took place following a public county commissioners meeting.
 
But the sheriff's department says the audio was secretly recorded.
 
Just a warning that what we are about to play for you is disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was back today. What does that with Alan Marshall? Take a black get whooped, harass and throw them in the cell. I'd run for chair. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it's not like taking a mud creek and hang them up with the rope. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, but you can't talk about it. I got more action. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: CNN's Rosa Flores following the story from us from Houston. 
 
Rosa, what are the people whose voices were allegedly caught on this tape saying about this today? 
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, CNN has reached out to all of the four individuals who allegedly participated in that conversation, and we have not heard back.
 
But, Brianna, as you mentioned, the governor of Oklahoma is asking for these four individuals to step down, for them to resign. 
 
They include Kevin Clardy, the McCurtain Curtain County Sheriff Mark Jennings, district commissioner Alicia Manning, the sheriff's investigator, Eric Hendricks, the jail administrator. 
 
Now we want to share with you more audio. But again, we want to warn you that the audio is disturbing.
 
That CNN has not been able to independently verify or authenticate this audio, and CNN also has not been able to determine who is saying what in this exchange. 
 
Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want to dig deep holes are ever needed escalator. These are three dunks. We actually have known to three hitmen.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very quiet guys would cut. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLORES: Now, Brianna, that audio is very difficult to -- and tough to hear what they're talking about, violence against journalists. 
 
Now I should mention that the governor of Oklahoma has asked me, which is the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to look into this matter -- Brianna?
 
KEILAR: There's a backstory here, Rosa. Tell us how we got here. 
 
FLORES: You know, this is important. As you mentioned, this is happening in a McCurtain County, Oklahoma, in the southeast portion of this state. 
 
The paper there is the "McCurtain Gazette News." And according to the attorney of that paper, there's a family-- the Willingham family has been publishing this paper for decades. 
 
Well, they filed a lawsuit last month on March 6th. This lawsuit alleges defamation and also other civil rights allegations. 
 
And it was on that same day, Brianna, that that lawsuit was filed when this recording was captured.
 
Now the paper says that the recording was legal. The sheriff says that the legality is being investigated.
 
The sheriff issuing a statement saying, quote:
 
"There is and has been an ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which states that it is illegal to secretly recorded conversations in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties." 
 
Now the Willingham family also issued a statement through their attorney saying, in part, "For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for a McCurtain County."
 <br>[13:55:07] 
 
It's important to note that the Oklahoma attorney general tells CNN that they do have -- that office has that recording, Brianna, and that they are investigating. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, officials are not saying it isn't real, which is important to note. 
 
Rosa, thank you for that report. We do appreciate it. 
 
Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: These sketches are just coming in from the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against FOX News. Twelve jurors have just been seated in the biggest defamation trial in a generation. And in just moments, we're going to take you live outside the courtroom. Stay with us.
