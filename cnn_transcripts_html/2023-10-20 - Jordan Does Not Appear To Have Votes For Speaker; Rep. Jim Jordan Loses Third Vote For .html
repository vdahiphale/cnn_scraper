THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[12:00:00]
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's a problem for your party for him to continue on without a path to the speakership?
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): Well, there is a problem for the party that we're in this place to begin with. And its four percent, eight members here, crazy members led by Gaetz, that put us in a bad situation.
 
RAJU: But he's still running?
 
MCCARTHY: You know, that's up to Jim. Jim, looks, I mean you look at and see where he wants to go.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What you mean, you have own opinion, you have an opinion, can't you? What do you -- -
 
MCCARTHY: You guys work hard at your job? I understand you work hard.
 
RAJU: Well, why wouldn't you say what you think?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
MCCARTHY: We are in a very bad place right now.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When we go to this conference?
 
MCCARTHY: I think we conference at 1. I'm not sure.
 
RAJU: Do you think they'll be a fourth ballot?
 
MCCARTHY: Yes.
 
RAJU: Jordan say, they'll be a fourth ballot. All right. OK. I'm back with you guys. I'm sure you caught most of that.
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: We heard that Manu, can I translate? I think I'm going to break out my McCarthy to English, English to McCarthy dictionary. So just if I can -
 
RAJU: Go for it.
 
TAPPER: -- so two days ago, he was saying Jim Jordan is going to win on the first ballot, right?
 
And that was the most honest, I've seen him, McCarthy, about Jordan, when he says that's going to be up to Jim. To me, that means, yes, man. He's got no path. He needs to give it up. That's what I took from that. That's my translation is that.
 
RAJU: I think that's a fair transaction. In fact, that was a much different message than he had going in to the chamber. I mean, when I asked him in the chamber, he said, it'll be fine. We'll see how it goes. He knows where the votes are.
 
He knows it's going in the wrong direction. He knows that Jim Jordan cannot become speaker, given the direction that this is headed here, but did make some news as we were hearing there is going to be a Republican meeting this afternoon to try to assess what to do here.
 
And he made very clear, they are not in a good place as Republican conference, which of course is an understatement. Given how bad things have gotten within the Republican conference about all of this. He continues to blame the same eight members, the Republicans who led this effort voted to oust him, here led by Congressman Matt Gaetz. He calls them the crazy eights, led by Gaetz.
 
That's also shows you that if they were -- if he wanted any hope to get back in the speakership himself, he would need those votes to come back inside. There's no sign of that happening, either. So where do they go from here? Is not clear. You heard McCarthy there saying, that it depends on what Jim Jordan decides to do. It's up to Jim to decide what about, whether or not to step aside here.
 
But acknowledging very clearly here, Republicans are in a very, very bad place. They have to figure things out. They have to get it behind closed doors again. They have had so many meetings behind closed doors that have gone absolutely nowhere that have just led to more and more division, more and more frustration, more and more chaos.
 
And this former speaker himself saying earlier to me today, things are just incredibly chaotic right now, him acknowledging that his Republican House has lived as essentially caused this crisis here, completely stalled legislative branch would no way out. But things are getting much worse for Jim Jordan and the former speaker, they're clearly acknowledging that, Jake?
 
TAPPER: Yes. When you ask a politician should so and so -- should Congressman x drop out and they say, that's up to the congressman. That means I sure hope he drops out. He should drop out. That's what it means. Manu, thank you so much. Dana?
 
DANA BASH, CNN HOST, INSIDE POLITICS: Jake, thank you so much. And I'm not sure if you can hear me. Jake, thank you so much. And welcome to a special edition of Inside Politics. You are looking at a shot of the House floor of a bunch of members elected from Americans across the country and every single district in America at a standstill, because they have once again voted and failed to elect a speaker of the House. This time, Jim Jordan, for the third time it is Jim Jordan. And now he -- - TAPPER: I'm sorry. Dana shot is taking hits out there until she gets it back up. We're going to take over for her and then as soon as her shot is fixed, she's got some, whether gremlins (Ph) is out there. We'll get right back to her.
 
But David Chalian, I have to say, I like it when politicians. I don't like when politicians no smile. I don't want to be. I want to be honest here. I don't like it necessarily, if something bad has happened to them, but I do like it when something intervenes, and they are candid. And that was a rare moment of candor, when he's basically saying, yes, Jim's got to drop out. We're going to meet, we're in a bad place.
 
DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Yes. And as Manu noted, it was just totally, totally different from where McCarthy was just an hour or two before where he was when he was giving the nominating speech? Where he was last night when he left him and saying that Jordan is going to be able to cut this out and that he was given 15 rounds.
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
TAPPER: Jim Jordan is the greatest legislator that ever lived. He is a man of integrity.
 
CHALIAN: Jim Jordan has some thinking to do here. That's an easy sell. But Kevin McCarthy also is a vote counter. I mean he was the, you know, he was the head of the NRCC.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CHALIAN: No, no, I understand that he didn't have the votes to stay with the vacay. But I'm saying, he has experience of understanding where the conference is. By the way, Kevin McCarthy knew when he allowed the government to stay open and do that government funding bill. He knew his job was in jeopardy. It's not that he didn't know where the votes were.
 
But the point here, though, is he too was paying attention.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
TAPPER: Hold a second, let's listen in.
 
REP. PATRICK MCHENRY, (R-NC): That is 429, of which the Honorable Jim Jordan of the state of Ohio has received 194. The Honorable Hakeem Jeffries of the state of New York has received 210. The Honorable Patrick McHenry, the state of North Carolina received six. All right. The House will come to order. The House will come to order.
 
The Honorable Byron Donalds of the state of Florida has received two. The Honorable Tom Emmer the state of Minnesota has received one. Lee Zeldin of the state of New York has received four. The Honorable Steve Scalise of the state of Louisiana has received eight. The Honorable Mike Garcia of the state of California has received one.
 
The Honorable Kevin McCarthy of the State of California has received two. The Honorable Bruce Westerman of the state of Arkansas has received one. No person having received a majority. The whole number of votes cast by surname a speaker has not been elected. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule 1, the chair declares the House recess subject to the call of the chair.
 
TAPPER: OK. So, we still don't have a speaker for the first time in American history. What are we on day 17 now, day 17. And of course, there is a tremendous amount going on in the world and we need a functioning legislative branch. We still do not have one because House Republicans cannot get their stuff together, they cannot get their stuff in order.
 
And we, for the 17th day in a row do not have a speaker of the House, which means we don't have a functioning U.S. House of Representatives, which means we do not have a functioning legislative branch. Despite the fact that we have a war in Ukraine and a war in Israel and Gaza. Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill for us to tell us what's going on. Manu?
 
RAJU: Yes. Republicans are going to meet behind closed doors at 1pm to discuss their way forward. Now, I am told that there's some discussion about whether they should, there'll be a vote, potentially a vote behind closed doors to decide whether or not the Republican conference believes that Jim Jordan should still be the candidate for speaker.
 
They may put this question to a vote. This is what's now being discussed on the floor of the House or trying to figure out, whether or not to actually put this to a test. And perhaps, if a majority of the House Republican conference votes, then they say, they don't think that Jim Jordan should be their candidate anymore, then he will step aside.
 
So, this is a very significant development, if this ultimately comes to it. But they have planned to meet in just within an hour to try to figure out their way forward as the speak -- former speaker of the House, they're saying we are in a very bad place. Can they get out of that bad place?
 
Unclear, but Jim Jordan's future could be put to a test in this meeting. And then they'll have to decide if they want him out. Who's going to be the next candidate? Can they get a candidate who can give you elected speaker, or will this House remain in a state of paralysis? Jake?
 
TAPPER: All right. Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. And we're joined here on my panel by the splendid Kasie Hunt. Kasie, coming in third number. Coming in first was Hakeem Jeffries. Coming in second was Jim Jordan. Coming in third or second among the Republicans was Steve Scalise, who at least had the self-awareness to not take his losing campaign to the House floor.
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: You have series of embarrassing votes about inability.
 
TAPPER: Yes. Who read the writing on the wall and decide it to not make a spectacle of himself. Coming in, after that is McHenry. HUNT: Yes. Look, these members clearly got together and decided they were going to make a statement that they wanted to stand for Patrick McHenry. and I think it's notable the three Republicans who made their stand against Jordan today who hadn't in the past, all from districts that Biden won, right.
 
These are people who, you know, need, frankly, their party to seem relatively at least a little bit appealing to the other side, maybe too far gone for that, but they're going to have to face campaign ads and problems. And collectively they decided it seems that McHenry was going to be the person they were going to throw their weight behind.
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
Now, McHenry was the person in the bowtie, who was cheered even by the clerk of the House. He's well liked across the aisle. He honestly just doesn't want the job. And I've actually been wondering how much of that is playing into this here because if he were more willing to do it, would we have seen perhaps this play out a little bit differently? I don't know. He's got a young family, and I mean, who would want to sign up to deal with this?
 
TAPPER: Well, I'm sorry. I'm going to throw back to Dana, because her gremlins have gone away. And her set is working, and her microphone is working. So, Dana Bash, over to you.
 
BASH: Gremlin free. Thank you so much. Appreciated, Jake. And the speaker fight has every -- but as we've been talking about paralyze Capitol Hill for more than two weeks. Two weeks in which we have witnessed the horrific Hamas terror attacks inside Israel. The House cannot do anything about aid for Israel or Ukraine until there is a speaker.
 
I want to focus on that for a few minutes and go right to CNN's Clarissa Ward, who is in Cairo, Egypt. Clarissa, there is of course a dire need for humanitarian aid that you have been talking about constantly to get into Gaza. The hope was that it would come through Egypt at the Rafah gate, but it is still closed.
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Dana. We were at the Rafah gate today with the U.N. secretary general. The hope was that that aid was going to start coming through. And yet, what we saw were hundreds of trucks, waiting in long lines now for three days and still a paralysis in terms of being able to get that aid to where it is so desperately needed.
 
Now, the two main issues at this stage appear to be on the Israeli side. They want to be sure that they can verify those trucks, that they can go through the contents, that they can make sure there are no weapons or anything like that before they go into Rafah and beyond.
 
The issue is where do you do that? Who does it? And how do you do it in a timely manner? The second issue is that the U.N. doesn't want this to be an isolated incident, one-time thing where 20 trucks go in. They want it to be an established and sustained daily humanitarian corridor. And what they're worried about is that if they can't get that kind of consensus from everyone at the table, that when they would go in with just 20 trucks, that they will be mobbed, that there will be a frenzy. And just to give you some perspective, it used to be before the violent attacks from Hamas of now almost two weeks ago, that over 400 trucks will go into Gaza every single day.
 
So now, we're talking about 20 trucks, relatively speaking, it's a drop in the ocean. And that's why there's this concern that it could be violent or dangerous for U.N. staff. If it isn't agreed upon, that this is not going to be a one-off thing, and that the aid will start flowing more freely.
 
Now what was interesting, Dana, is that the U.N. secretary general initially, I think, hoped he was going to go there with a good news story, at least hoped he was going to be able to go there and say, we're doing everything we can and meet with volunteers.
 
Instead, he arrived at a full-blown protest, hundreds of angry people who honestly you could barely hear the secretary general's remarks. They were drowned out by the crowd. People demanding justice. People looking for loved ones inside Gaza who they had lost contact with.
 
And a lot of people who are incredibly angry at Israel, the U.S. at international institutions that they feel had failed the Palestinian people. And also, Dana, a lot of anger at western media. I had one woman started shouting at me. I went up to her. I said, tell me what you want to say, engage with me. I'm willing to hear it. Take a listen to what she had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are here to speak the truth because western a lot, I'm not going to generalize. But a lot of western channels have been aiding in the dehumanization of Arabs. You say a hunt. When I say the word Muhammad. How does that make you feel?
 
You immediately flinch because that's what's been happening. So now, when a thousand plus Palestinian babies die, you don't feel the same. You don't feel the same as when I tell you one of your owners died. But these are our own. And it is unfair and each of 12,000 Palestine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WARD: Eventually, the situation became so charged and the protesters became so exercise that the secretary general was quickly whisked away. We were ordered onto buses and also whisked away. People were sort of slamming on the buses as we left. And then the secretary general at the airport in a reach just about 30 miles from there said, you know, listen, because I asked him about the anger.
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
He said, we understand. We're doing everything we can. We're desperate to make it happen as soon as possible, but up until now, Dana, there really isn't a sense yet in any concrete terms of when this aid might start flowing into those people who so desperately needed. Dana?
 
BASH: Clarissa, thank you so much for that report. And here with me now is Jonathan Dekel-Chen. His son is believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas. First of all, I am so sorry to hear this. And I know that you have been in anguish for nearly two weeks now. Your son Sagui Dekel-Chen was last seen at the kibbutz. One of the kibbutz is where there was barbaric torture, and also people were taken hostage.
 
And obviously, as we're seeing these demonstrations in the Arab world, this is an important reminder of how this particular war started. And it started with Hamas terrorists coming into Israel, and brutally killing many and taking others including your son. hostage.
 
JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAEL-AMERICAN PRESUMED TO BE KIDNAPPED: Yes. Well, thank you for saying that. Obviously, no decent human being can see the suffering of the civilians in Gaza and not feel that pain. And but the world simply can't ignore the fact that the series of events that's led up to this is still very much connected to its origin, which is a rampage of about 2000 heavily armed well-trained terrorists, into civilian cooperative farms and some small towns along the border with Israel, including my own kibbutz Nir Oz, a farming community and no military significance whatsoever.
 
Killing of dozens of our residents from toddlers to elderly people and everything in between, and the taking of many more dozens of captives from the kibbutz, also from 10 months old to 88-year-old granny, including 35-year-old son. So, you know, this is without understanding that it really -- any discussion of the current suffering in Gaza is just totally one sided. There are hundreds of Israeli civilian captains waiting to at least be acknowledged by Hamas. So, we know at the very least, if they're living or not.
 
BASH: Well, on that note, we learned this morning that the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, says that a majority of hostages are alive. Does that give you some hope? And specifically, have you been contacted by the IDF about what this could mean for you personally and most importantly, your son Sagui.
 
DEKEL-CHEN: I have not been contacted by the IDF since that announcement was made. And I very much hope that it's accurate. What I do know for certain is that the excruciatingly long list of missing and captive people from my kibbutz has incrementally gotten shorter over the last few days, as we've gotten notifications from Israeli authorities, that people that we thought might be captive had been confirmed dead, meaning murdered either on the grounds of the kibbutz or as they were being abducted into Gaza.
 
So, time is of the essence here. It's clear. We are -- I don't know if I can speak for other families. But at least those, the many dozens of families here are kibbutz, but we have no -- and we've gotten no information about signs of life or anything else from the IDF or any other source.
 
BASH: I can't even imagine as a parent of a son, the anguish that you must be feeling right now. You are speaking about your son. And the question for you is about the American perspective. I mean, you heard President Biden last night speaking, and he obviously was on the ground in Israel. What is your sense of how the U.S. government has been handling this so far?
 
DEKEL-CHEN: I think, you know, in a way it's a kind of mirror image of our impression as, you know, those families who have loved ones in captivity in terms of the American government, really from Tuesday, within two days after the massacres by Hamas in our people and throughout the border area. We were contacted. American citizens were contacted by our embassy and the state department, and we continue to be in contact with authorities. They don't have any information for us, but at least there's an open line.
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
And I have absolute faith after having heard President Biden, his general statements and also having participated in a video conference with between him and state department officials, and American citizens whose loved ones are being held by Hamas. I have no doubt whatsoever that he has a deep personal commitment, and to the welfare of all the hostages, not just the American citizens, as does his administration, and time will tell how that can come to bear. But I have absolute faith and his desire to make these people.
 
BASH: Jonathan Dekel-Chen, your son again, Sagui is, we believe, you believe, held captive by Hamas terrorists somewhere in Gaza. And obviously everybody continues to hold that hope that he is alive, and he will come back alive and well. Thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it.
 
DEKEL-CHEN: Thank you for your concern.
 
BASH: And we are going to now turn to a completely different story here in the United States. There is breaking news in Fulton County, Georgia election interference. That case that is going on there, another significant plea deal. I want to get straight to CNN's Nick Valencia in Atlanta. Nick?
 
Nick Valencia: Defense attorney for Ken Chesebro, Scott Grubman tells CNN that we just saw a video of Ken Chesebro signing a plea deal with the Fulton County District Attorney's office. We were under the impression that he was offered a deal. But the source familiar with those discussions happening last night, said it was not clear whether Chesebro would take the deal.
 
But now Scott Grubman telling CNN on the record just moments ago, Ken Chesebro, the alleged architect of the fake electors' plot in 2020. One of the key attorneys here in promoting conspiracy theories and widespread voter fraud theories that were not true.
 
In the wake of the election loss of Donald Trump has now taking a plea with the Fulton County District Attorney's office. Make no mistake about this, Dana. This is a monumental win for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
 
She now only, not only has one but two key witnesses against former President Donald Trump. And I'll toss it back to you as we get to this courtroom under way. The judge now addressing the courtroom. We should hear the details about plea agreement any moment now. Dana?
 
BASH: Thank you so much for this significant reporting. I appreciate it. I want to go now to CNN's Paula Reid. Paula, you have been doing a lot of reporting on this as well. Can you put into context, just how big a deal it is that for the second day in a row, we are seeing people in Donald Trump's orbit on this issue, agreeing to a plea deal.
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Not just in his orbit, Dana, but also members of his inner circle. The district attorney in Fulton County has now secured plea deals from two former members of Trump's legal team. And I spoke to a source this morning, close to the current criminal defense team who conceded that, yes, this could be a problem, especially if these two testify at a trial depending on what they say.
 
And they also noted that the biggest problem for Trump here is that his defense attorneys are not going to get what they hoped would be a preview of the Fulton County case. They were hoping to have the opportunity to watch the trial against Powell and Chesebro to be able to suss out, where the weaknesses were in this case and plot their own defense.
 
Now, they will not have that. Going forward, Dana, we will expect likely additional free deals, was never expected that all 19 defendants in this sprawling landmark case would actually go to trial. It is expected that like many Rico prosecutions -- -
 
BASH: Reid, I'm going to have to interrupt you. We want to listen in inside the courtroom.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And that you have signed as well?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I have.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Along with Mr. Rohr?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Judge (Inaudible).
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you had enough time to speak with your attorney Mr. Rohr and Mr. (Inaudible)?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you had an opportunity to talk with him about all the facts and circumstances regarding the charges in the indictment, including your potential defenses?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you need more time to discuss your case with either of your attorneys? And are you satisfied with their services?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Grubman, do you wait for more reading of the indictment?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you waive any and all defects that may lie within that indictment?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Chesebro, have you been arrested on these charges that lies in indictment? Two three SC 188947.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The state is unaware of any outstanding warrants related to these charges? Do you or your attorney know have any outstanding warrants that involve these charges?
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that this is a negotiated plea, which means your attorneys in the state have reached and negotiated recommendation to make to the court?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that the court is not bound by that recommendation and could send a shoe to the maximum penalty for the charges.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that the recommendation in this particular case as to count 15-conspiracy to commit filing false documents, is five years to be served on probation. A $5,000 fine. And that, you're -- believe you're asking the court to treat you as a first offender? Is that correct?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry. $5,000. Restitution. You understand that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And do you understand also special conditions of the probation is that you commit complete a hundred hours of community service?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And that you write an apology letter to the citizens of the state of Georgia?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Which I have, yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. And that you truthfully testify at all hearings and trials involving co-defendants in this matter, that you have no communication with co-defendants, witnesses or the media until all cases have been resolved against all co-defendants?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And do you understand that you must give a full recorded proffer with the state that you continue to also provide documents and evidence, subject to any lawful privileges asserted in good faith?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And your honor, the defendant has already sought done an apology letter which the state will tender into evidence as exhibit number one. And also, this morning Mr. Chesebro along with counsel, did give a proffer to the state. And I believe there is an understanding that any outstanding emails, text message or any of those things will be turned over to the state in timely manner.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Chesebro, do you understand as I stated before, if the judge does not follow the recommendation, you can withdraw your guilty plea and go forward with trial?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that this is a guilty plea, which be -- which, well, for your case, did you're asking for first offender? So, once you complete a first offender, you can honestly say that you have not been convicted of a felony. And I'll go over that with you a little bit more.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I understand.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And do you understand that this plea may be used to enhance sentencing and any other convictions you may have in any other jurisdictions in the state of Georgia, or outside of the state of Georgia and in federal courts?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that you are being placed on probation as part of this plea? As being on probation, you cannot violate any criminal laws of any governmental unit or any special conditions of the probation? Do you understand that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that if you violate your probation or any other special conditions, you will be subject to revocation of the balance of the sentence?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that you are not allowed to possess or use firearms as a result of this plea in while you're on probation?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that if you're not a United States citizen, this guilty plea could -- will affect your immigration status and will result in deportation, just like a conviction at trial would and that this is truly -- is true regardless of any advice your attorney may have given you or anyone may have given you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, fortunately, I am.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that you -- that there may be other adverse or unfavorable consequences as a result of this guilty plea? Just as there would be for conviction after trial, for example, your guilty plea may affect your right to vote, your right to hold public office, the right to resort to serve as a juror, the right to obtain a passport, the right to receive possess or transport firearms, the ability to obtain employment and your membership of any state or federal bars of which you are a member.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that by pleading guilty, if you use receive, possess or transport a firearm, or use a firearm in a crime, you will be guilty of a felony which may carry a sentence of one to 15 years.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As my understanding you're asking the court to treat you as a first offender. Is that correct?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is correct.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you gone over the First Offender Act with your attorneys Mr. Grubman and Mr. Rohr?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I have.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you ever pled guilty or nolo (Ph) to or ever been convicted of a felony in the state of Georgia or any other jurisdiction?

You could be adjudicated guilty, and you could be re-sentenced up to the maximum sentence for each -- for the charge in this indictment for which you are pleading.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that you waive any and all defenses, including any mental health defenses by entering this guilty plea?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that if you went to trial, you would have the right to trial by jury, the right to see here and confront witnesses called to testify against you by the state, the right to testify or remain silent and not incriminate yourself. Do you understand that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you understand that this guilty plea, you are giving up that all of those rights the right to a trial by jury, the right to remain silent and not to incriminate yourself, the right to confront witnesses. The right to have assistance of counsel hired by you or appointed by the court if you could not afford one, the right of the presumption of innocence.
