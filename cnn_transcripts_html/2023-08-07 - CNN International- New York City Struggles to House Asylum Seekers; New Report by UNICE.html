BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
Donald Trump has just a few hours to respond to a protective proposal order that would limit his access to evidence in the 2020 election interference case. Trump's attorneys says that they plan to fight that request. 
 
And nearly 120 million people are under severe weather threats across the Eastern U.S. Tornados, thunder storms, heavy winds and large hail are expected over the next few days. 
 
New York City is racing to help thousands of migrants who are seeking asylum there. Nearly 100,000 asylum seekers have come through and city's intake center since last spring and nearly 200 cites have been open to shelter them. City officials say that they need federal help. CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval is in New York with more on this growing crisis.

POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Still no end in sight for New York City's migrant crisis as New York City officials struggle to find housing for the increasing number of asylum seekers who have arrived here in the city since last spring.
 
Close to a hundred thousand of those, about 56,000 or more, continue to be in the city's care. They have been placed at shelter facilities in and around the city. In fact, the Roosevelt Hotel that you see behind me here in Manhattan, that not only serves as a shelter but also as that primary intake facility where many of the newly arrived are directed to, so they can best be at least make contact with those resources that they need.
 
It was as recent as last week that we saw dozens of asylum seekers, mostly men, actually forced to sleep on the sidewalk because of an influx in the numbers. We should note the New York City officials were later able to actually place them in temporary shelter facilities so this weekend no signs of that kind of an issue. However in Eric Adams's most recent remarks, the New York City mayor, he's made very clear that that scene is bound to repeat itself if the city does not receive any further support at the state or at the federal level.

NOBILO: U.S. border patrol officials made a surprising discovery during an arrest in Texas. Seven spider monkeys were found hidden in a backpack in an attempt to smuggle them through the southern border. Conservationist say at least six species of spider monkeys living in the central and south are considered endangered.

Italian Coast Guard crews rescued dozens of migrants after two boats sank off the island of Lampedusa. Migrants had to survive in choppy seas until they could be pulled to safety. Authorities recovered the bodies of three people including a 3-year-old and a pregnant woman. They say that one of the survivors gave birth immediately after being rescued. Italy's Air Force said dozens of other migrants stranded on rocks. Officials believe the boats set off from Tunisia on Thursday and at least 30 people are still missing from that. 
 
Now still ahead, a new report by UNICEF said extreme heat is having an outsized impact on children in a large region of the world. We'll have the details for you. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: Flooding in northeastern China has left at least 14 people dead. The region is also suffering heavily from agricultural losses from the rainfall. It's a major supplier of food for the rest of China. 40,000 people have been evacuated from the city in a neighboring province. And they're part of a massive wave of people being forced from their homes. Aid is being trucked in for more than a million people. 
 
And in Europe, fire crews are still battling wildfires. They brought a blaze under control in Portugal that had threatened homes and burned nearly 7,000 hectares. 
 
In Italy, on the island of Sardinia, hundreds of residents had to be evacuated too. This video from Spain shows how neighborhoods near the border with France narrowly escaped a wildfire that left behind charred hills and fields. Only the roads stood between them and disaster. Europe is dealing with one of the hottest summers on record. Spain's weather agency is predicting another heat wave will begin on Tuesday. 
 
And a new report from UNICEF said 76 percent of children in South Asia are exposed to extreme heat. That's the highest percentage in the world. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
It means children in the region, which includes countries like India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are living under extremely high temperatures 83 or more day of the year. This report emphasizes how these children are bearing the brunt of climate change through no fault of their own, obviously. CNN's Vedika Sud is in the heart of South Asia right now and she's coming to us live from New Delhi. Vedika, tell us about the specific vulnerabilities that extreme heat exposes children to. 
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: You know, in Europe and parts of America, like you just mentioned, people are reeling under extreme heat waves. But in South Asia, according to this UNICEF report, that is basing its findings on data from the year 2020, almost half a billion, Bianca, half a billion children have been affected deeply by the high temperatures triggered by climate change in the region. 
 
Now, we're talking about 460 million children. At least 460 million children from countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, and some other countries in the patch. 
 
A few highlights and key take-aways from the report that we have seen and understood was being almost 76 percent of children in South Asia were exposed to high temperature compared to 42 percent globally. Almost 28 percent of children in South Asia were exposed to 4.5 or more heat waves per year, compared to 24 percent globally and 800,000 children in flood-affected areas are in risk of severe heat stress in June 2023. 
 
According to this analysis, 3 to 4 children in South Asian have witnessed and been affected by high temperature compared to 1 of 4 globally. So the are staggering figures. And it talks to the plight of one or more children and women who are deeply impacted by climate crisis, and how that's triggered frequent heat waves across South Asia. And supports really that will continue until there is some solution for the region which, of course, we keep talking about, but we don't really see any solid solutions coming our way. 
 
Now, according to the regional director of UNICEF South Asia -- I'm going to quote him here. He talks of the concerns that these findings lead to. 
 
He says: The lives and well-being of millions of children across South Asia are increasingly threatened by heat waves and high temperatures. Young children simply cannot handle the heat unless we act now, these children will continue to bear the brunt of more frequent and more severe heat waves in the coming years through no fault of theirs. 
 
I think the last five words, no fault of theirs, is significant here as well. Because this is a legacy that has been left behind for these young children under the age of 18. The biggest headline from this report, Bianca, would be that children under 18 in South Asia have been hit hardest by climate change that's triggered frequent heat waves and high temperatures in the region. Back to you. 
 
NOBILO: Vedika Sud live in new Delhi, thank you. 
 
Still ahead this hour, a huge upset at the women's world cup. 
 
Swedish fans celebrate as their team eliminates the defending champions, the U.S. we'll tell you how they pulled that off. 
 <br>[04:45:00]

VLATKO ANDONOVSKI, U.S. COACH: It just shows how cruel these games sometimes can be. And how -- how small -- how small detail makes a difference between winning and losing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: Coach of the U.S. women's soccer team there with a stunned reaction to Sunday's loss against Sweden. The Americans were eliminated from the World Cup in a penalty shoot-out ending their quest for a third straight title. It marked their third tournament loss in 12 years. And their exit earliest ever. Sweden will now face Japan in the quarterfinals. 
 
Today four other teams are vying for a spot in the round of eight. The first two are England and Nigeria who are currently locked in a draw. That match will be followed by a contest between Denmark and tournament cohost Australia. 
 
Let's get more now from CNN's Angus Watson who is live for us in Sydney. Angus, fans are still reeling from the huge upset that we saw of the U.S. being knocked out. What can we expect today? 
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN PRODUCER: Well, that's what comes with the luxury of the penalty shoot-out, Bianca. And team USA just couldn't make a lot of their good attacking play on the night down there in Melbourne against Sweden. Pay off, nil-nil, on the score sheet at the end of the game, despite having 21 shots on the Swedish goal. 21 of them on goal, 11 of them right at the keeper there, forcing saves from Musovic who played a stunning game. And perhaps the fact that Sweden's best player was their goalkeeper says something about the match, keeping strikes out from Alex Morgan, Sophia Smith, captain Lindsey Horan, who really all putting a huge effort to try to get team USA on the scoreboard. 
 
They couldn't do it -- nil-nil, goes into penalties. What an extraordinary penalty shoot-out it was and disappointment for team USA. Who are going through some of a restructuring now, you must say looking at the next tournament. Not many people had been earmarked for an early exit this time, all eyes will be on the next tournament. Players like Megan Rapinoe, now considering her career, having played in her last major tournament there. Going out in heartbreaking fashion. Here's some of what she had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MEGAN RAPINOE, TWO-TIME WORLD CUP CHAMPION: It's tough to go out, obviously, like this. I mean, I just like obviously saw this half, and they said because this is like a sick joke. That's a dark, dark, dark, dark sour bread humor in there somewhere. But that's the way that, you know, the game goes. And that's the way that life goes. And I feel grateful for this moment still to be able to play in another one and have this experience and, yes, this is life.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
WATSON: So, Bianca, of course, the tournament goes on with or without team USA. Right now, we have England locked goalless against Nigeria, pulsating arm wrestle of a first half though. The Nigerians having a lot of the attacking play to enjoy England denied a penalty just before halftime there. 
 
But the showpiece of the day, you have to say, is here at stadium Australia in Sydney. Where the Matildas, the hometown heroes will play against Denmark in this round of 16. This do or die match. You'll remember that they had to beat Canada to get here. So this is almost like the second knockout stage that the Matildas have had to play. They won 4-nil in that game against Canada, the Tokyo 2020 cold medalists. Now against Denmark, let's see what they can do. Everyone here sweating on the fitness of Sanco, that calf injury has kept her out of the World Cup so far. We'll see if we see her on the pitch tonight -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Angus Watson, live for us from Sydney. Thank you so much for bringing all that color and those descriptions. Thank you. 
 
And as Angus mentioned, the U.S. match against Sweden marked the final tournament appearance for Megan Rapinoe who is to retire later this year. Her final play for Team USA was a crucial miss in the penalty shoot-out. It was hardly the ending that she was hoping for, of course. But as CNN's Carolyn Manno reports, the football star will leave an impressive legacy behind her. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MORGAN, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: She is someone who has, I think, made this team so much better than when she entered into it.
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN WORLD SPORT (voice-over): A legendary career on the world's biggest stage has come to a bittersweet end for Megan Rapinoe. After 202 appearances, 63 goals, two Women's World Cup titles, and an Olympic gold medal, the 38-year-old has played her last game for the U.S. women's national team.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've watched her since I was seven years old and see what she's done for the sport. I have the most respect for her and she's going -- she's going to leave a legacy and we're going to continue to grow as feminine soccer players and I think it's great.
 
MANNO (voice-over): Rapinoe has become a household name for her accomplishments on the field, but her legacy is so much more. As a gay athlete who was never afraid to speak her mind and her truth, she transcended her sport.
 
MEGAN RAPINOE, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: I feel like I used my career to do the thing that I'm, you know, the most passionate about and I feel like it's more of a purpose in life than, you know, doing things out on the left wing. I hope nobody thinks what I did on the field is more important than what I did off it. I don't think it even really comes close.
 
MANNO (voice-over): Rapinoe came out publicly in 2012, and she has always been a voice to the voiceless and an inspiration to the LGBTQ community.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm married to my wife, Renata, and now Megan Rapinoe is one of our, definitely one of our heroes.
 
MANNO (voice-over): In 2016, Rapinoe garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem in solidarity with NFL player Colin Kaepernick.
 
For years, she was instrumental in the lawsuits brought by the U.S. women who lobbied the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay and conditions. In 2022, their sacrifice and determination finally paid off in an equal rate of pay in all friendlies and tournaments, including the World Cup.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Megan Rapinoe challenges and inspires millions of people who believe in themselves and the possibilities of our nation.
 
MANNO (voice-over): She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, becoming the first soccer player ever to receive the medal.
 
A heartbreaking loss to Sweden on penalties in the round of 16 won't be how she imagined her international career ending. But if there's anything to know about Megan Rapinoe, this is not the end.
 
RAPINOE: Still just feel really grateful and joyful and you know I know it's the end and that's sad. But I've loved playing for this team and playing for this country and yeah, it's been an honor.

NOBILO: An Olympic swimming test event that was due to take place in Paris has been cancelled due to poor water quality following heavy rains. The decision was made by World Aquatics in consultation with French public health officials. Paris still plans to make it river Seine the centerpiece of next year's Summer Olympics, the swimming events. Officials say they'll be monitoring the water quality carefully over the coming days. 
 
And some stories for you that are in the spotlight this hour. 
 
Animal experts in Alaska are caring for a rare walrus calf found wandering alone on Alaska's north slope four miles inland. It's unusual, because this species is often found in the ocean or along the coastline and with their mothers. The wayward calf is believed to be just a month hold and has medical issues. 
 <br>[04:55:00] He's now under 24-hour cuddle care at the Alaska Sea Life Center to mimic the maternal closeness that these calves are used to. The center says that he's eating well, remains alert and is on the road to recovery -- which is very good news. 
 
It's Elon musk versus Mark Zuckerberg. And this time, they might step into the ring for a physical showdown. Which Musk says will be streamed on X -- formally known as Twitter. In June, the two tech billionaires seen agreed on participating in a cage fight. Sorry if I'm laughing. The stakes for the potential fight were raised last month when Zuckerberg's Meta launched a new Twitter competitor called Threads. But Zuckerberg says that these still waiting for Musk to confirm the suggested date of August 26th for the fight. So that could be quite soon.
 
And finally, the Barbenheimer duo as hot as is extreme weather. "Barbie" alone has raked in more than $1 billion in global box office.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's the best day ever. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is the best day ever. So was yesterday. And so is tomorrow and every day from now until forever.

NOBILO: It's now one of about 50 movies not adjusted for inflation to earn that much. "Barbie" has the top performing film in U.K., Mexico and Australia since its release by Warner Bros. The studio, of course, I should note, is owned by the same parent company as CNN.
 
Meantime, Christopher Nolan's World War II thriller "Oppenheimer" has become the highest grossing period film of its kinds. Released on the same day as "Barbie," "Oppenheimer" has made more than $500 million at the global box office. It's the highest grossing R-rated movie of the year and one of only four biopics to cross the $500 million mark. 
 
And that does it for this morning on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London. "EARLY START" with Rahel Solomon is up for you next. I'll see you tomorrow.
