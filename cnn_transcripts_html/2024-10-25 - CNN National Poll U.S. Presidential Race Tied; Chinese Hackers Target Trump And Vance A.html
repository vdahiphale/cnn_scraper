JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, formerly known as Twitter, and on the TikTok, @jaketapper. You can follow the show on X, 
 
 @TheLeadCNN. If you ever miss an episode of The Lead, you can listen to The Lead whence you get your podcasts. All two hours, just sitting right there, 
 
 waiting for you to enjoy. The news continues on CNN with Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room. I will see you Sunday morning.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: It is 6:00 on Saturday in Beijing, 3:00 in Los Angeles, and it's Friday 6:00 p.m. here in New York. 
 
 I'm Richard Quest. Julia's off. And wherever you and I are in this world, it's your "First Move."
 
And you're most welcome wherever in the world you are. Here's today's need to know. Deadlocked. CNN's final national poll before the U.S. election 
 
 finds a tie between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Sources tell CNN that Chinese hackers have targeted the phones of Donald Trump and J. D. Vance. 
 
 And Russian troops are heard condemning North Korean soldiers in intercepted audio. Also, we're going to tell you about the World Series 
 
 showdown. The superstars Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge battle, the New York Yankees take on the Los Angeles Dodgers. There's that and a great deal 
 
 more.
 
Only after I've told you about the presidential race, which remains deadlocked. 11 days of campaigning remain, and both candidates' neck and 
 
 neck. 47 to 47. There's the numbers. Look at it. Couldn't be clearer. And there goes a New York Times poll which also reveals a tie.
 
So, tonight, Kamala Harris is to address reproductive rights at a rally featuring Beyonce. That takes place in Texas. Donald Trump in Texas talking 
 
 immigration and later he'll be at a rally in Michigan.
 
We get to Harry Enten to go through these numbers. What do you find surprising about them?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Nothing. I wish we were talking about the Dodgers and Yankees. I hate the Yankees. And so, I would bash 
 
 them with you, Richard.
 
Look, there's nothing really surprising about this because it's the same gosh darn campaign that we've been seeing for two months right now, right, 
 
 or three months since Harris got in the race back in July. There hasn't been any movement at all. I mean, maybe, you know, Harris, when she came 
 
 in, the numbers moved a little bit towards her, but we've basically been in a dead heat now for, you know, a month and a half, two months since the 
 
 Democratic National Convention back in Chicago.
 
And you look at this data and you just wonder to yourself, what the heck is actually going to move those few undecided voters? And when we figure that 
 
 out, we'll know who the next President of the United States is going to be, Richard.
 
QUEST: Right, but the -- we don't know what is going to move them, and if we looked earlier, as you and I did at the various issues that are related. 
 
 So, economy and immigration, Donald Trump gets both of those, and he gets them strongly. You've got abortion and democracy for Kamala Harris, but it 
 
 seems as if -- well, they're not quite as hardened topics.
 
ENTEN: No, they're not. I mean, look, the number one issue of this campaign has been, since the beginning, the economy. Then you kind of place, you 
 
 know, two and three, it can be immigration, sometimes it's abortion. But the bottom line is, if you look at the top three issues, two of them line 
 
 up with Donald Trump, one of which lines up with Kamala Harris. And the question ultimately is, when you look at that, you wonder to yourself, how 
 
 does Kamala Harris actually win this election?
 
But here's the thing that I go through in my mind, Richard. When we headed into the 2022 midterms and you looked at the president's low approval 
 
 rating in our CNN poll, I think it's 36 percent. You look at the percentage of Americans who say the country is heading in the right direction, it's 
 
 south of 30 percent. You look at the percentage of Americans who say the economy is way off in the wrong direction, it's the same back as it was in 
 
 2022. And yet, Democrats put in a historically strong midterm election.
 
The real question, as yet unknown, is, can Donald Trump take advantage of these fundamentals? And the thing that is holding him back, holding him 
 
 back is the fact that he still has a majority of folks who have an unfavorable view of him and it has not been proven to me just yet that 
 
 Donald Trump will, in fact, be able to take care of this election, go with those fundamentals and actually take advantage of them.
 
QUEST: All right. Now, let's take you into areas where you don't have any numbers.
 
ENTEN: OK.
 
QUEST: Now, let's see how good you are then. The shy voter, the voter that doesn't want to admit how they're going to really vote. Who favors which 
 
 one then?
 
ENTEN: So, if you look at the last two elections, right, 2016 and 2020, the polls underestimated Donald Trump, right? He was able to win in 2016 when a 
 
 lot of folks thought he wouldn't, and 2020 came a lot closer than the polls suggested.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
Now, here's the question. One, do we just have a continuation of that, in which case Donald Trump's going to walk away with this election? Or two, is 
 
 this going to look more like 2022, where the polls underestimated Democrats and all those key battleground states, the seven we've been talking about 
 
 forever?
 
I actually went back through the history books, Richard, and I looked at every single presidential election since 1972. Has it ever been the case 
 
 that the same party was underestimated in the polling three times in a row? It's never happened. So, despite the fact that Donald Trump's been 
 
 underestimated twice, it may, in fact, be the case that pollsters are now going to account for that. They've done a lot of things, they've changed a 
 
 lot of things since 2020, and if, in fact, they are over accounting for it, trying to get in those Trump voters, maybe they have a few extra ones than 
 
 they should, and maybe the polls are, in fact, underestimating Kamala Harris.
 
QUEST: Which we will find out on the night itself. Are you excited by this?
 
ENTEN: I am -- 
 
QUEST: I can't decide. No, I'll tell you why, Harry.
 
ENTEN: Go ahead.
 
QUEST: I can't decide whether you're excited at this uncertainty or you're frustrated at the fact nothing's moved.
 
ENTEN: I am frustrated because, you know, I go on TV every day and I'm trying to find something new to discuss, and it's difficult when you have a 
 
 storyline that's just consistently the same, but it's also a challenge. It makes you actually dig deep down into your brain to find the new story.
 
But here's the deal. The deal is, I remember on election night 2000, I had old bunny ears. And so, I was watching ABC News, Peter Jennings, and my 
 
 mother told me to turn the TV off at about 12:30 because they wouldn't decide it until the next morning. As it turns out, I missed the call for 
 
 Bush, then the call taking away from Bush, and then it was 37 days of excellent drama in terms of elections.
 
Now, I don't think we're heading towards that, but I was born and bred on the 2000 election. So, any election night in which it's way too close to 
 
 call going into it, I welcome with open arms, my dear friend.
 
QUEST: I covered that election.
 
ENTEN: Oh, I wasn't even yet a Bar Mitzvahed Boy yet.
 
QUEST: Good Shabbos. Thank you, sir.
 
ENTEN: Good Shabbos.
 
QUEST: Hackers linked to the Chinese government have targeted the phones of high-level U.S. officials, including former President Trump as well as 
 
 senior members of the Biden administration. According to two sources, Trump's running mate, J. D. Vance, also among those targeted.
 
So, it's not clear, A, if they were successful or what was it all about. It's part of a much broader campaign from China in recent months. The 
 
 Chinese government has denied the allegation. Sean Lyngaas joins me now from Washington.
 
What is all this about? I mean, other than the wish to cause mischief and mayhem, but they seem to be targeting both sides in some measure. So, 
 
 what's it all about?
 
SEAN LYNGAAS, CNN CYBERSECURITY REPORTER: I'd say more mischief than mayhem, Richard. I mean, this is a classic cyber espionage where you're 
 
 going after major telecommunications companies that are the backbone of phone systems here in the U.S. We're talking about Verizon and AT&amp;T and 
 
 others.
 
And once you have access deep within those systems, you can kind of pick and choose what your targets want you to be. And if you're a Chinese 
 
 intelligence service, that would be the former president and his running mate, as well as the Harris campaign, as we reported.
 
So, this is just the latest sign that this activity has gotten really serious. They've -- this has been going on for several months, and U.S. 
 
 officials have been investigating, and they still actually haven't gotten to the bottom of how serious it could be. But with the news that the former 
 
 president and current candidate for the highest office has been targeted that has set off alarm bells here in Washington about some of the national 
 
 security risks of this activity, Richard.
 
I know we're talking phone records and who's talking to who, and where they might be on a given day. You can track someone location-wise with their 
 
 phone. So, this is very serious. And we reporters are on the beat, are bracing for several more weeks of this because this investigation is very 
 
 much ongoing, Richard.
 
QUEST: I'm grateful to you, sir. Thank you. The National Security advisers of the U.S., Japan, and South Korea have been in Washington talking to 
 
 discuss the recent deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia. The officials expressed grave concerns about the developments. U.S. 
 
 National Security Spokesperson John Kirby, Admiral John Kirby, says the move shows how desperate Russia has become as the war in Ukraine drags on.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: If Russia is indeed forced to turn to North Korea for manpower, this would be a sign 
 
 of weakness, not strength on the part of the Kremlin. It would also demonstrate an unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between 
 
 Russia and North Korea, with security implications in Europe as well as the Indo-Pacific.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST: The U.S. says 3,000 or so North Korean soldiers are now in Russia, and the fear is they'll soon join the fight against Ukraine. Whether or not 
 
 they are an effective fighting force, that is up for debate. 
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
Russian soldiers can be heard complaining about their new allies in communications that have been intercepted in Russia. The Russians are 
 
 calling the North Korean troops -- well, have a listen. It's less than pleasant.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): He's standing there talking to this mother -- about the K Battalion. I asked, who gets the weapons, the ammo 
 
 for them? We did get -- rations. And from what I hear, the -- brigade get it. And he's like, why the -- brigade? You receive everything.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST: Well, the world is demanding answers from North Korea and Russia about what's going on near the frontline. The two countries are by and 
 
 large dodging the issue. CNN's Marc Stewart reports.
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Richard. We are now getting some response from North Korea through state media. An official is not 
 
 necessarily explicitly confirming the presence of North Korean troops in Russia, not necessarily a denial either. But this official made the point 
 
 that if this were to be the case, if these North Korean troops are in Russia, that it would be following international law, international norms. 
 
 So, that's the response we're getting thus far from North Korea.
 
We are also hearing from Vladimir Putin. His response to these claims is that he is in contact with North Korea. The rest of his response, though, 
 
 very murky. He did make some remarks on Thursday following the conclusion of a global summit. Let's listen to Vladimir Putin.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As for our relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as you know, our 
 
 Strategic Partnership Treaty was ratified only today. There is Article 4. And Russia never doubted that the DPRK is serious about Russian 
 
 cooperation. But what we will do, and how we will do it, is our business.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART: Let me give you some additional context. This news involving North Korea comes at the conclusion of a conference in Russia with 
 
 representatives from Iran, from China, where they talked about this need for an alternative world view, a new world order of sports to counter some 
 
 of the alliances that the United States has formed with its allies. That makes this news, this relationship, this potential relationship between 
 
 North Korea and Russia that more significant, that much more newsworthy.
 
And it's these individual relationships with these individual nations, Richard, that is certainly catching the attention and the concern of the 
 
 United States as well as NATO on a more global level.
 
QUEST: Marc Stewart. In the past few hours, U.S. Central Command has reported that American F-16 fighter jets have arrived in the Middle East 
 
 that came from Germany. Part of the effort by the U.S. to strengthen its firepower in the region ahead of a possible strike by Israel on Iran. The 
 
 attack would be a retaliation for Tehran's biggest ever missile assault earlier this month.
 
As the Middle East tensions remain, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza gets worse. Emergency response officials now say at least 26 Palestinians, 
 
 including children, have been killed overnight in strides on Khan Younis, which is in Southern Gaza.
 
In the north, there's horrifying new footage that gives us a glimpse of the scale of the devastation. And I'll warn you now that Matthew Chance's 
 
 report begins with those graphic images.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just a glimpse of the bloodshed this week in Northern Gaza, as a horrified 
 
 Palestinian nurse struggles to help in the aftermath of an Israeli strike.
 
Auntie, auntie, I don't have anything to stop the bleeding, she screams, as one woman sits delirious on the ground.
 
She runs to fetch her bag and makes her way back up the bloodstained steps where dead and injured are strewn. But all she has are a few bandages and 
 
 basic medical supplies amid the carnage.
 
Back down the steps, she turns a corner and calls out as she sees someone she recognizes. Abu Mohammed (ph), she screams. But the old man is dead.
 
From above, an Israeli drone looks down on the Jabalya Refugee Camp, now the focus of what Israel's military says is an operation to stamp out 
 
 resurgent Hamas activity. These images show thousands of Palestinian residents already displaced multiple times on the move again, trudging past 
 
 Israeli tanks in search of safety.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
But where they are heading, the humanitarian crisis is also dire. These chaotic scenes at a bakery in Central Gaza, where amid acute food 
 
 shortages, hundreds are jostling for bread, grasping desperately for survival.
 
For three days, I've been searching for bread to take home, says this man. I am literally begging, he says.
 
All I want is bread for my children, says this woman. Every night, they go to bed hungry.
 
The U.N. says without more aid urgently, starvation here will get worse, saying Israel is preventing humanitarian missions from accessing Gaza. 
 
 Israel blames Hamas for disrupting the distribution of essential supplies.
 
Meanwhile, in Southern Gaza, Palestinians pick through the rubble of a residential building leveled in a recent Israeli strike. Here, and further 
 
 south, where the Hamas leader was killed last week, Israel says combat operations are continuing. But the heavy civilian toll continues to climb.
 
Matthew Chance, CNN, Jerusalem.

QUEST: Now, we have a lot more to talk about in the moments ahead. I'm going to go to the business agenda. When we come back the -- it's NVIDIA. 
 
 And for a brief scintilla of a second, also, it was the world's most valuable publicly traded company, then Apple came back again. But it's 
 
 NVIDIA and where it's going in a moment.
 
Also, Shohei Ohtani's World series debut. The L.A. Dodgers superstar is readying there as the fall classic gets underway two hours from now.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
QUEST: You're most welcome. All-time highs for the tech tops, which is today's Money Move. The NASDAQ is up more than half a percent. It's its 
 
 first record close since July. The other markets, you can see, pretty flat for the S&amp;P. The Dow was off.
 
McDonald's dragged it down. The shares are down 3 percent, it's still feeling the effects of the E. coli scandal. The U.S. officials now say 75 
 
 people have fallen ill.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
To Asia, and the week ended in the green. Investors are -- remain now (ph) as they're ahead of the Japan general elections taking place this week.
 
NVIDIA, the shares rose to new records on an intraday basis. And during that intraday, it briefly became the world's most valuable company, 
 
 displacing Apple. It's around 200 percent up so far this year. And 22,600 percent over the past five. Wall Street analysts has noted that NVIDIA's 
 
 market cap has surpassed the combined value of the stock markets of Germany and Italy. And there are those who still say it's overhyped and overpriced. 
 
 Paul La Monica is with me. Guru La Monica, senior markets analyst at Barron's.
 
So, Guru, look, the reality is, even if it is overpriced, even if it is hyped, even if it is too much, it's not going anywhere in the sense that 
 
 it's going to be part of the A.I. architecture of the future, and we've only just started.
 
PAUL R. LA MONICA, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYSIS WRITER, BARRON'S: Yes, that is a great point, Richard. I think that there is no doubt that NVIDIA is the 
 
 dominant player in supplying chips to all of these, quote/unquote, "A.I. hyperscalers." And we're going to find out just how much they're still 
 
 continuing to spend next week when the likes of Amazon and Meta And Alphabet, Google owner, you know, and Microsoft all report their latest 
 
 quarterly earnings. Those four companies are definitely big contributors to NVIDIA's largest.
 
Now, Jensen Huang could probably afford a lot more leather jackets because of all the money that they're spending on his A.I. Chips. And don't get me 
 
 wrong, I don't necessarily disagree with you, I'm just pointing out that the, you know, participants in the Barron's big money poll that we just put 
 
 up, they said that NVIDIA, along with Tesla, is the most overvalued stock right now.
 
QUEST: Right. But here's the point with NVIDIA, and I sort of -- I take that on board, but let's assume -- not the worst-case scenario, but let's 
 
 assume a souring of the environment. They're still going to be there. It'll still be good, it just won't be very good. I mean, even if the competition 
 
 starts to eat at their money, you may not be able to justify the share price, but it's not going to disappear.
 
LA MONICA: Oh, no, of course not. And look at Cisco. Cisco is not a company that disappeared by any stretch of the imagination, but Cisco, in the late 
 
 '90s, early 2000, was drastically overvalued when we had a similar situation where everyone was like, well, look at how many people are 
 
 spending on all those routers and switches because they need to connect to the internet. Yes, Cisco is a great company. It was back then. It is still 
 
 now, but you have to pay attention to valuations.
 
And also, as you pointed out, if AMD and Intel, which is admittedly really struggling, and other chip companies step up their game and give the large 
 
 hyperscalers more of a choice in the type of chips that they would buy, that could eat into NVIDIA's growth and profit margins. And again, that 
 
 doesn't mean NVIDIA is now a company that we're talking about becoming obsolescent by any stretch of the imagination, but at 50 times earnings, 
 
 it's going to be tougher and tougher every year to justify the valuation. But, you know, right now, the growth is clearly there.
 
QUEST: So, yes, you can't see what I'm doing here. But what you hope, of course, if you're a shelled and let's say things start to sell, you hope 
 
 that the price doesn't come down. Although, the -- but the -- if you will, it stays static while the market rises so that the EPA or the EPS isn't as 
 
 inflated in a sense on a PE basis. In other words, things catch up rather than NVIDIA falls back.
 
LA MONICA: Yes, exactly. And the good news for NVIDIA is that NVIDIA is not nearly as, you know, highly valued as tech stocks in the late '90s and 
 
 early 2000. It has to the most -- for the most part kept up with the rising earnings estimates.
 
So, you can argue justifiably that NVIDIA's stock appreciation has not really been because of hype, but because of real revenue and profit growth. 
 
 That is definitely great news for a video. And again, I'm not trying to stress any stretch of the imagination that NVIDIA is in trouble. This is 
 
 just a company that investors need to be careful and more cautious the higher the stock price stock goes.
 
QUEST: You and I need to talk about this more often because it begs the question, if you're long on NVIDIA and you've got good gains, what do you 
 
 do? But we'll have to save that for another day. Ponder that, Guru, and you and I will reflect on that. Have a lovely weekend, you and the family. Have 
 
 a lovely weekend.
 
LA MONICA: Thank you, sir. You too.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
QUEST: Now, the four meetings of the IMF -- the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank continue in Washington. The backlash against illegal 
 
 immigration is the big focus. Julia who's been at the meetings sat down with the president of the World Bank to talk about that and world trade and 
 
 climate finance.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AJAY BANGA, WORLD BANK PRESIDENT: I have a very simple logic here, Julia. 1.2 billion people, if you have one-third of them getting jobs, two-third 
 
 not, that's, first of all, a huge opportunity lost with the opportunity with these young people to contribute to our economies, to contribute to 
 
 American firms, European firms, our intellectual property, all that. That's how economic growth benefits all of us.
 
The second part of it is the negative side of it, which is if these young people don't get the dignity of a job or a job, what will they do? They 
 
 will migrate. They will become socially unstable, things that will eventually impact our national security as well, wherever you live. So, my 
 
 view of this is, this is a near and present issue.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: You've said at the World Bank you're going to increase climate financing to 45 percent of your lending by 
 
 the middle of 2025. You're clearly on board with what needs to happen as far as climate financing is concerned. Do you worry when you hear a 
 
 potential future U.S. president calling it still a climate hoax, talking about taking money away from the Inflation Reduction Act that hasn't been 
 
 spent?
 
BANGA: You know, first of all, we're at 44 as we speak. I joined when the bank was already at about 35 odd percent. I made the commitment to go to 45 
 
 by next year. We're actually at 44 this year. So, we're doing our bit. What I want to make clear is this is not taking away from anything.
 
See, this is, what are we doing with climate financing? What we're really doing at the bank? Is making the bank work simpler, faster and better, 
 
 involving the private sector, trying to do the right things with all of these in the way that benefits all of us together. So, we've become -- we 
 
 manage national security, but also we balance the opportunity for companies.
 
Honestly, I think that's something that every administration cares about. The politics are the politics. I can't solve for that, but I can certainly 
 
 solve for making the case for what we are doing that's relevant no matter who be the president.
 
CHATTERLEY: You're saying it's a good investment, don't miss the fact that this money will go to good use and it will be beneficial for all. What 
 
 about trade wars? How focused are you on a game, the risk of that?
 
BANGA: Yes, I think trade is already changing. It's changing so much in the last five, seven years. It's not that trade volumes have come down, the mix 
 
 of goods and services are changing. Data is going up. Of course. But actually, what's really changing is -- and look at the floors, a lot more 
 
 bilateral, a lot more regional, a lot more what we call French shoring kind of trade.
 
CHATTERLEY: Can we talk about Gaza? More serious subjects.
 
BANGA: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: I know the World Bank recently voted to increase by six-fold the amount of money that they're providing to Gaza. I think it's $300 
 
 million dollars. Do you know how that's going to be used and how quickly that money can be used?
 
BANGA: We used to provide $50 million from the board. This year the board voted to make it $300 from our surplus of the year. And the idea is to put 
 
 it to work for the Palestinian authorities, wages and salaries and capabilities, but also for humanitarian aid through people like World 
 
 Central Kitchen and others. And, you know, U.N. organizations that time.
 
To me, this is still only the beginning. Beyond the obvious human suffering on both sides of this conflict, which is clear to everybody, beyond the 
 
 obvious deaths, the kidnappings, the murder, the rape, the -- all that's going on both sides, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about 
 
 what happens next.
 
CHATTERLEY: What are you most optimistic about today?
 
BANGA: Young people.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK.
 
BANGA: I started with that, but they're also the source of my optimism. Think of the power of young people and women to transform where we could 
 
 go.

QUEST: That's the president of the World Bank talking to Julia in Washington. Be back in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
QUEST: Baseball's fall classic is almost amongst us. The World Series begins in Los Angeles. It's two hours from now, or give or take. It's the 
 
 Yankees facing off against the Dodgers in the championship. This is a classic. First time in more than 40 years. New York and L.A. are, of 
 
 course, two massive markets. And the tickets are selling for record prices. Fueled in no small part by the superstar, Shohei Ohtani.
 
His fans in Japan as devoted as those in Los Angeles, and many are making the pilgrimage to Dodger Stadium to see him play in person. Natasha is with 
 
 me from Los Angeles.
 
NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Richard, hi. We're on the field and we are looking at all the fans that have now come into Dodger 
 
 Stadium, so excited to be in person. Because keep in mind the last time the Dodgers won the World Series was 2020 during the pandemic. Most of these 
 
 fans were not able to attend those games played in Texas. This time they get to feel and experience this moment and the energy level is through the 
 
 roof.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHEN (voice-over): East versus West; Shohei Ohtani versus Aaron Judge. It's the dream matchup 43 years in the making.
 
MIGUEL JIMENEZ, KADI PROMOTIONS: Because it's Yankees versus Dodgers. You know, nobody wants to miss this game.
 
CHEN (VOICE-OVER): Miguel Jimenez is a ticket reseller in Los Angeles -- with high rolling clients hoping to score seats.
 
JIMENEZ: What kind of seats are you looking for?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In this case, I'm just looking for the best deal. Whatever the best deal is.
 
JIMENEZ: Ok. You know, the cheapest ticket is $1,100.
 
CHEN (VOICE-OVER): Seats closer to the action or going for thousands, the most expensive tickets to a World Series ever. Jimenez says that's partly 
 
 because prices in general have jumped since the pandemic but also because of who's playing.
 
CHEN: The interest in this epic World Series matchup between an East and West Coast team from the two largest metro areas in the U.S. really extends 
 
 beyond our borders to countries where fans may have historically rooted for the Yankees.
 
JIMENEZ: We have to let you know, in Mexico, 80 percent of the population go for Yankees. A lot of people -- the north side on Mexico, they go for 
 
 Dodgers.
 
CHEN (VOICE-OVER): Gary Lee, founder of the Dodgers Nation fan site says similarly in Japan after World War II, there had been a tradition of 
 
 rooting for the Yankees, but now, Shohei Ohtani is their nation's superstar.
 
GARY LEE, FOUNDER, DODGERS NATION: Shohei turning into a Dodger right now and then having to face the Yankees, there's going to be some discussions 
 
 between grandpa and his grandkids at the dinner table.
 
CHEN (VOICE-OVER): Fans from Japan poured into L.A. during the regular season to see Ohtani play, staying in L.A.'s Little Tokyo, where businesses 
 
 have seen way more customers this season.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We thought we ordered enough, but then people got -- you know, the word got out and all of a sudden, they're here all the time. 
 
 When he hit the like 50-50, when he broke the record, tons of people just swarmed downtown just to like celebrate.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
CHEN (VOICE-OVER): Very different dynamic than the last Dodgers World Series appearance in 2020 when the pandemic prevented most fans from 
 
 attending any of the games played in Texas rather than at the team's home stadiums.
 
LEE: That feeling, we didn't get a parade, nothing, you know, it was more of like a yay, we won, you know, stay home. You know, you keep your mask 
 
 on.
 
CHEN (VOICE-OVER): This time the series starts in Los Angeles and people are seizing the moment. Even if many can't afford a seat.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a classic clown face, you know, a little bit of pinstripe. Bring card (ph) culture into it.
 
CHEN (VOICE-OVER): They're buying merchandise and treats with cultural touches the way only a melting pot of a city can do.
 
DEANNA DUCTOC, OWNER, LOS ANGELITOS BAKER: It's even more meaningful because we're bringing our culture and what we love and part of our city 
 
 together.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHEN (on camera): And that celebration with diverse foods extends here to the stadium, where people right now are able to buy some very special, 
 
 unique to the World Series menu items like chicken karaage. There's a chili oil with pork dumplings and some fries with Japanese seasoning on it. So, a 
 
 lot of Latin and Asian fusion tastes.
 
And we did get to taste something as well. If you want the classic stuff, they also have the Dodger Dog and a fried sandwich, Richard, with peanut 
 
 butter, banana, strawberry, and Nutella. Certainly not recommended for breakfast right in the morning. But, as you know, there are zero calories 
 
 with any of the food here at the stadium, right?
 
QUEST: How many of your friends and family are envious that you're there?
 
CHEN: I -- you know, my husband is a much bigger baseball fan than I am. So, I feel bad, Richard, that I'm the one here, but I'm going to enjoy it 
 
 for him. You can't help but be swept up in this, even if you're not a true baseball nerd. This is just a very special World Series, and it's been 
 
 amazing to track the progress, especially of people like Shohei Ohtani.
 
QUEST: I'm glad you're there. Thank you very much. We'll worry about your relationship with your husband later. Thank you very much. Once you have to 
 
 -- once you show him the pictures. Thank you very much.
 
Now, lest we forget, baseball is a team sport. And you'd be forgiven for thinking Ohtani is the only one on the field. But it isn't. Because there's 
 
 a whole load of other very famous, excellent, world class. The Yankees captain Aaron Judge holds an American League record for the most home runs 
 
 in a single season. And there's even a love triangle of Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who will be playing for the Dodgers after being courted by the Yankees last 
 
 year.
 
The series is a best of seven. I never quite understand how it works, but I'm told -- no, I do, I understand. Best of seven. So, fans have plenty of 
 
 time to watch the best in baseball compete. Andy's with me. Andy in Atlanta. I guess, you know, you want it to go all the way, don't you? You 
 
 want it to sort of have an equality baba, booboo, so it goes the full series.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Oh, certainly, Richard. And do you remember who was in the World Series last year?
 
QUEST: Oh, come on, please. I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
 
SCHOLES: No. Well, you're not alone, Richard. It was the least watched World Series of all time. It was between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona 
 
 Diamondbacks.
 
QUEST: Oh, of course. Of course.
 
SCHOLES: But I guarantee you, this World Series will not be the least watched of all time. There's just so much star power for the Dodgers. You 
 
 got, of course, Shohei Ohtani, but you also got Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, then the Yankees with Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, Giancarlo Stanton. I 
 
 mean, this -- the star power in this World Series really is unmatched.
 
Now, the Dodgers, they are slight favorites. They had a better record in the regular season than the Yankees. They do have home field advantage. 
 
 Game 1, 2 in L.A. Three, four, and five will be in New York, then six and seven back in L.A.
 
You know, this is the first World Series for Shohei Ohtani. He got there in his first season with the Dodgers. This is also the first World Series for 
 
 Yankees captain Aaron Judge. He -- the Yankees breaking the drought of 15 years without reaching the World Series and Judge, for one, very excited 
 
 that they're back.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AARON JUDGE, LED MAJORS WITH 58 HOME RUNS: This is where the real fun starts, you know, drink, you know, for years as a kid watching the Yankees, 
 
 you know, playing the World Series, one World Series, you know, just that excitement, the emotion, how the city comes alive is something, you know, 
 
 definitely special and you're looking forward to doing that with this group.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When I was a kid, you watch all these games and it's -- you know, it's something you want to be a part of and experience and then, 
 
 yes, you throw in the Yankees, Dodgers, you know, kind of East Coast, West Coast, the Evil Empires, whatever you want to call it. And yes, I mean, 
 
 there's just -- there's so many good players in this series and. You know, it's on the biggest stage. So, I think everyone's looking forward to it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: Now, no two teams play each other closer than the Yankees and the Dodgers. Get this. In their last four games, the two teams are 2 and 2 
 
 against each other. Last 10, 5 and 5. Last 20 games, they're 10 and 10. Last 30, 15 and 15. Last 60, they're 30 and 30. And in the last 20 years, 
 
 Richard, the team that wins one night, they normally lose the next night.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
If by chance that team were to win two games in a row, they've always lost two games in a row. So, what can we take from that? Well, whoever wins game 
 
 one, Richard, the history tells us between these two teams, the rest of the way, they're likely going to go three and three. So, the team who wins game 
 
 one, probably going to win in seven games.
 
QUEST: I -- the thing I love about this, the similarities between baseball and cricket, where it's all about statistics. It is absolutely -- I mean, 
 
 the, you know, the books and the statistics and the this and the that, it's fascinating. And now, when -- so, you think it's going to be -- you think 
 
 whoever it's going to be wins one is going to win seven?
 
SCHOLES: I think whoever wins game one is going to win it all in seven games and I'm picking the Dodgers in seven.
 
QUEST: You've nailed your colors to the master. Thank you.
 
Coming up after the break, a relocation service that's out of this world. The former SpaceX engineer now the helm of a startup offers a lift and 
 
 shift service for satellites, in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
QUEST: Space is increasingly crowded. It's all up there. Junk, payloads, it's all flying around. The Impulse Space is a leader in fields in so-
 
 called space tugs. Now, these are things about the size of a washing machine that help reposition satellites from one orbit to another. It's two 
 
 vehicles, the Helios and the Mira. And the size of a dishwasher, a washing machine. Mira has already completed one mission last year. The company's 
 
 also working with the U.S. Space Force.
 
The chief executive Tom Mueller joins me now from their facility in California. This is fat. We love this story. We absolutely love it. So, 
 
 basically, you send these things up -- correct me if I'm wrong. You send them up and they grab hold of another satellite, and they push them around 
 
 higher and lower orbits. Is that the way it is?
 
TOM MUELLER, CEO, IMPULSE SPACE: That's one of the many things we can do. We go up on existing launch vehicles, like SpaceX, and then we pick -- from 
 
 where they drop us off, we go and do things up there beyond launch, up in orbit. So, we can move things around in orbit. We can take things from a 
 
 lower orbit to a much higher orbit, like going from, you know, low Earth orbit to like geosynchronous orbit, which is, you know, like almost 100 
 
 times as high as where the space station is or where the shuttle used to fly.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
And we also can do, what you're talking about rendezvous, where you would - - where you connect with other satellites to service them or move them or deorbit space junk, any and all of the above.
 
QUEST: But why? I mean, what's the -- well -- why would you want to move a satellite? I mean, surely once it's there you -- it's very expensive to 
 
 start moving it around. It was sent up there with a purpose. You knew where it was going to be. Why would you suddenly want to start moving it?
 
MUELLER: Well, you hit it on the head. It's very expensive. Some of these legacy satellites are extremely expensive when they run out of fuel. Now, 
 
 you can connect with them and use your fuel to move them around, it's to keep them alive, or if they're out of fuel and they're dead or they failed, 
 
 now you can take them out of that orbital slot and basically, they become debris and you could deorbit them or move them out of that orbital slot and 
 
 get them out of the way.
 
QUEST: Give me a rough idea, just ballpark, just so I know whether we're talking $5 million, $10 million, $50 million. How much it costs to move a 
 
 satellite?
 
MUELLER: To move a satellite? It depends on how big it is. We want to get - - we want to actually -- it depends on if you do -- if it's a single mission where you have to develop the spacecraft to go do one thing or if 
 
 you build a system to deorbit, like a bunch of space junk where you can use all your development costs to remove a lot of objects, then you can get the 
 
 cost way down.
 
And reusability comes into play when you're doing a big job like that too. We would love to get to reusability at some point.
 
QUEST: Isn't the reality of this that you're at the -- it's nascent, you're at the beginning of this, what is going to be a growing industry, simply 
 
 because space is going to become more important, there's going to be more satellites, we're going to need to move them around, repair them, pull them 
 
 back, get rid of them, whatever it is.
 
MUELLER: Yes.
 
QUEST: So, you're right at the beginning of a whole new industry that, essentially, you're inventing.
 
MUELLER: I think really to key up what you're talking about, that -- the Starship, you know, the new, extremely large completely reusable vehicle 
 
 that SpaceX is developing, and then there's Blue Origin with a large vehicle, these large reusable vehicles, think of them as cargo ships, 
 
 they're gigantic, they can take hundreds -- in the case of Starship, a hundred tons to orbit, and now you need the -- you know, you need the 
 
 trucks and the trains and the sprinter vans to take that cargo to other orbits, and that's what we're here to do.
 
QUEST: Fascinating. Sir, thank you for joining us tonight. Very interesting. We'll talk more about this in the future when -- as things 
 
 progress. I'm grateful for your time. Thank you.
 
MUELLER: Thank you.
 
QUEST: Now, coming up after the break. From space to soup at supersonic speeds. And on Concorde, they were serving snacks at 60,000 feet. We're 
 
 looking back at my love of airline food with some of British Airways' most iconic dishes. Oh, those were the days. Soup from the terrine and beef off 
 
 the trolley.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
QUEST: I'm flying to London tomorrow, on my way to Riyadh in Saudi, and United Airlines has already invited me to choose my meal. I've got a 
 
 choice, baked egg with kale. Kale, no thank you, no, too chewy. The bread buttering -- the bread pudding is amazing, and I might go for that, even 
 
 with my pre-diabetes. Because food is now one of the fighting grounds for the airlines.
 
This menu for tomorrow is a little different from the one I have on my wall in my office from the last flight of Concorde. Then it was mixed grill, 
 
 eggs, or lobster omelets. But it's not just the food at the front of the plane that I love, I'm very partial to a curry served in economy. Al 
 
 Bridger shares my love of airline food. He's written a book of British Airways recipes from over the years, and foolish though I was, I attempted 
 
 to make them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AL BRIDGER, BRITISH AIRWAYS PILOT: Every time I go flying, I get excited, and I still love the food. I try and try as much of it as I can from the 
 
 different cabins and it's fabulous.
 
QUEST: Now, from my experience, I know that feeding people in the air has certain challenges of taste buds. Isn't that right?
 
BRIDGER: Yes, I mean, I've covered that in the book.
 
QUEST: Yes.
 
BRIDGER: So, it's amazing. Actually, if you look through the chapters of how we're continuously developing to make the product better and better and 
 
 better, and it was really around the 1970s that people started to think, yes, there's something different with the palate in the air.
 
And then, in the sort of 2000s we started to really understand the science. And from then on, the science has got better and understanding that the 
 
 palate is different in the air.
 
QUEST: I have a dirty little secret. I love airline food. It goes back to when I was a kid going on a holiday -- on a summer holiday. Go back to the 
 
 old days. Imperial Airways, Empire Airways. The grand days of Pan Am crossing the oceans and where it was beef off the trolley, soup out of the 
 
 terrine and never was as good again.
 
BRIDGER: Yes. And I don't agree with you, Richard. I think if you look through the book and all the decades and how we ever continually try to 
 
 improve and be the best we can, and you saw that in Imperial Airways with the old biplanes and stretching their legs and getting more and more food 
 
 on board. And then, through the jet age all the way to current British Airways, where we're investing $7 billion in making a fantastic product. 
 
 So, if you go on board an aircraft now, they're amazing. But in each era, it was incredible.
 
QUEST: You talk about Concorde, of course.
 
BRIDGER: Yes.
 
QUEST: The thing about the food on Concorde was it was luxurious. It was very much like this sort of thing. It was -- but it was simple because the 
 
 galley was so small.
 
BRIDGER: This was actually on the Concorde. It's -- 
 
QUEST: What is it?
 
BRIDGER: It's a caviar rafraichisseur. So, it's a refresh basically, as the name says. So, it's a little bit of Melba toast, which is that easy to 
 
 make. Little bit of shallot, which is not too strong, creme fresh, and then some caviar on top.
 
QUEST: That is excellent. Are your recipes easy to make?
 
BRIDGER: Very easy. I mean, the big thing for me is that I've wanted to recreate the history and show, -- take everyone on that journey and show 
 
 all the wonderful pictures, but also to get the proper taste of it.
 
So, I'm home cooked, nothing more than that. And I just created these recipes. So, they're simple. So, if you've never cooked before, you should 
 
 be able to pick the book up and recreate whatever meal you want all the way up to modern times.
 
QUEST: What are we going to make here?
 
BRIDGER: Well, we can have a go at a fruit Mille-Feuill, which actually -- 
 
QUEST: Mille-Feuill.
 
BRIDGER: Yes, which actually is probably the messiest recipe in the book. So, we start with a piece of puff pastry. Now, puff pastry, as you know, 
 
 you can be very clever and make puff pastry, or you can be even smarter and buy it. And this was pre-rolled. So, there we have a piece of that. Then we 
 
 need some jam.
 
QUEST: When was this on a -- when was this ever on a -- well -- 
 
BRIDGER: This was 1960s. So, there we are. So, we start off with some jam. We want some creme pat. This one over here.
 
QUEST: Yes.
 
BRIDGER: So, this, hopefully, has travelled OK. So -- 
 
QUEST: Oh, we've got to do dollops of it.
 
BRIDGER: I think so. So, we put a bit of that on. Not too much, otherwise it will get messy.
 
QUEST: Of course -- 
 
BRIDGER: It's that easy.
 
QUEST: Yes. There we go. Look. Oh, you're being parsimonious.
 
BRIDGER: I'm trying not to make a mess. I love it to look fabulous. Like it would have done on board.
 
QUEST: Louis -- I'll tell Lous. Right. Next?
 
BRIDGER: Strawberries. So, quick layer of strawberries. So, we'll pop those on. So, there's one, and then we do exactly the same again. So, off we go 
 
 again. Thank you. So, grab another piece. Same again.
 
QUEST: I think the other thing that's interesting is the way airlines have realized passengers do value it, including BA, in the way, of course, BA 
 
 has put food back in, in different class, in economy.
 
BRIDGER: Absolutely.
 
QUEST: Look, at the end of the day, it is hospitality.
 
BRIDGER: If you read through the book, from the very earliest days of the biplane, you know, that first day in 1919 with a biplane, Hounslow Heath 
 
 and food was on board. And ever since then, the airline has really tried harder and harder and harder to be as good as it can.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
So, I think they're all golden ages. And I think it's a golden age now with the understanding of food and the science behind it.
 
QUEST: Right. How do I eat this thing?
 
BRIDGER: Oh, well, I was going to say to you, this is the challenge is how you eat it. So, I'll make up my final layer while you try and eat it. Good 
 
 luck. It's a fabulous messy dessert. But there we go. So, I'll pop my last one on/
 
QUEST: I'm going to ask the last question.
 
BRIDGER: Sure.
 
QUEST: You're still fine?
 
BRIDGER: I am and I adore as much today as I am.
 
QUEST: Really?
 
BRIDGER: I am. I'm -- 
 
QUEST: Even schlepping across the Atlantic, that billions of times you've done it, you still enjoy it?
 
BRIDGER: It's a huge privilege, a bit like writing this book. What a privilege to write about that the food and drink of British Airways across 
 
 the entire history, the fabulous history of the airline. That's an attempt. So, yes, I love flying and I'm still flying today.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST: I don't know whether he's going to laugh or cry when he saw me attack that Mille-Feuill. Anyway, Mille-Feuill to you. And let's have a 
 
 great weekend ahead, whatever you're up to. Thanks for joining us. I'll see you next week. Julia will be back here.
