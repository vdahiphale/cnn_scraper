LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the, world I am Laila Harrak. 
 
Ahead, Ukraine strikes back; a major attack on the Black Sea fleet headquarters ends in a cloud of smoke and debris. We will talk to a Ukrainian lawmaker about the latest strikes and Zelenskyy's trip abroad. 
 
Dramatic scenes at the U.S. southern border as migrant crossings surge. We will hear from people on both sides of the crisis. 
 
And a U.S. lawmaker is in legal hot water again, how one of the Senate's top Democrats is facing corruption charges for a second time.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Laila Harrak. 
 
HARRAK: Ukraine says its strike on Russia's naval headquarters in Crimea has left dozens of people dead and injured. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK (voice-over): A Ukrainian missile struck at the heart of Russia's Black Sea fleet on Friday. With Moscow saying only one soldier is missing. But Ukraine's special operations forces now say the strike targeted a meeting of senior Navy leaders. Some of the leaders of Russia's Black Sea fleet are among the dead and injured. 
 
Ukraine did not provide any evidence for this claim. Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy received standing ovations at the Canadian parliament on Friday. He addressed the lawmakers during his visit, calling Russia's aggression a genocide and lining up a new batch of military aid. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: The strikes on Crimea maybe far behind the front lines but a general in charge of Ukraine's counteroffensive says they still make a big difference for his forces on the ground. He gave an exclusive interview to CNN's Fred Pleitgen.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL (voice-over): Smoke billowing from Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. Moscow blaming Ukrainian launched cruise missiles, Kyiv only confirming they hit the building. 
 
I sat down with the commanding general for Ukraine's counteroffensive in the south, Oleksandr Tarnovsky, and he tells me strikes like these are invaluable for his troops.
 
BRIG. GEN. OLEKSANDR TARNOVSKY, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator): A destroyed commander means a destroyed command link. And if there is no command, then there are no coordinated actions. Hitting infrastructure like factories, bases, warehouses containing weapons is also a factor for victory.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): In the past weeks alone, the Ukrainians say they've hit a Russian ship, a submarine, an airbase and a surface-to- air missile system in occupied Crimea. Still, Ukraine's president faces skepticism, both from many Republican lawmakers and the public about the U.S.'s continued support for Ukraine.
 
Tarnovsky asking for patience.
 
TARNOVSKY (through translator): We have one goal: liberation of our territories. However hard it is, we will keep on working. And I want to thank even the skeptics. Their criticism also influences our task success.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): It's been a slow grind for the Ukrainians on the southern front. Progress, so far, incremental. But the U.S. has cautioned time might be running out as fall progresses, making the earth here soggy and movement difficult.
 
PLEITGEN: How much do you think that you can achieve before the winter sets in?
 
How far do you think your forces can get realistically?
 
TARNOVSKY (through translator): The weather can be a serious obstacle during an advance. But considering how we move forward, mostly without using vehicles, I don't think the weather will heavily influence the counteroffensive.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): General Tarnovsky says he remains optimistic that Ukraine's counteroffensive will be a success, especially if Ukraine continues its campaign targeting Russian forces in the rear, like Crimea -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Salma Abdelaziz has been following developments in Ukraine and she joins us now from London. 
 
Salma, this is not the first time that Ukraine has hit Russian targets and occupied Crimea. But this seems like a dramatic escalation.
 <br>[03:05:00]
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Indeed and we just got a statement a few moments ago, from Ukraine's special operations forces, making further claims about the consequences of that strike. 
 
It says, the special operations forces, that dozens have been killed or wounded, Russian troops, of course, that were inside that headquarters. It also says that this operation was successful because of the timing of it, adding in the statement that there was a meeting taking place, a high-level meeting taking place. 
 
And that senior leadership could be among those killed or wounded. I have to emphasize we do not have anything more from the Russian side. The latest statement is the one that you mentioned, that one Russian soldier is missing, not dead, in this attack. 
 
So very dramatic images of that headquarters, smoke billowing from it. Very important to know, regardless of what the actual outcome is, this is a strike in the heart of Russian occupied Crimea, making Ukraine ever feel ever closer to sensing that vulnerability for Russian forces. 
 
HARRAK: Salma, let's talk about a diplomatic spat that has broken out between the Ukraine and its neighbor, Poland. Poland, of all countries, a very staunch supporter of Ukraine in this war, has decided to halt some weapon deliveries to Ukraine. 
 
How did it get to this?
 
ABDELAZIZ: Clearly these tensions have been building and mounting for months over Ukrainian grain exports. It's important to know that the E.U. did have a ban in place for several countries to try to protect local farmers in E.U. states, from what was cheaper Ukrainian grain coming into areas that it normally would not. 
 
Because of the closure of the Black Sea, that E.U. deal was up, that ban was up in mid September, still polling in two other countries decided to continually unilaterally, if you will that ban. 
 
Then there was comments from President Zelenskyy at the UNGA; that led to a diplomatic spat. The latest are these comments from Poland's prime minister, again responding to Zelenskyy's criticism. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, POLISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I want to tell President Zelenskyy to never insult Poles again, as he did recently during the speech at the U.N. 
 
The Polish people would never allow this to happen. And defending the good name of Poland is not only my duty and honor, it is also the most important task of the Polish government. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ: Since this diplomatic spat has broken out, both sides have tried to walk it back. Poland's president said that the comments and social media statements saying that weapons would no longer be provided to Ukraine were misinterpreted. 
 
There have been attempts to again soothe and alleviate these mounting tensions. But still there is a fundamental issue here, particularly as Poland heads to a general election and candidates try to hear the voices and concerns of local farmers in Poland. 
 
And then, without overemphasizing this, of course, this has huge impact on the war in Ukraine. Poland is one of its prime supporters. 
 
HARRAK: Salma Abdelaziz, thank you so much. 
 
Dignitaries from around the world are gathering in China for the opening ceremony of this year's Asian Games, notably Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, making his first visit to China since the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011. 
 
He met with the Chinese president Xi Jinping ahead of the Asian Games, marking a significant step in Mr. Assad's efforts to return to the world stage. Chinese state media says that the two leaders agreed to establish a, quote, "strategic partnership." Let's get you more now on this, Marc Stewart joins me now live from China. 
 
Assad looking for friends and funds; what was he able to secure from Xi. 
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, if you look at the reporting based off Chinese state media, President Assad perhaps did have some success in the sense that president Xi is saying that Syria will be more fully integrated into its Belt and Road initiative. 
 
It's this big plan basically to create economic and infrastructure growth. Economic strength is what Syria wants. It may have a role at least with China in that front. 
 
But also president Xi has said that China will lend its support to help Syria rebuild, even among relations across the Middle East. For those two reasons, it appears that president Assad did have some notable accomplishments. 
 <br>[03:10:00] STEWART: But he is not alone. There are other leaders from the Middle East here, as well as from across Asia. This is not just about Syria trying to thrust itself back onto the world stage but also for China. 
 
This athletic event, the Asian Games, at $1.5 billion U.S. was invested in this. We have athletes here from more than 40 countries, thousands of athletes participating in dozens and dozens of competitions. 
 
This is also stripping a way for China to raise its profile after a very long COVID lockdown. It was only in the last year or so that these restrictions have been lifted. So this is a very visible way for China to tell the world that it has moved past the COVID pandemic and is open for business. 
 
In fact, in this big conference hall, this media center that we are in, no one is wearing masks. People are moving freely. The days of social distancing are over. With and that is very visible. Because China in recent months has really been struggling to get its economic engine up and running again. 
 
By hosting a such a bold and visible event such as this, it is just another way to do that. 
 
HARRAK: Marc Stewart reporting, thank you so much. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: For more on this I'm joined by political and national security analyst David Sanger. 
 
David, good to have you with us. Most of the international community has shunned Assad; China decided to roll out the red carpet. 
 
What does China get out of inviting him right now?
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: They really only get one thing. They have been systematically going about trying to build relations with countries that have been under sanction by the United States and the West. 
 
Or have been basically declared rogue nations by the U.S. and the West. Trying to put together an alternative system and you have seen the members of it. Obviously Russia, with whom their continuing trade and buying oil, despite the war in Ukraine. 
 
North Korea, Iran and now Syria. Syria has been under significant sanctions since 2011, when Assad began to put down what seemed to be at the time one of the color revolutions. 
 
It has now been a dozen years. No one thought that Assad would survive through all of that and now joining China Belt and Road and other initiatives, he's trying to make a comeback. 
 
HARRAK: So what does Assad get out of this trip? SANGER: Well, it's all upside for him. He is recognized by a major power. He had not been to China in 20 years, which is pretty remarkable to think about. He is hoping that he will attract some investment for the reconstruction of the country. 
 
Now that he has pretty well taken control, of just about all the elements of the country. Some parts have been in the hands of those opposing him on and off. But he has pretty much put down this rebellion. 
 
And he is feeling pretty good. It was only six or seven years ago, when Barack Obama and John Kerry and others were saying that he has to go, when they were getting resolutions against him in the United Nations, now he is being protected by and large by both Russia and China. 
 
HARRAK: But does this change anything? 
 
Because while he is in China attending, I believe the Asian Games, Syrians have been protesting now for weeks in southern Syria. 
 
As long as there is no political solution to the conflict in Syria, can Assad be rehabilitated?
 
SANGER: He cannot be rehabilitated by the West. And I don't think he will be. 
 
But he sees an opportunity here I think to join this runt group in opposition to the West. What the Chinese have been doing, quite successfully, is trying to organize countries in Africa and Latin America, obviously a few regional players in Asia. 
 
In his effort to say, you do not have to run by Western rules. And, by the way, all of the aid that the United States or the West would ever bring to Assad would come with all kinds of conditions about how to treat his people. 
 
And that would rule out things like gassing your own people, which is what led Barack Obama at one point to declare that Assad could not cross a red line, that he crossed. 
 <br>[03:15:00]
 
SANGER: And now, of course, famously, the U.S. did not take the kind of military action that has been threatened. But now he sees, in China and Russia, countries that are not going to give him human rights lectures. 
 
HARRAK: Final thought from you David, in an increasingly fractured world, are we bound to see more challenges to Western dominance?
 
SANGER: Absolutely. Look, we've got the Ukrainian war creating a sort of litmus test for countries. When you look at the map of the countries who are supporting Ukraine, either with aid or with military goods, with arms, it is pretty much the United States, the West, Japan and South Korea. India is not doing it; obviously China is not. So there are many
 
 countries that are fence sitters and many that have sided with the Russians. We do not hear about that much because we are living in our own news cycle here, with all kinds of good reasons for what the Russians have done. 
 
But much of the world's sitting this out and the Chinese see that as an opportunity. The Syrians do as well now because they have an alternative system they can sign up to. 
 
HARRAK: David Sanger, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
SANGER: Great to be with you.

HARRAK: Britain's King Charles and Queen Camilla have wrapped up a three-day state visit to France that was designed to highlight the close ties between the U.K. and its neighbor. On the final day, the royal couple visited the southwestern city of Bordeaux. 
 
There they met with a local community and focused on climate and sustainability. In Paris on Thursday, King Charles also addressed the French senate, a first for a British monarch. He also met with French president Macron several times during the trip. 
 
Pope Francis is on the final leg of his two-day visit to Marseille, France. He is currently holding a meeting at the Missionaries of Charity, which will be followed by a meeting with French president Emmanuel Macron in the coming hours. 
 
The trip has been focused, in part, on the migration crisis, facing Europe. On Friday the pontiff told reporters that the treatment of migrants arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa is, quote, "cruel and lacking in humanity." 
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
HARRAK: CNN's Antonia Mortensen reports now from Marseille.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANTONIA MORTENSEN, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: Pope Francis arrived here in the French port city on Friday. He's making a two-day visit to close the Mediterranean meeting. A gathering of bishops and other leaders and young people of different faiths, to talk about the challenges facing the region, including the migration crisis. 
 
The pope's trip to Marseille was planned months ago. But it comes as Europe's migrant crisis is once again making headlines, with over 10,000 migrants arriving on Lampedusa in three days this month and over 130,000 migrants arriving in Italy so far this year. 
 
Pope Francis has long made the plight of migrants a priority of his papacy. His visit in 2013 to the island of Lampedusa was the first place the pope visited outside of Rome after he took office, to shed light on what he called a global indifference. 
 
And Friday, after a moment of silence at the memorial dedicated to sailors and migrants here in Marseille, we heard a renewed call from the pope to welcome and integrate new arrivals. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS, PONTIFF, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): People who are at risk of drowning when abandoned on the waves must be rescued. It is a duty of humanity, it is a duty of civilization. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MORTENSEN: After the recent wave of migrant arrivals to Italy, Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, called on the European Union to change how it addresses migration. But the E.U. is still at a deadlock on how to deal with a sudden, large influx of people. 
 
With further friction after the French foreign minister said this week that France would bolster security on the border with Italy and would not be accepting migrants that tried to cross into its territory. 
 
Although this is not an official visit to France, the pope will meet with French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Saturday. And the migration crisis is no doubt on the agenda. He will then give a mass at the Marseille Velodrome before returning to the Vatican, where tens of thousands are expected to attend -- Antonia Mortensen, CNN, Marseille. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: An uncontrolled migration is also a crisis at the U.S. southern border. Nearly 9,000 migrants crossed the border from Mexico in just one 24hr period this week. New drone footage shows migrants at Eagle Pass, Texas, dealing with muddy water, rocks and long stretches of razor wire.
 
Some migrants formed a human chain to cross the Rio Grande into the United States. It is estimated that up to 1,000 migrants were apprehended in the area on Friday. For a close-up look at the human toll of the migrant crisis, we turn to CNN's Ed Lavandera, on the border between Mexico and the United States. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A small group of migrants scour the riverbank, searching for a safe place to slip through razor wire. Their final obstacle in a months-long journey to reach U.S. soil.
 
A man carries a young boy on his shoulders, leading a line of migrants crossing the Rio Grande.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language).
 
LAVANDERA: He said, "We faint, we passed out, this is crazy but, thank God, we are here."
 
Jorge Carrillo (ph) of Venezuela holds his 3-year-old child, telling me his family walked through three months in Mexico before crossing the river.
 
He said, "We cross illegally because of our children; can't take it anymore, they can't handle it anymore."
 
Eagle Pass, Texas, has been a flashpoint for U.S. border crisis, with no end in sight. For several days, thousands of people have turned themselves in to U.S. authorities. But on this day, the scene is dramatically different. Only a small number of migrants have crossed the river.
 
MAYOR ROLANDO SALINAS (D-TX), EAGLE PASS: People are frustrated, they are angry. This is not normal.
 
LAVANDERA: Eagle Pass mayor Rolando Salinas says city resources are strapped and claims that most of the migrants are processed and released. Many go to large cities...
 
CURTIS SLIWA, FORMER NYC MAYORAL CANDIDATE: We don't know where they are from, what their names are.
 
LAVANDERA: -- where they are increasingly met with resistance and dwindling resources.
 
SALINAS: So imagine Eagle Pass, a place of a town of 28,000 people, with limited resources. 
 
What are we supposed to do?
 
Fend for ourselves?
 
We can't.
 
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): With Joe Biden interfering with my efforts to secure the actual border.
 
LAVANDERA: Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott has gone on the political offensive, blaming the Biden administration for the crisis. Abbott is positioning his state as the only ones stepping up, posting a video on social media of state authorities standing in front of a migrant group.
 
The governor writing, "We are repelling illegal immigrants at the border," and reposting this video, writing, "We are refusing to let migrants in and sending them back."
 
But the migrants in that video were not repelled from the border. We watched as they all eventually helped each other crawl underneath the razor wire and turn themselves in to state authorities and Border Patrol agents.
 <br>[03:25:00]
 
JESSE FUENTES, KAYAK COMPANY OWNER: I am frustrated with everybody, with everybody, because, for me, it's about the river. 
 
LAVANDERA: Jesse Fuentes runs a kayak company on the Rio Grande and is suing Abbott for altering the river and hurting his business.
 
FUENTES: All these barriers, have they stopped them?
 
Have they stopped them?
 
No, sir. They haven't. Until the problem is addressed, these people are coming over here for the American dream.
 
LAVANDERA: Local officials in border communities like Eagle Pass fear this latest migrant search is far from over. 
 
The mayor of Eagle Pass says federal authorities had told him 50,000 to 60,000 migrants are starting to make their way through southern Mexico. And that large groups of migrants are waiting for the trains in Mexico moving north to start running again.
 
Jorge Carrillo (ph) and his family arrived shaken and exhausted but with a clear eye of what they've seen along the way, to make it this far.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language).
 
LAVANDERA: He says there's thousands of people coming behind him.
 
The most pressing question for local officials all along the U.S. southern border is just how long this migrant surge is going to last. Here in Eagle Pass, local officials tell us they've been told by federal authorities that there are tens of thousands of migrants making their way up north through Mexico.
 
So the question is, where are they all going to end up?
 
What specific areas of the border are they going to end up in?
 
And that's what they're most concerned about. So they don't know if this is going to last weeks or months. But they are bracing for the worst -- Ed Lavandera, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) HARRAK: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu touted a potential deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia during remarks Friday at the United Nations General Assembly. Saudi Arabia, like many Arab states does not currently recognize Israel. 
 
Hadas Gold has more on the possible agreement. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: For the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his United Nations speech was dominated by the idea of peace with Saudi Arabia. 
 
This subject has exploded onto the forefront this week after the interview that the crown prince did with FOX News after prime minister's meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden. 
 
And during his speech at the United Nations, he was telling the world that the equation has changed. Whereas it was once thought that it be impossible for Israel to reach peace with Arab nations, until they had reached peace with the Palestinians, now he says that has been reversed and peace with Arab nations will come before peace with the Palestinians. 
 
He said the Palestinians need to reconcile the fact that Israel exists. He said, while he wants the Palestinians to be part of the process, he does not think that they should have a veto over the process. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: I have long sought to make peace with the Palestinians. But I also believe that we must not give the Palestinians a veto over new peace treaties with Arab states. 
 
The Palestinians could greatly benefit from a broader peace. They should be part of that process. But they should not have a veto over the process. And I also believe that making peace with more Arab states would actually increase the prospects of making peace between Israel and the Palestinians. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLD: Netanyahu offering no specifics in his speech about what he thinks the Palestinians will get out of a possible normalization deal. 
 
Of course, that is a very big sticking point. It will be in the details because it's something that Saudi Arabia is seeking and something the Americans are seeking. And it's something that might be difficult for Netanyahu to get through his own government. 
 
He has ministers who sit with him at the cabinet table, who said things in the past before, like the Palestinian people don't exist. 
 
Will he be able to get any concessions through his own government? That is a big question. What he did not say was the idea of a two-
 
 state solution, of a Palestinian state. He did not mention that word. And we did not hear that from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, either. 
 
He talked about easing the life of Palestinians and how Israel is a major player in the Middle East. Of course, not the same for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who in his speech to the United Nations on Thursday reiterated his desire for Palestine to be a fully recognized independent state, to be welcomed into the United Nations as an independent state. 
 
He made the statement, "Those who think that peace can prevail in the Middle East without the Palestinian people, enjoying their full, legitimate and national rights, would be mistaken." 
 
It's interesting that that line was not in his prepared remarks. There are still a lot of gaps to bridge before any normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. But the messaging from Israeli officials, from the foreign minister, who recently said they believe this deal will be done within the first few months of next year -- Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Mr. Netanyahu spoke with Kaitlan Collins, expressing optimism about the potential deal, describing it as a chance to build networks of cooperation that spread across the globe. 
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST: How close are you today?
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Closer than we were yesterday.
 
COLLINS: Do you feel that a deal is likely?
 
NETANYAHU: I think it's -- I think it's possible. I think it's likely because I think Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States share a common goal: to change history, to make this quantum leap, another quantum leap for peace. 
 
We had one with the Abraham accords with the United States. 
 
And we now have an opportunity with United States to change the Middle East forever, to create -- not only to bring down the walls of enemies but also to create a corridor of energy pipelines, railings, fiberoptic cables between Asia through Saudi Arabia, Georgia and Israel and the United Arab Emirates. 
 
This is -- this is an amazing change. And I'm always careful about these things. I never exaggerate. I think this is a pivot of history.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HARRAK: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu there, speaking with CNN's Kaitlan Collins. 
 
Ukraine's president faced skepticism from some Republicans during his visit to the U.S. Still ahead, we will go live to Ukraine and ask one of its lawmakers if he is concerned that U.S. military aid could start to fizzle out.

Ukraine says Russia's naval leadership has suffered a serious blow in Friday's attack, at the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet in Crimea. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK (voice-over): Russia said only one of its soldiers is missing after Ukraine launched missiles against the fleet headquarters in Sebastopol. But Ukraine's special operations forces say it targeted senior Russian Navy leaders and dozens of people were killed or wounded, including some leaders of the Black Sea fleet. 
 
Ukraine has not provided any evidence to back up that claim. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was in Canada at the time of that attack. He received a pledge of new military aid worth nearly $500 million, which includes training for F-16 pilots and funding for mental health care. Paula Newton has more now from Ottawa. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This was the easy part, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on friendly Canadian soil, with near unconditional support. In a speech to the Canadian Parliament --
 <br>[03:35:00]
 
NEWTON (voice-over): -- he thanked friends and called out enemies. 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Moscow now, as always, is bent on controlling Ukraine and makes use of all available means to do that, including genocide. It is genocide. 
 
NEWTON (voice-over): Beyond the rhetorical platform, Zelenskyy secured nearly $05 billion worth of new military funding from Canada. And its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was shifting his strategy. Stable, multiyear funding will now replace a piecemeal approach. It's
 
 the kind of funding Zelenskyy would like to see from all allies. 
 
But in some capitals, as in Washington this week, he was met with skepticism about his battle plans and worse, criticism, like that leveled by some U.S. Republicans. To this, he replied, "Just watch us." 
 
ZELENSKYY: Ukraine, not genocide, will be victorious in this war. 
 
NEWTON (voice-over): To do that, Zelenskyy has recruited an army of allies here, many of them Ukrainian Canadians, who represent one of the largest Ukrainian diaspora anywhere in the world. 
 
CASSIAN SOLTYKEVYCH, UKRAINIAN CANADIAN: It's an incredibly difficult thing, absolutely, every single day. Part of me wakes up and I go, how do I get the attention of this country or this world leader today? 
 
NEWTON (voice-over): This Ottawa resettlement welcoming center, Ukrainian refugees find a helping hand. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a very touching moment where a newcomer gets a chance to mark the city he or she comes from. 
 
NEWTON (voice-over): It is sinking in among many that they have already been in Canada months longer than expected. They may be here years. Some, like Svitlana Maksiuta, are wondering if they will ever make it home after settling here. She says she will consider it. 
 
SVITLANA MAKSIUTA, SETTLEMENT MANAGER: Once Ukraine wins the war. 
 
NEWTON: You are confident that Ukraine will win the war?
 
MAKSIUTA: I believe that when we believe in things, they happen. So the more people believe that Ukraine will win the war, the more chances it will happen. 
 
NEWTON (voice-over): Belief is crucial, as Zelenskyy wrapped this week looking for so much more from allies, the kind of military support that will likely still take months to secure -- Paula Newton, CNN, Ottawa.

HARRAK: For more analysis of Mr. Zelenskyy's trip, we are joined now by Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian parliament member. He is speaking with us from Odessa. 
 
A very good day, sir. What a difference nine months makes; during President Zelenskyy's first wartime visit to Washington, he received a rapturous welcome. This time, the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, would not even allow the president to address Congress. 
 
Contrast that with the warm reception that he received in Canada. Looking at it from your vantage point, what do people in Ukraine make
 
 of Zelenskyy's trip?
 
OLEKSIY GONCHARENKO, UKRAINIAN MP: First of all, we cannot compare these two visits. Last year was the first visit for Zelenskyy outside of the country, after the Russian invasion, the first visit in any country of the world and that was to the United States, showing that this is our biggest ally and we are very thankful. 
 
Like yesterday's visit to Canada, it was the first visit to Canada. So you cannot compare those visits. And to the United States, his visit was not the first, definitely it's also completely different timing. 
 
Last year it was completely controlled by Democrats, both House of Representatives, Senate; this time it is not. Also there also a lot of internal issues in the United States, about financing of the government, a possible shutdown. 
 
Also presidential campaigns started in the United States. That clearly divides political forces, not unites them. But we saw that, in general, Ukraine is still issue which unites mainstream Republicans and Democrats. 
 
We saw a very warm welcome of the president of Ukraine in the Senate. We saw both leader of Republicans Mitch McConnell and the leader of Democrats Chuck Schumer meeting Zelenskyy and welcoming him in the Senate. 
 
I know both of them personally. And this is a very important signal and I appreciate it and Ukrainians appreciate it.

HARRAK: Sorry for interrupting you but is there a fear setting in, that tiredness is setting in, that the U.S. might become less hawkish in its support for Ukraine the longer the war drags on; maybe not now but maybe in the future, the near future?
 
GONCHARENKO: Yes, unfortunately, people got used to a little bit of what is going on in the Ukraine. The first shock finished and then it becomes kind of usual life. For us, that is awful. But it is something which are understandable. 
 
But I think that that there is no tiredness. There is internal American campaign, there is internal political issues inside the United States. 
 <br>[03:40:00]
 
GONCHARENKO: But in general, just I want to remind you one thing. Investment in Ukrainian army is one of the best investments in the United States' history. Without losing anyone, any American soldier, with investing only several percent of the United States' military budget to Ukrainian army. 
 
The Ukrainian army destroyed at least 50 percent of potential, at least in conventional weaponry of Russia, which is the second biggest and most dangerous rival of the United States in the world, after China. 
 
Also successes of Ukraine deterred China from any attempts on Taiwan. It shows them the strength of democracies and democratic law. So I think that in a strategic point of view, it is in the best interest of the United States to support Ukraine. 
 
And majority of the United States people, according to the polls, and the majority of United States political allies (ph), they show that they understand this. And that is why I believe that the firm support of the United States to Ukraine will continue. 
 
HARRAK: It is becoming clear that, the longer this war is taking, lasts, the more convincing is needed to keep the flow of aid coming. We also have one of Europe's staunchest allies of Ukraine, Poland, now also making its aid conditional to Kyiv. 
 
Do you find it discouraging that President Zelenskyy has to just keep on hammering time and again this message to convince allies, that they should stay the course and reminding everyone of what is at stake?
 
GONCHARENKO: Speaking about Poland, that's also internal political issues. Poland will have elections on October 15th. And I don't think that we will have any problems with Poland after elections will finish because that is in the best interest of Poland. 
 
If Ukraine would fail, Russians will be on the border with Poland and that will be a huge challenge for Polish security. And they clearly understand this. Yes, we need to work on the diplomatic level, we need to hammer these points and to remind people why it is important. 
 
So also I think that Ukrainians should do more in the United States. It's not just president; it should be leaders of civil society, members of the parliament, which are working on the Washington, not just in Washington but also in other states, explaining why it is important, working with the American public, working with the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States. 
 
That is the job, a diplomatic role. It's also at the front line (ph). You can't just wait that you have results yesterday, that you have them tomorrow. 
 
No, you just need to work and to explain why it is important and Ukraine the most important has what to say and what to show. 
 
Oleksiy Goncharenko, we thank you so much for joining us. 
 
GONCHARENKO: Thank you.

HARRAK: Russia's defense ministry claims ethnic Armenian separatists in a disputed region of Azerbaijan have begun surrendering their weapons to Russia peacekeepers. Under a 2020 agreement, about 2,000 Russian troops are stationed as peacekeepers in the area known as Nagorno-Karabakh. 
 
On Friday, numerous Russian vehicles were seen leaving the enclave. But ethnic Armenian leaders in the region reportedly dispute that they are giving up their weapons, saying no deal has been reached beyond Wednesday's cease-fire. 
 
Meanwhile shipments of international aid were finally able to enter the embattled area for the first time in months. Russia also says its troops are sheltering more than 800 people, including more than 400 children displaced by the Azerbaijani military offensive on Tuesday. 
 
A powerful U.S. senator indicted again on corruption charges, this time involving gold bars and nearly $0.5 million in cash stuffed in envelopes. The latest on the investigation and the reaction just ahead.

HARRAK: U.S. Democratic senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey is angrily rejecting calls to resign by members of his own party, including the state's governor. It follows his indictment Friday on federal corruption charges, for the second time in less than a decade. 
 
Menendez has temporarily stepped down as chairman of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee. He, his wife and three others have all denied any wrongdoing and are due in federal court next week. 
 
Federal prosecutors stress their investigation is still ongoing but allege Menendez accepted gold, cash, a Mercedes and other gifts in return for his influence. Paula Reid has the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Senator Robert Menendez facing corruption charges for the second time in just 10 years.
 
DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: I am announcing that my office has obtained a three-count indictment charging Senator Robert Menendez, his wife Nadine Menendez and three New Jersey businessmen.
 
REID (voice-over): Federal prosecutors allege Menendez and his wife accepted bribes including cash, gold bars and a Mercedes to wield his influence for allies in the U.S. and Egypt.
 
WILLIAMS: Among other actions, Senator Menendez allegedly provided sensitive, nonpublic U.S. government information to Egyptian officials and otherwise took steps to secretly aid the government of Egypt. REID (voice-over): The senator, seen here, traveled to Egypt just last month. The powerful senator who chaired the Foreign Relations Committee until he stepped down today also allegedly attempted to influence criminal investigations of two New Jersey businessmen. 
 
One was a longtime fundraiser for the lawmaker and allegedly pressured the Department of Agriculture to help an associate maintain a monopoly on the importation of halal meat to the United States.
 
Federal agents searched the Menendez home in June 2022, finding over $480,000 in cash. Much of it stuffed into envelopes and hidden in clothing, closets and a safe. Some envelopes were found inside jackets bearing Menendez's name and hanging in his closet as seen in this photo from the indictment.
 
The senator's previous corruption case ended in a mistrial in 2017. Then, a partial acquittal a year after that, before all charges were dropped. Menendez subsequently won re-election.
 
SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): I am so proud that New Jerseyans rejected the politics of personal destruction and the false, negative, salacious ads.
 
REID (voice-over): The White House today declined to comment.
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: But again, this is an active matter. So I'm not going to comment.
 
REID (voice-over): But New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, a fellow Democrat, along with Representative Dean Phillips, among those calling on Menendez to resign.
 
REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN): I don't care your politics, Democrat or Republican, you should be appalled. A member of Congress who appears to have broken the law is someone who I believe should resign. I think George Santos should've resigned already.
 
REID (voice-over): But the senator refusing to back down, saying, quote, "I have been falsely accused before because I refused to back down to the powers that be. And the people of New Jersey were able to see through the smoke and mirrors and recognize I was innocent."
 
REID: The senator and his wife, along with their codefendants, are expected to appear in federal court next Wednesday. Today, the U.S. attorney said, though, this investigation is, quote, "very much ongoing" -- Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.

HARRAK: You are looking now at live pictures -- hopefully, pretty soon -- of Pope Francis on the final leg of his two-day visit to Marseille, France. The trip is focused in part on the migration crisis facing Europe. 
 
Right now he is meeting, as you can see, with President Macron and the French first lady at the far palace in Marseille. They are going to celebrate mass at the Velodrome stadium before returning to Rome later this afternoon. 
 
As you can see, he is holding on to the French president there as they make their way. 
 
And we stay in France, was there was a historic night at the Rugby World Cup, with France beating Libya 96-0 in their biggest ever victory. 
 <br>[03:55:00]
 
HARRAK: But the win was overshadowed by the French captain Antoine Dupont getting his cheek fractured during the game. Patrick Snell has more on what this means. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was during the 2011 Rugby World Cup that New Zealand lost their superstar player Dan Carter to injury, one of the sport's all-time greats ruled out for the rest of the tournament in a huge blow for the host nation, who would at least go on to win the title that year. 
 
Now we have learned that, at this year's tournament in France, Le Bleu scamoff (ph) Antoine Dupont widely regarded as one of the best players on the planet, has suffered his own devastating injury setback after suffering a fractured cheekbone in the 96-0 victory over Namibia on Thursday. 
 
France, one of the pre tournament favorites, left reeling by the news with Dupont set to miss at least France's last Pool A game against Italy next month and also very possibly a potential quarterfinal clash against the number one Irish team, who are defending champions South Africa. 
 
Dupont sustained the injury in the 46the minute at the Stade de Marseille, in a head-to-head clash with Johan Deysel, whose initial yellow card was then upgraded to a red. On Friday, an apology from Deysel, who told reporters, "I would like to extend my best wishes to Antoine Dupont. Clearly I meant no harm. Everything happened very quickly and I could not get my head out of the way quickly enough, resulting in a clash. 
 
"I knew immediately I was at fault. He is a great player and person and I wish him a speedy recovery." 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just it's terrible for France, you know it's our most important player. So I don't know how we are going to win the World Cup if we do not have Antoine Dupont. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's very difficult for us because Antoine is our captain, he is the best player of the world. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Me and all of French people are concerned about Dupont. We hope that he will get better as soon as possible. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am sad for Antoine Dupont because he is a very bright young (ph) player. And hopefully he will resume (ph) soon. And I am always hoping for a French victory.

SNELL: Wishing Antoine all the very best of course. Meantime, action at the World Cup, Samoa taking on Argentina, first win of the tournament for the South American nation who get the job done. Emiliano Boffelli scoring all 16 points for the Pumas, who keep their quarterfinal hopes alive. 
 
This in Pool D, including the only (INAUDIBLE) of the game for Argentina. Sama Malolo (ph) giving Samoas hope with the Trirhizone (ph) but in the end too little too late for Samoa. Argentina sealing the victory, 19 points to 10. 
 
Three more matches set for Saturday, including a blockbuster game between the reigning champions South Africa and topped ranked Ireland. But for now, it's right back to you.
