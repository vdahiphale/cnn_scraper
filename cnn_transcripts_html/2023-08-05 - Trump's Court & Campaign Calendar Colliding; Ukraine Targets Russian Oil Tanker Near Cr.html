FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Hello everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. 
 
From criminal pleas to campaigning, Donald Trump is going to stump tonight in South Carolina just one day after he pleaded not guilty to more federal criminal charges involving classified documents found at his home. 
 
But it's his latest indictment on the Capitol attack that may lead to new court restrictions on the former president. In a court filing last night, special counsel Jack Smith seeks to stop defense lawyers from sharing copies of evidence with Trump that is deemed sensitive. Smith said he feared what the former president would make public. Writing, "If Trump," quoting now, "were to begin issuing public posts using details or for example grand jury transcripts obtained in discovery here it could have a harmful, chilling effect on witnesses, or adversely affect the fair administration of justice in this case," end quote. 
 
And Smith flagged Trump's online post from yesterday, as an example. It says, "If you go after me, I'm coming after you."
 
A Trump spokesperson said the comment was the definition of political speech. And it had nothing to do with the case. 
 
Trump in Alabama yesterday, kept up his condemnation of the prosecutions against him and made this declaration. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Every time they file an indictment, we go way up in the polls. We need one more indictment to close out this election. One more indictment and this election is closed out. Nobody has even a chance. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: The next hearing in Trump's indictment on election interference is August 28th, five days after the first Republican primary debate. 
 
And that's just one example of how his multi-case court schedule is colliding with his campaign schedule. 
 
CNN's Jessica Schneider takes a look at what is ahead for the former president. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Things are already moving quickly in this latest criminal case against the former president. The special counsel's team has to submit the recommendations for a trial start date next week, August 10th. 
 
At that point Trump's legal team will then have seven days to respond. And they have already said they will be pushing back against any rush to trial. 
 
The Speedy Trial Act actually does say that a trial should happen 70 days after a defendant appears in court. So 70 days from Thursday. But Trump's team can move to have that date pushed back which is very likely something they will do. 
 
In fact, Trump's attorney John Lauro told the judge in court on Thursday, that in his view there is just way too much evidence to sift through in this 2020 election case to move too quickly toward a trial date. And of course, up to this point, part of the Trump legal playbook has been to delay, delay, delay.
 
Now as for Trump, he railed against the prosecution on the tarmac of the D.C. airport after his arraignment. He said it was all political, part of the Biden administration's plan to thwart his 2024 bid. And he was back on the campaign trail just hours later on Friday, speaking to Republicans.
 
And we could see more legal trouble for the former president in the next couple of weeks. That's when we're expecting action from the district attorney in Atlanta, Georgia. It really could mean more charges against Trump, related to his and his allies attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia. 
 
So a lot that the former president is confronting on the legal realm. 
 
Jessica Schneider, CNN -- Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Let's talk more about all of this. Let's bring in former federal prosecutor and author of "A Spy In Plain Sight" Lis Wiehl. 
 
All right. So Lis, good to see you. Just so that we make it clear here on what the special counsel wants in his new court filing, the former president can view all the evidence, right, he just cannot have copies of specific pieces of evidence for fear, Jack Smith's fear, that he might disseminate it publicly. How do they go about that? 
 
LIS WIEHL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, I understand why Smith did this. It's a sort of a prophylactic thing to say look, even that tweet yesterday is threatening and so it is indicative that Trump is going to be releasing more and more evidence as it comes out. 
 <br>[11:04:50]
 
WIEHL: But I think it's a little too early for the judge to act now. I think the judge will act after and when it happens, if and when it happens that Trump actually does disseminate something that would be classified, and that would be, you know, shouldn't be disseminated by a defendant or defense attorneys. 
 
Once that action happens, one tweet, after the evidence has been given to him, after the discovery has been given, then the judge could shut it down. 
 
I think it is a little too early for her to do it now, Fred. 
 
WHITFIELD: Even though there is precedent that the former president tends to make things public and doesn't necessarily weigh all of the time the possible ramifications. So might the judge take that into consideration and perhaps consider that kind of motion early? 
 
WIEHL: Absolutely take it into consideration. But again, I think it's too early to say because this judge is just, you know, presiding over this case, right? So once something happens that is untoward in this case, then the judge can act. And then of course, Jack Smith will bring in all the other examples that has happened before. 
 
But I think, I mean I may be wrong, I could be -- but I think it's just a little too early for the judge to act on this one.
 
And as far as the threat goes, yes, it is a threat, but it is not for an individual person, like the prosecutor, that then would be shut down. But right now, it is probably deemed to be political speech. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: Gotcha. 
 
All right. And the special counsel also is seeking that the judge not wait for a defense response on this filing. Would that be unusual? 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WIEHL: Understood.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. 
 
WIEHL: Understood. You know, that's not particularly unusual. Look, Jack Smith is very attuned to this. And there have been threats in the past and there has been the intention in dissemination of information that shouldn't be out there. So he is on top of it.
 
I just think that this judge is going to be obviously wanting to be deemed as fair to both parties and I think to just wait a beat but to know that the past is there and is indicative of what might happen in the future. 
 
WHITFIELD: Ok. And then just hours after, you know, Trump threatened to go after whomever goes after him, and he said this about Jack Smith. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: But despite the demented prosecution of a movement by a corrupt and highly partisan department of injustice and deranged Jack Smith -- doesn't he look deranged, you see the picture with the purple robe -- he is a deranged human being. 
 
We're getting stronger by the day, somebody said, you should treat him nicer, maybe he would be nice. Let me tell you, this guy is a lost soul, bad guy. They don't get nicer. He is a deranged sick person. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: Ok, so we know his attorneys would wish he wouldn't say anything -- 
 
WIEHL: Right.
 
WHITFIELD: -- but then I have to wonder, you know Lis, as well, I mean at what point is it considered whether it be the judge, or you know, the special counsel, consider this harassment, consider this dangerous, that there would have to be, whether it be a gag order, or something imposed on restricting the language of the defendant. 
 
WIEHL: Right, well, it's interesting, if you conflate the statements that he made, "if you come after me, I'm going after you," with the Jack Smith statements about what a deranged individual you are, then you would have an absolute threat. 
 
But here, he has said them separately. He has said he's deranged, all of that. That's free speech, and he's allowed to say, even though it is wrong, he's allowed to say that.
 
What he's not allowed to do, and this kind of gets to the crux of the case, is he's not allowed to make steps toward a conspiracy to overthrow the election after he said all of these things. Saying them is one thing. But taking action and getting others to cooperate, that's a whole other thing. And of course, that's illegal. 
 
Just like you can't yell fire in a crowded theater, you can't get people -- you can't incite people -- you can't get people involved in your conspiracy. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Lis Wiehl, we'll keep it there for now. See you soon, I'm sure. 
 
WIEHL: You got it Fred. Yes. 
 
WHITFIELD: Thank you. Have a great Saturday. 
 
WIEHL: You too. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Now, to the war in Ukraine and an overnight attack on one of Russia's biggest oil tankers in the Black Sea. A source telling CNN that a sea drone carrying almost 1,000 pounds of explosives hit the ship. Video shows the moments leading up to the attack. Russia says the ship was not carrying oil but a Ukrainian source claims it was full.
 
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh looks at the escalating situation in the Black Sea. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: We're now beginning to perhaps see a new Ukrainian tactic. The Black Sea itself shipping lanes now repeatedly under attack by Ukrainian drones. And Ukraine being fairly public about its responsibility for these attacks. 
 <br>[11:09:50]
 
WALSH: We have the attack in Novorossiysk against an amphibious landing craft. And now it appears that a SIG Russian oil tanker, which Ukrainian officials would say was carrying fuel for the military campaign, that again hit by a Ukrainian drone also according to Ukrainian officials, carrying just shy of half a metric ton of explosives. 
 
That may suggest perhaps a similar model to that which carried the Novorossiysk attack. But this SIG oil tanker carrying 5,000 tons of fuel, significantly ablaze. According to the Russian official statements, the 11 crew have escaped unharmed, always difficult to work out quite where the truth lies, given Russian officials are still suggesting that the attack in Novorossiysk against the amphibious landing craft was unsuccessful. 
 
But at the same time that this attack appears to have occurred, one Russian official suggesting there is sound of explosions around the Kerch Bridge. It may not have been an attack, that maybe an anti- aircraft fire, but I think an increasing sense of that area so vital to Russian interests, being increasingly under Ukrainian attack. 
 
And Ukraine itself now quite capable of projecting power, it seems. These drones an ingenious way frankly of getting it toward things that the Russian naval military would presumably imagine were relatively invulnerable, this becoming something that we're now seeing daily. Perhaps a bid by Ukraine, to try and project power in a successful way, away from the slow grind and comparative lack of progress they're seeing on the southern counter-offensive front. But certainly a shock for the Kremlin to start seeing these incidents with this kind of frequency. 
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN -- Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Thanks so much, Nick. 
 
All right. still ahead, the relentless heat wave is not letting up. Right now millions are under dangerous alerts as blistering new records are being set. 
 
We'll have the forecast next. 
 
Plus, mayhem in New York City. A social media star is charged with inciting a riot after drawing thousands to a give-away stunt in Union Square. 
 
And a major shakeup in college sports. We'll explain the changes that are drastically altering the landscape of college football. 
 <br>[11:12:01]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Welcome back. 
 
Today, the National Park Service issuing an excessive heat warning for the Grand Canyon amid dangerously hot conditions. The warning is reserved for only the hottest days of the year and is issued when temperatures are expected to rise to dangerous levels. This as 62 million people across the south and southwest are under heat alerts. 
 
More than 100 temperature records could be broken or tied this weekend. And all this comes as 37 million people are at risk for severe storms in the Midwest with threats of hurricane force winds, hail nearly as big as golf balls, and threats of tornadoes. 
 
Let's get to CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar in the Weather Center. That is everything all at once. Sounds like a movie
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: I was going to say -- yes, I was going to say somebody's got something going on at some point today. And that may be the heat, that may be the storms, it may be flooding.
 
So let's take a look. We begin with the heat because we've got these heat alerts that stretch from California all the way over to Florida. So no, we're not even just talking one or two states here. There's a lot of folks impacted. 
 
We're starting to see those temperatures already rise. But keep in mind when you factor in that heat and the humidity together, you get that feels-like temperature. 
 
It is 11:00 in the morning in the eastern portion of the country, folks. It feels like 104 right now in New Orleans. 105 in Pensacola. Tampa feels like 106. Again in Tampa, it is only 11:00 in the morning, and it already feels like it is 106. Out to the west, it is not going to be much better. We will top out at
 
 111 today in Tucson, 115 in Phoenix, even and 108 in Vegas. a lot of these areas 5 to 10 degrees above normal. And for at least 100 locations, we're looking at the potential for records, not just today but for some of these places, it could be two, three days in a row of record-breaking temperatures. 
 
The only spots that really are cooler at this point are the areas that are getting rain. But it is really not a cooling that you want because it comes with the potential for flooding and severe storms. 
 
Right now, the heaviest rain is going to be focused in the central U.S. but it is also going to spread down across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley region and as well as the Tennessee Valley. 
 
The main threats today are going to be damaging winds and the potential for some hail. But flooding is also going to be a concern, especially for those areas that also got rain yesterday, and even the day before. We're talking portions of Kentucky and Tennessee where they've had 8 to 10 inches of rain in just the last 36 to 48 hours. And now, we're adding more rain on top of it. 
 
Two rounds of storms, the one that is already ongoing and the next second round that will develop across many of these areas, once we get later this afternoon and carry into the evening hours. 
 
In total, most of these areas, you're looking at an additional two to four inches and while that alone may not sound like much, as we mentioned before, it is on top of what some of these areas have already had. And especially across the southeast, areas of Kentucky, portions of Arkansas, Tennessee -- they have already had a lot of rain, Fred these last few days. So even an extra inch or two could be enough to trigger further flooding for today as well as tomorrow. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right, strong stuff. Thanks for the warnings, Allison Chinchar. Appreciate it. 
 
Bidenomics is working, at least that's the message from the White House, touting Friday's new jobs report. But new CNN polling shows that most Americans don't feel confident about the economy. 
 
What's behind the disconnect? We'll discuss. 
 <br>[11:19:25]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: A major shift in college sports, now that eight universities have pulled out of the PAC-12 conference which now leaves only four schools. Those programs stand to lose millions of dollars in funding. CNN's sports anchor Andy Scholes has more. 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Well Fredricka, the PAC-12 conference just crumbling right before our eyes yesterday. Definitely a sad day for a conference that has been around since 1915. Just days after Colorado left the PAC-12 for the Big 12, Arizona,
 
 Arizona State and Utah have now also all decided to leave for the Big 12. Oregon and Washington meanwhile, they're joining USC and UCLA and leaving for the Big 10. The Big 10 is going to have 18 teams starting next season.
 
The Big 12 is going to have 16 teams. And the PAC-12 meanwhile, left with just four -- Oregon State, Washington State, Cal and Stanford. Those programs now stand to lose millions of dollars annually that they were used to getting to fund their sports programs. 
 
The PAC-12 releasing a statement saying "Today's news is incredibly disappointing for student athletes, fans, alumni and staff of the PAC- 12 who cherish the over 100-year history, tradition and rivalries of the conference of champions. We remain focused on securing the best possible future for each of our member institutions." 
 <br>[11:24:56]
 
SCHOLES: And elsewhere, Spain and Japan getting wins this morning at the Women's World Cup, advancing to the quarterfinals. Japan will now face the winner between the U.S. and Sweden and that game is early tomorrow morning. 
 
The U.S. women have been heavily criticized for their performance in the group stage where they scored just four goals in three games. And Alex Morgan says she knows they must do better. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEX MORGAN, CAPTAIN, U.S.A. WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM: It hasn't been the tournament that I would have hoped but at the same time, having this incredible opportunity in front of us, in the round of 16, facing Sweden, a team we know extremely well. I think that there's no question we're highly motivated to play this game tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: Yes, the U.S. definitely needs to play their best to beat a Sweden team that has had their number recently. The Swedes beat the U.S. in the past two Olympic games. Kickoff tomorrow, an early one again, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. 
 
All righ.t Finally, Simone Biles set to make her much-anticipated return to gymnastics tonight. The Core Hydration Classic just outside of Chicago. Biles has not competed in the past two years after suffering a case of the twisties at the Tokyo Game.
 
The twisties are a mental block that cause athletes to get lost in the air. Biles thought looking like her dominant self yesterday in practice completing all of her signature moves, and Fredricka, the event sold out as many fans just can't wait to see Biles return to action. 
 
WHITFIELD: Well, I don't have tickets but I hope I can have a seat right in front of my TV and watch her tonight. Andy Scholes, thank you so much. And this quick programming note. The face of cannabis has changed.
 
 Sanjay Gupta meets senior citizens who are using plants to replace pills on a new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER" airing tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. right here on CNN.
 
We'll be e right back. 
 <br>[11:26:45]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: Cooling down. The latest jobs report shows the U.S. added 187,000 jobs in July. That's a bit under the 200,000 jobs that economists predicted. And the unemployment rate slightly ticked down as well, still near historic lows. 
 
The new report suggests the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes to cool down the economy is actually having an effect. President Biden is touting the new numbers as part of his economic plan. Here's the vice president on Friday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now today's jobs numbers make clear, Bidenomics is working. Today's numbers reflect the point that President Biden has made many times. America's economy is strong and experiencing stable and steady growth. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: Despite that optimism coming from the White House, according to new CNN polling most Americans don't see it that way. 51 percent believe the economy is getting worse. 
 
CNN's Jeff Zeleny went on the road to Michigan, a state Joe Biden won in 2020, to see how the president's economic agenda is playing out. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The old Emerald Isle, heading out on another Lake Michigan run, will soon be replaced by a new ferry, one small piece of President Biden's landmark infrastructure law. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is great. 
 
ZELENY: To Paul Newman, it is another example of a Biden accomplishment gone unnoticed or unappreciated. 
 
PAUL NEWMAN: I think the Democrats have never not done a good job selling themselves. That's one problem. I think they need to get out there and you know, like Trump did and just start talking about all the things that are going on. 
 
ZELENY: He and his wife Nancy are catching a ride to Beaver Island, Michigan. They believe the president has not gotten enough credit for his economic agenda and more. 
 
From conversations on Main Street -- what's the mood -- to the orchards here in northern Michigan. A disconnect between increasing signs of economic strength and persistent feelings of economic pessimism comes alive. 
 
GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): We've been through a lot and people are somewhat optimistic but worried that perhaps there's a curve ball coming. 
 
ZELENY: Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she understands the lingering unease as the nation emerges from the pain of the pandemic. She conceded the Biden administration achievements on infrastructure, lowering drug costs and job creation are not fully felt or understood. 
 
WHITMER: There is a lot more communication I think has to be done between now and next year's election without question. 
 
ZELENY: And is that the burden of the president himself? 
 
WHITMER: It is on all of us. It's on all of us. We all would benefit if we spent a little more time touting some of the great victories that we've seen over the last few years. 
 
ZELENY: Michigan is the pillar of Biden's blue wall. Along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, they are three states Donald Trump carried in 2016, but turned to Biden in 2020, and will be critical battlegrounds in 2024. 
 
WHITMER: I don't think anyone should take this upcoming election for granted regardless of what the matchup is. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Bidenomics is working.
 
ZELENY: As the president touts his economic policies, it is clear he still has some explaining to do. 
 
What does Bidenomics mean to you? Do you know what that means? 
 
FRITZ BENSON, MICHIGAN VOTER: No. I have absolutely no idea what it means. But I think it is Biden trying to put together some positive things for the economy. He has stepped across party lines to get a few things done. 
 
ZELENY: Inside The Clothing Company in Charlevoix, owner Annie Oosthulzen steers clear of politics but she says she feels a brighter mood after the pandemic. 
 
ANNIE OOSTHULZEN, OWNER, THE CLOTHING COMPANY: What we all went through in 2020, we're kind of still in that doom and gloom mindset, but I do feel like things are improving definitely. 
 
ZELENY: While inflation has cooled, high interest rates and prices contribute to a mixed economic climate. 
 
JOHN DAMOOSE (R-MI), STATE SENATE: I waited just for prices to go back to normal and they're not and this is the new normal. 
 
It is not like salaries and wages have kept pace with that, so people are struggling a bit. 
 <br>[11:34:50]
 
ZELENY: The president carried Michigan by nearly 3 percentage points and has visited often, including a stop at King Orchards where owner John King has endured high labor costs, supply chain challenges and inflation. He said his Republican neighbors blame Biden. He does not. 
 
JOHN KING, OWNER, KING ORCHARDS: I'm not disappointed in the president. I just think there's so much to overcome. 
 
ZELENY: The sentiment we heard in Michigan is reflected in the new findings of the CNN poll that showed that just 37 percent of Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy. 
 
Now, White House advisers are well aware of these frustrations, and are trying to close that disconnect between the signs of a strengthening economy, and that lingering sour economic mood. They know Biden's re-election may depend on it. 
 
Jeff Zeleny, CNN -- Washington.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Joining me right now to discuss is Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida. Great to see you, Congresswoman. 
 
REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): You too, Fredricka. Thank you so much. 
 
WHITFIELD: So I want to ask you about this new CNN polling that shows half of Americans think the economy is getting worse, despite what the actual numbers show. And we have seen the president and the vice president going out to take credit for the improving economy. So why, you know, why is the disconnect there? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I mean President Biden, like President Obama before him, inherited an absolute mess, coming out of the pandemic, from clearly the disastrous way that former President Trump handled the pandemic. And he was able to not only make sure that millions of jobs were saved, and small businesses were prevented from going under, but now he's begun to really get our economy turned around, 13 million jobs created, near historic -- near historic low unemployment. We have wages that are finally outpacing inflation.
 
And so with the investments in green energy and investments -- infrastructure investments and even reshoring manufacturing jobs, it is pretty clear that although we're making a lot of progress, the sort of hangover from the pandemic, which was obviously a century (ph), unprecedented situation is still causing melancholy, and also, you know, the impact of those investments is going to take some time to bake in. But that's our job, to make sure that we communicate. 
 
WHITFIELD: And so now, this effort to, by the White House, to put the Biden administration's name out and signs, particularly at road projects, to remind people this is, you know, this part of this administration, this is who to credit. Do you think this is going to make a big difference? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I do think. Just like with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, during the Obama years, making sure that the label, the infrastructure investments, and the wi-fi investments, and the superfund cleanup, and all of the investments that are being made, the jobs that are being brought back from overseas, the super computers that are going to be built as a result of chips being manufactured here, all of that has to be communicated very visibly, and also comprehensively.
 
And eventually you will start to see that baking in. You have seen improvements in the president's job numbers, improvements in his numbers overall, in terms of Democrats and Republicans being supportive of the improvements, but we've got to continue to communicate. 
 
And President Biden and Vice President Harris and Democrats across the country, including great governors like Governor Whitmer are really making time to do that. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. So those are the nationwide efforts. Let's zero in on your state of Florida now where the state's education commissioner is now telling superintendents of public schools that AP psychology classes can indeed be taught in Florida schools. It comes after the college board issued a statement encouraging school districts not to offer the classes after it was informed that the state's education board reportedly told districts the course can no longer be taught if it includes lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity. 
 
So what do you make of the state's education commissioner's about-face now? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Look, this is all on Ron DeSantis. He is the epitome of the MAGA extremism whiplash. Ron DeSantis and MAGA extremists, Donald Trump, the entire field of Republican candidates for president, their focus is on culture wars. Their focus is on taking care of the wealthiest, most fortunate Americans by supporting and passing tax breaks for the wealthiest that are unpaid for that blows holes in the deficit. 
 
They have nothing on their agenda, so all they can do is focus on culture wars, which includes trying to ban abortion nationwide. And that is the contest that you're going to have going into this election. 
 <br>[11:39:54]
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Do Americans want to continue down the road that Bidenomics have taken us and make sure that we can invest in those jobs that are reducing unemployment that are making sure that wages outpace inflation, that are making sure that we continue the 13 million job growth that we've had (INAUDIBLE). What do we want to go down to or back to MAGA extremism that focuses on taking people's rights away and pits Americans against one another. 
 
That's a very clear contrast and I think that is going to have an impact on this election. 
 
WHITFIELD: And speaking of Florida Governor DeSantis, a 2024 presidential contender as well, he has agreed to debate California Governor Gavin Newsom on Fox News. And I'm wondering what your view is of that and how does that potentially help or hurt your party? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: You know, I'm focused on making sure that we can continue, me as a member of congress, on making the kinds of investments that are going to continue us moving down the road that we're moving down, and improving our economy. 
 
Side shows on Fox News, are really not something that the American people are interested in. They're interested in making sure that they can feel more comfortable on the firm economic ground that President Biden is building. And as a Democratic member of Congress, I'm looking forward to continuing to help us do that. 
 
WHITFIELD: Since you think that is a side show, is it concerning then to you that Governor Newsom would agree to it? 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: You know, what's concerning to me is that we make sure that we continue to invest in our economy, that we continue to fight back against Republican MAGA extremism, as we're doing in Congress, and President Biden has been doing. And that's what American people -- I know my constituents want me to focus on the issues that are important to them -- growing jobs, and continuing to make the kinds of investments that we need to improve our economy and make them feel like they're on firmer footing. 
 
And you know, what Ron DeSantis does to try to breathe life into his nearly dead campaign 6really isn't something of concern to me. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, glad you could be with us today. Thanks for joining us. 
 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you. Thanks Fredricka. 
 
WHITFIELD: Coming up, chaos in New York City's Union Square. How a social media star's give-away stunt sparked a riot and how police are now responding. Next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:46:40]
 
WHITFIELD: That frenzied scene unfolding in New York City Friday, after a video game give-away spiraled out of concern. Police arrested 65 people, at least 60 of them were juveniles. It all started after a social media influencer announced a huge give-away in the city. Streamer Kai Cenat has millions of followers online and said he would hand out computers and gaming equipment. Well he is now charged with inciting a riot and unlawful assembly. 
 
CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval is following this for us from New York. So how did this unfold? 
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Fred. So here we are a day later and there is really a big sort of business as usual kind of mood here in the heart of Manhattan. If you look over my shoulder, not a lot of signs of what happened yesterday, there is some paint splattered at the construction site that was torn down by the mob just to the right. You may be able to see in here, one of the workers here, using a power washer, to get some of the paint off the floor. 
 
But look this is certainly, this is a chaotic scene that unfolded yesterday. You mentioned what we heard from the NYPD yesterday, saying in a matter of minutes, they went from a few hundred to a few thousand individuals, namely young individuals who were drawn here by promises of free PlayStations, free electronics, and other items, including gift cards. And things quickly spiraled out of control. 
 
We do know that at least four civilians and police officers were injured. You've mentioned over 60 people were arrested and detained, about half of them juveniles. That also includes this influencer himself, of course, we don't have to give him any more -- any more publicity since we know that he already had millions and millions of followers, one of the main reasons why we saw such a massive presence. 
 
In the meantime, again, he does face those misdemeanor charges including inciting a riot and also one of these unauthorized assemblies, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: And then what are we hearing from NYPD? 
 
SANDOVAL: So they quickly caught up. they were certainly caught off- guard yesterday, but quickly were able to boost up their numbers going from a level two to a level four response.
 
And then I want to hear you directly from one of chiefs here at the department as he specifically addressed influencers. They know they have a lot of power.

CHIEF JEFFREY MADDREY, NYPD: You know, we have to reach out to some of our influencers, and ask them to be responsible with this, to help us with this. I'm not against young people coming here. If we knew about this, we could have had the barriers out here, we could have police on-site and we could have did this orderly.

SANDOVAL: And here we are, a day later, and that really is sort of the lesson that remains here, what police, in terms of looking back on the last 24 hours, and what was done, and what was not done, they're certainly taking a closer look at the situation there what could have been done. 
 
But for sure, they were actively monitoring the chatter online, and they were expecting this to be a group of young individuals coming together to have a bit of fun. But when you look at those pictures, you can see it was anything but that.
 <br>[11:49:52]
 
SANDOVAL: And then finally, even calling on more parent involvement as well, according to the NYPD. In fact there were some parents that came out here yesterday, but as we heard, Fred, from the police department, say they wish they would have seen more. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Well, the volume of people turning out quite significant. Polo Sandoval, thank you so much. 
 
All right. Coming up, new details this week on a possible U.S. plan to put troops on commercial vessels in critical Middle East waterways to prevent Iranian seizures. We'll discuss with a former Navy Secretary straight ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: Concession speeches, a tradition dating back to 1896, where the loser of the U.S. presidential election makes a public acknowledgment. All of that was a tradition until 2020 when Donald Trump famously lost to joe Biden and refused to concede. 
 
While there is no legal requirement for the gesture, it signifies respect for the peaceful transition of power. 
 
Now that the former president is charged with attempting to overturn the 2020 election, questions loom over the strength of American democracy. 
 
I'm joined now by Julian Zelizer, he is a CNN political analyst and a historian and professor at Princeton University. Julian, always great to see you. 
 
JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Nice to be back.
 
WHITFIELD: I think we've all lost count, you know, of how many moments involving this former president the words unprecedented or defiant has been used. So in your view, has America's tolerance or expectation of winning or conceding forever been changed? 
 
ZELIZER: Well, let's hope not. I mean the peaceful transfer of power, concessions, accepting loss when there is a legitimate loss are really integral to the stability of democracy and 2020 did shake that up. 
 
And part of why this recent indictment is so important, is the test. It's not just a test of the former president, it's a test for all of us. And how important are these norms? How committed are we? We need to reestablish that. 
 
There has to be certain limitations to help our partisan work there, (INAUDIBLE).
 
WHITFIELD: So now look at this new poll from ABC News and IPSOS showing two-thirds of Americans, 65 percent see the latest charges against Trump involving the attempt to overturn U.S. election and government as serious. 
 
So have people become desensitized over the gravity of these indictments? I mean, we're talking 65 percent consider it serious. 
 
ZELIZER: I think they might have. I mean, it's not just that poll. It's the fact that the former president remains far and above the strongest candidate in the Republican primary. 
 
So within the Republican Party thus far, these haven't really affected how people see him or perceive him as a candidate. And so that numbing is very dangerous. That's part of why putting this out there, having a trial about what happened in addition to the January 6th committee is quite integral. 
 
We can't have people desensitized to just how dramatic, just how unprecedented and just dangerous that entire campaign to overturn the election was. 
 
WHITFIELD: In an op-ed for cnn.com, you wrote, "while the bar must remain extraordinarily high for any administration to take legal action against a former president, it is a necessary response in the case of Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election. 
 
When the alleged crimes are so egregious that they threaten the stability of our democracy, accountability is vital."
 
Why do you believe democracy, you know, is at stake here, that it is at the core of all that is taking place? 
 
ZELIZER: Because this unprecedented several months that surrounded the election really was dangerous, and it could have gone a very different way. In the end it was resolved and the correct winner is president. 
 
But we have now learned there were a million moments when this could have gone in a different direction. And so there are moments where the law is necessary and to have a trial to really hold even the former president accountable for this and to see what a jury has to say about the evidence. 
 
And when you consider the events of January 6th, we are still hearing lawmakers who are downplaying the severity of what happened. Why do you believe that is? 
 
ZELIZER: Well, I think it's a partisan strategy. I think many Republicans have decided that supporting the former president, accepting election denialism as it's called, is good for the GOP. That it rallies the party. This is the new anti-communism for Republican politics. 
 <br>[11:59:51]
 
ZELIZER: And they see the former president's poll numbers and they just double down. So I think this really is about what's happening right now in the Republican Party. It's about partisan incentives and perceptions.</pre>
