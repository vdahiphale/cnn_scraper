(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News.
 <br>[12:00:33]
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN HOST: All right. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
ZAIN ASHER, CNN HOST: And I'm Zain Asher. You are watching ONE WORLD.
 
It really does seem almost unthinkable, unimaginable, but the second time in two months, the U.S. political scene has been upended by the specter of 
 
 an assassination attempt.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And once again, Donald Trump appears to have been the target.
 
Just moments ago, Ryan Wesley Routh appeared in court where he was charged with two gun-related offenses, connected to what appeared to have been an 
 
 assassination attempt on Trump on Sunday.
 
Sources tell CNN that more charges could be filed as this investigation continues. For now, Routh remains in custody.
 
ASHER: And let's just recap how this all began. Trump went golfing Sunday at a course that he owns in Florida. It was an unannounced outing that he 
 
 did not actually put on his published schedule. He was in between holes, five and six. When a Secret Service agent noticed would appear to be the 
 
 barrel of a gun sticking out from between a few trees. The agent opened fire.
 
Officials say the gunman did not fire any shots back, but he quickly fled the scene. And then when law enforcement searched the area, they found a 
 
 rifle, similar to an AK-47 and two bags in the bushes as well.
 
An eyewitness saw the gunman leave in a car, and police were later able to pull him over. They made an arrest. He has been, as you pointed out, 
 
 identified as Ryan Wesley Routh.
 
GOLODRYGA: And there has been much praise for the Secret Service agent who spied the gun barrel and then engaged with the gunman.
 
But politicians say, there are still some serious questions about how the Secret Service is protecting our leaders.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): There's going to be reports and recommendations coming forward and Congress will act swiftly. We need accountability. We 
 
 must demand that this job is being done.
 
I think there are some really patriotic, great people working in the Secret Service, but it's the leadership. We have no faith. I have no faith in 
 
 Secretary Mayorkas.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank God the president is OK. I think we got a full report so far resounded. The one thing I want to make 
 
 clear, the Service needs more help. And I think the Congress should respond to their needs.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What kind of help do they need?
 
BIDEN: I think we need some more -- I think they may need -- they're made their deciding whether they need more personnel or not.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: When police were arrested, Ryan Routh, a short distance from Trump's golf course, they say that he remains silent and they described him as 
 
 pretty calm.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILL SNYDER, SHERIFF, MARTIN COUNTY, FLORIDA: His demeanor was perplexing in some way. Despite the fact that we had numerous people out with rifles, 
 
 uniform personnel, helicopter and state shutdown, he was as calm as if he was going to a Sunday picnic.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: He wrote and self-published a book on global politics in which he criticized Trump's stance on Ukraine, Afghanistan and Iran.
 
In the book, Routh calls Trump an idiot and a buffoon. He also admitted that he once voted for Trump, but called that a terrible mistake.
 
CNN senior U.S. justice correspondent Evan Perez is here with the very latest.
 
So, Evan, as we noted, he faces two possessions, gun-related possessions, and more charges could be coming soon. What more are you hearing?
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. We know that the investigation is still ongoing, and this was just a charge that 
 
 the federal prosecutors filed in the Southern District of Florida as a means to continue to detain him while that investigation continues.
 
And look, there's a lot that they already know. Obviously, these two charges right now, a possession of a firearm as a felon, which is 
 
 prohibited in the United States as well as possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number and a federal law in the United States. It's 
 
 illegal to destroy the serial number that allows the authorities to be able to trace firearms. And so that is a crime which is punishable, obviously, 
 
 with prison time. So those are the two charges that they're holding him in the meantime.
 
But the goal here, and you heard this from the FBI on Sunday, that they're investigating this as an apparent attempted assassination at -- aimed at 
 
 the former president.
 
And so that's where this investigation is going. We don't know when we might see additional charges, but that is what the FBI, that's what 
 
 prosecutors are working on at this moment.
 <br>[12:05:01]
 
Now, right now, the judge, the magistrate there in West Palm Beach, ordered him held until September 23rd when he has another court date.
 
But you can see from these charges that were -- that were unsealed just a short while ago, that they've already started doing some of -- some of that 
 
 investigative work. They mentioned that readily available or viewable in his -- in his -- in his car.
 
They found a Facebook post, and apparently from his electronics, where he was directing followers to contact him on WhatsApp. They say that this is, 
 
 you know, obviously this is something that is going to have to be more investigated.
 
He was very active, as you have been talking about. He's very active on social media, on his social media accounts posting very -- a lot of -- a 
 
 lot of content about Ukraine, which is something that he was very, very focused on back in 2022.
 
And more recently, he's been posting a lot about Donald Trump and some of criticism about Donald Trump. Some of it also in support of President Biden 
 
 and the new democratic nominee, Kamala Harris. Guys.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. The next court date set for a week from today, September 23rd for Routh.
 
Evan Perez, thank you so much.
 
PEREZ: Sure.
 
ASHER: And let's bring in CNN's Carlos Suarez, joining us live now from West Palm Beach, Florida, near Donald Trump's golf club.
 
So as Evan mentioned, I mean, this is being treated as an attempted assassination. What more do we know, Carlos, right now about the 
 
 investigation?
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that there are a number of unanswered questions at this hour, specifically just how this 58-year-old 
 
 knew that the former president was going to be at the golf course here behind me.
 
It was not on his public schedule yesterday. And in fact, we're told that the former president decided to go golfing almost at the last minute. And 
 
 so authorities are, at this hour, still trying to figure out how Routh would have known that the former president had left his Mar-a-Lago resorts 
 
 and was coming to this golf course here behind me. That's only about 10 to 15 minutes from Mar-a-Lago.
 
But to a kind of recap, just kind of how things played out yesterday, it was around 1:30 in the afternoon that we're told by authorities that a 
 
 Secret Service agent that was ahead of the former president playing golf, spotted a part of the rifle that was used in all of this, sticking out 
 
 through a fence.
 
Now, there had been some confusion in the minutes and in the hours after all of this happened about whether there had been an exchange of gunfire 
 
 between the 58-year-old and Secret Service agents.
 
But we now know that the only people that opened fire were -- was this a Secret Service agent who fired anywhere between four to six shots.
 
From there, we're told that Routh tried to get into a car, but not before he was spotted by someone who took a photo of him getting into this vehicle 
 
 and essentially, eventually called 911, told authorities what this person had seen.
 
All of this finally comes to a head about an hour north of where we are in Martin County. It's there that authorities pull over 58-year-old, Ryan 
 
 Routh. They take him into custody.
 
And the sheriff really describes almost an emotionless Routh. He says he didn't really have much of a facial expression on him. He seemed very 
 
 almost at ease with what happened.
 
So, authorities were able to stop him there. They took him into custody. Now, the sheriff of Martin County, William Snyder, he talked a little bit 
 
 about that encounter, how things went down. Here's a portion of that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNYDER: One of my road patrol deputies, very alertly, even though this weekend traffic, I-95, saw the vehicle and called it out.
 
So we followed the vehicle until my big pickup trucks got on location and with those big front end bumpers, they maneuvered that vehicle to a stop, 
 
 so there was no chase.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUAREZ: As for where the investigation stands at this hour, we know that the acting director of the Secret Service is already on the ground here in 
 
 Florida. He is scheduled to meet with law enforcement and investigators here on the ground to get a sense of where their work is at right now.
 
We're also expecting that the acting director is going to get a tour of the golf course here behind me. And then we're also told that at some point 
 
 today, he is going to meet with former President Trump to go over the details of what happened yesterday.
 
Again, the investigation is still in its early stages, considering what played out around 1:30 yesterday afternoon. Guys.
 
ASHER: All right. Carlos Suarez live for us there. Thank you so much.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, now to a closer look at protecting high-profile individuals like Donald Trump, sources tell CNN that golf courses where 
 
 Trump likes to spend a lot of his free time, have long been considered a source of concern among Secret Service officials because they are 
 
 particularly difficult for the agency to secure.
 
ASHER: The landscape design with trees, shrubs, and hills can conceal would-be assassins and challenging to protect.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[12:10:05]
 
RIC BRADSHAW, SHERIFF, PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA: You got to understand, the golf course is surrounded by shrubbery. So when somebody gets into the 
 
 shrubbery, they're pretty much out of sight. All right?
 
And at this level that he is at right now, he's not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded.
 
Well, because he's not, the security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.
 
So I would imagine the next time he comes to the golf course, there'll probably be a little more people around the perimeter.
 
But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Let's bring in CNN's Kevin Liptak at the White House.
 
Kevin, so the Secret Service has long said the golf courses in particular seem to be a vulnerability and it's where lots of presidents, Donald Trump 
 
 included among them, like to spend a lot of their time.
 
That coupled with the fact that even President Biden today said he is going to be asking Congress for more resources, begs the question as to whether 
 
 or not the former president and even now, I guess, she has enough security detail because she's the vice president.
 
But whether even candidates should be receiving the type of security detail that would cordon off an entire area like a golf course, the way a sitting 
 
 president would receive.
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes. And I think the sheriff in that press conference yesterday really kind of raised that question and 
 
 said explicitly that the next time Donald Trump is on his golf course down on Palm Beach, he would expect that there would be more personnel around 
 
 the perimeter of the course.
 
But in reality, sources have been raising concern for years about Donald Trump's golf course down in West Palm Beach in particular because it's 
 
 bounded by three major roadways. You don't close the road when the president is on the golf course.
 
And in fact, the club itself remains open to members. And so it remains something of a porous environment for Donald Trump when he is out on the 
 
 golf course.
 
And this is something that is true really for any kind of golf course. Presidents, this is kind of the only place that they're able to walk around 
 
 in the open air for any length of time.
 
So it's not something that the Service is going to say, no, you can't go out there. And it does remain on the agents to kind of secure it as the 
 
 president goes from hole to hole. They drive their own cart.
 
There isn't an armored suburban vehicle that's trailing them, which is often the case when they're not on the golf course. And so it remains, you 
 
 know, kind of -- kind of an environment that is tricky for the service to secure.
 
When Barack Obama was president, he used to golf almost every weekend. But he golfed at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington. So it's on a 
 
 military installation. It already has a perimeter established around the course.
 
That's not true of the courses that Donald Trump plays golf at, which are his own courses. There's the one in Palm Beach. There's also one outside of 
 
 Washington. It really abuts the Potomac River providing its own security concern.
 
He has his course at Bedminster in New Jersey, which is a little harder to get to. But certainly these places are very difficult for the Service.
 
And you did see President Biden today, you know, when I asked him what kind of help the agency might need, he specifically pointed to personnel.
 
And it is true that the Secret Service has long had staffing issues that have made it difficult for them to put individual agents on individual 
 
 details in a way that would provide the security that is clearly needed.
 
The Secret Service director, when she was still the Secret Service director, was testifying over the summer and said that the agency currently 
 
 employs 8,000 people, which is below the 9,500 figure that they have tried to target.
 
And so that remains an open question, whether more funding will help that or whether it's more of a cultural issue within the agency. And you do hear 
 
 agents and officers talking about burnout, talking about high turnover.
 
So this is a very serious problem. Certainly President Biden today, on the South Lawn, wanting to get in front of it and wanting to show that he has 
 
 it at the top of mind.
 
But as this election continues and as all of these candidates go about their campaign work, but also their personal lives, it will be an issue 
 
 that the agency has to deal with going forward.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. We know that the former president will be meeting with the U.S. Secret Service Director later on today as well in Florida.
 
Kevin Liptak, thank you.
 
ASHER: Thank you, Kevin.
 
All right. Let's bring in CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Charles Ramsey. Charles, thank you so much for being with us.
 
So, obviously, the Secret Service, of course, did do their job in the fact that they kept the president, the former president, safe. But the fact that 
 
 this would-be assassin got close to the president again is also a problem.
 
So yesterday's events, is that -- do they represent a success by the Secret Service or a failure? Your thoughts.
 
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: I mean, a little bit of both, I think. They're going to have to go over their operational plans. I 
 
 mean, the former president obviously loves to play golf. He plays golf quite frequently at his own golf clubs, including the one that he was at 
 
 yesterday.
 <br>[12:15:02]
 
The Secret Service probably has an operational plan, a security plan for that particular location. That plan did not include protection of the 
 
 perimeter.
 
So, obviously, they got to take a heavy look at that and in the current threat environment, not just toward the former president, but just in 
 
 general. You really got to beef up the security.
 
And I heard the president -- the current president, say that they need more resources. Well, that's not going to happen between now and November 5th. 
 
 So they've got to make do with what they have and they've got to rely very heavily on state and local to kind of make up the difference in terms of 
 
 personnel.
 
GOLODRYGA: There are reports that the alleged shooter spent hours at this golf course before ultimately running after the Secret Service shot at his 
 
 rifle and spotted it.
 
Does that surprise you that someone is able to spend as much time as he apparently did, leading up to even the president beginning his day on the 
 
 golf course?
 
RAMSEY: Well, what I'm not aware of is whether or not he actually maintained a surveillance by the golf club where it was fairly close. The 
 
 car should have been observed by someone.
 
Did he have a -- I mean, he was using one of those GoPro cameras. At least he had one with him at the time of the incident.
 
Did he have another one secreted somewhere where he actually could watch either the golf course or Mar-a-Lago to kind of see from a distance whether 
 
 or not the president was moving in that direction? I don't know the answer to that.
 
But clearly, you know, there's a lot of questions that need to be answered because this was an off the record type of event. So how could he possibly 
 
 know that the president would be on the golf course yesterday?
 
But again, he had scouted it out. He knew between holes five and six would be where the president would be the most vulnerable. And that's where he 
 
 set up.
 
ASHER: Yes. I mean, the fact that he did know Donald Trump's movements, even though the fact that he was playing golf wasn't something that was 
 
 publicized. It was a last-minute addition to his schedule.
 
The fact that he knew that, what does that tell you, Charles?
 
RAMSEY: Well, I mean, he either had surveillance of some kind and he knew that the president was at Mar-a-Lago and he was waiting to see if the 
 
 motorcade was going to go that way. It's not a secret that the president likes to play golf, probably on Sundays. So again, it could be something 
 
 where he just took a chance on that.
 
But it looks like he actually traveled in from a different location. So when they start really going through text messages, other types of 
 
 information that they got, they'll be looking for all the kinds of clues you would need to find out whether or not he got a tip somehow that the 
 
 president was going to go there. Was it blind luck? Did he have surveillance? What actually led him to that location yesterday to threaten 
 
 the life of a president, a former president.
 
GOLODRYGA: And we heard from local officials who, in addition to giving credit to the Secret Service, also praised an eyewitness who took a 
 
 photograph of the license plate of the suspect and thus helped officials, local officials, their track him on the highway.
 
Charles, I'm curious, when Secret Service spot as the Secret Service agent apparently did the barrel of a rifle from such a close range, are they 
 
 trained to shoot to kill in that scenario? Because obviously that didn't happen here.
 
RAMSEY: Well, you shoot to stop the threat is what you shoot for. I mean, people like to use that term shoot to kill, but you're shooting to stop the 
 
 threat.
 
I'm sure they probably announced their presence to the individual. They did take action and fire shots because there was a direct threat toward the 
 
 president -- former president of the United States. They did the absolute right thing.
 
But as you mentioned earlier, I mean, that witness was key as well to have the presence of mind to see an individual run from the bushes, get in a car 
 
 to take a photograph of the car and the license tag.
 
Most people would not react that quickly. So that particular person deserves an awful lot of credit because had he not been able to do that, 
 
 then we may still be looking for this individual because we wouldn't have had enough to go on to be able to really identify him.
 
ASHER: All right. Charles Ramsey live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
 
GOLODRYGA: Thanks, Charles.
 
Still to come for us, we're getting more details about the man investigators believe is behind the attempt, specifically his possible 
 
 connection to Ukraine.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:20:25]
 
ASHER: All right. We're learning more about the man charged in the apparent second assassination attempt on Donald Trump.
 
Ryan Wesley Routh has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine and visited the country in 2022. That's according to video and images geolocated by CNN.
 
GOLODRYGA: And Ukraine's Foreign Legion has been talking to CNN. It says Routh was never part of its volunteer fighting unit.
 
And in his self-published book on the Ukraine war, Routh spent time criticizing Trump.
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian is looking at all of this for us and joins us live.
 
Clare, paint a more of a picture for us as to Routh's connection specifically to the war in Ukraine. Because what's been fascinating, over 
 
 the past 24 hours, is just seeing the number of interviews he's given to Ukrainian journalists.
 
ASHER: Something tells me.
 
GOLODRYGA: We don't have Clare Sebastian. OK. We'll get Clare back up as soon as we have her. Thank you so much.
 
ASHER: All right. Still to come, Donald Trump has been reacting to Sunday's incident, calling it quote, an interesting day.
 
Let's take a closer look at how he's handling this apparent second attempt on his life. That's next after this quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:25:04]
 
ASHER: All right. Welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Zain Asher.
 
GOLODRYGA: And I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
Well, court sketches have just been released showing the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump making his first appearance 
 
 in court earlier today.
 
Ryan Routh has been charged with two weapons counts. He appeared just a couple of hours ago in a West Palm Beach court.
 
ASHER: Yes. And just in terms of his connection to Ukraine that we were speaking about earlier, we mentioned that he has been a staunch supporter 
 
 of Ukraine and visited the country back in 2020.
 
GOLODRYGA: I believe we have Clare Sebastian. I'm not going to say more until I actually see our colleague Clare joining us to talk more about 
 
 Routh's connection to Ukraine.
 
But it has been interesting, Clare, over the last 24 hours to see a number of journalists come forward, saying that they actually had interviewed 
 
 Routh over his what appeared to be an obsession with the war -- Russia's war against Ukraine.
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. From what we're able to piece together from, as you say, really quite a lot of evidence around his sort 
 
 of passion, perhaps even obsession with Ukraine, we know that he went to the country in the early months of the war.
 
There's evidence that he was there in April of 2022 and through some of the summer months as well. He was passionate about trying to help in various 
 
 ways. None of those ways ended up really working for him.
 
Initially, according to a book that he self-published that was released last year, he tried to volunteer to fight himself, but was told that he was 
 
 too old at the age of 56 and that he didn't have any military experience.
 
So then he turned his hand to trying to recruit other foreign soldiers. He set up a sort of makeshift recruitment area, perhaps you could call it on 
 
 Maidan Square in Central Kyiv. He was a well-known fixture there, certainly according to one aid worker who met him that I spoke to this afternoon.
 
He had a sort of U.S. bandana that he wore, but that didn't really work. The police ended up dismantling that area, according to his book. He tried 
 
 even to bring Afghan soldiers, former Afghan soldiers fleeing the Taliban into Ukraine.
 
But CNN has spoken to one U.S. citizen who worked for Ukraine's International Legion who said that that was sort of an ill-conceived idea 
 
 bordering on a security risk.
 
And Ukraine's own military has been distancing itself from him. There are sort of two offices that handle and coordinate foreign volunteers in 
 
 Ukraine. Both of them have said he had nothing to do with them, no official role, one which is affiliated with the land forces told CNN that he had 
 
 actually been in contact with them a number of times. But he had been basically ignored because they described his ideas as delusional.
 
But what is clear is that his frustration of what he saw as Western inaction of Ukraine, over the fact that foreign leaders weren't doing 
 
 enough, weren't sending in military, has sort of fueled his frustration with U.S. leadership.
 
He did say in an interview with Romania Newsweek in June of 2022 that, you know, next time round, he said, we'd have to elect leaders with a backbone. 
 
 So that is all part of the picture that we're building up here.
 <br>[12:30:08]
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much.
 
CNN has just learned that Routh may have spent nearly 12 hours near where he was spotted at the golf course.
 
Donald Trump has been reacting to Sundays, a parent attempt on his life throughout the day. He's been tweeting his thanks to the U.S. Secret 
 
 Service and all of law enforcement saying, quote, the job done was absolutely outstanding. I'm very proud to be an American.
 
ASHER: In an interview with Fox News Digital, Trump goes on to say the suspect, in his words, acted on the highly inflammatory language of the 
 
 Democrats.
 
Soon after Sunday's attempt, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson talked to the Republican presidential nominee. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHNSON: He was in very good spirits, as you might expect. That's who he is. He's so resilient and we were really grateful to see him.
 
There's no leader in the history of America that has been so attacked and has remained so strong and so resilient. He's one of a kind. He is not 
 
 going to stop fighting for the American people. And it was really encouraging for us to sit and visit with him right after that happened.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: All right. I want to bring in CNN's Kristen Holmes live from West Palm Beach, Florida.
 
I mean, the fact that Donald Trump is blaming the Harris campaign, saying that it's rhetoric from the Democrats that is, at least partly, or in hold 
 
 to blame for the second assassination attempt on his life, what impact is that having, Kristen?
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you have to remember this is completely different from what we saw after the first assassination 
 
 attempt in which Donald Trump got out there. He spoke to numerous different outlets, particularly conservative outlets, saying that he was calling for 
 
 unity, saying this wasn't a time to be politically divisive, that he wanted to bring both Republicans and Democrats together, particularly the 
 
 Republican Party.
 
We were told, time and time again, by his senior advisors if he was a changed man after that assassination attempt, that is clearly not.
 
What we are seeing from the former president right now, and I do want to read you in part of that interview where he goes on to blame Biden and 
 
 Harris even more. This is what he says. He says, he, speaking about the shooter, believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris and he acted on it. 
 
 Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at when I am the one who is going to save the country and they are the ones that are destroying the country 
 
 both from inside and out.
 
Now, we have seen a sort of evolution from the former president in terms of blaming the Biden administration for that first assassination attempt. He 
 
 has walked slowly into blaming them before it was essentially this was a crazy person. We need to bring everybody together.
 
Now he has essentially said that it was them. One point saying Kamala Harris was completely responsible. Obviously, this is a political tactic in 
 
 part because of the fact that he is running against Kamala Harris and there are incredibly tight polls.
 
But that is not fair to say in this circumstance because of the fact that there was now a second assassination attempt. We don't know what there -- 
 
 what if anything is part of a strategy behind this.
 
But it is clear that Donald Trump is a different person in reacting to this potential or this assassination attempt than he was to that first one in 
 
 Butler, Pennsylvania.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And, Kristen, just as you're speaking, Donald Trump has posted to X and he posted two posts. One sort of in line with the first 
 
 post of Truth Social where he thanked local officials there for a job well done, as he says.
 
But then he went on to once again really dig into the attacks against Kamala Harris' campaign specifically and circle back to what he says was 
 
 some of the rhetoric that she used during the debate that in his view led up to this assassination what appears to be an assassination attempt 
 
 yesterday.
 
So in terms of what you were just saying, whether or not this is now their new strategy, we're hearing him really double down on this front.
 
HOLMES: Yes. And he did talk about Ukraine which we obviously know the suspect was deeply involved in Ukraine and the war in Ukraine following the 
 
 war in Ukraine. He wanted to fight with Ukrainian soldiers. Donald Trump, during that debate, did talk about Ukraine.
 
But again this is now more politically divisive rhetoric on top of what we've already seen in a very polarized race. A very -- it has been a very 
 
 angry race on both sides with both -- with both parties attacking each other, but this is clearly now piling onto that with more rhetoric blaming 
 
 Democrats, blaming Kamala Harris for the second assassination attempt.
 
Look, we still have so much to learn about this suspect and about what brought this suspect to the golf course to try this assassination attempt 
 
 on Donald Trump's life on Sunday. We still just don't know. We don't have the answers. And it might be some time before we do.
 
But, of course, Donald Trump is in a race to win the White House. He is 50 days away and now he is making this clearly political.
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
ASHER: All right. Kristen Holmes live for us there. Thank you so much.
 
GOLODRYGA: Time now for The Exchange. Joining us is Margaret Talev, a senior contributor at "Axios" and the director of Syracuse University's 
 
 Institute for Democracy -- and bless you -- and Citizenship.
 
Margaret, welcome to the program.
 
So picking up on where we left on there with Kristen, it does appear that the president, the former president is doubling down on targeting 
 
 Democrats, specifically Kamala Harris and her campaign for some of the statements that she, he says, that were false, that were made during the 
 
 debate last week.
 
I'm curious if you think what happened yesterday, and it's quite stunning and unprecedented, I think we should note, to thankfully failed 
 
 assassination attempts within just a matter of weeks against one candidate.
 
Do you think this changes the tenor and the strategy for either one of these campaigns in the remaining 50 days left?
 
MARGARET TALEV, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS: Well, it definitely will change the tenor for a period of time, but -- and I can't believe I'm saying this, 
 
 we have one previous assassination attempt, so far, in this cycle, by which to judge, you know, sort of how long those changes lasted.
 
So I think what have we heard so far from President Biden, from Vice President Harris? We've heard there's no place for violence in America. 
 
 We've heard that they're so glad that President Trump -- former President Trump was unharmed.
 
So those are not the signs of divisive violent rhetoric. And I think neither is winning a debate decisively by critiquing your rival's past 
 
 performances, president and conduct. That's not inherently violent language, and that's not inherently insightful language. So you are hearing 
 
 a lot of politics at this moment.
 
But it does seem that there is a difference between how former President Trump handled the response around the attempt in Butler versus this.
 
In that case, there was clearly a message that he just wanted to go on with the campaign and would keep fighting. And here, there has been a quick 
 
 pivot to try to blame his opponent. And this is happening against the backdrop of just a lot of violent rhetoric outside of politics also.
 
You're seeing multiple school shootings. You're -- there's just -- there is a bigger backdrop here. As a journalist, I can focus on the campaign and 
 
 say how might this impact turnout or people sympathies?
 
As someone who's trying to understand democracy and civic engagement, there's just a landscape right now in the U.S. that's littered with 
 
 violence as an acceptable way to construct sentences and as a way to respond to conflict in your life, and it's beyond the election, and 
 
 including the election, it's very troubling.
 
ASHER: I mean, yes, it's -- an assassination attempt is something that a U.S. president, if they're unlucky, if they're unlucky, deals with once in 
 
 their lifetime, if they're unlucky, not twice in as many months.
 
And so I'm just curious to get your perspective on, despite the sort of statements we've seen from Kamala Harris saying, oh, we need to tone down 
 
 the rhetoric. We don't support political violence. Can the rhetoric actually be toned down in the next 50 days? And if so, how? 
 
Specifically, how do you begin to -- go ahead.
 
TALEV: I just want to say who's rhetoric?
 
ASHER: Exactly.
 
TALEV: Because I think there are -- there are many issues at play here. One is that when you are a sitting U.S. president and to a lesser extent, a 
 
 former U.S. president, traditionally, when you're a sitting U.S. president, you are constantly at risk or at fear that somebody may be trying to do you 
 
 harm. It just doesn't usually get to this point.
 
But any -- name any former presidents in the last, you know, since the time of Ronald Reagan, and that is why security is so tight at the White House, 
 
 that is why the motorcades are so deep, that's why press access is sometimes limited. We're seeing it right now.
 
But to have two actual attempts, someone who got that close, that is indeed quite unusual. And the Secret Service is going to be, obviously, talking 
 
 about how much protection does an ex-president get, as opposed to a sitting president, particularly when they're the nominee. These are all unusual 
 
 situations.
 
But I think in order to truly change the rhetoric of the presidential campaign, there are two candidates running for president. And, you know, 
 
 former president Trump and his running mate have been out there spreading misinformation about immigrants and using violent rhetoric themselves.
 
It could make a difference if everyone, across the political spectrum, use -- do not use aggressive language in their political conversations.
 <br>[12:40:02]
 
I also think that people who actually attempt something like this are very rare and very unwell and it is a security management situation as well as a 
 
 rhetoric situation.
 
ASHER: That's a good point.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. We saw the poll shift marginally, if at all, following the first assassination attempt on -- against former President Trump. He had 
 
 already seemed to be on a trajectory of doing better than candidate Biden at the time. And, God forbid, we get numb or accustomed to assassination 
 
 attempts.
 
But I'm just wondering now that we've had two, Margaret, and we're focused specifically on a small number of voters in seven states, those that are 
 
 undecided. Do you think that this swings them at all in one direction or the other?
 
TALEV: Yes. I think I've grown wise enough over the years not to predict, especially on something like this.
 
But I will say that in a conventional setting, if a political figure, whether they're in office or outside of office, if attempt is made on their 
 
 life or on their safety, it generates sympathy around them. Nobody wants -- people shouldn't get hurt for practicing politics. Our systems will be 
 
 clear of anything like that.
 
So I would say -- traditionally, you would say, this could benefit the former president politically. But there are so many other particulars to 
 
 this year that this is the second attempt that most people have made up their minds about this race that early voting has already begun.
 
And fundamentally, that a few months ago, he pledged that he was a vowed man and then went back immediately to the kind of campaigning we had seen 
 
 before.
 
So I think there are too many variables to really predict how voters are going to respond to this. But I think it's important for voters to get 
 
 accurate information about what's actually going on. This is about a man's actions that we are still learning a lot about who this person is.
 
And there's no evidence, at this point, that either the sitting president or that the vice president are involved in this, in any way, other than 
 
 saying they want to be helpful towards making sure the Secret Service has the resources that it needs. And that they -- there's no place for violence 
 
 in American politics.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well said. Axios senior contributor, Margaret Talev, thank you so much.
 
ASHER: All right. We've got new details and new pictures coming to us from yesterday's assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump. This 
 
 brand-new footage from the Martin County Sheriff's Office of the arrest of Ryan Routh. Let's listen to it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey there. Take two steps to your right. Take two steps to your right. Driver, now stay back. Keep walking.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. Keep down low.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: And we are hearing that it took about a two-mile chase for Routh to finally pull over and be apprehended. Just fascinating.
 
ASHER: We heard that he was also uncharacteristically calm and cooperative as well.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. Well, any new information will continue to bring your way. We'll be right back after a short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:45:19]
 
GOLODRYGA: At least 10 people have died after some of the heaviest rain in decades hit parts of Central and Eastern Europe.
 
The Storm Boris has caused catastrophic and widespread flooding, with several cities receiving at least a month's worth of rain.
 
Meantime in China. Authorities say Typhoon Bebinca is the strongest storm to hit Shanghai in more than 70 years. It made landfall early Monday with 
 
 heavy rain and gale force winds forcing more than 400,000 people to evacuate their homes.
 
ASHER: And in Nigeria, close to 300 people have died and more than 640,000 have been displaced in heavy flooding.
 
Aid agencies say that more than 1,000 people have died across West and Central Africa as a result of high waters.
 
So let's take a look now at Storm Boris, which pounded Central and Eastern Europe. CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam has more.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. That's right, Zain and Bianna.
 
Storm Boris has been catastrophic for so many people. We've seen this storm produce meters of snow fall across the Alps. Then, of course, in the lower 
 
 elevations, it's falling as heavy rainfall leading to catastrophic flooding.
 
Look at this video from the Czech police, a river bursting its banks and this very daring helicopter rescue of an individual who was stranded by 
 
 these flood waters. Wow. Just to see that unfold is incredible.
 
Here's the storm system in question. That storm Boris. It's kind of that clockwise or counterclockwise spin in the cloud cover. It's been meandering 
 
 over Central Europe. It's produced significant rainfall totals.
 
In fact, storm reports in the Czech Republic have topped 350 millimeters. Equally is impressive. The further south. He head towards Austria as well. 
 
 In fact, Vienna reports over 230 millimeters of rain. That's four times their September average rainfall just from this storm alone.
 
Now, the wind reports have been equally impressive as well. Check this one out in the Czech Republic of 205 kilometers per hour. We're almost getting 
 
 that jet stream winds right down to the surface. Incredible.
 
A lot of rain still to go, but the storm still is weakening as it kind of turns its energy out. Still some snowfall for the higher elevations of the 
 
 Alps and heavier rain across the Adriatic.
 
Let me take you to China because we have had a land falling typhoon near Shanghai. This was the scene just a few hours ago near Shanghai as Typhoon 
 
 Bebinca made landfall. It made its presence known.
 
This storm, still a typhoon as it moves inland. The real threat going forward is certainly going to be the heavy rainfall that could lead to 
 
 flash flooding.
 
But when it made its initial landfall on the 16th, it was just incredible because there was one wind report of 187 kilometers per hour near the 
 
 greater Shanghai region. The rain totals going forward will easily eclipse 150 millimeters. So that's why we have the flash flooding and a possibility 
 
 for this part of Eastern China.
 
Zain, Bianna, back to you.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Still to come for us, did your favorite TV show take home and awarded the Emmys last night?
 
Well, we'll take a look at the big winners, after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:50:08]
 
ASHER: All right. It was a record-setting night at the 76th Emmy Awards. A historical drama "Shogun" took the awards for outstanding drama, lead actor 
 
 and lead actress in a drama, as well as directing for a drama series. That gave "Shogun" a total of 18 awards. The most ever for a show in a single 
 
 season.
 
But the big surprise was the winner for Outstanding Comedy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Emmy goes to "Hacks."
 
(CHEERING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: That was one of two wins on Sunday for the Max series "Hacks." Max and CNN belongs to the same parent company.
 
The show's co-creator called for the TV industry to portray more older characters.
 
GOLODRYGA: And from Comedy to a heartfelt message from one of the night's winners, writer and actor Richard Gadd, accepted one of his two awards for 
 
 Netflix's "Baby Reindeer."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RICHARD GADD, COMEDIAN AND ACTOR: Look, 10 years ago I was down and out, right? I never, ever thought I'd get my life together. I never, ever 
 
 thought I'd be able to rectify myself with what had happened to me and get myself back on my feet again.
 
And then here I am, just over a decade later picking up one of the biggest writing awards in television.
 
I don't know much about this life. I don't know why we're here, none of that. But I do know that nothing lasts forever. And no matter how bad it 
 
 gets, it always gets better.
 
Yes, so if you're struggling, keep going, keep going. And I promise you, things will be OK. 
 
Thank you so much for this award.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: That was really powerful.
 
CNN entertainment correspondent, Elizabeth Wagmeister, joins us live now.
 
I mean, anyone who's watched the show, "Baby Reindeer," I mean, obviously, it was extremely popular. Bit contentious because it is about a relentless 
 
 stalker, but that show, of course, was made famous because of the massive lawsuit that Netflix ended up being hit with. But it's an amazing story for 
 
 him because he talked about what his life was like just 10 years ago.
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And that's one of my favorite parts about award shows. I've been covering these 
 
 award shows for years.
 
And when you see these actors and writers and directors get on stage and share these really powerful messages to keep going and keep believing in 
 
 yourself, and obviously show business is one of the toughest industries to break into. You're faced with a ton of rejection and you hear no all the 
 
 time.
 
So Richard Gadd's acceptance speech last night was really one of those powerful moments, of course, capping off a huge night and really a huge 
 
 year for that Netflix series, "Baby Reindeer," which swept all of the major awards in the limited and anthology categories.
 
Now, if we look at some of the other big winners that you discussed up top here, "Shogun," really the big winner of the night, 18 awards, which is 
 
 just extraordinary and actually breaking the record for the most wins for any series for a single season.
 <br>[12:55:03]
 
Then "The Bear" coming in next with 11 wins, beating its own record last time at the Emmys that won 10 awards, winning three awards in the acting 
 
 categories. But shockingly falling short in the best comedy series category.
 
Now, of course, we don't have to feel bad for the creative team behind "The Bear." They're doing just fine. And as I said, they won 11 awards.
 
But that really was the huge surprise of the night when "Hacks" won at the very end. I'm telling you, in that room, everybody gasped. They couldn't 
 
 believe it because it was just expected and predicted that "The Bear" was going to win, but everyone very excited in that room to see "Hacks" win. 
 
 And, of course, that coming after Jean Smart won for Best Comedic Actress.
 
Now, I see this clip that you're playing now, Catherine O'Hara. She was the one who introduced the final award when "Hacks" won.
 
And this was also a great moment. If you watch "Schitt's Creek," everybody was so excited that there was this reunion on stage because Eugene and Dan 
 
 Levy, father and son duo, they hosted last night, and they brought their whole TV family, including Catherine O'Hara back to that stage as well.
 
ASHER: And Jean Smart said, I really love this because I don't get enough attention. She was hilarious.
 
Elizabeth Wagmeister, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much.
 
WAGMEISTER: Thank you.
 
GOLODRYGA: That does it for this hour of ONE WORLD. Thanks so much for watching. I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
ASHER: I'm Zain Asher. "AMANPOUR" is up next.
