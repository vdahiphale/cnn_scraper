<br>[06:30:00] 
 
KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, to move the focus generally to your opponent. You're trying to define your opponent. I mean I don't see a world where she's going to sit back and sort of let Trump define her time in the White House and just kind of say, you know, OK, but here's - you know, but there's - there's - we - we know what you're going to do. We - you also had four years in office. We saw what that looked like. 
 
I just don't think there's a clean shot for Trump on this for that reason. And I also think you saw her last night really lean into this new way forward. I mean she clearly wants to make the - the pivot. And I think that the country wants that too. I mean that's the other thing. 
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes.
 
BEDINGFIELD: So, the last thing I'll say, that - that's what the country wants. I mean part of a successful campaign is the message meeting the moment, is meeting where the country wants to be. The country wants to see changed. She's embracing that. Trump doesn't represent change anymore. He does not.
 
JENNINGS: If you - if you - if you made it a comparative though, would you take this campaign framing? If you were Trump or if you were Harris, who would you rather be? If the people walk into the voting booth and say, who gave me better results, Trump or Biden and Harris, would you take that right now? Would you take that bet?
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The - the problem - the problem is that you're framing - I think you're framing it wrong.
 
ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes.
 
SELLERS: And I think that's your framing it -
 
JENNINGS: Well, they're two - they're two incumbents. People want to -
 
SELLERS: But, but, but - but I - I don't - but that's - that is the fundamental problem with -
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: She's never been president, he has.
 
SELLERS: But that's - that's - that's also not the point. Like, the - like, I -
 
HUNT: OK.
 
SELLERS: Like I -
 
JENNINGS: You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong.
 
SELLERS: You're wrong. And you're wrong. Everybody's screwing this up this morning.
 
HUNT: Did we put this shirt button? (INAUDIBLE)
 
WILLIAMS: I know, I just -
 
SELLERS: First of all, I am making a statement.
 
WILLIAMS: That's a lie (ph). That's a lie (ph).
 
JENNINGS: Hang on. Hang on. Let me - let me get my Bakari going. Here we go, Bakari.
 
HUNT: Oh, my God, Scott. Thank God you could barely see that on camera.
 
JENNINGS: Well, listen - listen -
 
SELLERS: Can I talk about - can I talk about the fact that this race is not about what you did for me three and a half years ago, right? Like - like I think that's why everybody's wrong. This race is not about what you did for me -
 
JENNINGS: Now, I can't stop looking at him.
 
WILLIAMS: Can I make a - can I make an actual point here, and not about your shirt (INAUDIBLE).
 
BEDINGFIELD: This is not what I signed up for.
 
Yes, Elliot, please speak to substance.
 
HUNT: Yes, Elliot has the floor. Go. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: This is not what I signed up for.
 
WILLIAMS: OK, back to focus - focus on - no, no, and I - no, but to all of this, I do think the fact that Democrats pivoted a little bit away from Donald Trump is an existential threat to democracy and toward Donald Trump is not a serious person. That was a thread running through. And the - and the mockery of him and mockery of the behavior and the 56 tweets as the - as the vice president was speaking, suggests that this is a contrast between in serious people and sort of an unserious clown that - which (INAUDIBLE) -
 
SELLERS: But also - but also - also the -
 
HUNT: And it gets under his skin as well. SELLERS: But the - but the election is not about what - and this is where - this is where I was saying Scott was wrong, and this is where I'm saying that a lot of people frame this wrong.
 
The election is not about the four years when Donald Trump was president. The election is not about the last three-and-a-half years that they - they're - it's just not. I mean the election is about the next four years. And that is what - that's what Democrats are betting on because - and - and one of the - one of the problems with Donald Trump and being a prisoner of being 78-years-old is he has a fundamentally - a fundamental inability to tell me what the future will look like under him. He has not articulated a message about four more years for Donald Trump. He -
 
JENNINGS: Sure - sure he has.
 
SELLERS: No, he hasn't.
 
JENNINGS: Lower inflation, lower taxes, secure border, better economy.
 
SELLERS: No, but he is -
 
WILLIAMS: And a lot of -
 
HUNT: And a lot of Donald Trump.
 
WILLIAMS: Yes, and a lot of - and a lot of circus -
 
JENNINGS: Ok, but what - how many - how many - but how many people who have suffered, working class who have suffered under inflation would say, I'll take all of the other ancillary stuff if you'll just give me back a little bit of peace of mind about my own economic situation?
 
WILLIAMS: I think (INAUDIBLE) pass the test. 
 
HUNT: Well, that's kind of the fundamental question, right? The people that got sick of Donald Trump in 2020 were like, you know, I like the policies, but I can't handle the man, and they went and they voted for Biden or they stayed home. I mean, isn't that the ballgame here?
 
JENNINGS: Yes, but I think people have looked back over the whole thing and said, my God, we traded in somebody who gave us a good economy for somebody who claimed to be the adults in the room, and they never acted like adult sone time.
 
SELLERS: But every - but they -
 
BEDINGFIELD: But also, the economy is moving in the right direction too. So, no, you can't - like I - you can't suggest that, you know, people are like walking outside to, you know, stagflation and red lines. 
 
SELLERS: But every - but - but the country's -
 
BEDINGFIELD: I mean the economy is moving in the right direction, and that's going to undermine your argument. SELLERS: But the country's - the country's rejected this. In '18, in '20, in '22. Like, the country has outwardly rejected everything Donald Trump represents.
 
BEDINGFIELD: (INAUDIBLE).
 
SELLERS: I mean, it's OK if you wanted to put it on rinse and repeat. That's what - that's what the Republican Party is now, it's a rinse and repeat party. Nobody wants to buy the same thing that was cool in 2016. I mean, Donald Trump is Tommy Hilfiger. Don't nobody wear that no more. 
 
WILLIAMS: Wow. Oh, deep cut.
 
JENNINGS: Man.
 
WILLIAMS: Yes.
 
HUNT: Wow.
 
JENNINGS: I hope - I hope they're not an advertiser.
 
SELLERS: No, I'm so sorry. Let's -
 
JENNINGS: Geez, Bakari.
 
SELLERS: (INAUDIBLE).
 
If Bakari's not here in the next segment, it's because -
 
JENNINGS: Yes. Take it out of your salary.
 
HUNT: Scott, I mean, the - the reality though, I mean to - to Bakari's point -
 
JENNINGS: Yes. 
 
HUNT: This does seem to me to be the biggest difference between the convention that we were - we saw this week, because Harris was at the top of the ticket, compared to what we would have seen with Joe Biden. The flip on who is the oldest, most tired, however you want to put it, the - the - the older version of whatever shtick (ph) any candidate is bringing to the table, right now it's Donald Trump, and that is a significant change.
 <br>[06:35:01]
 
JENNINGS: Yes, it - it is a change. But the question they're going to be posing as this. The last time the Biden-Harris team showed up and told you the adults are now back in the room, everything they did from that point forward proved that they were not. Whether it was on Afghanistan, whether it was on the economy, whether it was on the border, they told you the competent, moderate, dealmaking adults were back, just like she's arguing right now, and it was a total lie. They could not deliver on it. And when I was in office, yes, maybe you don't like some of the stuff
 
 I say, but you had money in your pocket, the border was secure, America was respected around the world. That's the frame if he can stick to it.
 
HUNT: If - if - big if.
 
WILLIAMS: Well, yes.
 
BEDINGFIELD: I mean if - if he can stick to it. 
 
HUNT: If.
 
BEDINGFIELD: If he can stick to it. But also, like -
 
HUNT: All right.
 
WILLIAMS: You know, it's like the - I - like it would be great if I were 5'10" also, but, unfortunately, you know, there's -
 
HUNT: We have to press pause on this conversation. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: It would be great.
 
HUNT: Could everybody please button their shirts for me? OK. It's 6:35 on the East Coast.
 
All right, coming up on CNN THIS MORNING, convention vibes. Michael Smerconish is here to tell us who won the all-important five (ph) battle now that both conventions are in the books.
 
Plus, it's been just over a month since Trump gave his acceptance speech at the RNC. We're going to take a look back at the differences about how that played out at his opponent's big night.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:40:32]
 
HUNT: Even though they were just one month apart, the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention were held in political contexts worlds apart it seemed. The result, two starkly different - seems to be the word of the election - vibes that were perhaps nowhere more evident during the convention's respective roll calls.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I'd like to welcome you all to the Democratic National Convention roll call.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let us commence with the roll - with a call of the roll of the states.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) THC (ph) turn out for what (ph).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Iowa, 40 delegates.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You - you've got to do it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am proud to cast our 39 votes for the first black woman president, Kamala Harris.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: New Mexico casts all 22 votes for the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: OK, that said quite a bit.
 
Joining me now, CNN political commentator Michael Smerconish. He's also the host of CNN's "SMERCONISH." 
 
Michael, always wonderful to have you. Thank you so much for being here. 
 
I feel like they - they did a great job showing - I mean that kind of said it all. But I know you have some big picture thoughts about the Democratic National Convention, what you saw, what it's going to mean for the race going forward.
 
MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I've always loved - hello, Kasie. 
 
I have always loved the roll call. And I'm dating myself. I mean, when it came to Kansas, and it was Kansas carry on wayward son, I'm like, wow, this speaks to me. 
 
Here's my big picture observation.
 
HUNT: OK, I love that song. I'm kind of an old soul. Go ahead.
 
SMERCONISH: Yes, I love that song. It brings back eighth grade memories.
 
The Democrats are no longer ceding the flag. I have often commented that there's never been a response to Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the USA." And, by the way, I love that song. It gives me goosebumps. But Arlo Guthrie, "This Land is Your Land," which has usually been the Democratic response, has never worked. And what most stood out to me about the convention, big picture this week, because, Kasie, I've been a viewer, I've been afar, you're there in the thick of it, is the bid for patriotism from Beyonce's "Freedom" to the chants of "USA, USA," to the internment of love of country. These are the sort of things that normally come with Republican convention. So much so that I have done radio segment where I've asked listeners, if you see an American flag outside of a home, do you presuppose you know the politics of the people? And many have said, yes.
 
Like, I get it, if it's a flag on the back of an F-150 and it's alongside some kind of reference to Brandon, it's probably a Trump supporter. But this convention to me said the Democrats are no longer going to cede the flag to the Republicans, and they want to wrap themselves, cloak themselves in patriotism. And I loved seeing it because no one side ought to own the flag and patriotism.
 
HUNT: For sure, Michael. And, I mean, look what do you think that means and what do you think it says about how Kamala Harris wants to present herself to America because this was her night. I mean, she was able to choreograph every single moment of what went on here, basically, or at least try. And that's what they decided to go with.
 
SMERCONISH: Yes, and I thought she - I have to give her props. I thought that she spoke last night with poise and with conviction. I took note of the fact that she - she had a message she wanted to deliver about the border. She had a message that she wanted to deliver about Israel and Gaza. 
 
Now, she's got to sustain this moment when she's questioned, because it still rankles me the idea that on the 8th of August she was asked when she'd make herself available for an interview, and she said, I think I'm going to do that by the end of the month. By the end of the month. It was the 8th of - of - I said October, of August when she said it. So, that is the next stage. And I know it's causing tremendous frustration on the part of former President Trump. He's like bursting at the seams, watching her ascendance at the time that she's not being questioned in detail on these issues. 
 <br>[06:45:00]
 
If she's not questioned in detail on these issues before, you know, the debate, he's going to be like ready to pop. So, that's what I want to see next.
 
HUNT: Yes, very interesting.
 
Michael, were going to expand this conversation out to include our panel. And one of the things that I think came up, especially right in the immediate aftermath of the - of Harris' speech was the contrast between her and Donald Trump and their speeches. 
 
I wanted to start by playing a little bit of what we heard from Donald Trump when he accepted his nomination. Let's watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Because they're emptying out their insane asylums and terrorists are coming in at numbers that we've never seen before. Bad things are going to happen.
 
But we've become a dumping ground for the rest of the world, which is laughing at us. They think we're stupid. 
 
Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: I mean the darkness on display there, Scott Jennings, a very stark contrast to what we saw from Harris last night. JENNINGS: Well, I mean, Trumps going to continue to make an argument
 
 that he did have everything under control and that he turned it over to people who have let everything spiral out of control. She's obviously going to counter message that. That's part of the - but - but it's not just going to be about foreign policy or immigration. It's going to be right on the economy. And with Michael on here, I would just say, for Pennsylvania, which is the pivotal state and the campaign, which of those issues is going to be the most important? I would argue it will be the economic chaos that he - that he says they've created the most, don't you think?
 
HUNT: Michael, that's to you? 
 
SMERCONISH: So, the question is one of, is the race going to be about personality. If it is, he loses. Or is it going to be about policy? And if it is, I think he probably wins because when you look at the data and you asked people whether they appreciate more the - the - I'll say the Biden-Harris record or the Trump record, they look back favorably on the Trump years. 
 
But, you know, he's got to rein in his worst instincts. He deviates too much from that script when he looks at the audience and thinks they're getting bored. Let's not forget, the Republicans had a great convention. I thought they were note perfect. And so too the Democrats. So, it's still up in the air. It's still margin of error. Who the heck knows the next twist in this road. 
 
SELLERS: I've never seen an election won on yesterday, ever. Every election - and I'm only 39. I'll be 40 in a couple of weeks. Kasie made me button my shirt up. So, here - here I am.
 
HUNT: Sorry.
 
SMERCONISH: Oh, you did button it.
 
HUNT: Fifteen seconds, Bakari. It looks great.
 
SELLERS: Here - here I am. But - whatever.
 
HUNT: I don't know. It fits a little high. This one - anyway.
 
SELLERS: Anyway. But what I - what I will say is that, I just think people are framing it wrong. If they If they want to look back at the four years of Donald Trump or look back at the last three-and-a-half years. Donald Trump is a prisoner of being 78 years old, and he's unable to articulate a vision for the future. 
 
HUNT: All right, we got to leave it there, unfortunately.
 
Michael Smerconish, always grateful to have you. Thank you so much for being here.
 
SMERCONISH: Thank you.
 
Coming up next here on CNN THIS MORNING, four days full of big names, standout moments at the Democratic National Convention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT": I don't know about y'all, but - but - but after a week of live shows, watching all this energy and joy and purpose tonight, I feel like I just fell out of a coconut tree.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: We're going to hit rewind and take you back through some of the moments that stood out the most from the DNC.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:53:03]
 
HUNT: With the Democratic National Convention now concluded and the race for the White House beginning in earnest, we wanted to take a look back at a week that was filled with big names and some significant moments.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me know in my heart, when my days are through, America - American, I gave my best to you.
 
BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The only personal vanity I want to assert is I'm still younger than Donald Trump. 
 
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions.
 
CROWD: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
 
MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY: Who's going to tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs?
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This weird obsession with crowd sizes. It - it - 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: THC (ph), turn out for what (ph).
 
OPRAH WINFREY, MEDIA MOGUL: Together let's all choose Kamala Harris.
 
DOUG EMHOFF, SECOND GENTLEMEN: As soon as our kids started calling her Mamala, I knew we'd be OK. 
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hope, Gus and Gwen, you are my entire world. And I love you. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America.
 
And together let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[06:55:07]
 
HUNT: So, that is what Democrats wanted to tell America this week. We have just over 70 days left in this campaign.
 
Very quickly, we're running out of time here, who has the football? Who has the edge heading into this sprint, Kate, Trump or Harris?
 
BEDINGFIELD: Hard to argue that Democrats don't have the momentum coming out of this last month, frankly, and this week. Now then the question becomes, how do you translate that momentum? Momentum has to actually get you to getting votes in the swing states on Election Day. So, it's going to be an intense couple months. 
 
HUNT: Harris or Trump?
 
SELLERS: No, we're still underdogs. But while we're in here, I'm still waiting on - I mean I think Beyonce and Taylor Swift should be running -
 
WLLLIAMS: No, that's happening. It's coming.
 
SELLERS: They're coming. They're joining us at any moment. We're going to keep that -
 
HUNT: We're just going to sit here and keep waiting. 
 
SELLERS: At 5 a.m., we're just going to keep waiting.
 
WILLIAMS: I know.
 
SELLERS: We still have them in the -
 
WILLIAMS: And the joke will be on all them for leaving.
 
SELLERS: For leaving.
 
BEDINGFIELD: I have it on good authority - I have it on good authority, any minute. Any minute.
 
WILLIAMS: There was an energy in that room that Joe Biden could not have produced. Right now Democrats have momentum. But to Bakari's point, it's just hard to see. you know, they're underdogs.
 
HUNT: Who's got the football?
 
JENNINGS: I'm still think - I'm still thinking about Pennsylvania. I think, obviously, Democrats are in a better spot, but I still think Trump is in a slightly better position in Pennsylvania. And the candidate that wins it is most likely going to be he the president. 
 
HUNT: I don't disagree with that, that - what you have to say about Pennsylvania. That is for sure.
 
All right, guys, thank you so much for the early, early morning after a long, long week. Really appreciate it. 
 
Thanks to all of you for joining us as well. I'm Kasie Hunt. Don't go anywhere. "CNN NEWS CENTRAL" is going to be next right here from Chicago.
