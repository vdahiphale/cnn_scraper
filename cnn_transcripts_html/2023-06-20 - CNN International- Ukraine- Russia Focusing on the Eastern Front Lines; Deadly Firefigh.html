BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Max Foster. If you just joining us, let me bring you up to date with the top stories. 
 
Search and rescue efforts are underway for a missing submersible that was taking passengers to the Titanic. The company that owns the sub lost contact with the vessel an hour and 45 minutes into the dissent on Sunday. 
 
More than 25 million people across the southern U.S. are under a severe weather threat right now. Some areas have already been devastated by tornadoes over the last few days. 
 
NOBILO: U.S. Secretary of State is now here in London after wrapping up his high stakes trip to Beijing. Antony Blinken is set to attend a Ukraine recovery conference to help mobilize international support for the war-torn country. He also plans to meet with his counterparts from the U.K., Ukraine, and other partners and allies. 
 
FOSTER: Ukrainian officials say Russia launched a massive air assault on the capital Kyiv overnight, firing waves of drones from all different directions. 
 
NOBILO: Those officials say that air defenses were able to intercept most of those attacks, but that Moscow targeted other cities across the country, from Lviv in the west to Zaporizhzhia in the east. Meanwhile -- 
 
FOSTER: Ukraine says Russia's major battlefield focus right now is in the east, with dozens of combat engagements on Monday alone. 
 
NOBILO: Ukrainian military officials say Russia is throwing everything at them, infantry units, air units, assault units made up of Russian convicts. But despite the pressure, Ukraine's president is painting a hopeful picture.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): In some sectors, our forces are moving forward. In others, they are defending positions or resisting assault in intensified attacks from the occupiers. We have no lost positions, only liberated ones, they only have losses.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: Well, further south, battles are very hard going. One Ukraine fighter says Russians are digging in and are unleashing massive firepower from all directions. They've also set up dense minefields along those front lines -- you see there. 
 
Let's talk about all of this with Salma Abdelaziz and Nic Robinson. Nic, let's start with, you. Because of Blinken's trip to Europe -- we just had the big NATO summit, didn't we, of the defense ministers. Is it going to be development of that do you think? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, there's the Ukraine Recovery Conference taking place in London -- begins later today, and tomorrow is the main day. And I think that will be the big focus for Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and James Cleverly, who is the British foreign secretary, he's meeting with today. It's World Refugee Day today, so a meeting about that. They have a press conference earlier in the day. 
 
But after that, that day takes a little bit more of a Ukraine turn. Secretary Blinken meets with Ukrainian foreign minister, and he gets a well reception with King Charles. 
 
But tomorrow is about trying to energize the business community, not just governments, because we know governments have been giving billions and billions of dollars of military support, humanitarian support, and essentially paying the Ukrainian governments bills. But looking ahead, there's going to be a need to rebuild, recover Ukraine. And the estimate is that that cannot be left to governments alone. That needs business and civil society input. So, that's what tomorrow's conference will be about. 
 
And just as sort of a headline number of how much money is going to be required to do this, last year, after just a few months of war, Ukraine has estimated the total bill for recovery was going to be $100 billion. You can imagine what it's going to be like.
 
FOSTER: Extraordinary numbers. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
NOBILO: And they need to keep that support. I don't know if either of you had seen them, but when I was driving into London the other day, I saw a large Ukrainian flag, an advertisement I suppose from the Ukrainian government, saying thank you Britain for your support. 
 
ROBERTSON: And it's why they felt in Ukraine. I mean, I was in Ukraine a month ago, and when you're on the front line, whether it's the front-line soldier or the commanders, the colonels and such that you meet behind the lines, they all say thank you to the U.K. They recognize -- and I think this is part of secretary Blinken's mission here as well, is to continue to strengthen the partnership and the big role that the U.K. is paying to support Ukraine. And you see Ukrainian flags in the oddest of places around the U.K., on small farms, gas stations. And I think that is witnesses to the political support that has been engendered by the leaders of Ukraine's allies, the U.K. and France and Germany, you know, the Baltics, the United States. 
 
But that is at stake also, that domestic political support. The U.K. goes into an election next, so does the United States. These leaders' policies on Ukraine need to be seen to be effective. They're talking about a long fight. And this is, you know, going to be a difficult message if Ukraine doesn't take territory, big territory on the battlefield. So I think you're absolutely right, there is a lot at stake politically here as well. 
 
NOBILO: And on that note, Salma is joining us from London to discuss that. So, Salma, in order to retain that support and garner more momentum in this counteroffensive, Ukraine needs tangible successes and gains, which we can demonstrate to the international community, which supports it. What is the latest? 
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely billions of dollars have been poured in by NATO. There is an expectation that that will be reciprocated with a major breakthrough on the ground. We're several weeks into this offensive, and yes, we've seen very modest gains, Ukraine claiming that's been able to retake territory, particularly south of Zaporizhzhia. That is been able to push into the front lines of Bakhmut. But again, no major breakthrough. 
 
We know from Ukrainian officials that for Russian forces, the focus remains on the eastern front lines. That's the Bakhmut region. But Ukrainian officials also say that Moscow's forces are reallocating towards the south, towards that Zaporizhzhia access where Ukraine seems to be extremely focused on an attempt to punch through Russian defenses and potentially sever or disrupt that land bridge that connects Crimea to the rest of those Russian occupied territories. 
 
But they are absolutely facing stiff resistance from Moscow's forces. There are land mines laid. There are anti-tank equipment in the ground. There are more soldiers arriving, according to Ukrainian officials. This is going to be a major challenge of course. 
 
NOBILO: Salma Abdelaziz, and Nic Robertson, thank you both so much. 
 
A new trial has begun for jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. This time on so-called extremism charges, which he and his supporters say are absurd and politically motivated. Navalny appeared in court Monday at a penal colony east of Moscow. Journalists were not allowed inside the courtroom. Germany's foreign office says it's a frightening example of what Kremlin critic's face when they speak out. 
 
FOSTER: But even behind bars facing health problems and new charges, Navalny is still fighting for change in Russia. 
 
On Monday, he tweeted: I want to call everyone to action to use this day to announce our new very important project. We will conduct an election campaign against the war and against Putin, a long, stubborn, exhausting but fundamentally important campaign were we'll turn people against the war. 
 
Chinese tech giant Alibaba is shaking up its corporate leadership. The company announced Joseph Tsai will become the new chairman and Eddie Wu will take over its chief executive officer. 
 
NOBILO: Both men are cofounders of the company. This is the second leadership chain since Jack Ma stepped away in 2019. Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce company with more than 900 million active users annually. It also operates the country's biggest cloud computing and digital payment platforms. 
 
As the fighting rages in Sudan, the head of the U.N. is calling for more international aid to help the war-torn country. The U.N. says about $3 billion is needed this year for humanitarian relief, both inside Sudan and for the refugees fleeing the country. But only a fraction of that has been pledged so far.

ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: The scale and speed of Sudan's descending to death and destruction is unprecedented. Without strong international support, Sudan could quickly become lockers of lawlessness, radiating insecurity across the region.

 <br>[04:40:00]
 
FOSTER: The secretary-general also said he was concerned by the ethnic violence in Darfur, and reports of gender-based and sexual violence. Thousands of people been killed and about 2 million have been forced from their homes since the fighting started in April. 
 
As Nic mentioned, today is World Refugee Day, a time to honor those who've been forced to flee their homes. The United Nations says their plight must be recognized now more than ever, as the number of displaced people has reached a new record. But estimates that one and 35 million people crossed international borders last year. 
 
NOBILO: More than 62 million people are internally displaced, while about 5.4 million people are asylum seekers, and another 5 million are concerned people in need of international protection. 
 
An extraordinary violent confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians leaves multiple people dead and almost 100 wounded. Coming up, we'll tell you what set off an 11-hour firefight. 
 
NOBILO: Plus, why a new study warns against the common practice of taking a daily aspirin for older adults. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: A massive fire fight between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants erupted money in the West Bank, leaving at least six Palestinians dead and dozens wounded. 
 
NOBILO: It happened -- 
 
It happened as Israeli forces arrested two suspects in the city of Jenin. Here, an IED explodes under in Israeli truck, wounding some of the eight Israeli troops hurt in the battle. Israel open battle with attack helicopters to provide cover, as the IDF evacuated its wounded soldiers. The first time it had done that since the early 2000s.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
FOSTER: The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 90 Palestinians were wounded in the fighting that went on for some 11 hours. At least five Israeli vehicles were damaged. You can hear the rattle of gunfire, even as they move out of the city. And as a Palestinian ambulance siren blaring raced away in the other direction. 
 
Journalist Elliott Gotkine has been following this major confrontation for us from Jerusalem. Elliott, walk us through what triggered this inclusion from the Israeli and also what the regional and international reaction has been so far. 
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Bianca, it was set to be an Israeli encourage into Jenin like many of the others that we've seen over the past few months. They went in there to arrest a militant from Hamas, and another from the Islamic Jihad. Now they always are prepared and expecting to come under some sort of fire, perhaps to meet some kind of resistance. But I think it's the scale of the battle that erupted on Monday morning. And as you, say it went on for some 11 hours, that took certainly these Israeli Security Forces by surprise. As well as, as you noted, this improvised explosive device, which the IDF described as pretty advanced. 
 
And as a result of that IED, which went off and damaged those armored vehicles from the IDF, and then the Israeli soldiers, eight of them in total were injured, a number of them in that explosion itself, they got bogged down in Jenin and had a call for support from an Apache helicopter. Something that has not happened in the West Bank in some two decades. 
 
And the result of all of this is that six Palestinians who are left dead, three of them have been claimed by the Jenin Brigade, which is a militant group associated with Islamic Jihad. Scores were injured, and as I say, eight Israeli soldiers injured as well. 
 
Some of them on Monday afternoon receiving a visit from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who reiterated Israel's determination to go into the West Bank to arrest militants that it deems to be a threat to Israel, and also to show his support for Israel security forces. And also, I think given the political backdrop and the pressure he's under, under his government -- over his government's judicial overhaul plans to show that he is very much at the wheel. He is at control of what is going on at the heart of the Israeli government. 
 
Now we have heard from the U.S. State Department, a spokesperson calling for a de-escalation, saying that we call on both sides to refrain from actions that escalate tensions. But I think given what has happened on Monday, Israel will perhaps be -- will not before forgoing these kinds of raids to arrest militants, but it will perhaps be reassessing what in needs to do in the event that there are more of these IEDs, and perhaps the ramifications that this kind of explosive could have for other operations or other parts of the Israeli security apparatus -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: And Elliott, the Palestinian Authority as referred to this as a dangerous escalation. What are people in the West Bank bracing for at this point? 
 
GOTKINE: I think probably more of the same, Bianca. I mean, yes, Israel will be looking very carefully into perhaps where this IED came from, where it was made, and perhaps we will see some actions in that regard. But I think as we've seen over the past few months, not just under this government, but under the previous government, that these raids, which are ever more common now in daytime as well, we'll continue as Israel seeks to either arrest people that are wanted for actions that they've carried out, for attacks that have been carried out against Israelis either in the West Bank or inside Israel proper. So, I don't think anyone really expects anything to change in that respect. And Israel has said it will carry on with these raids as when it deems necessary -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Elliott Gotkine for us in Jerusalem, thank you very much. 
 
FOSTER: British lawmakers have overwhelmingly voted to uphold a report claiming former Prime Minister Johnson lied to Parliament multiple times over the "Partygate" scandal. The report from the House of Commons committee was Johnson knowingly misled lawmakers over breaches of his own COVID lockdown rules, when parties were thrown at Downing Street during the pandemic.
 
Many Conservatives abstained or weren't present for the vote, including many of Johnson's allies. Johnson resigned as an MP earlier this month, so the vote is mostly a symbolic rebuke. 
 
FOSTER: Still ahead, Americas mark Juneteenth, a new federal holiday. We'll have details on a special celebration involving the vice president and several special famous musicians. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: Just into CNN, a Korean man attempted to open a plane door midair on a flight from the Philippines to South Korea. 
 
FOSTER: Again.
 
NOBILO: Honestly, I just can't. I'm already a very nervous flier. I'm going to control all my aircraft flyer now to report.
 
Officials from Jeju Air say that the 19-year-old began to act strangely an hour into the flight, and flight attendants moved him to the front row of the plane, close to the exit door, so they could monitor him. FOSTER: That's when the man ran towards the door and attempted to open
 
 it. Fortunately, the door stayed closed. No one was hurt and the man was handed over to the police after the flight landed. 
 
The incident comes barely a month after a positive actually managed to open a plane door on a Korean carrier, which was bad enough, now they're trying to do it again. I wonder -- well, we'll find out if they're linked in any way. 
 
Now, the NBA draft is just two days away. And the expected number one pick has arrived in the U.S. Victor Wembanyama landed at Newark International Airport outside New York on Monday. The 19-year-old French phenom signed autographs for fans, as you can see. The San Antonio Spurs have the first pick in the draft, and no one on the planet thinks still pick anyone else. 
 
Draymond Green has been a key part of the last four Golden State Warriors teams that won the NBA championship, but he may soon be wearing a different uniform. Green declined his $27 million play option for next season, making him an unrestricted free agent. Green's agent says that he'll continue talking to the Warriors and explore all options. 
 
NOBILO: And now to some stories in the spotlight this hour. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
A new study finds that a daily aspirin may actually do more harm than good for some adults. Researchers say that those over 65 -- pay attention, Max -- who have taken an aspirin every day is at high risk for anemia. 
 
FOSTER: So rude and false and inaccurate reporting. More than 40 percent of adults aged 60 and over in the U.S. take a daily aspirin to prevent blood clots linked to strokes and heart attacks. But recent studies show that aspirin carries an increased risk of major bleeding that most likely outweighs any benefit in preventing initial heart attacks or strokes. I mean, it has been a big trend in Europe to take aspirin. 
 
NOBILO: And also, people have known for a long time if they're taking aspirin to prevent blood clots, that there is also that downside if they're having surgery or  
 
FOSTER: Yes. Across the U.S. people have been marking Juneteenth, the new federal holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the country. CNN organized a free concert in Los Angeles to mark the historic day. 
 
NOBILO: Speaking at the event, Vice President Kamala Harris said that the holiday represents America's ongoing fight to secure freedom for all. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: America is a promise, a promise of freedom, liberty, and justice. The story of Juneteenth as we celebrate it, is the story of our ongoing fight to realize America's promise. Not for some, but for all.

NOBILO: A NASA mission to Jupiter has captured images of green lightning near the planet's north pole. You can see it here, near the center of your screen. It was taken in 2020 by the Juno spacecraft on a close fly by of the planet. That is pretty cool. 
 
FOSTER: That is actually quite interesting. In the coming months, Juno will pass over Jupiter's night side, giving scientists more opportunities to see these lightning strikes in action. 
 
NOBILO: Do you know how many earth years to Jupiter? 
 
FOSTER: 265,000.
 
NOBILO: About 12. 
 
FOSTER: Thanks for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Max Foster. 
 
NOBILO: And I'm Bianca Nobilo. "EARLY START" is up next, right here, on CNN.
