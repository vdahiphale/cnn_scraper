COY WIRE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, sunshine. Hope you had an awesome weekend, pump to be right here with you. There`s no mentum like 
 
 momentum. So let`s get our energy up, up, up, and start this week off strong. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start today with an update on 
 
 the latest news on the situation in Israel and Gaza. Conditions in Gaza have deteriorated. On Friday, Israel`s military dropped leaflets on Gaza`s 
 
 largest city urging, roughly 1 million residents to move south for their own safety. Many people there have since been trying to flee ahead of an 
 
 expected ground invasion, but over the weekend, that`s proven to be exceedingly difficult. 
 
We`ll hear more now about the current situation. And I do want to warn you that some of the material we`re about to see might be tough to watch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dozens of Palestinians dig through rubble, desperately searching for survivors in the aftermath of an airstrike. More than half of 
 
 Gaza`s 2 million residents who live in the Northern section of the Strip were told to evacuate, ahead of an anticipated Israeli ground assault on 
 
 Hamas. But leaving is also deadly. An apparent explosion Friday along a main evacuation route killed a number of people, including children. The 
 
 IDF says Hamas was responsible.
 
LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  It appears that they have -- they`ve physically prevented people from moving from 
 
 north to south. And also it appears that they have booby-traps, some of the roads.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Even emergency crews are not safe from the constant barrage. Hospitals in the area already struggling are now overwhelmed.
 
AVRIL BENOIT, EXEC. DIRECTOR, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS:  We considered it a humanitarian chronic emergency over many, many years, and now it`s a 
 
 complete catastrophe.
 
RICK BRENNAN, REGIONAL EMERGENCY DIRECTOR, WORLD HEALTH ORG.:  There are major gaps in food, water, shelter, sanitation. People now are being forced 
 
 into these unsanitary overcrowded settings, risks of disease outbreaks.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lack of electricity, along with food and water shortages in both the Northern and Southern parts of Gaza are becoming very 
 
 real concerns.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I am searching here under the rubble for the remains of lentils and rice.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Many who have taken refuge in a U.N.-run school, sleep on the ground, and try to comfort their families.
 
NAEEM ISMAE, DISPLACED GAZA RESIDENT (through translator):  It`s a tragedy. There`s no water, no electricity. And I have no money. I`m standing here 
 
 and hungry, wondering what`s left.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Palestinians who hold foreign passports are also in dire straits. The only remaining route out of Gaza is through Egypt. 
 
 Egypt`s Foreign Minister says the crossing is open, but the roads are so damaged. They are impassable even for humanitarian aid.

WIRE:  Up next, the folks in charge of the shipping industry have promised to cut down on their earth warming emissions and go carbon neutral by the 
 
 year 2050. Now, too much CO2 in the atmosphere is bad in then it can supercharge the year`s natural greenhouse effect warming the planet. 
 
So going carbon neutral means the shipping industry plans to take steps, to remove the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to what 
 
 it`s emitted through their activities of their business. To do this, they`re looking at using cleaner fuels like electric and wind power as 
 
 opposed to burning fossil fuels. So many of the things we use in our daily lives are shipped across the ocean.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STUART NEIL, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY AND COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF SHIPPING:  We`ve gone from rowing to sail, to sail, to steam, steam, to 
 
 the oil sector. And now we`re moving to a new transition.
 
INGRID IRIGOYEN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ZERO EMISSION MARITIME BUYERS ALLIANCE:  Bells and whistles that can be put on ships. We also now have wind assist 
 
 technology. Our top priority right now must be the transition to the new zero emission fuels and technologies. 
 
If you look around your home, the clothes that you`re wearing, the food that you put on the table, almost all of that has come across the ocean. 
 
 And at any given time, there is many as 50,000 large cargo vessels traversing the high seas. 
 
In terms of the global pie, as we call it, for carbon emissions, maritime is only responsible for about 3%, which sounds like a small number, but 
 
 it`s actually -- if it were a nation, it would be equivalent to a major G-7 economy like Japan or Germany. And unfortunately, under business as usual, 
 
 those emissions are predicted to at least double by 2050.
 
Decarbonizing the shipping sector can have great benefits beyond just reducing carbon emissions, reductions in local air pollution, lots of new 
 
 jobs, producing these new fuels. We also have the potential to address other issues like ocean noise pollution.
 
NEIL: We need to look urgently at the efficiency savings that can be made, whether it`s wind propulsion, whether it`s bubbles on ships, hole, design, 
 
 even operating procedures. And these have multiple benefits.
 
IRIGOYEN: Of course, these new wind propelled ships are different than the olden days. And there`s a lot of innovation happening in this space. There 
 
 are going to be some challenges because ports may need to make some changes to be able to accept these vessels, as they come into port. It`ll be 
 
 interesting to see about maintenance, making sure that these technologies are safe. But all of these challenges are surmountable. 
 
Even if we did all of that, we would only be able to reduce emissions by about 50%. Shipping has benefited for a very long time from its ability to 
 
 use very inexpensive residual fuels that are essentially what`s left over after oil has been refined for other purposes. So it`s very polluting.
 
NEIL:  The biggest issue is availability of zero emission fuels. There aren`t any on the market at scale. And what there are, are very small 
 
 amounts requiring an awful lot of electricity and the prices astronomical at the moment.
 
IRIGOYEN:  Most commentators predict that in the future will have a mix of different fuels. As we look to the future, some people believe that ammonia 
 
 will actually be a really important, scalable fuel that can actually significantly come down in cost as we gain scale. 
 
If we can address the safety concerns in the meantime, methanol is being deployed already now in very, very small quantities. And then in the longer 
 
 run, we`ll probably see electrification. We`ll see the use of fuel cells and perhaps some approaches that we haven`t even come up with yet.

WIRE:  Ten second trivia. 
 
How old was the asteroid NASA collected material from back in September? 450,000 years old, four and a half million years old, four and a half 
 
 billion years old or four and a half trillion years old?
 
If you said four and a half billion years old with a B, you are correct. That`s how old the asteroid is estimated to be. 
 
Asteroids are on NASA`s mind, big time. NASA`s Falcon heavy rocket, lift it off Friday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a colossal journey 
 
 of 2.2 billion miles or 3.6 billion kilometers. This mission is scheduled to happen over the next six years in the ultimate destination, a meadow 
 
 rich asteroid called 16 Psyche, which orbits around the sun between Mars and Jupiter.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, engine ignition, and -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A NASA spacecraft named Psyche embark on a 2.2-billion- mile journey. That`s 3.6 billion kilometers over the next six years. The destination, a metal rich asteroid named 16 Psyche that orbits the sun 
 
 between Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid whose diameter is roughly the length of Massachusetts will be the first metal space object that humans have ever 
 
 visited. Scientists hypothesized that Psyche was formed when a Rocky planet lost its surface after colliding with other bodies exposing the metallic 
 
 core.
 
One could almost call Psyche`s mission, a journey to the center of the earth. Even though it`s an outer space. Since humans can`t drill a path to 
 
 Earth`s core, asteroids like Psyche may be our only chance to visit something like it.
 
LINDY ELKINS-TANTON, PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF PSYCHE, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY:  So we`re going to learn about when we get to psyche, a 
 
 previously unstudied ingredient that went into making our habitable earth, and that is the metal that is now in the earth`s core and the cores of all 
 
 of the Rocky planets, cores that we can never visit, but cores that we want to learn about.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Psyche spacecraft is expected to reach the asteroid in 2029 and during its six-year journey, it`ll first cruise to 
 
 interplanetary space for several years, then slingshot from Mars into the asteroid belt. Before arriving at Psyche. It`ll then orbit the asteroid for 
 
 more than two years, taking images, mapping and studying the metallic object.

WIRE:  For today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 let`s give him pumpkin to talk about Steve Kueny from Lebanon, Missouri, just set the record for 
 
 longest voyage by a pumpkin vessel by floating in this massive 1200-pound pumpkin, a whopping 39 miles on the Missouri River. The previous record was 
 
 37 and a half miles. 
 
Kueny had to hollow out enough of the pumpkin to be able to squeeze into it in the kneeling position with his legs folded under him. Let the gourd 
 
 times roll. This journey lasted nearly 11 hours. That`s what I`m talking a boat, my gorgeous people.
 
Today`s special shoutout goes to, Mr. Britain`s (ph) Social Studies Class. Snoqualmie Middle School in Washington, rise up. Thanks for subscribing and 
 
 commenting on our YouTube page for your shout out on my pumpkins. I`ll patch you later, people. I`m Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.
