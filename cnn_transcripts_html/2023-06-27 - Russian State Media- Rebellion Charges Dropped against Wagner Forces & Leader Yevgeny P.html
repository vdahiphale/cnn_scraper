(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNNIHOST: This hour a display of unity and order in Moscow security forces gathering at the Kremlin for an address by the Russian 
 
 President Vladimir Putin praising them for their service during the Wagner Group's brief insurrection over the weekend and thanking them for stopping 
 
 in his words, a civil war.
 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump heard on audio tape discussing secret documents that he admits he didn't classify. It is likely a key piece of 
 
 evidence in the classified documents indictment against the Former President.
 
Carlos Ghosn says it's all about the truth. The Former Nissan Chairman talks to me about suing the Japanese Carmaker for a billion dollars. And we 
 
 speak to Actor Tom Cruise about his latest death defying stunt it is a mind blowing scene in his latest film "Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 
 
 1".
 
Well, welcome to our second hour of "Connect the World". Russia's President in major damage control today. Vladimir Putin trying to convey strength and 
 
 control after a brief insurrection that poses big questions about his continued power, and indeed the ongoing war in Ukraine. So tonight we ask 
 
 can Putin seal the cracks in Russian security forces revealed by the Wagner Group's aborted march to Moscow and what will happen to Wagner Chief 
 
 Yevgeny Prigozhin?
 
Well last hour CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Payton Walsh talked with me about the unprecedented challenges facing Vladimir Putin. Now they joined 
 
 me just after the news broke that Yevgeny Prigogine is apparently in Belarus. We started by taking a close look at Putin's comments earlier 
 
 today.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, fascinating. He's sort of painting his own narrative which doesn't gel with reality. He is 
 
 telling those military officers gathered inside the Kremlin that here we are celebrating your unity; it was your unity that saved the people of the 
 
 country.
 
There was a moment of silence for some Russians who were killed, holding off that Prigozhin's troops but these would was just a tiny, singular 
 
 incident on the massive movement of Prigozhin's forces very close to Moscow.
 
The reality on the ground was that the Russian security services did not stop. Putin did not stop Prigozhin's forces. So that calls into question 
 
 what Putin is saying here, we want you to always be cautious in believing Putin what he says. But that also gets to Putin's second point that there 
 
 was unity in the security services here historically, there hasn't been unity in the security services in Russia.
 
And so that leads you to perhaps coming to the conclusion that there wasn't unity in the security services. We know late last night Putin met with 
 
 leaders of his security services. And we heard today from the Head of the National Guard saying that they will now get tanks and heavy armored 
 
 equipment.
 
It gives the impression that they were sort of sat on the sidelines where Prigozhin was taking his tanks towards Moscow, the National Guard saying 
 
 what we can do? We don't have the weapons to do it. So it rather speaks to an opposite narrative being the reality than what Putin is actually saying.
 
Interesting what he said to military -- lower military ranks later on in the day, he painted this very simple picture. The Russian government is 
 
 good. Yevgeny Prigozhin is greedy and bad. It broke down this way. He said that the government's been supporting the Wagner Mercenary Group to the 
 
 tune of about a billion dollars in their fight their heroic fate laying down their lives in support of Russia.
 
That was all good he said. It was good that the Russian government was supporting that Prigozhin reminding everyone that he actually runs an 
 
 organization called Concorde. On the other hand, that organization had had a billion dollars' worth of government contracts.
 
Prigozhin had made a lot of money out of fighting the war not like his heroic fighters who laid down their lives. That was that analogy there but 
 
 it also seems to lay the Kremlin groundwork for further charges financial charges potentially ahead for Prigozhin.
 
We heard the FSB this morning drop charges relating to that insurrection, but it looks like the Kremlin is jacking up something else to keep 
 
 Prigozhin out of the limelight. It does seem financial irregularities perhaps on the horizon. We'll hear from the Kremlin later.
 
ANDERSON: We've been waiting to find out where Prigozhin is? Nick Paton Walsh where is he?
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: We don't actually still know for sure but the President of Belarus Alexander 
 
 Lukashenko said today that he believes he is in Belarus in fact he arrived in Belarus today.
 
Now this is part of a lengthy speech. We heard from Lukashenko the remarkable it seems, intermediary here, and the peace broker that seems to 
 
 have saved Putin on Saturday according to the Kremlin's own narrative.
 
Now, important bit of context here, Lukashenko neighboring Belarus's President. Well, he's a man that Putin often treats with a degree of 
 
 contempt, frankly, as a subordinate. But it appears that during this chaos, he was the man who got through to Prigozhin.
 
And in the speech, he talked about how hard it was for them to get the phone number of Prigozhin. And all the struggles they went through about 
 
 actually getting each other on the phone, and then remarkably, it gives you an insight into the sort of nature of statesmanship in the post-Soviet era.
 
He refers to how Prigozhin used 10 times more swear words than indeed normal vocabulary during their conversation and indeed apologize for that 
 
 in advance. But essentially, their conversation Lukashenko said, he said, listen, Prigozhin if you continue on your march to Moscow, you'll be 
 
 crushed like a bug.
 
And Prigozhin didn't want to turn round but essentially, eventually agreed that his future was better in Belarus, and now it seems that he is indeed 
 
 there. Maybe some Wagner fighters will join him there as well. And interestingly enough to Lukashenko said.
 
Well, his Defense Chiefs had uttered the possibility of how Wagner might be a useful unit to be part of the Belarusian Ministry of Defense that they 
 
 might fundamentally at the end of the day regret inviting the Wagner Group clearly out for his own interest very well equipped, pretty ruthless into 
 
 Belarus.
 
His state security services and law enforcement have taken a real battering suppressing their own people over the past years. That's a separate 
 
 narrative for now. But what does appear to be clear is this remarkable role of Lukashenko.
 
The way he spoke about this conversation unbarred possibly transparently telling people exactly what had occurred. But in this extraordinary role of 
 
 after years since the rebelling against his stolen election, back in 2020, Lukashenko putting himself forwards now as the man who essentially saved 
 
 Putin.
 
ANDERSON: That was Nick Paton Walsh in Ukraine and my colleague, Nic Robertson, in London. Many are skeptical about the official details that we 
 
 are getting from Russia and Belarus about how events transpired over the weekend.
 
That includes our Former Moscow Bureau Chief Nathan Hodge, who says the role of Alexander Lukashenko as negotiator raises more questions than 
 
 answers on cnn.com. He writes, why was Putin who until this weekend was the reliable arbiter of elite disputes in Russia unable to cut that deal?
 
Himself delegating Lukashenko to resolve the crisis, further damages Putin's image as a decisive man of action, the initial details, Nathan 
 
 writes we have do not completely add up. Well, Nathan Hodge joining me now live. Just explain what you mean by this?
 
NATHAN HODGE, FORMER CNN MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF: Well Becky, I mean, just now we're learning more apparently about how all of this went down over the 
 
 weekend with Lukashenko's long and rambling talk.
 
It bluster, I think is the only way to really describe it, where he's sort of puffing up his role in, you know, essentially saving Putin's bacon. 
 
 Again, if this narrative is to be believed, and we don't really have a whole lot of Prigozhin version of events.
 
And we haven't really heard from him even though Lukashenko has said, you know, he's on his ways on the ground. You know, and this is one of the 
 
 things that raise questions, because as Nick Paton Walsh had alluded to before, Lukashenko was always seen some as the junior partner in this 
 
 alliance.
 
And in fact, it was following these mass street demonstrations in 2020 against stolen election by Lukashenko that Putin came in and essentially 
 
 saved the day with his sort of full force backing for Lukashenko including significant financial support.
 
So you know it's somewhat boggles the mind and I'm sure that we're going to be finding out more details about exactly how this happened? But everything 
 
 from you know, not being able to find you know, Prigozhin's telephone number, which as we've just learned Prigozhin was a government contractor. 
 
 What strikes me is all a bit astonishing, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: So, we've got two questions were posing tonight, the second of which is what will happen to the Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin? The first 
 
 is can Putin seal the cracks in Russian security forces revealed by Prigozhin's aborted march to Moscow. Which do you want to tackle first?
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
HODGE: Well, let's start with the sort of the cracks in the edifice, if we want to put it that way, you know, the Kremlin spin machine has been 
 
 working overtime to try to present an image of calm stability. You know, this has always been essentially the message that Putin has been pushing, 
 
 basically saying, do you want to return to the chaos of the 1990s? I'm the man who's brought this country from its knees.
 
And you may have to give up some of your civil liberties and some of your free press and all of that kind of stuff. But in exchange, the social 
 
 contract with ordinary Russians is going to be you can expect stability, there's not going to be as sort of chaos on the streets.
 
Well, that deal is kind of thrown out of the window. And the second thing is, regardless of what, you know, theater we're being presented with Putin 
 
 presiding again, at a long table with all of his security chiefs. You know the question and awarding medals and congratulating everyone for you know, 
 
 performing so capably.
 
He's really had an emperor has no clothes moment. And that really, I think, undermines a lot of this, you know, raises questions first for ordinary 
 
 Russians. Is he actually the guarantor of stability, when we've just been presented with the specter of a possible Civil War? And it also really, 
 
 really dense his image is sort of the man on horseback. So this is again, I think, it's really -- it's not so easy to patch this one up, Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Nathan, what will happen to the Wagner Chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin? It's clear that we simply don't know at this point, what's your best guess?
 
HODGE: Well, my best guess is, first of all, he's not going to be starting a catering business anytime in Belarus, I think. You know, most likely I 
 
 think, first of all, the question we need to answer is, and who's going to be accompanying him? Where is he physically going to be? Will he have part 
 
 of his entourage? Will his group be armed?
 
You know, I think that we heard a little bit from Lukashenko, who's not necessarily always the most reliable narrator here say. Well, there's a 
 
 possibility of, well, we might find some work for you or, but then again, you know, do you necessarily want to have this force that has proven that 
 
 it can be acting independently, you know, rocking up on your doorstep?
 
So this is really going to be the question. I mean, I think that there's no shortage of speculation about, you know, what happens to Prigozhin, 
 
 everything from, you know, rehabilitation to defenestration. But, you know, we really can't sort of put on our, you know, put our crystal ball out 
 
 there and say exactly, because we've already entered uncharted waters here, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Nathan Hodge, it's good to have you, your years spent in Moscow your experience as the Bureau Chief for us means that your analysis and 
 
 insights is so important to us. Your article on cnn.com is a good read. Thank you.
 
And you can read Nathan's analysis his article entitled "Belarus Leader at Lukashenko's purported mediation and criminal crisis stretches credibility 
 
 to the limit". Consider this was published ahead of what has been some fast moving news today.
 
But you can find that cnn.com or the CNN app important analysis there. Well just days after the revolt in Russia, the U.S. is to announce a new 
 
 military aid package for Ukraine. It's valued up to $500 million, and is expected to include Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Armored Personnel 
 
 Carriers plus a variety of weapons.
 
Joining us now is CNN's National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand. Natasha, we've got part detail. What more do we know about this additional 
 
 military aid?
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Becky. So what we're expecting from the Pentagon today is an announcement that they will be 
 
 providing a new military aid package of up to $500 million for Ukraine, and it will include those Bradley and Stryker Fighting Vehicles.
 
Which is important because Ukraine has apparently lost some of those vehicles already in the fighting that has taken place over the last several 
 
 weeks in the beginning of their counter offensive? So this will be very welcome news for the Ukrainians.
 
They're also going to be getting munitions for Patriot systems, as well as munitions for their rocket systems and importantly, additional ammunition, 
 
 which is something that they are always kind of wanting for.
 
And this obviously comes at a moment when the U.S. military is trying to figure out how the rebellion in Russia will impact the war in Ukraine and 
 
 whether Prigozhin's troops Wagner forces are going to be playing a role there anymore? Obviously there are questions now about whether they will be 
 
 absorbed into the Russian Ministry of Defense?
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
But broadly speaking, the U.S. military aid package that we're seeing today, which is going to bring the total amount of military aid to Ukraine, 
 
 since the war began to over $40 billion, that just demonstrates that the U.S. remains committed to supporting Ukraine kind of no matter what happens 
 
 there on the battlefield, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Natasha, thank you. You're watching "Connect the World" with me, Becky Anderson. Coming up, CNN has the tape. Former President Trump 
 
 gloating about classified documents that he took from the White House, you can hear him in his own words coming up.
 
A little later this hour Carlos Ghosn famously escaped from Japan, hidden in a box aboard a private plane, now the Former Nissan Boss is telling me 
 
 about his legal battle with the carmaker and his ambition in Lebanese politics that coming up after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Former U.S. President Donald Trump back on the campaign trail today just after CNN obtained audio that undercuts his claim that he did 
 
 not keep classified documents after leaving the White House. On the recording from a 2021 meeting at Trump's Golf Club in New Jersey you can 
 
 hear him discussing highly secret documents and then say he knows he has not declassified them have a listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DOLAND TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Isn't it amazing. I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came out. This was him. They presented me this is 
 
 off the record. They presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him.
 
We looked at him this was him. This wasn't done by me. This was him. All sorts of stuff pages long I just found it. Isn't that amazing? Just totally 
 
 winds my vacation except it is like highly confidential. See as President I couldn't have declassified it. No, I can't. But this is that interesting. 
 
 It's so cool. Look, we're here -- and you probably almost didn't believe me. But now you're incredible, right? Let bring some coke in please.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, this conversation is a critical piece of evidence in the case of Trump's alleged mishandling of classified information. CNN Senior 
 
 Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid explains.
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFIARS CORRESPONDENT: This recording is from the summer of 2021 at Trump's Bedminster Golf Club. He's speaking with two 
 
 people working on an auto biography for Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and the Former President knew he was being recorded his own 
 
 aides were making a recording of this meeting, in addition to the folks working on that auto biography.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
But even though he knew he was making a record of this conversation, former president was, as you can hear on this tape, surprisingly casual when 
 
 talking about some of our nation's most sensitive secrets. He admits that this information that he is sharing with others in the room who do not have 
 
 a proper clearance or any clearance at all, he acknowledges that this is classified information that it could have declassified it when he was in 
 
 the White House, but then he no longer had the power to do so.
 
Now in public, the former president has repeatedly said that he didn't have this document that is not actually that document that he is referring to in 
 
 this tape. But one interesting quote that you can hear on the CNN version of this tape that was not included in the indictment is that the former 
 
 president said these are those papers.
 
And so he's insisting that in fact, whatever he appears to be showing the other people in the room, or the papers that he alleges, will vindicate him 
 
 in terms of Mark Milley's comments about Iran. Now, this tape is expected to be a central piece of evidence for the special counsel.
 
Now another aspect of the tape that was not included in the indictment is former President Trump and at least one of his staffers mocking former 
 
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server. Now, that's of course not really pertinent to the criminal case. But in the 
 
 court of public opinion, it does appear to be hubris. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.
 
ANDERSON: Well, this week, the justices out the U.S. Supreme Court are expected to release a series of major decisions, the court typically 
 
 releases most of the, or some of the most controversial decisions near the end of the summer session.
 
Now President Biden's student loan forgiveness program and college affirmative action programs are just some of what are these hot button 
 
 issues this time. In the last hour the court rejected a controversial election law, theory that was pushed by former President Donald Trump's 
 
 supporters. Jessica Schneider is outside the court for us, and just break down what we know at this point, if you will.
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Becky, so big week for the Supreme Court, you previewed some of the cases still remaining. And 
 
 there was a big case decided just a few minutes ago. The Supreme Court striking down this theory that the challengers of this theory had warned 
 
 would really up end the way federal elections are run if this theory had been adopted, but the Supreme Court striking it down.
 
It's called the independent state legislature theory; it was pushed most recently by backers of the former President Trump during the 2020 election. 
 
 They argued that since the federal constitution says that legislatures are in charge of the time, place and manner of federal elections, they were 
 
 arguing that that meant that legislators had the final say that state courts couldn't step in to overrule any of the rules or laws that state 
 
 legislatures put into place.
 
So they pushed this theory all the way to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court heard arguments several months ago. But today, the Supreme Court and 
 
 a six three decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts rejecting the independent state legislature theory ahead of the 2024 presidential 
 
 election.
 
The court here basically saying that throughout history, state courts, federal courts, as well have always been a check on the power of 
 
 legislatures, whether it'd at the state level or the federal level. And that check should continue. So moving into the 2024 election, crucially, 
 
 any of the rules that are passed by state legislatures that maybe are a majority of Republicans or a majority of Democrats.
 
If they try to push any rules that could potentially favor their party's candidate, state courts can step in review those rules, maybe declare them 
 
 unconstitutional, that system will still be in effect for 2024. It was something that was questioned. If the Supreme Court hadn't gone this way on 
 
 this decision, there would have been maybe some imbalance for the 2024 election, maybe some chaos.
 
But now the Supreme Court putting a stop to that and saying that this theory should not be embraced that it will not be tolerated. But of course, 
 
 Becky there will still likely be ongoing litigation about rules that legislators put into effect, but the Supreme Court really trying to set the 
 
 stage and keep things calm going into the 2024 election.
 
ANDERSON: Super, thank you very much indeed. Well, let's get you up to speed folks on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. 
 
 And fighting in the Darfur region killed 21 people over the weekend, including 12 civilians. They died in the Southern Capital of Nyala.
 
The Darfur Bar Association described the deaths of civilians as arbitrary killings. A local activist reports heavy clashes is between Sudan's two 
 
 rival warring factions. Well, a battle for a police base in Khartoum has left at least 14 dead according to activists.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
Sudan's paramilitary forces say they capture the headquarters of a militarized police unit in the Capitol on Sunday. The rapid support forces 
 
 as they are known also claimed they've seized dozens of armored vehicles. Well, UNICEF says more than 100,000 children who fled the violence in Sudan 
 
 now face new dangers in neighboring Chad.
 
That includes the risk of disease and of delayed access to humanitarian aid. The UN agency says more than 90 percent of those fleeing as Sudanese 
 
 refugees are women and children. Well, many of those fleeing their homes in Sudan are finding themselves trapped in a bureaucratic nightmare. They're 
 
 stranded without their passports.
 
They say the U.S. embassy was holding them for visa processing and destroyed them when the fighting broke out. More on that in our Meanwhile 
 
 in the Middle East newsletter, you can scan the code just below me to read what some harrowing accounts, that is, are Meanwhile in the Middle East, 
 
 our newsletter from here in Abu Dhabi.
 
Well, just ahead. Our warriors have advanced in all directions. Those are the words of the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. How much is Kyiv 
 
 using Russia's chaos to its advantage if at all? Plus President Joe Biden is speaking out about the weekend revolt in Russia and his denial that the 
 
 U.S. was behind any of it.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back, you're watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson. It is just before half past seven and evening here in Abu Dhabi, 
 
 you are more than welcome. Wherever you are watching, these are your headlines.
 
In newly obtained audio former U.S. President Donald Trump has heard discussing classified documents at his New Jersey Golf Club back in 2021. 
 
 This tape could be a key piece of evidence in the classified documents case against him, undercutting his claims that he didn't keep any classified 
 
 documents after leaving the White House.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the Wagner groups attempted mutiny at the Kremlin earlier today expressed his gratitude to security 
 
 officials had in a separate speech.
 
Thanks to security forces for their service. He paid tribute to an unspecified number of military pilots who were killed in that weekend 
 
 confrontation. President Biden is pushing back at any implication that the U.S. was behind the weekend revolt in Russia.
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
Sources claim U.S. intelligence officials had detailed accurate information about what was being planned, but only shared that information with select 
 
 allies. In his first public remarks since the revolt, Mr. Biden adamantly says the U.S. was not involved.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We gave Putin no excuse to blame this on the West would have blamed us on NATO. We made 
 
 clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it. This was part of a struggle within Russian system, it's still too early to reach a 
 
 definitive conclusion about where this is going, the -- outcome of all this remains to be seen.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, joining me now is White House Reporter, Kevin Liptak. So that information held back from many allies, including those one assumes 
 
 who are involved in helping Ukraine at least with military aid. Why was that?
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, I think when you talk to American officials; really, they wanted to protect how they had gathered 
 
 that information, the so-called sources and methods. And it did lead to some mild frustration among the wider NATO group, the U.S. did share the 
 
 intelligence with members of the British government, they also shared it with American members of Congress.
 
But certainly the accuracy of what the United States knew before it was happening, how this offensive was going to begin, potentially where it was 
 
 going to begin, really does tell you how high grade the intelligence actually is that the U.S. is getting from inside of Russia. And it's so 
 
 striking.
 
Now after this happened, the president did convene other world leaders on the phone, on a video call and he was able to share more information then 
 
 and the message really on that call was what you heard President Biden say yesterday was that they did not want to give President Putin any pretext to 
 
 accuse the west of orchestrating this plot.
 
And in fact, when we heard President Putin come out yesterday, he sort of did just that. He said that the West was very eager to see what happened 
 
 underway in Russia. And the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said that he would begin an investigation into whether this was a Western 
 
 intelligence plan.
 
And that was essentially what the United States what President Biden's aides had been anticipating. I'm told they expect those accusations to 
 
 continue to mount in the lead up to this very important NATO summit that's due to begin in July, early July. That's happening in Lithuania, Becky, 
 
 that's only about 20 miles from the border with Belarus.
 
So this dynamic will continue to play out and it's certainly something that President Biden will continue to reinforce that the U.S. had no role in 
 
 this plot. Even though our reporting suggests they did have some insight into what was happening before it happened, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Kevin Liptak is on the story for you out of Washington, thank you. Well, Ukraine is using the chaos in Russia. They say to their 
 
 advantage claiming their big gains over Russian troops on Monday in his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian fighters 
 
 had advanced in all directions on the southern and eastern frontlines. CNN's Ben Wedeman is with the latest for you.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A brief revolt in Russia complicating the fight on the front line in Ukraine. Now 
 
 as Prigozhin halts his uprising and relocates to Belarus as part of an agreement to avoid Russian bloodshed. Wagner's future on the battlefield is 
 
 uncertain.
 
YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY: The purpose of the march was to prevent the destruction of the Wagner PMC and the 
 
 prosecution of those who made a huge number of mistakes in the course of the special military operation due to their unprofessional actions. The 
 
 society demanded this; all the soldiers who saw supported us.
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): Eager to accelerate the halting start of their counter offensive, the Ukrainian military claimed a spate of advances over 
 
 the weekend. The Russian defense ministry has yet to comment on the Ukrainian claims. In the southeast Ukrainian troops claimed to liberate the 
 
 village of Rivnopil.
 
Ukrainian Armed Forces said they cleared a strategic Russian position on the western bank of the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas Canal. And in the long 
 
 embattled town of Bakhmut, Ukrainian troops said they made gains on territory that Wagner fighters fought mercilessly to claim for months.
 
Battle in Bakhmut unfolded in close quarters among the trenches, some fighting even taking place at point blank range, a Ukrainian commander 
 
 said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the front lines of Donetsk to praise the efforts of the troops to advance.
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Ukraine is proud of each and every one of you. You are tough, strong or real Ukrainians. Everyone in the 
 
 country understands that you're with us. Those who are not on the front line everyone knows you're doing the most difficult work right now.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): Despite these small territorial gains, the front lines remain largely unchanged. While Ukraine has claimed some tactical 
 
 success, it remains to be seen whether it's enough to turn the tide of war. Ben Wedeman, CNN, eastern Ukraine.

ANDERSON: Well, you're watching "Connect the World" with me, Becky Anderson, just ahead for you.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CARLOS GHOSN, FORMER NISSAN CHAIRMAN: Using your weaponizing the justice system to try to organize a coup that other way you would not be able to 
 
 make the change.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That's the former boss of Nissan Carlos Ghosn, he's got a 10 figure message for the car giant. He's been telling me all about that in my 
 
 interview with him, which is up next. And I asked superstar actor Tom Cruise about what the studio calls the biggest stunt in cinema history. He 
 
 talked about Mission: Impossible, coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: On this edition of "Connect the World" I've been talking to Carlos Ghosn, was once a top name in the global car industry. Until he was 
 
 arrested in Japan for alleged financial misconduct which he denies, the former Nissan Chairman infamously escaped.
 
And he now lives in his childhood home of Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan. Well, Carlos Ghosn tells me he is fighting to expose 
 
 what he calls a plot against him by Nissan. Have a listen.
 
GHOSN: The complaint is about the crime which was committed before and at the moment of my arrest. So just limiting to it because as you know, we've 
 
 done it in Lebanon because it's tied to Lebanon, the way they entered the home without a warrant. The way they stole document, the way they've given 
 
 the document.
 
These are Nissan people given the document to the prosecutor in Japan, all of this they violated a lot of laws. And these are crimes that are crimes 
 
 in Lebanon and they are crime in front of international law. So we are not attacking what happened after what happens after will be the object of 
 
 other complaints. But for the moment we are starting from the beginning.
 
ANDERSON: Nissan says it has and I quote them "Substantial and convincing evidence that established is that you intentionally committed serious 
 
 misconduct and significant violations of corporate ethics". We are talking here about $80 million that you are accused of underreporting. Can you say 
 
 with absolute certainty that you did not divert company funds for your own use?
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
GHOSN: Look under reporting, a compensation that was neither decided nor paid, I don't know how you can divert it. I mean, this is the charge. This 
 
 is the crime for which I was arrested from the beginning. It's what the only charge.
 
So I don't know how you can, in a certain way be accused of the crime consisting in not reporting something you didn't even earn, which was not 
 
 decided by the board. They came three months later with a lot of additional accusation because of the fragility and the in-consequence of the first 
 
 acquisition.
 
I mean, that's a very long story, Becky, but let's go to the fundamentals. The fundamentals are the fact that there was a meeting of experts of the 
 
 United Nations which analyzed the case. And they came with a very clear conclusion; they said that my arrest was arbitrary. They said that all my 
 
 human rights have been violated.
 
They ask the Japanese government for an investigation, which obviously they didn't do. And finally, they said that I should be compensated for all the 
 
 harm that was done to me, these are not my lawyers. This is the United Nation. This is the United Nations.
 
So I don't want to go into a lot of details. But we have a lot of evidence, Becky, that this has nothing to do with misconduct, because even if it was 
 
 misconduct, let's suppose there was any misconduct, you do not harm your own company, your own brand, by arresting the CEO, you should sit down with 
 
 him in the meeting with the board, try to get an explanation.
 
And then you do it in a way that you preserving the shareholders that you place on the brand that did nothing of that which mean, this is not about 
 
 corporate, this is a more political action.
 
ANDERSON: You've just quoted the UN Human Rights body that found that your 100 day detention was arbitrary and unlawful. The response of the 
 
 Government of Japan claims that that opinion, written by the UN was based on factual errors.
 
Be that as it may, you have accused the Japanese justice system of being rigged, sir, have your defense attorneys ever been given access to the 
 
 evidence that the prosecutors have, for example?
 
GHOSN: Yes. Look, the hostage justice system in Japan has not been only criticized by the expert of the United Nation. I'm sure you've seen 
 
 recently the Human Rights Watch, which came with a very big report about the violations committed by the hostage justice system. And again, the 
 
 objective today here is not to talk or develop about that, even though you can say a lot about it.
 
ANDERSON: Is the billion dollars symbolic to a certain extent, do you genuinely believe that you can win this case?
 
GHOSN: Oh, yes, that, frankly, my lawyers, if I was making a complaint in the United States, which unfortunately, I cannot, because I'm not a U.S. 
 
 citizen, and the crime was not linked to the United States. But if I was doing this in the United States, I would be asking for much more money.
 
Because as you know, in the U.S. the law, the justice system, doesn't take very seriously tentative where somebody to make change in a corporation, do 
 
 not go through the normal ways or making changes when you go to the board, you put in a minority, you have to leave, and then you give explanation.
 
But you're using; you're weaponizing the justice system to try to organize a coup that otherwise you would not be able to make the change.
 
ANDERSON: Well, you're not in the United States. Of course, you are in Lebanon. In France, you face charges of tax evasion of money laundering and 
 
 fraud, while in Japan; there are other charges of breach of trust and misuse of company assets. Given the global nature of these claims, what's 
 
 your sort of overarching plan at this point?
 
GHOSN: Look, my overarching plan now is to fight this in Lebanon, hopefully win it in Lebanon, and then ask Nissan to pay. On top of this, I am 
 
 intending to continue to fight to put back the truth. I cannot, in a certain way sleep any night knowing that people who lied, manipulated, 
 
 truncated evidence are just enjoying a normal carrier like nothing has happened.
 
ANDERSON: You in Lebanon, the country, of course, where you grew up, it is a country in political and economic turmoil. Do you have any ambitions 
 
 yourself to enter the political sphere in Lebanon, Carlos?
 
GHOSN: No, not at all, Becky, no, not at all. I have no political ambition. By the way, this is not something recent, I've always said that. I've been 
 
 solicited many times in the past, even when, you know, when I was CEO of Nissan and Renault and Mitsubishi, I said, I'm not interested in it.
 
But this doesn't mean I'm indifferent to the situation in which this country is. And I'm ready to help with my experience and knowledge, any 
 
 plan that would have as an aim to really full recovery of the economy and of the country.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
Obviously, I said it to many people who have been elected that, you know, my experience would be to serve the country for recovery is, is there, if 
 
 they need it, I'll be there.
 
ANDERSON: Have you been offered an official role in Lebanon? Let me pressure you on that.
 
GHOSN: No, I will not take an official role. But obviously, as advisor, or as you know, in charge of something that could particularly prepare plans 
 
 and actions and specifics for people who are official representative of the government, I will be ready to do it. You know, Lebanon is a rich country. 
 
 It's not a poor country.
 
But it's a, but it's a failed state. It's not a failed country. The country is rich; it has a lot of assets. It has a huge population outside of 
 
 Lebanon. There are more than 12 to 14 million Lebanese outside, and are usually well educated people doing very well in many countries in the 
 
 world. So the recovery of Lebanon is not a question that would be extremely difficult.
 
But you need to bring back trust, and you need to bring back the confidence that you have a plan and this plan makes sense. And you're going to get 
 
 results and not in five years down the road, but six months down the road one year down the road, to really trying to fix the things that really 
 
 matter for people. And that's missing today, unfortunately, and that's why the country is in this situation.
 
ANDERSON: Would you get involved in the next parliamentary elections? I have to ask because there is much speculation. You say you won't take an 
 
 official role. I did ask whether you've been offered one, you just said you wouldn't take one. But would you run in the next parliamentary elections 
 
 for example?
 
GHOSN: No, no, Becky that mean when I say I'm out of any political job, it includes obviously Parliament or government or something like this. I think 
 
 I can be much more useful in a certain way and helpful by working on the side with the people that, with the persons that the people of Lebanon 
 
 would elect to you know direct to direct the country.
 
ANDERSON: Well, that's Carlos Ghosn suing Nissan is former company of course for a billion dollars. CNN reached out to Nisan to seek common and 
 
 has not yet received one. Well after the break my interview with actor Tom Cruise.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Look me in the eye and tell me you weren't frightened of your wits.
 
TOM CRUISE, ACTOR: I can't.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: He goes, riding a motorcycle off a cliff in this wild scene from the latest Mission: Impossible movie. What happens next? Stay with us. And 
 
 why tonight is one of the most important nights for Muslims around the world. We'll take you to this mountain in Saudi Arabia for the Arafat.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTOPHER MCQUARRIE, DIRECTOR, "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- DEAD RECKONING PART ONE": This is far and away the most dangerous thing we've ever 
 
 attempted, the motorcycle jump off a cliff into a base jump.
 
CRUISE: Oh, my god, what am I doing?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well that of course is Tom Cruise there. The video was posted on his Twitter account with the caption "Why are we doing this because it's 
 
 Mission: Impossible".
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
Well, Cruise was here in Abu Dhabi this weekend for the premiere of the next installment in the multibillion dollar movie franchise. And I had the 
 
 opportunity to catch up with him for a sneak peek at Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON (voice over): It's been hailed as one of the most dangerous stunts in cinematic history. Tom Cruise is risking life and limb as Ethan Hunt to 
 
 go bigger and bolder for the latest Mission: Impossible film. Crews stopped down in Abu Dhabi this week for the Middle East premiere of the seventh 
 
 installment dead reckoning part one.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): Tom Cruise you just spent like an hour with the fans, which is in typical Tom Cruise fashion, absolutely wonderful. And they are 
 
 in for such a treat when this movie launches, not least seeing you in your biggest stunt ever. If not one of the biggest cinematic stunts ever. Look 
 
 me in the eye and tell me you weren't frightened out of your wits.
 
CRUISE: I can't. The difference is I just, I just don't mind it. You know, I don't mind that, that feeling, I kind of liked that feeling. I like to 
 
 see like, you know, you prepare for something and you're like, what's going to happen? That's, I don't mind that feeling.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): Is there anything you wouldn't do?
 
CRUISE: I don't know. You know, there's a lot of things that I still want to do.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): How do you challenge yourself? I was talking to somebody before this interview and they said, listen, he's unrivaled at 
 
 this stage. Who challenges him? Who challenges you, Tom Cruise?
 
CRUISE: I'm always, I'm always my whole life, I just want I strive for excellence. I'm always as I said, there's always another story to tell 
 
 there's always another mountain to climb and, and I always feel like I can do it better.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): This stunt should have the audience on the edge of their seats, even shook up Cruise's longtime friend and the film's highly 
 
 acclaimed director, Christopher McQuarrie.
 
MCQUARRIE: I don't have clear memories of it. Somebody was there recording it. And that ended up on the internet. So now I know what I look like. It 
 
 feels a lot different in my head than it actually looks from the outside. I apparently I was pretty nervous.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): Is it true that it was the first scene that you shot just in case you didn't make it?
 
MCQUARRIE: Not in case you didn't make it. We just like to get the big stuff out of the way. And most importantly, we'd like to know the kind of 
 
 movie we're making around that stunt. So having it out of the way is just, it's just a huge relief to focus on the stories.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): How big a deal is he to work with?
 
MCQUARRIE: How big a deal is he to work with? If I'm taking your meeting, right, surprisingly, not a big deal. Very personal, personable, very, very 
 
 much connected to not just to the rest of the cast, but to the crew, their needs and their fancy. He's a producer as well as he is the star of the 
 
 movie and he makes everybody feel very, very comfortable.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): This is the third time the franchise's filmed in the UAE. In 2010, Dubai was host to Cruise's jaw dropping stunt scaling the 
 
 Burj Khalifa while shooting Ghost Protocol. In 2021, at the height of the pandemic, the films cast shot at the leeward desert in Abu Dhabi, as well 
 
 as the Abu Dhabi International Airport midfield terminal.
 
The series has enjoyed incredible international success, grossing more than $3.5 billion dollars at the worldwide box office. The global rollout of 
 
 dead reckoning, part one is slated for mid-July. And the cast is nodding to much more to come.
 
SIMON PEGG, ACTOR: I mean, Tom is 61 nearly, and he has the complete order of 25 year old. So I think he'll be jumping off things when he's 100.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): Ethan Hunt, is this his swan song sir?
 
CRUISE: I'll talk to you next summer.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Next summer, of course is Dead Reckoning Part Two. Part one, a two part movie out in a couple of weeks. So wherever you are watching in 
 
 the world, you'll find it. In tonight's parting shots, we take you to the latest precession of the Shia's Hajj, the largest religious gathering in 
 
 the world.
 
Today is known as the Day of Arafat. Pilgrims who want partaking in this year's Hajj ascend the mountain of Arafat in Saudi Arabia said to be the 
 
 location of the prophet's last sermon. Well, during the Hajj, pilgrims walk in massive processions shoulder-to-shoulder with Muslims from more than 80 
 
 countries.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
Together, they share meals, prayers and living quarters. According to Saudi news outlets more than 2 million, 2 million people will partake in this 
 
 year's Hajj. And tonight, there Muslims all over the world will celebrate the start of Eid al-Adha, also known as the Big Eid. So from our family 
 
 here, at "Connect the World" to yours, we wish you a blessed Eid. "One World" with Zain Asher is up next here on CNN. From the team here, it's 
 
 very good evening.
