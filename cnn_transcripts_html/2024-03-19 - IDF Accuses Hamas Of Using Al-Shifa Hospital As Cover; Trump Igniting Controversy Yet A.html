ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. 
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: And live from Washington, D.C., I'm Bianna Golodryga. You are watching "One World". Israel says that its 
 
 troops are still conducting an operation against Hamas at Gaza's largest hospital where thousands of Palestinians are reported to have taken 
 
 shelter. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: The IDF accuses Hamas of using Al-Shifa Hospital as cover and says that it's killed 50 terrorists, so far. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, a doctor trapped inside the complex is calling for urgent intervention, saying that the hospital could actually turn into a mass 
 
 grave. He says anyone moving inside the hospital grounds is being targeted. In the meantime, civilians in Gaza are also facing starvation, as well. A 
 
 new U.N.-backed report is warning that northern Gaza could see famine imminently.
 
It says the crisis is preventable and entirely mad-made because of the widespread destruction of Gaza and the throttling of aid supplies. The U.N. 
 
 human rights chief says Israel's extensive restrictions on deliveries could amount to the use of starvation as a weapon of war, which is a war crime. 
 
GOLODRYGA: The White House says President Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the urgent need for aid to get into Gaza in their first phone 
 
 call in more than a month. And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also gave a grave assessment of the situation when he spoke before heading back 
 
 to the Middle East for more talks on a possible ceasefire deal. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: A hundred percent of the population in Gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity. That's the 
 
 first time an entire population has been so classified. This only underscores both the urgency, the imperative of making this the priority. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Meantime, the Republican candidate for President of the United States is igniting controversy yet again, this time with incendiary 
 
 comments he made about Democratic Jewish Americans. During an interview on a right-wing podcast Monday, Donald Trump had this to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion. They hate everything 
 
 about Israel. And they should be ashamed of themselves because Israel will be destroyed.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: Backlash to those remarks was certainly swift. It was fierce, as well. The White House slammed the former president for spreading what it 
 
 called toxic false stereotypes and said the only person who should be ashamed is Donald Trump himself. And the Democratic leader in the Senate 
 
 accused Trump of making partisan and hateful rants. 
 
CNN's Alayna Treene joining us live now from Washington, D.C. I mean, this idea that saying that anyone who is Jewish, who votes Democrat must hate 
 
 Israel, must hate their religion. Sadly, it is not the first time that Donald Trump has made sort of these sorts of remarks targeting Jewish 
 
 Democrats. Just walk us through what the reaction has been, Alayna. 
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Well, as you said -- as you said, Zain and Bianna, Donald Trump's rhetoric sparked massive backlash from Democrats, 
 
 but also some Republicans across the political spectrum. And really coming out and calling this language offensive, arguing that it does not represent 
 
 American values and it is not, you know, in line with those who argue they are supporters of Jewish Americans.
 
Now, the Trump campaign, for their part, actually doubled down on his language and defended that rhetoric. Here's a statement from Trump campaign 
 
 spokesperson Caroline Leavitt. She said, quote, "President Trump is right. The Democratic Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, anti-
 
 Semitic, pro-terrorist cabal."
 
So, very different reactions from the different sides here. But look, you're completely right, Zain. This type of rhetoric from Donald Trump 
 
 isn't entirely new. And it is far from the first time the former president has targeted Jewish Democrats. Donald Trump is someone who claims, and I 
 
 know he personally believes this from my reporting, that he did more for Israel than any other president in modern history.
 
But there is an interesting distinction, as well, about Trump that we got a glimpse of during that interview. He often conflates support for Israel and 
 
 what he argues are the massive accomplishments for Israel when he was in office with being supportive of the Jewish population, despite trading in 
 
 these anti-Semitic stereotypes. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
And remember, shortly after losing the 2020 election, Donald Trump also lamented how his support for Israel didn't seem to translate to the ballot 
 
 box among support from Jewish Americans. He felt at the time, and I know from my conversations with his team, that he still personally feels that 
 
 Democrats wrongly got a lot of votes from Jewish people. So, a lot of this is political as well. 
 
ASHER: All right, Alayna Treene, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, let's dig deeper now into all things Israel with CNN Political and Global Affairs Analyst Barak Ravid. He's also the Politics 
 
 and Foreign Policy Reporter at "Axios", and he joins us live now from Chevy Chase, Maryland.
 
Barack, it's great to have you on. I know you have new reporting on a potential ceasefire deal, but I do want to get you to respond first to 
 
 these comments made over the weekend by the former president. You're the perfect person to have on and speak to this. You wrote a book, Trump's 
 
 Peace, the background behind the Abraham Accords and the Trump administration's relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his 
 
 coalition. 
 
We talk about how these comments are being received in the United States. I'm curious, especially since this isn't the first time he's made 
 
 incendiary comments like this, how it's being received among Israelis, in particular the Israeli government right now, because I know there are some 
 
 extremist members of this coalition who are actually hoping that President Trump does come back into office. 
 
BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL AND GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Yeah, first, we just saw a few days ago there was a big public opinion poll on Channel 12 in 
 
 Israel that showed that the majority of Israelis would want to see Donald Trump winning the next presidential election, which was, at least to me, 
 
 was quite surprising, because in the first few weeks or few months of the war in Gaza, it was the other way around, with the majority of Israelis 
 
 saying that they would rather have Joe Biden. 
 
So, we see this change in Israeli public opinion over the last few weeks. The interesting thing is that if you look at Donald Trump's comments since 
 
 the beginning of the war in Gaza, you see that he, you know, in general says that he supports Israel, but he didn't say one positive word about 
 
 Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
In fact, you know, according to a "Rolling Stone" report at the beginning of the war, Trump told his associates that Netanyahu should be impeached 
 
 because of the failures that led to October 7th. And, you know, I met Trump in April 2021, three months after he left the White House, and he was very 
 
 clear about what he thinks about Netanyahu when he used the F-word about him. And as far as I know, his feelings towards Netanyahu haven't changed. 
 
ASHER: And, Barak, I just want to pivot slightly, because I know you've been doing some reporting in terms of a possible deal being negotiated 
 
 between Israel and Hamas, both sides obviously previously quite far apart. Just walk us through what you're hearing about the current proposals.
 
RAVID: So, I think what's interesting in what's going on in Doha in the last 24 hours is that it's the first time in, I don't know, three months 
 
 that Hamas and Israel are not negotiating over how to negotiate, but are actually negotiating the details of a hostage deal. It doesn't mean that 
 
 it's going to happen tomorrow. 
 
This is going to take, best-case scenario, another two weeks of talks, but there are two negotiation teams in Doha in the same compound in separate 
 
 rooms with Qatari and Egyptian mediators shuttling between them. This is something we haven't had for a long time. And therefore, what I hear from 
 
 both Qatari officials and Israeli officials, that there's cautious optimism that those gaps that still remain are bridgeable. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, and like you said, I mean, there's some optimism here. It's the first time that they're actually getting into some specifics, but 
 
 it still could take weeks to see if this deal does come to fruition. Barak, if you could weigh in on the phone conversation yesterday, the first in, I 
 
 believe, over a month between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, not necessarily the tone, but what came out of it. And that is that Prime 
 
 Minister Netanyahu agreed to send a delegation to Washington. 
 
The U.S. has been public about their concerns of any operation going into Rafah. And this apparently is what triggered this invitation for a 
 
 delegation to come and what Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to do. What do you make of this? And what can we expect out of their visit next week? 
 
RAVID: So, first, I think it shows that both Netanyahu and Biden are trying to avoid a clash over Rafah, which is very interesting. And Netanyahu said 
 
 this morning that he agreed to send a delegation out of respect for Biden, not because he thinks that it's a good idea. You know, an Israeli 
 
 delegation will come to Washington next week. You know, we'll see what happens.
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
The gaps between Netanyahu and Biden on Rafah are quite big. But I just want to tell you another anecdote, interesting anecdote, from this phone 
 
 call, what was, you know, for Biden it was important to speak about Rafah. For Netanyahu, it was more important to speak about Senate Majority Leader 
 
 Chuck Schumer's speech from last week in which he called for elections in Israel. 
 
Netanyahu complained to Biden about this speech, and he said that, you know, Schumer's comment and several of Biden's recent comments were 
 
 interference in Israeli politics. And Biden told him, according to two sources I spoke to, that, you know, he's not trying to push him out of 
 
 office and he doesn't have any intention in interfering in Israeli politics. And, you know, one source told me that it helped somewhat to 
 
 clear the atmosphere. We will see in the next few days and weeks whether this is true or not. 
 
ASHER: And Barak, just to touch on what you said earlier about the negotiations, that this is the first time that they're not negotiating over 
 
 how to negotiate, but they're actually hammering out details in terms of the hostages. At the same time, Netanyahu, though, is vowing to press on 
 
 with a military assault into Rafah. How does that fit in with the ceasefire negotiations? 
 
RAVID: First, there's not going to be any operation in Rafah before it is clear whether there's a hostage deal or not. So, all the rhetoric you hear 
 
 from Netanyahu over this thing, who, by the way, Netanyahu already said three times in the last, I don't know, month or so that he approved plans 
 
 for an operation in Rafah. This is the plan that was approved the most -- the highest number of times ever. 
 
So, I think everybody wants to see whether there's a hostage deal or not. If there is a hostage deal, we will go into at least six-week ceasefire, so 
 
 this whole thing will be postponed even more. If there's no hostage deal, the possibility of an operation in Rafah will become much more serious. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, I think he once upon a time said that he would go into Rafah. The red line was if the hostages weren't released before Ramadan. 
 
 And we know that Ramadan has already started and no operation into Rafah has begun. Barak, if I could get you to respond to news that, as we 
 
 reported, the Secretary of State Blinken is expected to visit the region again. I believe this will be his fifth time in the region, going to Egypt 
 
 and possibly Saudi Arabia. And it's not clear yet if he will be making a trip to Israel. How much should we read into that? 
 
RAVID: I'm asking myself the same question. From what I hear from both State Department officials and Israeli officials, he has no plan at the 
 
 moment to go to Israel. And I think it tells you something, because in every trip Blinken has made to the region, since the beginning -- since 
 
 October 7th, Israel was not only a key destination, but in some of those trips he came to Israel twice. 
 
And this time he's coming to the region and he's not visiting Israel. So, I think that tells a lot about what Blinken thinks he can achieve in a visit 
 
 to Israel. In previous visits, he did not achieve much. I think now his assessment is that there's not a lot he can do there at the moment. 
 
ASHER: All right, Barak Ravid, always good to have your perspective on the show. Thank you so much for being with us. Appreciate it. All right, let's 
 
 turn now to Haiti, because armed gangs there are turning that country into a war zone and as they tighten their grip on the capital, police say at 
 
 least 10 people were killed in Port-au-Prince on Monday. 
 
The latest attacks taking place in upscale neighborhoods. The U.S. is raising red flags -- a lot of red flags about the growing crisis, as the 
 
 number of Americans filling out the crisis intake forms in Haiti is approaching 1000.
 
GOLODRYGA: Dozens of U.S. citizens have already been evacuated from the Caribbean nation over the weekend, with more awaiting rescue. Our David 
 
 Culver is in Port-au-Prince and he sent us this report from the middle of the chaos. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Port-au- Prince feels post-apocalyptic. This is basically the aftermath of a war zone. Driving through the battlegrounds between gangs and police, we dodge 
 
 massive craters and piles of burning trash. 
 
The police control these roads leading to Haiti's international airport, for today at least. It's been shut for weeks. Out front, checkpoints to 
 
 search for suspected gang members and an armored truck to keep watch. It sits beaten and battered. Less than a month ago, we flew in and out on 
 
 commercial flights here. Now, it's desolate. 
 
The country is in chaos, essentially held hostage by gangs eager to expand their reign of terror. Over the weekend, more businesses looted and cars 
 
 stolen, gangs leaving behind a scorched path of ruin. We're headed to one of the last remaining hospital trauma centers that's still functioning in 
 
 Port-au-Prince. 
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
UNKNOWN: February 29th was probably the worst.
 
CULVER (voice-over): As soon as we meet one of the doctors, a call comes in. 
 
CULVER: Go ahead if you need to get it. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): A gunshot victim heading into surgery. He takes us to him. 
 
CULVER: Most of those cases that are brought here are gunshot victims from the gang violence. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): With the patient's family giving us permission, we go in as staff prepare to operate. We're told the 24-year-old truck driver was 
 
 caught in the crossfire between police and gangs. 
 
CULVER: The doctor is showing me here images that are very disturbing, but they show an entry wound of a bullet basically around the temple and went 
 
 right through and caused damage to at least one eye. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): The doctor tells us the man's lost vision in both eyes. Another bullet hit his arm. And so they will have to amputate his 
 
 arm? 
 
UNKNOWN: Yes. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): We peer into the ICU. It's full. Are most of these gunshot victims? All of them are. 
 
UNKNOWN: She's in pain. She feels a pain in her leg. 
 
CULVER: And so how did it happen? Where were you? 
 
UNKNOWN: She was going to the market. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): Eighty-six years old. A reminder, no one is shielded from the violence that's gripped Haiti's capital in recent weeks. Police 
 
 are exhausted. One local commander telling me morale is broken and that the gangs have more money and resources than they do. Low on ammo. Their squad 
 
 cars out of gas. It is personal for the commander.
 
CULVER: He was forced out with his family from their own home. And now this is his home, essentially. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): The police, at least in this community, do have backup in the form of local residents.
 
CULVER: Do you feel like gangs are trying to move in and take this area? 
 
UNKNOWN: Yes, for sure. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): While many community leaders call for peace, they admit they're tired of feeling threatened. So much so, some have created 
 
 their own checkpoints and barricades, staffed 24-7, redirecting traffic and determining who comes in. Not everyone gets out. 
 
CULVER: You can see right here at this intersection, there's a massive burn pile. This is actually where the community takes justice into their own 
 
 hands. About a week ago was the most recent such case. They captured four suspected gang members. They brought them here. Killed them with machetes. 
 
 And set their bodies on fire. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): The gruesome vigilante acts recorded in part as a warning to the gangs. But even amid utter turmoil, life moves forward. And 
 
 with it, moments to celebrate. Outside a church, these bridesmaids excitedly awaiting their cue to walk down the aisle. Port-au-Prince is a 
 
 city now shattered by the relentless blasts of violence that have forced more than 300,000 of its residents out of their homes. 
 
CULVER: Where are you staying here? Where's your home in this facility? Right up there. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): They take refuge in places like this school. Classrooms turned dorm rooms, where more than 1500 people cram in. 
 
CULVER: So, she's showing us, this is all her stuff --
 
UNKNOWN: That's her stuff.
 
CULVER: -- she's been able to bring. And this is where she is set up right now.
 
CULVER (voice-over): In the classroom next door, we meet this woman. Her husband killed by gang members. She and her five-year-old, like many here, 
 
 have been forced to move every few weeks. We're sleeping hungry. We're in misery, she tells me. We'd probably be better off dead than living this 
 
 life.
 
CULVER: Adding to the complication for those folks is the reality that they are not only facing threats from gangs, but as they describe it to me, 
 
 they're also being ostracized from communities in which they are now essentially camping out in. They say those neighbors don't want them there 
 
 and will likewise attack them because they feel like having these refugees now within their community is drawing the gang's attention and potentially 
 
 bringing more violence to their homes. David Culver, CNN, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER: Let's get more now on the situation in Haiti from the member of Congress who is closest to what is happening there. Stacey Plaskett is the 
 
 Congressional Representative for the U.S. Virgin Islands. Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
Haiti is the world's first free black republic. And as a black child, as a person of color, I grew up hearing stories about Toussaint L'Ouverture and 
 
 the slave revolt, the uprising that took place there at the end of the 18th century. It has such an inspiring history and it is absolutely devastating 
 
 to see what has happened to this country.
 
I think what is even harder to digest is the fact that I don't really see an end in sight. I don't really see a way out for this country. Just walk 
 
 us through your thoughts in terms of how the U.S. can assist Haiti get back on its feet.
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
STACEY PLASKETT, CONGRESSIONAL REP. FROM U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Well, thank you so much for having me. And thank you for amplifying and bringing this 
 
 issue to so many of your viewers. It's incredibly important for everyone to recognize this. And yes, in fact, I as well heard the amazing stories about 
 
 Haiti's independence, it being one of the first black nations in the world. It's removing slavery from itself and being a free people. 
 
But what is not often discussed is that Haiti, of course, had so many strikes against it when it became an independent country. Haiti had to pay 
 
 France back for the loss of revenues that France had. For not having slaves there. They have paid almost $20 billion to the government of France for 
 
 that freedom. Something that would never have happened to the United States or other countries when they got their independence. 
 
That has, of course, hampered Haiti in realizing its full economic potential. And now we are seeing the cycle of hurricanes and tornadoes, 
 
 earthquakes, et cetera, that have been exacerbating that issue for the Haitian people. 
 
Presently, of course, we are in an absolutely untenable situation in the country of Haiti right now, there is no working government. There are no 
 
 elected officials. The president, who was never elected by the people, has stepped down. Police officers had not been paid in almost a year. And 
 
 therefore, the gangs took over control. Police officers -- many have joined the gangs. They have to feed their families. 
 
There are over 200 gangs that are running throughout this country. People - - the people of Haiti want stability. They want to be able to grow. What can the United States do? We have been a convener. We don't want to be 
 
 someone strong-arming or telling the Haitian people what to do. And we have convened many of the people who are in civil society. 
 
Just recently, there was a meeting in Jamaica of the CARICOM nations, the heads of states of other Caribbean, their neighboring countries, have come 
 
 together, along with Senator Blinken, and said, how do we create a transitional government of individuals who will not run for office, but 
 
 just want to bring stability, so that there is a free and fair election, and that stability can be brought back for the Haitian people? 
 
The Kenyans have generously offered to bring troops there to bring that order to stop the chaos that is happening. The United States can help. 
 
 Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have sent a letter requesting that Mike McCaul, who is the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
 
 along with the Ranking Member Greg Meeks, who has signed off -- Greg Meeks has signed off on this.
 
But we are waiting for Mike McCaul to sign off on reprogramming funds so that these 1000 Kenyan troops can come to Haiti and bring order. We know 
 
 that without that money, without that stability, the migrant issue that we have here in the United States and other countries will be exacerbated, and 
 
 many Haitian people will die.
 
GOLODRYGA: Congresswoman, I know that providing aid to Haiti has been a top priority for you. You co-sponsored legislation last year to get more 
 
 funding to the country, and obviously you raise now the issue of getting those Kenyan troops to help there on the ground. I was not aware of this 
 
 just hinging on Mike McCaul's signature.
 
Is this something that he had initially signed off on earlier in terms of, you know, the now-resigned prime minister had been in Kenya to negotiate 
 
 these troops coming to Haiti? Had this been something that had been agreed to, and now it's just missing the formality of a signature? 
 
PLASKETT: Well, that's it. The State Department has agreed to support this. President Biden has agreed to support the Kenyan troops coming, but 
 
 reprogramming of State Department funds needs to be signed off by both the Ranking Member, the Democrat, as well as the Republican Chairman of the 
 
 Foreign Affairs Committee. And Mike McCaul has not signed off on this.
 
We're not entirely clear what his reasoning is, but what we don't want to happen is the Haitian people to be used as political fodder in an election 
 
 year to show them coming to the American border to Florida to exacerbate the already untenable situation we have at the American border. 
 
We don't want, in the same way that Republicans refuse to agree to bring a vote on a bill that was struck for our border, both conservative senators, 
 
 Republican senators, and the White House agreed, and then they decided to table it, and nothing happened. 
 
And it appears that this is what the Haitian people are now being used for, to try and bring more chaos to our border so that there's something for 
 
 former President Donald Trump to talk about in his election cycle. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
That can't stand, and members are trying to work to make sure that we can support the troops to come, order can be brought in, a transitional 
 
 government put in place that has been agreed to by hundreds of Haitian diaspora, as well as on the ground civil society groups, the Caribbean 
 
 neighbors, and a free and fair election and economic stability can be brought to the Haitian people. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has actually been talking about Haitian migrants trying to get to Florida. I do want to talk about 
 
 this idea of outside intervention when it comes to the Kenyan troops -- the Kenyan police force going to Haiti.
 
I mean, as you know, the U.S. Marines occupied Haiti in 1915. The U.S. forces also occupied Haiti back in 1994 and then 2004, as well. Haiti has 
 
 had a really difficult history when it comes to outside intervention. They don't like the idea. Just, obviously, we are running out of options in 
 
 terms of how to get Haiti back on its feet. But just what are the optics of having 1000 members of a foreign police force come into the country, given 
 
 the history? 
 
PLASKETT: I mean, I think it's a very difficult one, but I think that the Haitian people have also spoken and said that we need order. You've seen 
 
 the pictures. You yourselves have shown the videos to the rest of the world what's happening in Haiti, and we recognize that the police officers have 
 
 not been paid. There is no police force. There is no local government right now. There are no elected officials. They all have been turned out, not 
 
 elected or resigned. 
 
And so, there is a need for this order, and that is why we have the agreement of these groups, Montana Group and others, who said, yes, we are 
 
 in agreement that this would be a group that we could be here for a short period of time to try and bring order so that we can organize ourselves. 
 
We know that Canada had initially said that they would come down and then backed out of that agreement. We thought that Canadian troops that also 
 
 spoke the language in some manner would be appropriate. We -- I know that there are members of Congress, again, Greg Meeks, Hakeem Jeffries, the 
 
 Democratic leader in New York, Yvette Clark, members from Florida, Frederica Wilson, who are organizing Haitian police officers in various 
 
 states to -- who are police officers in the United States to try and come down and also support any troops that are brought there. 
 
It's kind of like bringing an outside National Guard when we've had to do that in American civil unrest as well, to allow students to go to school in 
 
 certain states. We recognize that this is an outside group coming in. We as America want to do what the Haitian people think is best without strong 
 
 arms in one way or another. We're very reluctant to bring our own. We do have Marines that are on the ground that are there specifically and only to 
 
 support the last American State Department and others who are on the ground. 
 
We know that there have been advisories for several, over a year now, several years to tell Americans that this is not a safe place to be. And 
 
 we're grateful for those Americans that are leaving that do not have to be there at this time. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, we saw those first flights just the other day, but as you point out, you know, this idea of there needing to be something, something 
 
 obviously has to change. And we know that the Haitian police force that is on the ground in Port-au-Prince have been outnumbered, outgunned, and 
 
 certainly overwhelmed. Stacey Plaskett, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate you being with us.
 
PLASKET: Thank you. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Thank you.
 
PLASKETT: Thank you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Coming up for us, he was one of Donald Trump's top White House aides. But Peter Navarro now has a new label, prison inmate. We'll explain 
 
 why just ahead. 
 
ASHER: Plus, after weeks of speculation and a lot of concern, Princess Kate, the princess of Wales, was spotted shopping over the weekend. Is it 
 
 enough to put the rumor mill to rest? The story just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:32:04]
 
ASHER: All right, Joe Biden is aboard Air Force One right now heading west to visit two states crucial to his reelection bid. He's going to spend a 
 
 couple of days making campaign stops across Nevada and Arizona, too.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, the Biden campaign plans to highlight a strengthening U.S. economy and the president's support for abortion rights as two key reasons 
 
 to back him in November. He won Arizona by just three tenths of a percentage point and Nevada by about two points in 2020, making them two of 
 
 the closest states in the 2020 election. 
 
ASHER: Donald Trump's former White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has just made history. A short time ago, he reported to a federal prison in 
 
 Miami where he officially began a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, the 74-year-old was convicted last year after ignoring a subpoena from a House Committee investigating the January 6th insurrection. 
 
 Before surrendering, a defiant Navarro spoke to the media.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PETER NAVARRO, FORMER AIDE TO DONALD TRUMP: This is not about me. One of the big stories is about what is really an unprecedented assault on the 
 
 constitutional separation of powers.

GOLODRYGA: On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected Navarro's request for a last-minute reprieve. He was the first former White House official ever to 
 
 be jailed for contempt of Congress. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now live in Washington. Katelyn, we took his little press conference there for a few 
 
 minutes and then cut out. But as you noted, he was right in saying that he did make history. Not sure what the other points were that he was trying to 
 
 convey to reporters. But talk about the significance of this move.
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, this is the first time a senior White House official has gone to jail after being 
 
 convicted by a jury in federal court for contempt of Congress. In Peter Navarro's situation, he had been serving as a top advisor in the Trump 
 
 White House, a trade advisor, and also on the COVID response task force. 
 
But he also put himself out there in pushing forward Donald Trump's message after the 2020 election and wrote about that in his book. Things that he 
 
 was doing not as a White House official, but on his own. Congress subpoenaed him for testimony and documents, and he just didn't respond to 
 
 them in any substantial way. He did not sit for an interview. He didn't turn over any information. 
 
And then, when Congress held him in contempt for responding to the subpoena and referred it over to prosecutors to take him to court to prosecute him 
 
 and get him convicted before a jury, he had no evidence to show that the bubble around the presidency should have protected him. It just didn't 
 
 become part of the case. 
 
That's why all of the courts did not give him a reprieve and say he could skip out on going to prison. He did have to go to prison today. That is 
 
 going to be a sentence he's going to be serving for about the next four months. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
That is the length of his sentence on paper. He's speaking more broadly about the executive privilege. But what he says there is this isn't about 
 
 him. Actually, this is about the very particular facts around Peter Navarro and what he did in response to a congressional subpoena. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Peter Navarro, a controversial figure, an economist, China expert. He played a role in Trump's COVID policy early on and now going to 
 
 prison. Katelyn Polantz, thank you. 
 
ASHER: All right, still to come, these new mothers got a respite from war, but that will soon come to an end. You'll hear their thoughts as they 
 
 prepare to return to the war zone.

GOLODRYGA: All right. Welcome back to "One World". I'm Bianna Golodryga. And I'm Zain Asher. Let's continue our coverage of our top story, the 
 
 Israel-Hamas war. For years, critically ill Palestinians have been treated in Israeli hospitals. And that actually did continue after the attacks of 
 
 October 7th. 
 
GOLODRYGA: But now Israeli officials have ordered some Palestinian patients to return to Gaza, among them cancer patients and babies. CNN's Jeremy 
 
 Diamond reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Little Sarah is barely six months old. Born in East Jerusalem, all she knows is the safety 
 
 of this hospital room. This week, that will be torn away. 
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
War will become her new reality. I might go back and they invade Rafah, her mother Nima says. I'll be the one responsible for anything that harms them. 
 
 If I go back with the twins, where do I go with them? Where would I get diapers and milk? Gaza is not the same anymore. 
 
For nearly six months, these three mothers have been living, sleeping and nursing their five babies in this hospital room together. Before the war, 
 
 their high-risk pregnancies made them eligible to leave Gaza and give birth in Jerusalem hospitals.
 
But now they've packed their bags after learning that the Israeli government is sending them back to Gaza, where Israel's brutal military 
 
 campaign has made survival a daily struggle. Hanan, the mother of twins, says she's scared of going back to Gaza without a ceasefire. There are 
 
 diseases spreading, infections, she says. It's not a normal life. 
 
They will be among the 22 Palestinians set to be bussed on Wednesday to the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. But her husband is in the north, and 
 
 Hanan is still trying to find a place to live.
 
Despite that uncertainty, Asma wants to return to Gaza. My daughter is there. She needs me, Asma says. Every time she speaks to me, she asks when 
 
 I'm coming back. Every time there's an airstrike, children go to hug their mothers, and mine has no one to hug. 
 
At nearby Augusta Victoria Hospital, nearly 50 Gazan cancer patients have been receiving treatment since before October 7th, watching from afar as 
 
 their families endure the horrors of war. For Mohammed, one of the 10 who are in remission and being sent back to Gaza, being far away from his son 
 
 Hamza, who is blind, has been the hardest to bear. But going back is also terrifying. "I'm torn," he says. "The only wish I have in life is to go 
 
 back home. I regret even coming here for treatment. I wish I could be with them, because I know how they need me." 
 
In a statement, the Israeli agency in charge of their return said patients who have received medical treatment and who are not in need of further 
 
 medical care are returned to the Gaza Strip. After more than two months of pushing back on Israeli demands, Dr. Fadi Atrash says he was ordered to 
 
 compile a list of patients to be sent back to Gaza this week. 
 
FADI ATRASH, CEO, LWF AUGUSTA VICTORIA-HOSPITAL, EAST JERUSALEM: We don't want to send them, but it's not our call at the end of the day.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Now, he fears for his patients. 
 
ATRASH: All the support, all the efforts that we have been putting to try to cure them or to put them in a good condition or to improve their quality 
 
 of life will be lost, because there is no care in Gaza. There is no hospitals, there is no health care. The system is totally destroyed. 
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): The mothers are preparing for their journey. They've bought sweets and toys for the children who are waiting for them. If they 
 
 want to throw away all my belongings, they can, but not this bag for my daughter. It is all they can bring for the children who have endured so 
 
 much in six months. And the babies who will soon learn the reality of war far too young. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem.

ASHER: All right, the Princess of Wales was spotted out and about over the weekend with her husband. This is, by the way, the first real up-close 
 
 glimpse of Kate in months, actually. A British tabloid released this video of Kate and Prince William shopping near their home in Windsor. Kate, of 
 
 course, has been recovering from an abdominal surgery she underwent back in January. 
 
GOLODRYGA: In the absence of official information about the princess and her whereabouts, the rumor mill went into overdrive, fueled in part by the 
 
 controversy over a family photo she put out that turned out to have been edited. Well, now there's a claim that a photo taken by Kate of the late 
 
 Queen Elizabeth with grandchildren and great-grandchildren was also doctored. 
 
ASHER: CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster joins us live now from London. So, here we have in this video Kate and her husband out and about shopping 
 
 in Windsor. Kate looks perfectly fine. So you think the rumor mill would stop, but it's not doing enough to quench the thirst of the internet trolls 
 
 who are looking for something to say about this. A lot of people saying that it's fake, that it's not real. I mean, Max, why isn't this working? 
 
 Why isn't this doing enough to sort of stop the rumor mill? 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: I don't know. I think it's just gone so out of control. And there are two parts to it. I think there's the 
 
 genuine concern. People who are worried about Kate really want to know if she's okay. And I think for them, this video was reassuring. There's 
 
 nothing in it that suggests it's fake to us. And the palace aren't saying don't run it. So, they're not waving us away from it. It was taken, as we 
 
 understand it, by a customer on their phone. 
 
So, it was raw footage of her looking well with her husband, both of them looking really happy together, and does undermine a lot of the conspiracy 
 
 theories currently floating around. But I think, you know, when you look at a lot of these conspiracy theories, there are people looking for views on 
 
 their accounts. 
 
And they'll put anything out there that sort of fills a gap in people's knowledge. And at the moment, we've got this big sort of distrust with any 
 
 royal imagery at the moment. So it's very easy to knock even images that didn't come from the palace and say something else really happened.
 
ASHER: Yeah. And then on top of that, you've got the photograph with the queen and her great-grandchildren and all the sort of Photoshopping that 
 
 was involved in that, as well. Unfortunately, we are out of time, Max. I don't have -- I can't actually ask you about that because we don't have any 
 
 more time. 
 
FOSTER: You said it.
 
ASHER: I said it, right? I said it. 
 
FOSTER: No, that's the headline.
 
ASHER: I summed it up for both of us. 
 
GOLODRYGA: We'll have you back for more. 
 
ASHER: Yes. All right, Max Foster, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, still ahead for us, why China's richest man is losing billions with his bottled water company. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:51:45]
 
ASHER: Fans who paid to see football superstar Lionel Messi playing Hong Kong but didn't since he stayed on the bench will soon get some of their 
 
 money back. But only if they don't pursue any legal complaints -- that's according to news outlets. Organizer Tatler Asia is now offering a 50 
 
 percent refund for last month's friendly between Messi's Into Miami and their Hong Kong opponents.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, Messi's absence from the pitch caused an uproar among fans in Hong Kong and China who felt snubbed. But he insisted it was due to an 
 
 injury and not for any political reasons. Meantime, China's richest man is under attack from people who say he's not patriotic enough. The owner of 
 
 Nongfu Spring Bottled Water has already lost billions of dollars.
 
ASHER: Yeah, that's because detractors are slamming the company's packaging, saying that it's inspired by Japanese culture. CNN's Marc 
 
 Stewart explains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If you live here in China, there's a good chance you're drinking Nongfu Spring Bottled Water. It's the country's 
 
 biggest maker of bottled water and sold on almost every street corner, including here in Beijing. The company is owned by China's richest man, but 
 
 his wealth has been shrinking fast in recent weeks, thanks to an unexpected backlash. 
 
Zhong Shanshan is facing online attacks accused of being not patriotic enough, in part because of the designs of some of his product packaging. On 
 
 the bottles, you can see a temple, you can see a crane. Some Chinese people feel these images are inspired by Japanese culture. Now, that's upsetting 
 
 to some people because of long-standing animosity between the two countries. Some Chinese people even claim the red bottle cap resembles the 
 
 shape of the Japanese national flag. CNN has reached out to Nongfu Spring for comment. 
 
STEWART (voice-over): A perfect storm that has triggered a nationwide boycott, with people uploading videos of themselves pulling Nongfu Spring's 
 
 water off store shelves, all in the name of patriotism. All of this is proving to be a heavy blow to business. The online campaign has cut into 
 
 Nongfu's sales, as well as its share price, wiping about three billion dollars off its market capitalization since the end of February, according 
 
 to a CNN calculation. But views on the streets are much calmer.
 
UNKNOWN: We should have a fair and just attitude. We shouldn't be intensifying conflicts. That serves no good for our own government either.
 
UNKNOWN: Maybe it is inspired by Japanese architecture, but it could also be inspired by traditional Chinese architecture. If you look back in 
 
 history, didn't Japan learn from China, too? I think it's wrong to be connecting product design to politics. 
 
STEWART: As Beijing tries to rally behind the private sector in the midst of an economic slump, many worry this war on bottled water could see the 
 
 business community's confidence dry up even further. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.

GOLODRYGA: Our thanks to Marc for that report. And finally, hey Zain are you feeling lucky? 
 
ASHER: I am actually, I am.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, this one's for you. The jackpot for tonight's Mega Millions Lottery drawing is now approaching $900 million. That makes it the 
 
 sixth largest prize in the game's history. 
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
The massive jackpot is estimated at $875 million with a $413 million cash option. 
 
ASHER: Might go straight to the gas station to get my ticket right now. Your chances though, this is the sad reality of taking on the jackpot, are 
 
 more than one, or not more than, just one in more than 300 million. One in 300 million. But if you are extremely lucky and you do end up winning, here 
 
 are just a few of the things that you could buy. 
 
Eight yachts, 4000 Bentleys. Who came up with this? Four thousand Bentleys, okay, or 104,000 first-class round-trip tickets from New York to the city 
 
 of Tokyo. But if you do end up playing, two words for you. Good luck. Because the chances are not in your favor. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Hey, Zain, let's increase the odds. Buy me a ticket, too, I'll pay you back.
 
ASHER: Yes, yes, we'll do that. 
 
GOLODRYGA: We'll share the $200. 
 
ASHER: I'll still come to work.
 
GOLODRYGA: Bentleys.
 
ASHER: I'll still come to work if I do win. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Anyway, we'll figure out who put those numbers together. That does it for this hour of "One World". I'm Bianna Golodryga. 
 
ASHER: And I'm Zain Asher. Thank you so much for watching. Amanpour is up next.
