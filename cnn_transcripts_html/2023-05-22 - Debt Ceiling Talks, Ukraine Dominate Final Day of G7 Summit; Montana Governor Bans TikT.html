COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello to you and happy Monday to all my friends all across the country. Hope you had a great weekend. 
 
I was in Ocean City, Maryland, with my dad and brother for the annual car show there. Hot rods, muscle cars, cruisers, all sorts of awesome rides and 
 
 people. To Bryant, Nathaniel, Journey and Jada (ph) from Cape Henlopen High School in Milford, and Mariner Middle Schools, it was great to meet you.
 
Now this is going to be our last week together before the show goes on summer hiatus, so what do you say we get our engine started and go all gas, 
 
 no brakes and finish this school year strong. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. 
 
And we begin today with the G7 Summit or the Group of Seven summit. It`s where the world`s most powerful democracies meet to discuss a wide range of 
 
 issues, including economic policies, security, the climate, and energy issues. 
 
The G7 countries are the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Germany, France and Canada. But leaders from some non-G7 countries will 
 
 also participate this year. Australia, Brazil, Comoros, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, South Korea and Vietnam are also invited. 
 
This year is Japan`s turn to host, led by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The summit is in the Japanese city of Hiroshima, which is where, 
 
 as many of you know, the world`s first atomic bomb attack happened at the end of World War II in the 1940s. 
 
Hiroshima is the prime minister`s hometown as well and the host city was chosen to emphasize a determination to put nuclear disarmament at the top 
 
 of the agenda of this year`s summit. Key issues being discussed this year include growing aggression from China and North Korea and Russia`s invasion 
 
 of Ukraine. Ukraine`s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise appearance at the summit to address his nation`s ongoing conflict with 
 
 Russia. 
 
Now, while President Biden is at the summit, the debt ceiling limit is a growing concern back in the United States. The deadline to reach an 
 
 agreement is just a matter of days away, and President Biden addressed a stark warning about the debt limit as both the White House and 
 
 congressional Republicans remain at a standstill.
 
Our Phil Mattingly is in Japan with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The second full day of President Biden`s high-stakes appearance on the world 
 
 stage clouded by one reality.
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER:  We`ve got to get movement by the White House. And we don`t have any movement yet. 
 
MATTINGLY:  Even as he wakes up 7,000 miles away from Washington, Biden is no closer to resolving the looming crisis he left behind. 
 
REP. GARRETT GRAVES (R-LA):  Until people are willing to have reasonable conversations about how you can actually move forward and do the right 
 
 thing then we`re not going to sit here and talk to ourselves. And that`s what`s going on.
 
MATTINGLY:  House Republicans hitting pause on negotiations with the White House over a fiscal deal that would address the debt limit, less than two 
 
 weeks before the U.S. is set to default for the first time in its history with potentially catastrophic consequences for the global economy. Biden 
 
 leaving a working dinner of G7 leaders here in Hiroshima early on Thursday night to be briefed on the talks. 
 
His second briefing of the day on negotiations that are in desperate need of a breakthrough. A White House official telling CNN, quote, there are 
 
 real differences between the parties but that the president`s team is working hard towards a reasonable bipartisan solution. 
 
Biden`s domestic political challenge coming at the same moment U.S. officials are pressing to maintain and accelerate the steadfast support for 
 
 Ukraine. G7 leader is putting the conflict front and center in the first day of their summit in Japan, launching new sanctions and export curbs 
 
 designed to squeeze Russia`s ability to wage war, at the same time, Biden marking his own dramatic shift, delivering the message to his counterparts 
 
 that the U.S. will support a joint effort with allies to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation fighter jets, including F-16s. Those fighter 
 
 jets have been a top Ukrainian priority, as Russia`s invasion of the country grinds towards its 15th month, at an inflection point with allies 
 
 rapidly moving to provide new defense capabilities as Ukrainian forces prepare for a long-awaited counter-offensive.
 
Those efforts set to receive a dramatic boost by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy`s last-minute decision to travel to the G7 leader 
 
 summit this weekend. It`s Zelenskyy`s latest visit to rally`s support after securing commitments for additional aid in European capitals last week, 
 
 before a stop in Saudi Arabia where he addressed the Arab League Summit.
 
And President Zelenskyy is expected to participate on Sunday in meetings with G7 leaders. President Biden is expected to be meeting on issues like 
 
 climate, issues like infrastructure but a central focus or an overarching focus on the issue of China.

WIRE:  Next up, a TikTok takedown. Montana has become the first U.S. state to sign a bill banning the download of the popular app due to privacy and 
 
 security concerns. 
 
TikTok says that more than million Americans are active users on their platform known for sharing short videos of anything from dance challenges, 
 
 food recipes, inspiration, motivation, how-to tutorials, comedians and more. And for their part, TikTok maintains that all user information on 
 
 their platform is safe.
 
Our Brian Todd has more from Montana.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For the first time, a U.S. state has completely banned TikTok, sort of. Montana Governor Greg 
 
 Gianforte signing a bill that bans downloading the app in Montana. Individuals who already have TikTok won`t be prosecuted for using it, but 
 
 App Stores like Apple or Google Play would be fine if they let anyone in Montana download it.
 
The Montana ban will probably face strong challenges in court, but it`s the latest salvo against the popular app that nearly half of Americans use for 
 
 sharing short videos, of everything from goofy stunts, to food recipes and dance challenges. Critics call it a security threat because a Chinese 
 
 company owns TikTok.
 
REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R-WA):  To the American people watching today, hear this, TikTok is a weapon by the Chinese communist party to spy on you, 
 
 manipulate what you see and exploit for future generations.
 
TODD:  The most serious warnings, that personal data could be stolen, privacy compromised.
 
JAMES LEWIS, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES:  That`s the main concern is this Chinese software controlled by the Chinese state and 
 
 you are downloading it onto -- voluntarily downloading it onto your phone. 
 
TODD:  Critics say TikTok users could be spied on and blackmailed. One analyst says China could use the app to take a page out of Vladimir Putin`s 
 
 playbook and create misinformation campaigns to influence American politics.
 
LEWIS:  Maybe downplay stories about what`s going on in China, that they don`t want people to see maybe exaggerate stories about how things aren`t 
 
 going so well in the U.S.
 
TikTok`s CEO recently told skeptical lawmakers the company doesn`t share user data, doesn`t spy for Beijing, and doesn`t take orders on content. 
 
SHOU CHEW, CEO, TIKTOK:  It is our commitment to this community and all our users that we will keep this free from any manipulation of any government. 
 
 We will protect the U.S. user data and fire it all from all unwanted foreign access.
 
RODGERS:  Your platform should be banned.
 
TODD:  More than half of U.S. states and the federal government have already restricted the TikTok app from being installed on government 
 
 devices. Defenders of the app say there`s no evidence TikTok has spied on users at the Chinese government`s behest or turned over data. And --  
 
REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY):  We`re talking about free speech for everyday Americans.
 
TODD:  And the Chinese government calls talk of a ban a xenophobic witch hunt. But analysts say if the Chinese regime does decide to pressure TikTok 
 
 for information, by Chinese law, the company can`t say no.
 
PROF. AYNNE KOKAS, AUTHOR, "TRAFFICKING DATA: HOW CHINA IS WINNING":  Are there pressures from the Chinese government that eventually make their way 
 
 down to TikTok? Absolutely.
 
TODD:  In a statement to CNN, TikTok vowed to defend the rights of its users in Montana, saying the governor has signed a bill that infringes on 
 
 the First Amendment rights of people in the state. TikTok calls the ban unlawful and says it wants to reassure Montanans that they can continue to 
 
 use the platform to express themselves.

WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:
 
Which of these is not one of the new Seven Wonders of the World?
 
The Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, the Colosseum, or the pyramids of Egypt?
 
Considered a wonder of the ancient world, the pyramids of Egypt are not on the list of new world wonders.
 
(MUSIC)
 
WIRE:  A Guinness World Record for visiting all Seven New Wonders of the World in less than seven days -- well, that`s today`s story getting a 10 
 
 out of 10.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Come on, a new Guinness World Record.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  With only a backpack, British traveler Jamie McDonald whose alter ego is "Adventureman" started his trek by walking parts of the Great Wall 
 
 of China. He traveled to the Taj Mahal in India, the Petra in Jordan, Colosseum in Rome, then headed to South America to the Christ the Redeemer 
 
 statue in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, and finish it up at Chichen Itza in Mexico. Nine countries, four continents in less than a week, and he 
 
 traveled the 22,000 some miles using only public transportation, 13 flights, 16 taxis, nine buses, four trains, and a toboggan. 
 
Perhaps the most inspiring part -- when he was 9 years old, Jamie was diagnosed with a rare spine disorder and doctors thought he`d have trouble 
 
 even walking for the rest of his life. W, Jamie.
 
I want to give us a special shout out today to Mrs. Williams class at North Forsyth Middle School here in Georgia. We see you.
 
Thanks for the love and thanks for watching, everyone. I`ll see you tomorrow. I`m Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10.
