CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR:  CNN's Sophia Saifi live in Islamabad, Pakistan with more. What is expected from today's hearing, Sophia?
 
SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER:  Christine, we have absolutely no idea. We've tried to speak to Khan's lawyers here. Right behind me is the compound where Imran Khan is actually being held at the police headquarters here in Islamabad. We've been told by Imran Khan's lawyers who have been coming here in an attempt to meet him that they haven't had any contact with their client for more than 24 hours now.
 
The internet remains shut down.
 
(Audio gap). Just about a kilometer from here there are clashes that are taking place between riot police and Imran Khan supporters who are trying to come close to the compound where he's being kept. We can actually see tear gas when we go around the corner from where I am standing. 
 
There is a sense of unease in this country. This is a state of political tension that has been brewing ever since Imran Khan was ousted as prime minister back in April. The country's economy is in the doldrums. There is an IMF known that has not been completed. Pakistan's current government has been attempting to make that happen. There has been a lot resting on certainty on this happening in this country but Imran Khan is an incredibly popular politician.
 
The police tried to arrest him about two times in the month of March and it is paramilitary troops that eventually went out and got him at Islamabad high court. They actually broke through the glass when he was sitting there trying to get his biometric verification done, and then he was dragged away. Nobody has heard from him since, let alone his lawyers. 
 
We are waiting to see when he will make an appearance in this special court behind me. It was supposed to happen at 8:30 in the morning. It's now 2:30 in the afternoon. There is a continuous sense of unease -- Christine.
 
ROMANS:  All right, Sophia. Keep us posted. Thank you for that.
 
All right, quick hits around the globe right now. AFP video journalist Arman Soldin was killed in Eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Soldin was killed by rocket fire on the outskirts of a town near the highly contested area of Bakhmut. 
 
Prince Harry's phone hacking trial against Mirror group newspapers is expected to start shortly in London. The Duke of Sussex is alleging that he and friends and family were the victims of unlawful information gathering by the tabloid publisher.
 
All right, olive oil prices spiking, due in part to ongoing droughts in Spain. A top producer of the product, the International Monetary Fund, says global olive oil prices have hit a 26-year- high. 
 
All right. More troops head to the border today as Title 42 migrant rules run out. And the new top dog at Westminster named after a rock star.

ROMANS:  A Manhattan jury has found former President Trump sexually abused columnist and writer E. Jean Carroll in a Manhattan department store dressing room in 1996. Trump was found liable for battery and defamation and ordered to pay Carroll $5 million.
 
Carroll was seen emerging from court after the verdict was read and later said in a statement the verdict was a victory for her and other victims of abuse.
 
Trump says he will appeal the verdict.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I don't even know who this woman is. I have no idea who she is or where she came from. This is another scam. It's a political witch hunt.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMANS:  Let's bring in CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Good morning, Joey.
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Good morning, Christine.
 
ROMANS:  So the jury clearly disagreed with Donald Trump there. They found that he sexually abused Carroll -- sufficient to hold him liable for battery. They didn't find that he raped her -- that Carroll proved that he raped her. 
 
What do you make of this verdict?
 
JACKSON:  Yes. I think it's a compelling verdict of vindication after certainly, many years. I mean, we're talking about 1996 in a department store and we're talking about a person who waited a long time and was really demeaned in significant ways. When I talk about the demeaning, I'm speaking about the defamation.
 
And so, yes, there was the absence, Christine, of the finding of rape, which essentially relates to the intercourse. But they did find the touching as it concerns intimate parts of the body -- that would be unlawful. 
 
At the end of the day, in English, battery is essentially the touching of someone without their consent. The jury found that happened. And the jury additionally found that she was defamed by Mr. Trump calling her a liar and a hoaxer. 
 
And so I think ultimately, with that and the finding of a $5 million verdict, I think this is a win in all respects for Ms. Carroll who brought this forward, and I think in a very brave and courageous way. 
 
ROMANS:  The jury clearly deemed her credible. She was corroborated by sort of recent witnesses -- two friends at the time that she had told about this. They showed that "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" video. 
 
Any of that grounds for appeal? Trump is, as usual, saying this is political and completely denying it and vowing to appeal. Does he have a case on any of those elements do you think?
 
JACKSON:  So I think certainly, there will be an appeal. I think two significant grounds, one being -- you mentioned both of them. 
 
One being the "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" tape -- the extent to which it should have been admitted into evidence, right? The argument will be that trials need to be about what they're about. Whether the actual battery at that time -- the rape -- sexual abuse in this context, and defamation -- or whether there was not. And so, when you look at the "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" tape the argument will be that prejudiced the jury. 
 
However, Christine, remember that this is permitted by law. The fact is if there's evidence out there which goes to show motive or intent, it can -- and in this case, was admissible. 
 
Additionally, as it relates to the two other victims of Mr. Trump who alleged that he touched them, that's what we call prior bad acts. And if those prior bad acts also establish that that's your motivation -- that's your modus operandi -- then that can be admissible too.
 <br>[05:40:05]
 
So yes, will they be grounds for appeal, absolutely. Will they be successful? That's a very open question.
 
And I think the judge was very thoughtful in permitting those two to testify. Certainly, there could have been substantially others who the judge could have allowed.
 
ROMANS:  Yes.
 
JACKSON:  The judge allowed those, too. So I think it was certainly -- in the context of this I think it was proper.
 
ROMANS:  Quickly, Joey, I want to switch to this New York congressman who now we know has been criminally charged -- George Santos -- by the Department of Justice. We don't know what the charges are. 
 
What do you think he's facing here?
 
JACKSON:  Yes. I think that this is about the misrepresentations and about the fraud that he's engaged in, and I think to really get that seat. Now, whether it's about the campaign misrepresentation -- is there other fraudulent activities that people believe him to and he's allegedly engaged in, we're going to find out. 
 
We know that as you noted, Christine, it's sealed. That means that right now we don't get to evaluate and parse the indictment. But it would have to be a person who essentially is living a life of fabrication and lied --
 
ROMANS:  Yes.
 
JACKSON:  -- to be where he is. I think that we could look in that indictment about significant acts of fraud and misconduct that should and could lead to accountability.
 
ROMANS:  All right, Joey Jackson, CNN legal analyst. Nice to see you this morning. Thank you, Joey.
 
JACKSON:  Thank you, Christine.
 
ROMANS:  All right, here is today's fast-forward lookahead.
 
Five hundred fifty U.S. troops set to begin supporting southern border officials today with monitoring data entry, warehouse support. Another 950 troops will arrive before the end of the month.
 
New York Congressman George Santos, as you heard, expected to appear in court today. The Justice Department has filed criminal charges against him under seal in the Eastern District of New York.
 
President Biden heading to Upstate New York today where he will deliver remarks on the debit limit. He is expected to discuss why Congress must avoid default immediately and without conditions.
 
All right, to sports. The 76ers dominating game five in Boston to push the Celtics to the brink of elimination.
 
Andy Scholes has this morning's Bleacher Report. Hey, Andy.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Christine.
 
So, I mean, Boston fans -- they're close to a meltdown. After the Bruins flamed out in the first round after their best season ever, if this Celtics team loses in the second round it's going to be a long summer in Boston. 
 
MVP Joel Embiid and the Sixers just controlling this game from the start. Embiid had 33 points. Tyrese Maxey having a big game as well. He went for 30. 
 
And the home fans there booing the Celtics as they never made a run in the second half. Now, Boston did come back from down 3-2 to the Bucks last year in the playoffs but this, obviously, not ideal.
 
The 76ers win game five 115-103 and are now a win away from the first conference final since 2001.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOEL EMBIID, PHILADELPHIA 76ERS CENTER:  I only care about one thing -- is winning. We've got a pretty good chance after winning this game in front of our fans. We got a jump on them from the -- just like tonight, from the start. We've got to send a message and got to be aggressive offensively and defensively.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  Elsewhere, Nikola Jokic with some jokes before game five of the Nuggets-Suns. He handed Suns owner Mat Ishbia a ball and shook his hand as he left the court after warming up. Jokic was fined $25,000 for the scuffle in game four and Jokic was hoping Ishbia would pay that fine. 
 
Well, then during the game, Jokic and Kevin Durant having a moment. Durant given a technical for shoving Jokic right there. 
 
Now, as for the game, Jokic was doing it all last night. He had 29 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists as Denver dominated, winning 118- 102 to get within a win of the conference final.
 
You've got two more big games tonight. The eight-seed Heat trying to eliminate the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, while LeBron and the Lakers trying to close out Steph Curry and the Warriors. The action gets started at 7:30 Eastern on TNT.
 
The Hurricanes, meanwhile, now just a win away from eliminating the New Jersey Devils from the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Carolina cruising to a 6-1 win after a huge second period last night. They scored four goals in less than 5 1/2 minutes to take a commanding 3-1 series lead. The Canes can wrap it up and advance to the Eastern Conference final with a win tomorrow night at home in Raleigh. 
 
The Georgia Bulldogs, meanwhile, will not be visiting the White House to celebrate their second consecutive national title. The team declining an invitation to come in June, saying that the date suggested was not feasible given the student-athlete calendar and time of year. 
 
The Bulldogs did not visit the White House after the championship last year, nor did the Alabama Crimson Tide the year before. That one was due to COVID-related reasons.
 
All right, and finally, there is a new top dog at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. A Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen named Buddy Holly was named Best in Show last night beating out the more than 3,000 pups representing 210 breeds. The hound is the first of his breed to win the top prize in the show's 147-year history. 
 <br>[05:45:05]
 
Buddy Holly's handler and co-owner Janice Hayes couldn't hold back her tears of joy after winning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JANICE HAYES, BUDDY HOLLY'S HANDLER AND CO-OWNER:  I have dreamed of this since I was nine years old. So I'm not going to tell you how many years ago but it's been a while. And this breed I've been passionate about for over 20 years and to do it with a dog of this quality is -- and to have the breeder here and my husband -- and hi, everyone at home. We just won Best in Show at Westminster.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  Congrats to Janice there and Buddy Holly, Christine. What a good-looking dog.
 
ROMANS:  And congrats to you. Your high school French paying off there. That was well done.
 
SCHOLES:  (Laughing).
 
ROMANS:  Well done.
 
SCHOLES:  I practiced all morning.
 
ROMANS:  All right, nice to see you. Thanks, Andy.
 
SCHOLES:  All right.
 
ROMANS:  Coming up on "CNN THIS MORNING" fired Fox host Tucker Carlson wants to take his show to Twitter. Can he legally do that?
 
And next, right here, the labor shortage in America. Why it could be here to stay.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[05:50:07]
 
ROMANS:  All right. Your Romans' Numeral this morning is eight. Prices online now dropping for an eighth month in a row, down 1.8 percent in April compared to last year. 
 
Online prices fell in 11 of the 18 categories tracked by Adobe. Computers down more than 15 percent. Appliances down over seven percent. Toys down nearly six percent. Important information in the inflation story.
 
Looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished lower. A weak consumer spending reading in Japan. European markets are down slightly here. And on Wall Street, stock index futures also leaning lower this morning. Stocks fell yesterday as debt ceiling talks began in Washington. 
 
Also, big news. A big order for Boeing. European airline Ryanair has struck a deal to buy up to $40 billion worth of 737 MAX jets.
 
On inflation watch, gas prices held steady overnight at $3.53 a gallon. And April's Consumer Price Index will be released at 8:30 Eastern. The forecast showing a five percent increase in inflation from a year ago. CPI is forecast to rise just 0.4 percent if you look at it month-over-month. 
 
All right, the U.S. labor shortage could be here to stay. Let's bring in Axios markets correspondent Emily Peck. Emily, where are the workers? I mean, this has been the big story, right, in the recovery from COVID. There just aren't enough workers. Why, and why are you arguing those labor shortages could be here to stay?
 
EMILY PECK, MARKETS CORRESPONDENT, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes, absolutely, there aren't still enough workers. Americans of working age are back to where they were before the pandemic. It's something like 83 percent of Americans of working age are working.
 
The big problem is Americans are getting older, right, so the population over 55 has doubled, or something like that, over the past 20 years. That means more Americans are, in fact, too old to work and that's a problem that's going to worsen over the coming years unless steps are taken to ameliorate it. And that is why the labor shortage is here to stay.
 
ROMANS:  Yes. Talk to me about the industries where they're seeing labor shortages -- manufacturing, leisure, and hospitality. How does the -- how does, I guess, the aging of that demographic affect those sectors?
 
PECK:  Yes. So each sector is going to be hit a little bit different. 
 
The reporting I've done -- it looks like health care jobs, especially the lower-wage health care jobs -- we're going to be seeing shortages there probably for the long term, even as this very hot job market cools off a bit. Demand for low-wage health care workers -- think like home health aides -- is going to soar again because the population is getting older and there's going to be more of a need for these kinds of workers. And there's likely not going to be enough and that could be a long-term problem. 
 
Other sectors will probably figure out ways to automate. I mean, you're already seeing that, right, when you walk into, like, any drugstore -- CVS. You go to the automatic checkout and things like that. You can expect to see more of that happening, especially with the advent of AI and things like that.
 
ROMANS:  Yes. We were -- I mean, we were recently at McDonald's. I took the kids through McDonald's and there -- I didn't even see a person. Everything was automated there.
 
I wonder if immigration fits into this story here. If you're talking about all of these low-wage jobs that need to be filled in health care, for example, is immigration part of the solution?
 
PECK:  That is such a good question. Yes, there are a few levers that policymakers could pull and certainly, immigration is one of them. Among the advanced economies that are sort of, for now, dodging this bullet, they've had just more migration than the U.S. has had. So certainly, if we wanted to avoid labor shortages for years and years to come we could increase immigration. We could have more immigrants coming in.
 
And there are a few other things we could do also. Another thing the U.S. could do would be encourage more women to come into the labor force. Women's labor force participation is still lower than men's --
 
ROMANS:  Yes.
 
PECK:  -- in the U.S. and lags behind other countries. So if we wanted to we could try -- I say we but I mean U.S. policymakers could engineer something -- you know, more childcare, more maternity leave, and things like that to get more women into the workforce. That could also ameliorate the shortage.
 
ROMANS:  Sure. There are solutions. It is a -- it is a solvable problem.
 
Emily Peck, Axios markets correspondent, thank you so much. 
 
PECK:  Thank you.
 
ROMANS:  All right. New York Congressman George Santos now facing criminal charges. Details in the exclusive CNN reporting ahead. And the number of migrants keeps surging at the southern border. What President Biden says about how chaotic things will get coming up on "CNN THIS MORNING."
