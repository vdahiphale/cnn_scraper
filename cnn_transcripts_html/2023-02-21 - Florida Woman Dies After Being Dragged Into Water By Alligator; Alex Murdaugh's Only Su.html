VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: Florida Wildlife officials are investigating the death of an elderly woman who was dragged into a pond by an alligator that's close to 11 feet long.
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA: CNN's Leyla Santiago is in Miami. So, Leyla, give us the details. How did this happen?
 
LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Victor, Bianna, we now have the incident report from Fish and Wildlife, and so we're getting more of the details of what led up to this and how it happened, who was involved. We have now learned that it was an 85-year-old woman by the name of Gloria Serge of Fort Pierce.
 
She was walking her dog out right over on the edge of a pond that was right behind her house, as you mentioned, was an alligator that was described by the sheriff as (INAUDIBLE) alligator. The images show you exactly how big this alligator was.
 
And -- give me 1 second here. OK. Can you hear me?
 
BLACKWELL: We got you.
 
SANTIAGO: OK.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
SANTIAGO: One, two, three, I'm -- OK. One, two -- can you hear me OK?
 
GOLODRYGA: We hear you. We hear you.
 
SANTIAGO: Can you hear me OK?
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
SANTIAGO: Can you hear me? OK. You can hear me OK?
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. SANTIAGO: OK, OK, good to know. Sorry. Apologies. I understand there were some audio issues, so I want to make sure that you can hear me. I'll go back to what we have learned since we had the incident report that came out from Fish and Wildlife in just the last few hours telling us that it was 85-year-old Gloria Serge who was walking her dog along the pond, rather, right behind her home.
 <br>[15:35:09]
 
And in that moment, an 11-foot alligator, as the sheriff described it, as you see a big, big alligator in the images that we have shown you, that alligator came out, tried to go after the dog. In that moment, Serge was knocked down and then she was pulled into the bond -- into the pond and died.
 
As you might imagine. Horrifying moment for neighbors. Listen to how they described it.

SEAN HIGGINS, NEIGHBOR: It's scary. That's really scary. They're around here, they move from pond to pond.
 
MICHAEL LOVE, NEIGHBOR: It's my understanding that he attacked a woman and I understand that she died. So I wanted him out of here. I wanted euthanized.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANTIAGO: And the alligator was, in fact, caught and euthanized, according to Fish and Wildlife. Now listen, Fish and Wildlife will be very quick to point out that, yes, this was tragic, a horrifying event for anyone in that neighborhood. But also something that still remains very rare, across the 67 counties of Florida, you're talking about 1.3 million alligators.
 
So it's something very common for people in Florida here to see. Why Fish and Wildlife are very much stressing the importance of those safety protocols, not to feed the alligators and to make sure you keep your distance. Bianna, Victor?
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. Having lived in Florida for seven years, this is something you hear every few years.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
BLACKWELL: And when you hear those numbers, you really understand that this is especially rare a tragedy, nonetheless. Leyla Santiago, glad we got that audio situation worked out. Thank you for the report.
 
GOLODRYGA: Thanks, Leyla.
 
Well, today in the double murder trial of Alex Murdaugh, the former South Carolina attorney's only living son took the stand in his father's defense. BLACKWELL: Yes, he's the first witness, the defense's called as his attorneys attempt to paint the former South Carolina attorney as a loving father and husband. CNN's Randi Kaye has been following the trial. What did he tell the jury?
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hello to both of you. This is the first member of the Murdaugh family to testify as a witness at this trial. He talked a lot about golfing with his dad, hunting with his dad, birthday parties with his dad, and they also talked quite a bit about evidence, including the shotgun that Paul Murdaugh was killed with.
 
There was a buckshot and a bird shot in that shotgun. And he testified that nobody in his family, which would include his father, would ever load a weapon with a buckshot and a bird shot. He also talked about how Alex Murdaugh often misplaced his phone. We know that Alex Murdaugh didn't have any activity at all on his phone from 8:09 to 9:02 p.m. and the murders took place in that window. So that was also a key piece of testimony.
 
And then he also talked about his father's bathing habits because Alex Murdaugh, according to testimony, had changed clothes before and after the murders. On the day of the murders, he was wearing two different outfits. One scene earlier in a Snapchat video, long pants and a blue shirt. And then later, after the murders, in shorts and a white t- shirt.
 
Here's that exchange with Buster in court.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How frequently would your dad take a shower or bath?
 
BUSTER MURDAUGH, ALEX MURDAUGH'S SON: He could take him a lot and he -- yes. Working out there. If he goes outside and sweats a lot, comes back in and takes a shower.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was that normal routine for him?
 
MURDAUGH: It was.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAYE: And this was really key because the state has suggested that Alex Murdaugh killed his family, then washed up and changed clothes. And one other note, he was never, ever asked on the stand. Nobody -- none of the lawyers asked Buster Murdaugh if his father was capable of this, if he might do something like this.
 
No one ever asked him that directly. He talked very much about what a loving family it was, but was never asked that directly. Victor, Bianna?
 
GOLODRYGA: Interesting. Randi Kaye, thank you. BLACKWELL: United Airlines has announced a new family seating policy that's designed to keep children from being separated from the parents and to do it without an extra fee. Details next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:43:47]
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, new today, the Biden administration just announcing a major rules change for asylum seekers.
 
BLACKWELL: It would impact people trying to reach the U.S. through other countries, including Mexico. CNN White House Reporter Priscilla Alvarez is here with details. So, what do you know?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, this is the most restrictive measure that the administration has taken so far in their patchwork of policies to try to manage the U.S.-Mexico border. And administration officials just moments ago told reporters they have to take these steps to try to manage what is mass migration across the Western Hemisphere.
 
So here's what could possibly change. So, first of all, U.S. law permits migrants who are seeking asylum to do so regardless of how they arrived on U.S. soil. What this rule would do is essentially presume ineligibility based on how they arrived.
 
So if they passed through multiple countries on their way to the U.S.- Mexico border but didn't seek refuge in those countries, they would be ineligible to apply for asylum in the United States. That is a market difference and one that is a departure from decades long protocol.
 
Now, of course, there are exceptions. And what the administration is trying to do here is have migrants apply for lawful pathways to the United States, including some of the programs that they recently rolled out for certain nationalities. That allows them to come for temporary periods and apply for asylum once they are in the United States.
 <br>[15:45:10]
 
For example, this was the case for Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans. Now, an administration official told reporters bluntly, this was not our first preference or our second, saying that it's really on Congress to pass immigration reform.
 
And the interim, they're going to have to take measures to try to manage the flow of migration, especially looking on the horizon when they may lose that COVID era border restriction known as Title 42 that allows authorities to turn migrants away. That is set to expire in May, though, of course, it is still part of litigation.
 
And when that is to happen, they say these are the measures that are going to help them. Victor?
 
BLACKWELL: Priscilla Alvarez for us there, thank you so much. GOLODRYGA: Health experts are warning that there is a shortage of black doctors right now, which will have a direct and negative impact on the country's public health. We'll explain how after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:50:27]
 
BLACKWELL: Right now, fewer than 6 percent of doctors in the U.S. identify as black or African American. That's despite the fact that the community makes up 12 percent of the country's total population. And that's raising concerns about the impact on public health.
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard joins us now. So, Jacqueline, what is being done to rectify this?
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: That's the thing, Bianna. More needs to be done to make sure that our physician workforce herein the U.S. reflects the diversity seen among patients. Now, what has been done so far? We've seen more efforts to get STEM programs in grade schools.
 
At the medical school level, we've seen more mentorship programs, particularly for students of color. But when you look at the physician workforce right now, active doctors at this moment, we're still seeing 5.7 percent are black or African American. And that's compared with, as Victor said, 12 percent of the U.S. population.
 
When you look at Native Americans, less than 1 percent of doctors are Native American. And that's compared with up to 2 percent of patients. When you look at Hispanic or Latino physicians, 6.9 percent are doctors, compared with up to 18 percent of the U.S. population. So those differences are what's concerning here. And experts say we need to do more to make sure our doctor workforce reflects the diversity seen among patients.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, we need to do more because the research shows, and we've discussed this before, the benefits of a more diverse work force. Often, sometimes doctors will dismiss the concerns -- 
 
HOWARD: Yes.
 
BLACKWELL: -- or symptoms of a certain demographic, explain what the studies show.
 
HOWARD: Exactly, Victor. And research shows that when we have a more diverse physician workforce, there's more understanding and more trust between the patient and the doctor. If the doctor has an understanding of the patient's cultural experiences, cultural background, lived experiences, especially when it comes to racism or discrimination or other aspects of their life, that can help with that physician-patient relationship.
 
And we also see that patients are more likely to follow a physician's medical advice if they do have a feeling of being heard and understood. So all this plays a role in really improving public health, Victor and Bianna.
 
BLACKWELL: Jacqueline Howard, thank you so much.
 
So as President Biden underscores America's support for Ukraine today, Russia unleashes a new round of attacks, leaving at least six people dead in the city of Kherson. We have details.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:57:20]
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, United Airlines is making it easier for families to sit together when they fly. Let's assume families do want to sit together. Most do.
 
BLACKWELL: Together with them (ph).
 
GOLODRYGA: With the new seating policy aimed at cater to travelers with children who are under the age of twelve. Now you may remember President Biden calling for this change in a state of the union address earlier this month.
 
BLACKWELL: CNN's Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean is here to explain how this will work. Some people want their kids to sit in row 31.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, it depends on how old the kids are.
 
BLACKWELL: OK. But tell us about this plan.
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: But some people want their kids next to them.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
MUNTEAN: And that's the big deal here, you know, because -- 
 
BLACKWELL: Yes.
 
MUNTEAN: -- when you travel as a family, you know, families complain about this a lot and it's a huge priority for the Biden administration and now it's sort of becoming one for the airlines. You know, the issue here is that they would have to essentially plead at the gate or at the ticket counter to try and make it so that you can sit next to your kid essentially free of charge.
 
And what United Airlines is doing here is putting out a seat map where if you book a basic economy ticket, you can sit next to your child under 12, no charge. Remember, all of those seat selection fee, those can really add up. Think about it. If you're flying with a family, two, three, four kids, that really, really piles on on top of the existing ticket price.
 
So this is a huge thing for the Biden administration because they say, you know, the airlines really ticky tack on all of these fees, especially when it comes to baggage seat selection. They say that you just can't treat family members like baggage. And that's almost the exact quote that President Biden used during his State of the Union address when he was addressing these junk fees, not only in the airline industry, but also across so many industries.
 
Want you to listen to that now and just how impassioned he was about this problem.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And will prohibit airlines from charging $50 round trip for family just to be able to sit together. Baggage fees are bad enough. Airlines can't treat your child like a piece of baggage.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MUNTEAN: Think about this. On some airlines, you might have to get charged $139 as much on American Airlines to choose your seat, as much as $200 on some budget carriers like Spirit Airlines. You know, consumer advocates say this is a great start. But the federal government really needs to take this one step further and enact a law to make it so that airlines cannot charge you extra if you want to sit next to a young family member.
 
It's a really big development here. Although consumer advocates say just maybe not enough just yet.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right, Pete Muntean. And of course, Victor was kidding. He would never want to separate families on airplanes.
 
BLACKWELL: I'm not -- I mean, I'm noy looking to separate families, but if you want to be separate from your family -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: You're not excuse now -- 
 
BLACKWELL: -- you should have the option. Just saying.
 
MUNTEAN: Maybe it was.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: That's a different airline.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right, thank you so much.
