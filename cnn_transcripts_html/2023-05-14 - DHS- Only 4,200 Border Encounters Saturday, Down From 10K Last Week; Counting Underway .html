DENNY KELLINGTON, ASSISTANT ATHLETIC TRAINER, BUFFALO BILLS: We are ready. It's a bit odd to be the person reporters are talking about when they say Danny Kellington is a hero, it is very humbling.
 
I've said repeatedly that I am not a hero, but I will tell you what I was that day, I was ready.
 
When unexpected doors open or life changes course, trust that your experiences have led you there and you will be ready.

ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN HOST: Kellington's career advice for the graduating OSU Sooners was that small things done with passion and intention have the potential to make a lasting impact.
 
Great message.
 <br>[15:00:38]
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, HOST: Hello, I'm Alex Marquardt, in today for Fredricka Whitfield. Thank you so much for joining us on this Mother's Day and Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there.
 
We do begin this hour at the US-Mexico border where the number of migrant crossing has dwindled significantly in the three days since Title 42 expired, that COVID-era immigration policy had allowed for near instant deportations and in the days prior to its expiration, the US had seen record migrants trying to enter the United States.
 
But today, Department of Homeland Security officials say they've seen a 50 percent drop in the number of migrant crossings in the last three days. Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, he says it is a credit to the work that the Biden administration has been doing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: The numbers that we have experienced over the past two days are markedly down over what they were prior to the end of Title 42.
 
We have communicated very clearly a vitally important message to the individuals who are thinking of arriving at our southern border. There is a lawful, safe and orderly way to arrive in the United States. That is through the pathways that President Biden has expanded in an unprecedented way, and then there's a consequence if one does not use those lawful pathways, and that consequence is removal from the United States, a deportation and encountering a five-year ban on re-entry and possible criminal prosecution.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: CNN's Arlette Saenz is back with us from the White House. Arlette, what else is the White House now saying about the situation at the border?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alex, the Biden administration has defended their actions when it comes to the lifting of Title 42 even as they face political criticism and some legal challenges along the way.
 
You heard the Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas there talk about how the steps that they have put in place had helped to lead to a bit of a decrease in the encounters that they've seen since the lifting of Title 42.
 
Now he did acknowledge that it is too early to say whether that surge has reached its peak. But if you take a look at the numbers, there has been a significant decrease in the number of encounters since Title 42 lifted. Just yesterday, there were 4,200 encounters; the day before 6,300.
 
If you compare that to before when Title 42 was in place, 9,600; over 10,000 on Wednesday and higher than that on Tuesday. So we will see how those encounters continue to play out over the course of the next few days.
 
But the White House and the Biden administration has been quite forceful in defending their positions and in the policy that they've put in place. In the meantime, they've been facing criticism from both sides of the aisle. People -- Democrats and Republicans saying that they've been insufficiently prepared for this moment and some within their own party also questioning the tightening of asylum rules.
 
The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the administration challenging their rule that would prevent migrants who are transiting through other countries from seeking asylum in the US. The Biden administration says that they need to seek asylum in those countries before trying to come here.
 
Additionally, there are a host of other legal challenges that the administration is facing at this moment. Chief among those is a ruling down in Florida by a federal judge who has blocked the Biden administration's plan to release migrants from CBP custody without set court dates.
 
That's something that previous administrations have used in the past to try to ease capacity concerns. But now that program, that plan is on hold for roughly two weeks. Now, the Justice Department has appealed that. They have asked for a stay and if they don't get that stay by tomorrow afternoon, they are going to go to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to ask for an emergency request.
 
That is just one of the tools that the administration is trying to use at this moment as they're grappling with the lifting of Title 42 and the impact it will have on the border.
 
MARQUARDT: All right, Arlette Saenz kicking us off at the White House, thank you very much.
 
Now many of these migrants have spent weeks if not months trying to go through the legal process to enter the United States. We find our CNN's Polo Sandoval near the border in El Paso, Texas.
 
Polo, you've been speaking to so many of these people who have made this trek who are now going through this process. What are they telling you?
 <br>[15:05:13]
 
SANDOVAL: And for those that stay behind, Alex, they are basically in the state of limbo. Many of the asylum seekers who I have had an opportunity to speak to in some of the area shelters here in El Paso, they have been apprehended, processed, and then released by federal authorities.
 
So now, they are waiting in some of these shelters, waiting to find out exactly what comes next. And for many of these, it's not necessarily the when, but if they will be able to secure the resources to get either on a bus or an airplane as they can legally do, and then travel to any of the cities that we've seen those upticks in arrivals of asylum seekers.
 
When speaking to some of the asylum seekers, they tell us a Denver is one city; Chicago, DC, but certainly New York City continues to be sort of the north star for so many of these individuals.
 
So those numbers in terms of the folks who are arriving in those American cities, those numbers are going to continue to rise. In some, it'll be a few dozen a day, but New York City, it'll be perhaps a couple of hundred a day, which is what I've heard from sources in New York City.
 
But in terms of that 50 percent decrease that Arlette just went over, here is what that means for folks here on the border, on the frontlines of the nation, that lack of a spike in illegal crossings, that will likely mean an opportunity for DHS officials to pretty much catch up with processing the tens of thousands of asylum seekers that turn themselves in the moments leading up to the expiration of Title 42.
 
But as we saw in some recently filed federal court documents, CBP senior official believes that there is potential for those apprehensions to go from perhaps the 4,000 that we saw yesterday per day to make it well over 10,000.
 
Now, whether or not we see that play out, that is something that we might potentially have to monitor, obviously, for the next couple of days.
 
But it just speaks to the situation on the ground, the lack of a spike in crossings, it gives opportunity, basically to reset the system, not just DHS officials, but also for those that are running the shelters to make sure that those folks that they have in their facilities can secure passage north -- Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, those numbers could soon quickly rise again.
 
Polo Sandoval in El Paso, thank you so much for all of your reporting.
 
Now to Turkey, where the polls have closed in the high stakes presidential election and the votes are now being counted in this pivotal race that really will have global repercussions.
 
Now, the fate of the country's longtime president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, you can see him right there, his fate is hanging in the balance as he faces the greatest challenge yet to his rule of the past 20 years.
 
Now, at the moment, with the 60 million plus votes being counted. The election is too close to call. Both Erdogan and the main opposition candidate, they claim to be leading.
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul for us.
 
Jomana, what is the latest?
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alex, as you mentioned there, the more votes are being counted, the narrower that lead that was being reported for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan by Turkish state media, the narrower that lead is becoming and you can feel the tension, you can feel how anxious people are.
 
We are outside. The president's AK Party headquarters here in Istanbul where we see supporters of President Erdogan who have come out here, they say that they feel stronger being here together, that they are here to show their support for Erdogan.
 
These are people who say that this is the only man they see who can lead this country, the only man that can represent them.
 
But this is a divided nation, a truly polarized society where you have on the other side, you've got the opposition that has come together and put forward one candidate this time presenting President Erdogan with the toughest challenge yet, the toughest election he has had to face; on the other side, the opposition is offering people the promise of change.
 
They say that they are going to reverse the past few years of President Erdogan's rule, what they say has become one-man rule in this country and telling people that they will take them back to a real democracy and we speak to people who are supporting the opposition, who came out today and voted for the opposition and they say this is what they want. They would tell you all the things that have been going wrong in this country, how difficult life has become, whether it is the state of the economy, whether it is the fact that power has become so centralized that they say that they saw the impact of that with a response to that devastating earthquake back in February, that slow response initially by the government, the lack of preparedness, they say that is because that one-man rule has hollowed out government institutions.
 
And people say that this for them is about the future of their country, that they want that change because they feel that Turkish democracy is under threat and they feel that this is the moment, this is the time for change, this is a time to take back control of their country and their future.
 <br>[15:10:11]
 
This is still too early to call. This is a very, very tight race. And as it was -- you know, there was one scenario that had been, you know, the experts were predicting could be what we see happening tonight that the potential is that this could go to runoff. If neither of those candidates gets more than 50 percent of the vote in two weeks' time, people will go out and vote again.
 
For these two different sides, they feel that this is the future of Turkey right now hanging in the balance.
 
You have two different visions for the country and we will have to wait and see in the coming hours how this all turns out -- Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, again, this race may be far from over and huge implications not just for Turkey, but for its relations with the rest of the world.
 
Jomana Karadsheh, we will certainly be coming back to you. Thank you very much for your reporting.
 
Just ahead, a deadly shooting in southern Arizona. Police telling CNN that two people are dead and five others injured including teenagers. The latest on that investigation will be next.
 
And Ukraine's president says his country's counteroffensive against Russia will begin soon. The latest from the frontlines, that's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:15:32]
 
MARQUARDT: This just in to CNN.
 
A shooting in Arizona has left two people dead and five injured. Police say some of the victims are teenagers. CNN national correspondent, Camila Bernal joins us now.
 
Camila, this is the latest in a string of shootings that has involved young people. What more are you learning? CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it is not the first one happening this month in this country, but we're learning that in this case, officers are still trying to piece together exactly what happened. They say they don't have a suspect. They essentially don't have a motive here either as they try to investigate and figure out exactly what happened.
 
What they're saying is that just before 11:00 PM in Yuma, Arizona, they received a call about a shooting, and when they arrived, people had already been shot, specifically a 19-year-old had already been taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, he was pronounced dead at the hospital.
 
There was a 20-year-old that was also taken to the hospital and he later died as well. And then a 16-year-old who was critically injured and had to be flown from Yuma to Phoenix, Arizona, we still don't know exactly what his condition is at the moment.
 
And then the rest of those injured according to police were ages 15, 19, 18, and 16. So these were, you know, teenagers, young people that were at this party and authorities again, saying they're trying to figure out exactly what happened.
 
Here is Yuma Police.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SGT. LORI FRANKLIN, YUMA POLICE DEPARTMENT: It is still an ongoing investigation. So there was a lot of witnesses there. So everybody's being interviewed, everything is being double checked. Everything is being gone over.
 
So at this time, this is all I have, but like I said they are actively working on this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: And as you saw in that video, it was a residential area. Police saying again that there were -- they are trying to figure this out, but there were some off duty officers in this neighborhood and they were able to help out when it came to this area. Again, still no suspect and no motive in this case.
 
But as we mentioned at the top, this really is not the first shooting that involves teenagers. Over just the last couple of months, we've seen a number of shootings where it's 16-year-olds, 19-year-olds -- teenagers. And then you know, in Alabama there was a sweet 16 party, four people killed, 32 injured.
 
So really, this is just another one to add to that list where you're seeing these deadly shootings involving teenagers across the country -- Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: All right, Camila Bernal, we know you'll stay on this story. We will come to you when you learn more.
 
Still ahead, the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Islamic Jihad appears to be holding for now. We'll take you to Jerusalem next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:22:39]
 
MARQUARDT: And now to Russia's war in Ukraine.
 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is hinting that the long anticipated summer counteroffensive will be starting soon. The comments coming as he tours Europe and meets with European leaders, as well as the Pope.
 
Earlier today, President Zelenskyy meeting with Germany's president as well as its chancellor who promised support in Ukraine for as long as it is necessary.
 
Just yesterday, Germany announced a $3 billion aid package for Ukraine. CNN's Sam Kiley, joining us now from southeastern Ukraine and Melissa Bell joining us from Paris where President Zelenskyy is about to meet with French president, Emmanuel Macron.
 
Sam, to you first, Zelenskyy on this tour of Europe, just arriving in Paris where he is due to meet Macron. Why is it so important for Zelenskyy in this moment to be going to meet with crucial European counterparts.
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think very important, indeed, from Zelenskyy's perspective to steady the troops as it were in the form of allies that, for example, Germany, had been very reluctant in the past to step up with lethal aid, now being one of the more generous contributors from Europe.
 
Similarly with the Italians that he visited beforehand and are now going on to see Emmanuel Macron, who has in the past indicated that, for example, a Russian humiliation in his words should be avoided.
 
Now, it is the defeat of Russia that Zelenskyy has made absolutely clear is the agenda for Ukraine, defeat of Russia that is inside his own borders.
 
He is not getting involved in any discussion about the future of Russia, but he does want them out of his territory. And in the past, he's resisted any kind of attempts to try to mitigate or dilute his agenda and I think he's going to be steadying the allies ahead of this offensive, making sure that the supply lines for resupply, if they get bogged down, are going to be there so that the Ukrainians don't squander the remaining human lives that they're going to be prepared to throw at this problem -- Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: And Melissa Bell, the relationship between Germany and Ukraine has been a little bit rocky. What do you think that President Macron is trying to say in rolling out the red carpet for President Zelenskyy today?
 <br>[15:25:03]
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We expect, Alex, the Ukrainian president to arrive at any minute now here at the Elysee Palace and what the Elysee has already said about this visit is that it is once again about showing the unwavering support. We've heard it from Rome, we've heard it from Berlin, we're about to hear it from Paris.
 
Again, the two men are going to be discussing much less extra weaponry that in Berlin Zelenskyy received that nearly $3 billion extra aid military package with those 30 Leopard tanks. Remember that they were for a long time, the idea of sending the tanks resisted by Germany.
 
In fact, they've now become a huge supplier of them. In this leg of his whistlestop tour, we don't expect necessarily further weapons commitments, but a discussion about how France can continue playing its part, they are also going to be discussing that 10-point plan of Zelenskyy.
 
But of course, it is the objects that are so important here. The support that Europe continues to give and what we've just heard from President Zelenskyy who should be arriving any second now from his car, going on his Telegram channel saying, with every one of these meetings with all the time that passes, Europe and Ukraine grow closer, Russia becomes even more under pressure as a result of that proximity.
 
So about showing once again, shoulder-to-shoulder the European support for President Zelenskyy. Of course, as Sam was just saying ahead of this counteroffensive, we have also been hearing a little bit more about that, while he was -- Zelenskyy was in Rome, saying that it could -- it should be starting imminently. They have been preparing, we'd heard early last week from the Ukrainian president, they needed a little more time to get these western weapons in place.
 
What he said in Rome was that it should be starting the first steps of it, should be starting anytime soon. So meeting just getting underway, it is President Zelenskyy's car that's arriving here, Alex for that meeting.
 
He is due to spend the night in Paris and leave tomorrow morning, this hot off the heels of course of his trip to Rome and Berlin. It isn't the first time he's been to Paris , he was here only back in February. This another opportunity, the Elysee Palace said for the two leaders to continue the discussions that they began last February.
 
There is President Zelenskyy, Alex, arriving just now.
 
MARQUARDT: Let's take a look at President Zelenskyy arriving at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
 
BELL: There, President Zelenskyy being greeted by Emmanuel Macron for this, the French leg, Alex, of his European tour designed to shore up that support ahead of the counteroffensive that we understand will be beginning shortly -- Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: President Zelenskyy showing increasing confidence in more travels outside of his country. He left for the first time during this war in December to visit here in Washington, here in the United States. As Melissa just noted, this is not his first trip to Paris. He was in Paris back in February. And this visit that you're seeing right now is the third stop on this European tour that started in Rome, where he met with the prime minister, as well as Pope Francis before going on to Germany where he met with the chancellor and the president.
 
And now going into the Elysee Palace right there with Emmanuel Macron.
 
I want to go back to Sam Kiley.
 
Sam, ahead of this counteroffensive. No one is putting pressure on President Zelenskyy to sit down with President Putin at least publicly, but to what extent do you think there is an awareness in Ukraine that this is an enormous shot that they have to really reconfigure things, reshape the battlefield in a way that may perhaps give Ukraine a bit more leverage when the time comes, when talks actually do end up happening?
 
KILEY: Well, in a sense, Alex, and you're absolutely right. This is the big shot, the main shot, possibly for many Ukrainians the last shot at outright victory that they think they have.
 
Now, President Zelenskyy has said over the last week and during his tour around Europe that he imagines that it's possible that Ukraine could win this in a year and by win, he means kick the Russians out of all Ukrainian territory once and for all.
 
And he is very insistent that that is the agenda and if it not this year, then in later years and the German are reiterating that they will back him to the end, but and this is the big but, if this offensive runs into the sand, quite literally, if it gets bogged down, if it becomes a war of attrition or returns to a war of attrition, then he inevitably will start to come under pressure from even strong allies, I think ultimately to do some kind of a deal to salvage what remains of his country and try to get as much of the Russians out as possible.
 <br>[15:30:10]
 
Now, that's a very long way off and it is something that the Ukrainians are both on the streets and in politics on whatever side of the political spectrum you might be in Ukraine are not prepared to countenance on any level.
 
But they do rather acknowledge slightly in the background here that this big push that they're hoping to have this summer might be all they've really got when it comes to offensive action, certainly, in the near to medium term -- Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: And Melissa, you have also spent so much time in Ukraine covering this war since the beginning. That image that we just saw there of President Zelenskyy walking in with President Macron. That is meant to really show to President Putin that the unity not just with France, but with the rest of Europe. How important is that right now, when the calculation, at least in President Putin's mind is that the longer that he can just dig in and stay in Ukraine, the more Europe will become fractured.
 
BELL: That's right. I think it was back in February when he was last here, Alex, that President Zelenskyy had spoken to exactly that. These visits, you mentioned a moment ago, the fact that he'd been more and more confident leaving Ukraine, these visits he'd explained then were about avoiding that kind of fatigue that might set in as the world gets used to this conflict as time drags on, as allies may waver, as elections may take place, and that he needs to stay in the mind of his allies and keep making these meetings.
 
On the part of Europeans, we've been hearing from anyone you're on my call also today, in an article, in an interview that was published about the fact that he believes that Russia has already lost geopolitically has become according to the French president, a vassal of China as a result of this war, lost Russia's access to the Baltic Sea as a result of Sweden and Finland joining NATO.
 
But of course, for the Europeans as well. It is essential that they show how steadfast they are in that support. But there is no suggestion that they will waver at all, either in their financial, military or humanitarian support to their Ukrainian ally -- Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: And both of those men keenly aware of what's going on here in the United States. We just heard from former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner refusing to say whether he wants Ukraine to win. Both those men certainly know that this country will soon could be consumed by presidential politics.
 
So this is a very important moment in so many different ways. Melissa bell in Paris, Sam Kiley in Ukraine, thank you both very much.
 
And we'll be right back.

 <br>[15:36:51]
 
MARQUARDT: New today, NBA superstar Ja Morant is sidelined again, suspended after a social media post appears to show him flashing a gun.
 
Joining me now is the host of CNN World Sport, Don Riddell.
 
Don, this is actually the second time that Morant is being suspended for another social media post involving a gun. What's his team saying about this?
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT HOST: Well, the team, the Grizzlies are not saying much to be honest, Alex. They could have released their statement on the back of a postage stamp. They have literally acknowledged that they are aware of the social media video. They have suspended him and they will be making no further comment.
 
The NBA have said that they are in the process of gathering more information. You know, Ja Morant is one of the most exciting young players in the NBA, the league. The team has built the franchise around him and his future earnings could easily run into hundreds of millions of dollars. That is if he can stay out of trouble.
 
And this video is one of the reasons why people are really concerned about whether he can stay out of trouble or not.
 
This is the video that got him the suspension. Morant appears to be flashing a gun in a vehicle. It is not clear though where and when this video was shot.
 
And this follows an incident earlier this season just a couple of months ago in fact in March when Morant was suspended for eight games on that occasion by the league after an Instagram Live video showed him holding a gun at a nightclub in Colorado.
 
Now at the time, the NBA's commissioner, Adam Silver described Morant's actions as irresponsible, reckless, and potentially very dangerous. Morant issued an apology when he returned to action after that eight-game suspension and he seemed to acknowledge the error of his ways.
 
He seemed to acknowledge the fact that it was impacting his own potential and certainly the fortunes of his team. This is what he said at the end of the season after the Grizzlies had been knocked out of the playoffs by the Lakers. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JA MORANT, MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES GUARD: I've just got to be better, you know what my decision making. That's was pretty much it. You know, off the court issues, you know, affected us as an organization. Pretty much so yes, there is more discipline.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL; So Alex, those comments coming less than a month ago. We've now seen the video today, of course. I repeat, we don't know when that video was actually shot, but it is of great concern to friends and family and fans of Ja Morant. He's really got the world at his feet, but he just doesn't seem to be able to do the things that he is required to do to make the most of his potential. It's really, really causing him problems at the moment.
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, risking his pay, risking his career and the respect of his fans.
 
Don Riddell, thank you very much.
 
Still to come, a real life "Queen's Gambit" is playing out in Maine, after a custodian let his school's chess team to the national championships.
 
We'll be hearing from the coach himself and one of the team's top players. That's after the break. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:44:10]
 
MARQUARDT: The Netflix show, "The Queen's Gambit" is based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis about an orphaned young girl who becomes a rising star in the chess world after learning the game from her school janitor.
 
(BEGIN "THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT" VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: "Modern Chess Openings"?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the best book for you. They will tell you all you want to know. You'll need to learn chess notation before you can read it. The names of the squares.
 
I'll teach you now.
 
UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Am I good enough now?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How old are you?
 
UNIDENTIFIED GIRL:  Nine.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nine years old.
 
UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: I'll be 10 in November.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To tell you the truth of a child, you're astounding.
 <br>[15:45:10]
 
I'll tell you the truth of a child. Your astounding.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: The beloved show may be based on a novel, but it is not a story of fiction for my next guest, a full-time custodian who is coaching his school's chess teams to national championship.
 
Joining me now is chess coach, David Bishop, fantastic name for a chess coach and Derrick Johnson, one of the chess players for the George B. Weatherbee School Bobcats in Maine, Derrick and David, thank you so much for joining me today. We have a lot to discuss.
 
David, I want to start with you. Obviously, tons of parallels with "The Queen's Gambit." That show loved by so many. But this is not your main job, right? You're not even paid. So why is it so important for you to help these students develop a love for chess?
 
DAVID BISHOP, GEORGE WEATHERBEE SCHOOL BOBCATS CHESS COACH: Well, it started when I was 10 years old, I started playing chess. And throughout the years, I kept with it. And when I got my job at the schools, I discovered a chess club there. And then I wanted to provide more competition for them. So I started teams. And I felt that was a really fun thing for them to do.
 
MARQUARDT: And Derrick, how about you? How did you first start learning about chess? What do you love about it?
 
DERRICK JOHNSON, GEORGE WEATHERBEE SCHOOL BOBCATS CHESS PLAYER: So I first started when I was like, five, I saw my dad and my sister playing chess. I was like, I really want to learn to play.
 
But I never got used to it until when I was in second grade. My dad told me there was a chess club at school. So I went there and I learned all of the moves and I developed a love for the game.
 
MARQUARDT: And how has Coach Bishop helped you?
 
JOHNSON: He is very encouraging. Yes.
 
MARQUARDT: Has he helped you learn more moves? Has he pushed you to be a better player? Can you beat him?
 
JOHNSON: Like 50 percent of the time.
 
MARQUARDT: That's pretty good. And David, you guys are -- you're based in Maine, but you're just north of where I am. You're in Baltimore in Maryland for national championship. How is the team doing so far?
 
BISHOP: Well, we're hovering around 15th or 16th place out of 53 national teams and we finished our last round about an hour ago. And the standings won't be posted for a while and if get at least the 15th and we have a trophy, but all the kids have just had a once in a lifetime experience and they've had so much fun.
 
There's 2,000 kids that converged on the convention center here, and it's a blast.
 
MARQUARDT: Derrick, have you been able to enjoy yourself despite the fierce competition and the pressure?
 
JOHNSON: Yes, because like the team and club, you play the same people over and over and you know how they play. But they're not really much of a challenge every time you play, but you're playing different people, which is more challenging, and you don't know how they play.
 
MARQUARDT: And it's not just this show that was a phenomenon, David, that has led to, you know, a growing interest, a real spike in interest in chess.
 
How did COVID contribute to that, do you think?
 
BISHOP: It was a big contributor. There are a lot of adults and kids alike at home and they start playing chess and they started to love it. And there are great online sites that you can join like chess.com and many others and there are streamers that took hold online, grandmasters for instance. And IMs and everybody likes watching those who plays chess, and it just really grew from there and it hasn't stopped. It's spreading across the country and in our state of Maine. MARQUARDT: And you have said, David that chess needs more financial support. You've likened it to a sport. Obviously, you need a massive amount of brainpower to get through these games and these tournaments. What more do coaches like you need?
 
BISHOP: I've spoken to many coaches at this tournament and we all have the same thing to say. We think that chess should be treated the same as other sports like basketball and football with buses provided for the team and stipends for the coaches, so there is actually a position.
 <br>[15:50:14]
 
Lots of schools like ours just don't even have a position. So, it's not stopping. It's growing and there is going to be more kids on our teams next year. So I think it should be -- there should be more parity with chess and other sports.
 
MARQUARDT: And Derrick, before I let you guys go, what would you say to kids your age who don't know much about chess, but they've heard of it and they might be interested in joining a club like yours? What your advice?
 
JOHNSON: Give it a try. You'll only get better from there.
 
BISHOP: Great.
 
MARQUARDT: That's fantastic, succinct advice. You've certainly inspired me to go dust off the board and pieces and get back involved.
 
David Bishop, Derrick Johnson. Best of luck to the both of you. Thank you so much for spending some time with us today.
 
BISHOP: Thank you.
 
JOHNSON: Thanks.
 
MARQUARDT: Take care.
 
We will be back in a moment.
 
But first how computerized cooking is taking kitchens by storm.
 
Vanessa Yurkevich has more in this week's Innovate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Nikhil Abraham is on a mission to recreate some of the world`s finest dishes with some computerized help.
 
NIKHIL ABRAHAM, CLOUDCHEF CO-FOUNDER, CEO: What we did was build technology where a chef can come into one of our kitchens, be it from your favorite restaurant in Paris or even from your grandmother. And we can then recreate this recipe without the chef. YURKEVICH (voice over): Abraham and his co-founders developed this specialized software and are putting it to use in a new startup kitchen called CloudChef.
 
ABRAHAM: We start with Indian food because we were missing some of our favorite restaurants from back home.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Chef Annika Goldbulli (ph) is testing the technology, as she cooks, sensors record the entire process, breaking it down into thousands of data points.
 
ABRAHAM: You have cameras looking at the contents of the pan, looking at colors, in some cases, textures. There are infrared cameras figuring out how hot each individual item is.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): After her dish is recorded, it can be reproduced at any of the sensor powered stations. And the results -- 
 
YURKEVICH (on camera): I can`t taste a difference in it.
 
ANNIKA GOLDBULLI, CHEF: Literally everything is duplicated.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Chefs receive a royalty every time one of their dishes is ordered. Right now, CloudChef has dishes from Michelin starred chefs available for pickup and delivery in Palo Alto, California. But they are looking to expand their kitchens and menus soon by bringing the world's greatest cuisine to your home.

MARQUARDT: This week, the CNN Original Series, "The 2010s" is back. In an all-new episode, the series examines the major trends and innovations in the music of the decade. Here's a preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPHEN WITT, AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST: At the beginning of the decade that music industry had functionally collapsed. Piracy had destroyed it.
 
It was possible to believe that in 10 years, the music industry might not exist at all. They were scrambling, they were panicking, and they had to do something different.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get set to enjoy Spotify, the highly acclaimed music streaming platform from Europe is launching in the US.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Spotify was the first service I ever saw that competed not with everything that preceded the iTunes of the world and the Rhapsodies of the world, but it actually competed with piracy.
 
WITT: Spotify's value proposition to the pirates was, we're going to make this easier for you. It's going to stream out of the cloud, so you won't have to mess around with these files anymore and you're getting access to the overwhelming majority of music since the beginning of the recorded music era for $5.00.
 
It was an irresistible proposition.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: Joining us now is Jason King. He is the chair of the Clive Davis Institute of Music at New York University and the dean of the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California.
 
Jason King, thank you so much for joining me today.
 
All of those innovations, especially streaming that came to the music industry in the 2010s that had a huge impact on pretty much every aspect of music, how it was bought, how its consumed. What were some of the biggest changes that you saw.
 
JASON KING, CHAIR OF THE CLIVE DAVIS INSTITUTE OF MUSIC AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: I mean, streaming is the big music tech story of the 2010s.
 
You have to remember that prior to that, 20th century music was a physicalized thing, it was something you can hold in your hand, you would buy vinyl or you'd buy cassette or on eight-track or a CD, then the late 1990s, music becomes de-physicalized with the rise of Napster and peer-to-peer sharing networks, all of a sudden music is something that is a digital file that you can pass around and share around with friends that leads to the piracy that we just heard about, which has other kinds of consequences for the business of recorded music.
 
But then in the 2010s, you have the rise of these music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple, and Tidal, and they have both pluses and minuses for the industry.
 
I think the big plus would be that suddenly fans are more empowered than they've ever been. They can create playlists, they can share music in a way that they couldn't before and they have more power to actually determine the kinds of hits that are made in the music industry. It's no longer just programmed from the top down.
 
And also, music is more on demand. You can suddenly click a button and just listen to anything that you want to hear in a way that makes it highly accessible. But on the flip side, some artists are really feeling disempowered, streaming services in terms of the economics of recorded music, they don't pay out to artists the same way that they used to in the past, and so that's difficult for most artists who are trying to earn a steady living, or livable wage in terms of just their recorded music.
 
So there's a double-edged sword to music and tech in the 2010s.
 
MARQUARDT: Yes. No doubt, that decade completely redefined how the industry works.
 
Jason King, we do have to leave it there. Thank you very much for your insights.
 
And all of you out there, be sure to tune in to an all-new episode of the CNN original series, "The 2010s" that airs tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific only on CNN.
