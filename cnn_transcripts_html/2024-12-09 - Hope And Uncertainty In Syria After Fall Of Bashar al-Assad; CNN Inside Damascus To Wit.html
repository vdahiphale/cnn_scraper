ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, it is. This is the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. It is 7:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi, I'm Becky Anderson. 
 
And world leaders are worried about what the future of Syria and indeed this region, the wider Middle East will look like. We will bring you 
 
 reporting from inside Damascus, Moscow and the Golan Heights.
 
A shocking lawsuit details sexual assault allegations against rapper Jay-Z and Sean Diddy Combs. More on the legal implications this could have for 
 
 the musician.
 
And strong comments from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump on his first T.V. interview since the election, more details on his aggressive agenda 
 
 for migrants in the U.S. and what he plans to do on his first day in office.
 
Well, a new picture emerging as we speak in Syria, it is a transformation that is reverberating across the Middle East and beyond the capital, 
 
 Damascus, for the most part, calm today, this Monday. The future, though uncertain, with the Assad regime suddenly toppled and rebels in control. 
 
 Extremist groups in the opposition, understandably causing some concern. 
 
Israel says its military struck Syrian weapons systems and chemical weapons capabilities, it says, to prevent them from falling into the hands of 
 
 extremists. 
 
But inside Syria, hope for the future does appear to be running high. Nick Paton Walsh looks at how the country arrived at what is this historic 
 
 crossroads.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Decades of savage, horrific rule, over in a matter of days.  Thousands of Syrians celebrated in the streets of Damascus after rebel 
 
 forces advanced on the capital early Sunday morning, declaring it free of President Bashar al-Assad.
 
YOUSSEF AL-YOUSSEF, SYRIAN REBEL ANCHOR: We announce to you from the Syrian News Channel the victory of the great Syrian revolution, after 13 years of 
 
 patience and sacrifice. We won the bet and toppled the criminal Assad regime.
 
WALSH (voice-over): Facing crumbling resistance from regime forces, rebels launched a stunning, lightning offensive. Russia undermining its long-term 
 
 ally by announcing he had fled the country and was granted asylum in Moscow.
 
Hours of jubilation followed as civilians and rebels entered the presidential palace, looting furniture with children running about, a sign 
 
 of how every day the suffering he inflicted had been. Some even touring the presidential kitchen in a land where starvation was once a weapon. What 
 
 would you like one woman says while filming? Our people are hungry. Take whatever you want.
 
Traces of Assad were being dismantled across the country. This statue of the man who had children gassed in a gutter basement 11 years ago toppled 
 
 in the eastern city of Tartus. His image torn down from buildings in Damascus and on top of the gates of Homs city center. Symbolically, where 
 
 protesters tore apart his image more than a decade ago in a scene that defined the civil war's early days.
 
Inspired by the seismic shifts of the Arab Spring, Syrians rose up in 2011 demanding democracy but were met with live rounds and eventually jet 
 
 planes, chemical weapons and mass executions and torture. Hundreds of thousands were killed, millions displaced. As rebels swept through the 
 
 capital on Sunday, images surfaced of prisoners being released from the notorious Sadnaya prison, from which so few emerged. Dubbed the Human 
 
 Slaughterhouse by Amnesty International.
 
The militant figure leading this rebel offensive is Abu Mohammed al- Jilani, seen here prostrating in prayer upon entering Damascus. Once 
 
 affiliated with Al Qaeda, Jilani has been suggesting he has matured from his extremist roots, though there are deep concerns about what kind of new 
 
 Syria may now emerge. At one of the oldest mosques in the world in Damascus, he was received with applause and jeers as he held total victory.
 
ABU MOHAMMED AL-JILANI, SYRIAN REBEL LEADER (through translation): This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation. This new 
 
 triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region.
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
WALSH (voice-over): Without doubt a new chapter, but with the joy of change comes anxiety at the future and surely a reckoning of sorts. The decades of 
 
 horror past that could mire the hope of the days ahead.
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, for the time being, at least, it is calm in Damascus. Let me show you some images here. It's just after 6:00 in the evening, and you 
 
 can see people with the old Syrian flag, the flag described as the flag of independence, also the flag carried by the opposition. Very different, two 
 
 different flags there, in fact, two groups, but one -- the flag with the stars on, one described as the Syrian independence flag, and you can see 
 
 that adorned on that building. So, we'll keep an eye on these images for you. 
 
But 24 hours after, what was this lightning offensive that toppled the regime in Damascus, liberating the city? These are the pictures this 
 
 evening. 
 
Well, while these Syrian people wait for clarity, daily life, of course, goes on. CNN's Clarissa Ward reports from Damascus a majority -- a major 
 
 priority for the Eber (ph), for many, of course, is making sure they have enough supplies to ride out the transition. This is what she filed a little 
 
 earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You can see, there are a lot of people out on the streets today. It's not scenes of 
 
 celebration. It's not scenes of looting like we were seeing today. Now people are trying to make sure that they have stopped up on all the 
 
 supplies that they might need. 
 
Take a look at this line here. We're outside a bakery. These people say they've been waiting more than half an hour, some of them, they're waiting 
 
 for bread. We've seen lines like this around the city. People are lining up for cash. They're lining up for gas. They are trying to make sure that they 
 
 have enough food to ride out this transitional period where nobody really knows what's going to happen.
 
Now, you can see behind me at the end of the road there, that is the central bank of Syria. Yesterday, there was extensive moving there. A lot 
 
 of people in the city started to feel a little bit concerned that this was going to be a chaotic period. 
 
Then more rebels arrived in the capital. The looting appears to have stopped. It does seem very calm on the streets. Of course, there are many 
 
 people who are elated the Bashar al-Assad is finally gone. 
 
But, there is also the day today that people need to focus on to ensure that they have enough bread, enough gas, enough cash, enough supplies to 
 
 get them through this tenuous transitional period.
 
Clarissa Ward, CNN, Damascus.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, that is the story in the south, of course, in Damascus. The U.S., meantime, has been launching what they call precision strikes in the 
 
 north targeting ISIS. 
 
On Sunday, U.S. forces struck more than 75 ISIS targets. The White House National Security Council spokesperson says that approach appears to be 
 
 working. John Kirby spoke to my colleague, CNN's John Berman earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: Pentagon is doing what they call a battle damage assessment of that, John. We don't 
 
 have a firm indication of the assessment of each and every one of those strikes. They do believe preliminarily that they were very, very successful 
 
 in hitting legitimate ISIS targets and further degrading their capabilities.
 
I mean, we have kept the pressure up on ISIS now through the entire four years of this administration through these kinds of strikes. We'll continue 
 
 to do that as we see valid threats. So, I'm certainly not going to rule anything off the table in terms of additional strikes on ISIS.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: Who's running Syria this morning?
 
KIRBY: That's an open question. Right now, the rebel groups are in charge of Damascus again. Yes, HTS sort of was the vanguard here, but they're not 
 
 the only rebel or opposition group in Damascus as we speak. And I think they're trying to work that out amongst themselves. But it is an open 
 
 question.
 
In fact, the very fact that it's an open question, John gives us concern. As the president said, we're in a period of uncertainty here. And so, we're 
 
 going to be working through all the processes we can, including at the U.N. to make sure that there is adequate communication with these opposition 
 
 groups, and that we are all working together on the -- for the best aspirations of the Syrian people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ANDERSON: Well, CNN's Arlette Saenz is also at the White House. She is monitoring how the Biden administration is reacting to what are these 
 
 seismic developments in Syria with only weeks, of course, for the Biden administration left in office.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden cast this as a moment of opportunity for the Syrian people, as the country is now rid of 
 
 the crushing regime under Bashar al-Assad. But at the same time, the president said there are significant risks and uncertainty with this 
 
 situation, and managing those risks will be a key priority for the president and his team going forward.
 <br>[10:10:09]
 
The president in the coming days is expected to speak with counterparts about the situation, and he will also deploy top U.S. officials to the 
 
 region for conversations about the future of Syria.
 
Now, among the top priorities for the Biden administration is trying to assure that there isn't any type of resurgence of ISIS. The president said 
 
 that they are very clear eyed about the fact that ISIS might try to take advantage of this, the power vacuum at this time in Syria, to try to re-
 
 establish their capabilities in Syria and other parts of the region. That is something he says that the U.S. is going to try to prevent. 
 
That is why the U.S. launched dozens of air strikes against 75 ISIS targets in Syria on Sunday, they used a variety of Air Force assets like B-52 
 
 bombers and F-15 fighter jets. That is something that the administration will be focusing on in the days to come, as they are hopeful that ISIS will 
 
 not try to use this moment to reestablish their capabilities. 
 
Now, another issue that the Biden administration needs to navigate is how exactly to work with the incoming Syrian government whenever one is 
 
 established. The main rebel group that has really taken a lot of the control and power in recent days is HTS, which the U.S. has deemed a terror 
 
 organization, and the senior U.S. officials said that they believe significant portions of that group does have ties to ISIS. 
 
Now, earlier today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan indicated that the U.S. is ready to work with any group that is focused on democratic 
 
 institutions in Syria. 
 
But both the president and Sullivan said that right now, while they are hearing the right words from rebel groups, they will be judging them on 
 
 their actions going forward. 
 
Now, this is all playing out as President Biden only has six weeks left in office. This is an issue that president-elect Trump will inherit come 
 
 January, as the rebel forces were making their way towards Damascus, in recent weeks, president-elect Trump said the U.S. should stay out of this 
 
 situation.
 
And so far, he has given very few clues about what he thinks the future of Syria should look like. For President Biden's part, he says that's the 
 
 decision that's up to the Syrian people.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
ANDERSON: Well, the Kremlin, meantime, says that the Russian President Vladimir Putin granted asylum to Bashar al-Assad and his family after they 
 
 fled to safety there, a spokesperson didn't comment on Assad's whereabouts in Russia. He did describe what is happening in Syria as, "A period of 
 
 transformation and extreme instability."
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more from Moscow.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Russians admit that they were surprised by the events quickly unfolding inside 
 
 Syria. Spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, saying he believes the whole world was surprised how quickly Bashar al-Assad was ousted from power 
 
 and forced to leave Syria and come here to Russia. The Russians also saying that it was Vladimir Putin himself who signed on Bashar al-Assad and 
 
 members of his family being able to come here and being granted asylum inside Russia, as the Russians say, for humanitarian reasons.
 
Now, of course, for the Russians, all of this could have very big repercussions. At the same time, the Russians do understand that there is a 
 
 new reality on the ground in Syria. As of this morning, the flag of the Syrian opposition flies above the embassy here in Moscow. And we asked here 
 
 at the embassy, and folks here told us that the embassy is actually working as normally, even though the transition in Syria is already very much 
 
 taking place.
 
For the Russians, however, they were one of the biggest backers of the Assad regime, and of course, still have major military assets inside Syria 
 
 as well. They have an air base in Hmeimim, close to Latakia, which is very important for them, not just for air operations in Syria, but also to 
 
 project power into the Mediterranean and even all the way into Africa. 
 
And of course, they have a major naval base in Tartus, and just last week, conducted big naval exercises, firing some high-powered missiles from ships 
 
 inside the Mediterranean Sea.
 
The Russians admitting that for them, it's unclear what the future of those military bases will be. They say a lot of that depends on who will have 
 
 power in Syria in the future. The Russians say that their forces inside Syria are on high alert, but at the same time also say that it is calm 
 
 outside their bases.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: With the situation in Syria now deeply uncertain, Israel has ordered the creation of a security zone, as they call it, inside Syrian 
 
 territory, one that would go beyond the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. And the area has been patrolled by the United Nations for the far -- for the 
 
 past five decades, and the Israeli military rarely ventured into what is known as sort of no man's land. And that is until now. 
 <br>[10:15:08]
 
Jeremy Diamond is in the Golan Heights with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: We are right along the border between the Israeli occupied Golan Heights and Syria. This is the 
 
 border fence right here, which for the last 50 years, has marked the beginning of a buffer zone inside of Syrian territory where neither Israeli 
 
 nor Syrian forces have entered and taken up positions. 
 
But yesterday, the Israeli prime minister saying that Syrian forces had abandoned their positions on the other side of that buffer and ordering 
 
 Israeli troops to move inside of that buffer zone. 
 
This is one of those openings in the fence where we have seen Israeli troops and vehicles moving in and out of here as they take up positions 
 
 inside of that buffer zone. But we're also told that those Israeli forces are going beyond that buffer zone, taking up other strategic positions 
 
 inside of Syrian territory.
 
And beyond that, we also know that the Israeli Air Force is taking action as well. We have heard those jets going in and out of Syrian airspace 
 
 throughout the morning, the Israeli military carrying out air strikes against strategic capabilities of the Syrian forces, including air defenses 
 
 and missile as well.
 
Beyond that, the Israeli prime minister said that he is extending a hand of peace to the new leaders inside of Syria. But the question right now is 
 
 that there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly what that new Syrian government will look like and what kind of neighbors they will be to 
 
 Israel.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: We have said that CNN is fanned out across this story. Jeremy Diamond made it from that border area into the center of a town Majdal 
 
 Shams, where he witnessed some celebrations just last hour. Have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DIAMOND: There are -- we have heard these children who have been in the town square here, chanting -- cursing Bashar al-Assad and also celebrating 
 
 a free Syria to come. 
 
But in addition to that, what we have also heard are the stories of people who have family in Syria, both those whose family are in Syria now finally 
 
 feel free, but also those who have family who are political prisoners. 
 
We spoke to one woman, Hala Abu Ade (ph) whose nephew was imprisoned 14 years ago. And just going to pause here, as you have the children coming 
 
 through with the flags, with this scene of celebration. 
 
And like I said, that is the dichotomy, because this woman who I was telling you about, Hala Abu Ade, her nephew was imprisoned 14 years ago on 
 
 political charges. Several months later, they were given a death certificate, told that he died in prison. 
 
But now, as we are seeing these prisons being -- these political prisoners being liberated in Syria, she is holding out some hope that perhaps there 
 
 is a world in which her nephew is still alive, and she is working to try and get information from relatives inside of Syria. It is, of course, the 
 
 story of so many in the Syrian diaspora.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ANDERSON: And we continue to cover the story more coming up this hour.
 
Also still to come, Donald Trump sits down for his first major television interview since winning the U.S. presidential election, you might be 
 
 surprised to hear what he has to say as he approaches his second term in the White House. 
 
Also one of the rap world's biggest stars is accused of sexually assaulting a minor back in 2000. Jay-Z's denial and the details on the allegation 
 
 after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:20:51]
 
ANDERSON: Billion -- let me start that again. Billionaire music mogul Jay-Z has denied allegations that he raped a 13-year-old girl along with Sean 
 
 Diddy Combs, 24 years ago. Now, a woman who is already suing Combs for the same alleged crime has amended her civil lawsuit toward Jay-Z as a named 
 
 defendant. 
 
Now, this is the first time a celebrity has been accused in connection with Combs, who is facing dozens of civil lawsuits, as well as federal charges 
 
 including sex trafficking. 
 
Well, let's bring in attorney in legal affairs commentator Areva Martin who joins us now from Los Angeles. 
 
This is a civil lawsuit as opposed to a criminal one, but this is a very serious allegation. And just how serious is this for Jay-Z?
 
AREVA MARTIN, CNN ATTORNEY AND LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Well, it's very serious, Becky, as you indicated, not just in terms of potential civil 
 
 liability, but also it opens up the prospect that there could be a criminal investigation by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. 
 
Also, it opens up the possibility of other lawsuits. We've seen when high profile men like Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Sean Combs are sued by one 
 
 individual, it emboldens, it gives courage, it gives strength to other potential claimants to come forward and file additional lawsuits. 
 
And although this is the first time we've heard Jay-Z's name mentioned in a lawsuit of this kind, we should note that this lawsuit was originally 
 
 filed. It was filed with celebrity number one, and now we know that that is Jay-Z, indeed.
 
ANDERSON: The one identified as Jane Doe describes in some detail in what she claims happened. How does that level of detail affect a case like this, 
 
 Areva?
 
MARTIN: Well, it gives more credibility. Obviously, the more details that you can provide, the more credible your testimony is, both to those who may 
 
 be investigating, such as prosecutors, but also before a jury. We've seen these cases play out over the last couple of decades, and there has been a 
 
 sea shift change in terms of how women are believed, how these cases are treated by juries. 
 
20 years ago or so, a woman filing a lawsuit like this against a very powerful individual such as Jay-Z would find herself maligned, in many 
 
 ways, villainized, but over the last 10 years, particularly with the MeToo movement, women are being believed.
 
ANDERSON: Do we have any specifics on what the plaintiff is seeking at this point?
 
MARTIN: No, there has been some back and forth though in social media, Jay- Z accusing this lawyer of trying to extort him for money. This being just a political stunt and a money grab, but the lawyer pushing back, saying 
 
 there's been no monetary amount demanded from Jay-Z, he did acknowledge sending a letter requesting a early and private mediation to try to resolve 
 
 this matter. But we haven't heard yet what the -- or her counsel are seeking in terms of monetary damages.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, the lawsuit says she requested mediation as you rightly point out with Jay-Z. What does that actually mean?
 
MARTIN: Well, a lot of these cases get resolved privately through a mediation process where a retired judge or perhaps a lawyer sits as a third 
 
 party arbiter to try to help the parties come to some agreement, some agreement about a monetary amount. And oftentimes those mediations result 
 
 in confidential settlement agreements so the public never knows what is actually paid out by the defendant in these kinds of claims.
 
Jay-Z's lawyers pushed back and rejected the request to go to early mediation, and now the lawyer is actually accusing Jay-Z and his team of 
 
 engaging and harassing and threatening conduct to prevent this lawsuit from ever coming forward.
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
ANDERSON: And Areva, an extremely strongly worded rebuttal from Jay-Z on his social. His lawyers says, as I understand it, say that he wrote that 
 
 himself. You've read it, and it talks about the impact on his family, how he's going to have to sit his kids down. It's likely that they will have 
 
 seen these allegations. And he said this is going to be a really difficult time for the family. 
 
Were you surprised at just how strongly worded and sort of emotional that was?
 
MARTIN: Not really, not given Jay-Z and his history. He's not one to a coward. He's not one to shy away from controversy. He's one to do exactly 
 
 what he did, which is to face it head on. 
 
I'm not surprised at all that he referenced his own daughter and the need for his family to sit down and talk with them about these allegations, 
 
 because he's right, given social media and given the pervasive nature of these kinds of claims and how widely they will be reported on social media, 
 
 his daughter, that's about 11 or 12 years old, will definitely hear about the charges. 
 
I also thought it was interesting for him to talk about his background, coming -- growing up in the housing projects of Brooklyn, and what a code 
 
 of honor individuals like him and those that grew up around him had about protecting girls. 
 
So, he's making an appeal on several different levels about his role as a protector of girls and women, and not one that not as a predator. 
 
So, again, this case may get played out in a court of law, but oftentimes these cases are settled before a trial through a private process whereby 
 
 the public isn't made privy to the outcome. 
 
But given what we see now are pretty strident positions on both sides, as far we can tell, it is heading way courtroom.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Always good to have you. Attorney and legal contributor for CNN, Areva Martin in the house for you. 
 
Well, the man who gunned down and killed Brian Thompson, CEO of United Healthcare in New York, last Wednesday, is still on the run. The suspect 
 
 was caught in video firing the deadly shots. Police still don't know who this man is, and they believe he has long left New York City. 
 
While investigators had some evidence, including DNA on a Starbucks water bottle and a backpack that he possibly wore, they are still searching for 
 
 crucial evidence, like weapon used and the bike that he rode to get away. Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our 
 
 radar as we continue to follow that one.
 
The U.S. Supreme Court is in session this hour, hearing oral arguments in cases involving mail fraud and pay disparities for military reservists 
 
 called into active duty. 
 
Earlier today, the court declined to review race neutral efforts to diversify public schools started by three schools in Boston.
 
New caravan of migrants is beginning the journey from Mexico to the United States. It comes after Mexico's president has responded to remarks made by 
 
 U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, saying that closing the border was never discussed in a recent phone call between the two. 
 
Claudia Sheinbaum added that her government will avoid, "Falling into any provocation around the issue."
 
Britain's Keir Starmer is making his first visit as prime minister to this, the Gulf region. He met the president of the UAE in Abu Dhabi earlier. Mr. 
 
 Starmer working to agree a free trade deal with the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. His next stop is Saudi Arabia. 
 
You are watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me. Becky Anderson live from Abu Dhabi. Time here is just before half past 7:00 in the evening, just before 
 
 half past 6:00 in Damascus in Syria, where Bashar al-Assad is gone, of course, after decades of brutal rule. But how will his stunning ouster 
 
 impact the country and indeed this wider region? We're going to take a look at that.
 
And Iran, a key ally to Syria's Bashar al-Assad, how Tehran is reacting to the downfall of his regime, that is up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:31:39]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. Half past 7:00 here or just after in the UAE, just after half 
 
 past 6:00.
 
In Syria, celebrations tempered with a good deal of uncertainty. It has to be said about the country's future after the stunning fall of President 
 
 Bashar al-Assad. Rebels, of course, swept into Damascus over the weekend, unopposed after seizing key cities in a lightning offensive that lasted 
 
 less than two weeks. Syrians are hailing the end of decades of brutal rule by Assad and his late father.
 
The initial celebrations turning to everyday concerns on day two, of course, we've got issues like just putting food on the table.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Now, it's because people are poor, hungry and fed up. This is why they are getting bred. They all came 
 
 together. Asked them where they came from, each from a place or a village.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, there are big questions, of course, about how Syria will be governed going forward given its wide array of rebel groups with differing 
 
 ideologies. Western diplomats do fear a power vacuum could lead to the reemergence of ISIS or other extremist groups there. Whatever shape Syria's 
 
 new government takes for the first time in more than five decades, it will not be led by a member of the Assad family.
 
Nic Robertson now brings us some context on the Assad era and the mark that it has left on the country.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Bashar al- Assad inherited his father's totalitarian regime and left it and his country in ruins. A thuggish police state in a brutal repression turned war 
 
 where hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed and more than half the population fled their homes.
 
RAMI KHOURI, MIDDLE EAST ANALYST: He'll be remembered as one of the most violent rulers in response to the uprisings that started in late 2010 in 
 
 the Arab world. He'll also be remembered as the failing end point of the Assad dynasty that his father had started that lasted for over 42 years, 
 
 but it collapsed under him.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Bashar al-Assad never expected to take over from his father. His older brother Basil was the heir apparent. Instead, Bashar 
 
 trained as an ophthalmologist in London. Former Assad family insiders say he didn't have the right stuff to run Syria.
 
ABDEL HALIM KHADDAM, FORMER SYRIAN VICE PRESIDENT (through translator): His brother basil bullied him as a child. His father never gave him as much 
 
 attention as Basil.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): When President Hafez al-Assad died in 2000, Syria's elite pushed Bashar into the presidency, keeping 30 years of their own 
 
 wealth, power, position and influence intact.
 
RIFAAT AL-ASSAD, BASHAR AL-ASSAD'S UNCLE (through translator): Hafez was a leader, the head of the entire regime while Bashar never came close to 
 
 that.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): At first, the new president agreed to modest reforms and released hundreds of political prisoners but that brief moment 
 
 of optimism dubbed the Damascus spring ended abruptly.
 
Protests demanding change spread across Syria in early 2011.
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
The regime cracked down turning peaceful protest into slaughter. The UN found what it called massive evidence of war crimes, crimes against 
 
 humanity, responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state.
 
The chaos spawned countless local militias and opposition forces. In the mayhem, the ultra-violent Islamist group ISIS gained a temporary foothold, 
 
 spewing its nihilistic terror over the border into Iraq. U.S. and Iraqi forces confronted and ultimately crushed them, but didn't challenge Assad's 
 
 brutal authority.
 
Russia, too joined the fight. Assad and his allies, Hezbollah from Lebanon, an Iranian militia, were losing ground, committing more forces than any 
 
 other country with barbaric, internationally condemned ground and air assaults, Russia turned the tide in Assad's favor.
 
But when Russia's forces went to war in Ukraine in 2022 the clock on Assad's rule began ticking down. By late 2024 his other main allies, Iran 
 
 and Hezbollah, were blooded by over a year long war with Israel. Assad's fortunes plummeted.
 
Former al Qaeda turned nationalist Islamist Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham surged out of their northern enclave, exploiting Assad's allies weakness over 
 
 running the country. Within two weeks, Assad had fled to Russia, ending his family's half century ruthless repression of the Syrian people. His life in 
 
 exile begins living in the shadow of fear. His heinous crimes will eventually catch up with him.

ANDERSON: Well, Iran, of course, a key backer of Assad, it says it was surprised that the Syrian army was unable to stop the rebels in a televised 
 
 interview. Iran's foreign minister said his government has been aware of the rebels' movements and had told Damascus but he said Iran will respect 
 
 Syria's sovereignty.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABBAS ARAGHCHI, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): We seek for the will of the Syrian people to prevail through democratic and 
 
 participatory mechanisms, what the people of Syria desire must be realized. However, I anticipate that the path ahead will not be easy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Let's break this all down. Vali Nasr is professor of International Affairs. A Middle East Studies at John Hopkins University. 
 
 Joins me now from Doha. A lot of discussions going on in Qatar over the weekend. A hive of activity as things were unfolding in Syria, just how big 
 
 a loss is the Assad regime for Tehran. Can you just explain?
 
VALI NASR, PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONA AFFAIRS, JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY: Well, it's a big loss both to their prestige and also to their role in the 
 
 Levant. I mean, first of all, Iran put a great deal of blood and treasure into preventing Assad falling in during the Arab Spring, and then obviously 
 
 use the Syria as a conduit for its relations with Lebanon. So, loss of -- loss of a -- loss of Assad means a great deal in terms of having all of 
 
 that investment come to naught.
 
But in reality, going forward, Assad's value had decreased because of the battering that Hezbollah had suffered at the hands of Israel. The supplying 
 
 of Hezbollah was not as critical as it had been before. Iran was not looking to be sending massive ballistic missiles into Lebanon right now, so 
 
 it doesn't make much difference to Lebanon in the short term, and it's more about what Iran has lost in terms of its -- of its position as a power in 
 
 the region.
 
ANDERSON: Israel has been turning the screws on Iran now for some time with the implicit support of the United States, of course. Take a listen to what 
 
 John Kirby, the U.S. National Security Adviser said about Iran earlier on CNN.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: I mean, you look at Iran with their so-called Axis of 
 
 Resistance, Hamas decimated, Sinwar is gone. Hezbollah, their leaders gone, Israel is gone and they're now earning a ceasefire with Israel and now 
 
 Assad, their other -- their other proxy in the Middle East, gone and Syria's future very much as we said, an open question.
 <br>[10:40:04]
 
Iran has also been hurt deeply by the sanctions regimes that the United States has kept and increased on them, as well as our European partners. 
 
 And, of course, they've been degraded militarily by some of the strikes that Israel has conducted. So, they're looking at a very different Middle 
 
 East when they're waking up today.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: What did you make of his comments? What did -- what type of Middle East did Tehran wake up to today?
 
NASR: Well, I mean this what Kirby says is not untrue, but he's also not taking account that the United States woke up and Israel woke up also and 
 
 saw a very different Middle East. Yes, the aim was to batter Iran and to cut its hands from the Levant but the -- but the vacuum left by Iran is now 
 
 filled by a Islamist force which could also present its own challenges. And the man who's taken over Damascus has a $10 million bounty on its head for 
 
 being, in accordance with the United States, a terrorist.
 
I don't think Washington or Jerusalem also envisioned that Iran's departure from the Levant would be so quickly filled by forces that were -- their 
 
 enemies just a while back. So, it's not beneficial to the United States to make this all about Iran. The Levant area, Lebanon, Syria is now completely 
 
 battered, is broken. It doesn't have order and the United States and Israel may also live to suffer the consequences of the vacuum that we are seeing 
 
 right now.
 
ANDERSON: As may a number of the Gulf states, there is no love lost, of course, here in the UAE and in Saudi for Islamist elements and factions 
 
 around this region. There is more support for these rebel groups. Certainly, let's call them that when we talk about Turkey's support for 
 
 those in the north and of course, in Qatar. The Iranian, Russian and Turkish foreign ministers met in Doha on Saturday, just hours before we saw 
 
 the rebel invasion, as it were, of Damascus and the liberation of the capital city.
 
This was Saturday. They were looking to seek a political solution to the Syrian conflict. This is called the Astana group. And I think it's really 
 
 important to point out here, Iran, Turkey, Russia, two of those countries seemingly abandoned or were abandoned by the Assad regime. Turkey, it seems 
 
 a big winner here. Can you just like, you know, can you square the circle for us, as it were across this Astana grouping?
 
And where you see the influence in what is a, you know, a very -- it's a shifting -- the shifting sands of the Middle East at this point?
 
NASR: So, the Astana group was created in order to help stabilize Syria once it was clear that Assad was not falling. And it provided at least six, 
 
 seven years during which Assad was asked to talk to the opposition, work on the Constitution, build his economy, stabilize the country. And he did none 
 
 of those things during that time period. Over the last year, both Russia and Iran encouraged them to talk to Turkey and help stabilize the 
 
 situation.
 
So, he didn't do that either. And in the end, even though Iran warned him that that an attack might be coming from Idlib in the north, he said that, 
 
 you know, he -- the situation was in hand. So, by the time that the -- that the 11-day campaign to unseat him started, it was too late for Iran and 
 
 Russia to do anything. It's not a question of whether they would have done anything or could have done anything.
 
The unfolding events didn't even provide them with the time. And they -- yes, the result of which is that Iran and Russia's role in Syria is 
 
 eliminated for now and Turkey is the big winner. Turkey is basically is stepping in to fill the vacuum that was left by Iran and Russia and Turkey 
 
 is not emerging, if you would, as the main country. The main power broker in charge of Syria. So, yes, we're celebrating Syria's liberation from 
 
 Assad.
 
But in many ways, there is still another great power in Syria which is controlling territory and is now also the main backer of the -- of the 
 
 force that's taken over Damascus.
 
ANDERSON: The Iranian Ambassador to Syria said this weekend that developments in the region could move beyond American control. Vali, it's 
 
 good to have you. We will continue to report from the ground and on what is happening.
 <br>[10:45:02]
 
Let's see whether the Iranian Ambassador to Syria, his comments prove to be -- to be true. For the time being, always a pleasure, sir. Thank you so 
 
 much.
 
Still to come. A closer look at Donald Trump's signature issue here what he is saying about migrants and mass deportations now that he has won the 
 
 White House. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: With just over a month until Inauguration Day, President-elect Donald Trump is laying out some of his priorities upon his return to the 
 
 White House. In an interview with NBC News, he reiterated his campaign pledge to launch mass deportations of people who entered the U.S. illegally 
 
 and to end birthright citizenship. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're the only country that has it --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Through an executive action?
 
TRUMP: You know we're the only country that has it. You know, if somebody sets a foot -- of just a foot, one foot, you don't need to -- on our land, 
 
 congratulations. You are now a citizen of the United States of America. Yes, we're going to end that because it's ridiculous.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: While Trump also addressed international topics that could play a major role in his presidency, regarding Syria, for example, our headline. 
 
 He posted on social media that "This is not our fight, and that was -- and that Russia was no longer interested in protecting Assad." 
 
Trump also wrote, Russia's war with Ukraine has left it weakened. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris.
 
Well more than 80,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes as a large volcano erupts in the central Philippines. The Kanlaon volcano has 
 
 been spouting a column of ash and gas up to three meters into the sky according to the Philippine Institute Volcanology and Seismology. The 
 
 government says about 47,000 people are inside that danger zone. Well, the volcano is one of the most active in the Philippines. Remarkable images, 
 
 aren't they?
 
Next up, getting the inside track as The Formula One season wraps up here in Abu Dhabi. We hear from one of the people who made it all possible.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:54]
 
ANDERSON: Well, let's connect you to some of the news that is close to home. And in a significant move for businesses here, the UAE introducing a 
 
 15 percent tax on large multinational companies. The proposal is part of the government's drive to boost revenue outside of the oil sector. The tax 
 
 will come into effect in January and it will apply to companies with a consolidated global revenue of just under $800 million or more.
 
Well, stay in the UAE, the Formula One season wrapped up with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this weekend. Lando Norris took the checkered flag Yas Marina 
 
 circuit helping McLaren to win their first F1 constructors title since 1998. And McLaren not the only winner. The race gives a huge boost to Abu 
 
 Dhabi itself. Last year, visitors who came to the Grand Prix spent $317 million in the Emirate. I spoke to the man behind the event, the CEO of 
 
 this region's biggest name in entertainment events, Ethara. He explained why the weekend was more than just a sporting success.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAIF RASHID AL NOAIMI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ETHARA: Proud to be, you know, one of the major tent pole events in Abu Dhabi that supports our 
 
 tourism strategy in Abu Dhabi and also supports the economic diversification. From a tourism point of view, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is 
 
 huge. If you look at occupancy, if you look at hotel rates over the weekend of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix their highest throughout the year.
 
And, you know, looking at retail spend, looking at people spending, you know, five, six days in Abu Dhabi and getting to experience what Abu Dhabi 
 
 has to offer. Whether it's coming to the event, the entertainment, or coming to experience the cultural attractions in Abu Dhabi. It's something 
 
 that we're very proud to have this platform.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: As we mentioned, Ethara, the company is a leader in the entertainment industry in this region. And sport is just the tip of the 
 
 iceberg. It's behind some of the biggest music and cultural events in key venues like the Etihad arena and these are growing. Asked about Ethara's 
 
 new partnership with the venue and hospitality firm Oak View Group. It is looking to invest a staggering $5 billion in new venues around the world, 
 
 with a chunk of that investment heading right here.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AL NOAIMI: Our objective is to operate and grow our portfolio of venues in the region. And, you know, it's really a win-win partnership with Oak View 
 
 Group. We complement each other. You know, Ethara being regionally present, having the operational team on the ground to deliver events and operate 
 
 venues in the region. And Oak View Group with their, you know, global leadership and in the venue, space, entertainment and elevating hospitality 
 
 and customer experience.
 
So, we're fortunate the partnership Oak View Group Middle East just won the agreement to operate Zayed Sports City which is a huge, iconic venue in Abu 
 
 Dhabi. We're really excited about getting involved in that, you know, bringing global events to such a historic and iconic venue. And we also 
 
 recently were appointed to operate a house of sustainability in Expo City. So those are ones, immediately we have taken over operations.
 
And our aspirations are much bigger than that. As you can see, the sky's the limit. You know, these are the biggest sporting brands in the world. 
 
 You know, Formula One is growing at such a tremendous pace, number of viewers globally, demographics of viewers is evolving. NBA, likewise, is 
 
 growing globally. It's become a global sport. UFC, obviously, has been -- has been in growth phase for years.
 
So, we're always looking at the next big thing. And, you know, these are -- these are the kinds of leagues that we want to be associated with.
 
ANDERSON: Abu Dhabi is always looking at the next big thing. But as I look at these sports and entertainment pillar, there is real opportunity here. 
 
 Where do you see Abu Dhabi in five, 10 years from now?
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
AL NAOIMI: We're going to continue doing what we're doing, we're going to enhance, we're going to, you know, bring world class events. We're going to 
 
 deliver world class venues, elevate the existing venues that we have. And yes, it's a very, very exciting time for us.
