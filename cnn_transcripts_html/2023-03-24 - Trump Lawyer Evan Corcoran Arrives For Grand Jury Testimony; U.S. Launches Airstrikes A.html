JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, good morning, everyone. I'm John Berman. Developing this morning, we are getting new information about the U.S. retaliation after a drone attack killed an American contractor and wounded five U.S. service members in Syria. This video appears to show the aftermath of that strike. The Pentagon believes the drone that hit a base housing U.S. personnel. They believe that drone was Iranian made. U.S. forces quickly struck back, targeting facilities used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard, so says U.S. officials. Also say U.S. officials. This morning, CNN got reaction from the White House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: We don't seek a war with Iran. We're not looking for an armed conflict with that country or another war in the region. We do seek to protect our mission in Syria. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: All of this is unfolding as President Biden is set to meet with the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. We are live in Ottawa. We are waiting to hear from the President himself on this attack in Syria. 
 
Also just a few minutes ago, you can see him there, the back of him. That is Trump attorney, Evan Corcoran, arriving at a Washington, D.C. Courthouse. He just entered the building. He is going to testify today before a grand jury in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents probe. And he will do so without the protection of attorney-client privilege. 
 
First, though, we are getting new information about this deadly flare up of hostilities in Syria overnight, President Biden ordered retaliatory airstrikes after a drone attack killed a U.S. contractor, five U.S. service members and another U.S. contractor were also wounded. 
 
CNN's Natasha Bertrand is covering all this for us, has the latest information now, Natasha, what are U.S. officials say? 
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  Yeah, John, so we're being told that that suspected Iranian drone that attacked a U.S. base in Syria and killed a U.S. contractor and wounded several other service members U.S. service members was a one way suspected Iranian attack drone that potentially crashed into its target. We are told, of course, the U.S. did retaliate. They targeted facilities in Syria that the U.S. believes were being used by Iranian proxy groups in order to support those groups with munitions and intelligence. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin saying that this strike, this airstrike, was carried out in response to several recent attacks by these Iranian proxy groups. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BERTRAND: President Joe Biden ordering a U.S. airstrike in eastern Syria Thursday after U.S. intelligence assessed that an Iranian origin drone killed an American contractor and wounded five U.S. service members and another U.S. contractor. 
 
Biden authorized the strike, "against facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps," Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement. The department of Defense said, "took proportionate and deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimize casualties."
 
The U.S. military maintains approximately 900 U.S. troops in Syria, some of which are there as part of a coalition to defeat ISIS. But those forces are often under attack by Iranian proxies. 
 
GEN. MICHAEL KURILLA, COMMANDER OF U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Iran's vast and deeply resourced proxy forces spread instability throughout the region and threaten our regional partners.
 
BERTRAND: The commander of U.S. Central Command said in a statement following the strike, "we are postured for scalable options in the face of any additional Iranian attacks." Testifying on Capitol Hill Thursday, Kurilla said that Iranian proxies have carried out attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East 78 times since the beginning of 2021. 
 
KURILLA: So what Iran does to hide its hand is they use Iranian proxies that's, that's either UAVs or -- or rockets to be able to attack our forces in either Iraq or Syria. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are these considered acts of war by Iran? 
 
KURILLA: They are being done by the Iranian proxies is what I would tell you, Congressman. 
 
BERTRAND: The Biden administration has carried out multiple airstrikes against militias affiliated with Iran following previous attacks on U.S. facilities in the region. Biden's first known military action was a strike in February 2021, after rocket attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BERTRAND: Now, General Kurilla, who is the Commander of Central Command, he did provide important context for all of this last week, telling lawmakers that currently Iran possesses the most diverse and largest missile arsenal in the Middle East. And also has the largest and most capable unmanned aerial vehicle force in the region. 
 
So all of that, of course, really concerning the U.S. here, and we should note that these U.S. service members, four of them, were actually medically evacuated to Iraq, and we are told that they are currently in stable condition. John.
 <br>[09:05:07]
 
BERMAN: Natasha, please keep us posted on their wellbeing, thank you so much for that report. 
 
With me now is retired U.S. General Wesley Clark. General, thanks so much for being with us. Natasha reporting that the U.S. says there have been 78 drone strikes within that Syria region since 2021 by these Iranian proxies. First, what does that mean, Iranian proxy when we're talking about this? And number two, what are they up to if they're striking the U.S. so much there? 
 
GEN. WESLEY CLARK, (Ret.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So these are groups that are affiliated with Hezbollah or other groups in the region. They are conducting resupply reconnaissance operations. They're building their forces against Israel. They're supporting Bashar al-Assad to some extent. The Israelis go against them. And our mission there is to support our allies, both our Kurdish allies working against ISIS, and also we collect information and intelligence. 
 
Now, why this is particularly disturbing is when they're able to bring accurate targeting against the United States and inflict casualties, this raises the level of risk for our personnel in the region. Attacks mortars, a mortar falls inaccurately and so forth. That's an attack. A drone that hits a barracks facility and takes out five service members, that's a different order of magnitude. So we're retaliating. The question is, will we have to actually defend against these drones in order to maintain our footprint in the region. We don't want to do that. Obviously, we don't want to escalate against Iran, as the Secretary of Defense said. So this is raising the risks for us and creating some policy dilemmas. 
 
BERMAN: If it does create this new level, as you're describing, if the Iranian proxies can't hit U.S. troops with these precision weapons, what then do you do about it? Is this precision strike, so-called by U.S. officials in retaliation enough? 
 
CLARK: Well, we don't know. I mean, this really goes back to what the Iranian intent is. Can they keep us off balance enough and the Israelis off balance enough to build up their forces, maintain their leverage against Israel, their relationship with Syria? These are all variables that are -- that are evaluated by the Iranians and then they determine the next course of action. Would they like to drive us out of the region? Absolutely. That would give them greater control in the region, also reduce our ability to support Iraq and give them greater influence there. 
 
It's all part of Iran's quest for regional hegemony, and we're there to block it in a very and we're doing so in a very efficient, safe manner. We don't need these kind of drone strikes. You know, Iran is raising -- it's raising the bar. It's got the relationship with Russia, and China has just helped it restore relationship. So we're entering a new era in the region. 
 
BERMAN: Talk to me about that wider picture, because Iran's got its fingers in Ukraine also. The Russians are using Iranian drones to attack the Ukrainians here?
 
CLARK: That's right. And there's a possibility they're going to build a factory in Ukraine, maybe in Crimea or in Russia, to be able to manufacture more drones there. So this is all part of Iran's quest to return to great power status. It's the regional hegemony, and they're using Russia, they're using their relationship with China. They feel a little bit more confident and they're still struggling with enormous internal resistance. 
 
These protests that began last fall are still continuing to some extent inside Iran. The regime is not stable and it projects itself and builds its reputation by these kinds of actions externally. 
 
BERMAN: General Clark, thank you so much for helping us understand what we are seeing. This may just be one chapter and a continuing story there. I appreciate it. And again, we are waiting to hear from President Biden on this attack in person. He is traveling in Canada. 
 
In the meantime, just a few minutes ago, Donald Trump's attorney, Evan Corcoran arrived at a Washington D.C. courthouse, you can see him there, to testify to a grand jury without the protection of. Attorney client-privilege. Corcoran must also hand over documents and notes related to his. Legal work with the former President. This is all about the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation. CNN's Katelyn Polantz, live outside the courthouse in Washington D.C. 
 
Evan Corcoran is inside, Katelyn, so what's happening? 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Indeed, Evan Corcoran is inside the courthouse, and we do believe he's back with the grand jury at this point, a little bit after 9:00. His attorney is here as well. So it is quite clear that he isn't complying with this court order, that he provide answers he did not want to give and that his client, Donald Trump, did not want him to give to the grand jury about their communications as the federal government was trying to -- get to -- trying to get back classified records at Mar-a-Lago.
 <br>[09:10:15]
 
We learned last night from my colleague, Sara Murray, and a source she was speaking with that what they want to ask him about is that response after May of last year, where the federal government sent a subpoena demanding all classified records be returned to them. 
 
And there clearly were conversations between Corcoran and Donald Trump then, including in June. That is what we know they want to ask him about and that he is going to have to respond to today inside the grand jury. 
 
He did just go in a few minutes ago and typically these types of appearances can last for hours. So we are going to be waiting. It is entirely confidential what happens inside that grand jury room, so we won't be able to see it like we do other court hearings. But this is really a critical day for the special counsel's investigation. And also a really unusual day to have a lawyer for Donald Trump being forced to come back to court and testify again, John. 
 
BERMAN: It is incredibly unusual. Katelyn Polantz, we know you're watching it closely. Let us know, you know, when the white smoke comes out of the building, when people emerge, when there is information about what went on in there. I appreciate it. 
 
POLANTZ: I will. 
 
BERMAN: Joined now by former federal prosecutor and CNN Legal Analyst Jennifer Rodgers. Jennifer, as we've been saying, this is highly unusual for a defense attorney to have to testify like this. The prosecution, the special counsel, obviously this is a big get for them. They got them there. What do they now need to try to get from him? 
 
JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: So Katelyn said the first thing, which is the circumstances around the certification that was submitted in response to the subpoena saying, we have diligently searched for all documents, and we have no more documents with classified markings. That document was drafted by Evan Corcoran, but he didn't sign it. Christina Bobb, another Trump lawyer, signed it. 
 
So the question is, where did they get that information? Did they get that information from Trump? Why did Christina Bobb sign it, everything around that certification.  The second really important thing is that there was a conversation between Corcoran and Trump on the day that the Trump Organization received a subpoena for surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago. 
 
People were seen bringing boxes in and out of the storage room. Why did they do that? What was that conversation? I mean, you can imagine what would have happened. We got this subpoena. What's going on at Mar-a-Lago with the boxes.  Mr. Trump and that conversation. So that's another topic they're going to have. 
 
BERMAN: So Evan Corcoran, perhaps at this very moment is going through something that very few attorneys have ever gone through. You haven't, certainly, sitting before a grand jury having to testify about your client. What are just the challenges for him, the professional challenges for him? 
 
RODGERS: Yeah. Well, this is something that you obviously would never want to do. When you talk to your client in that context, it's supposed to be confidential, you don't really have to worry about talking around things, right? You can be fully candid with one another under that protection. That protection has now gone away. So that's not great for him. 
 
Listen, he doesn't have a choice here. He could take the Fifth, but I don't think he will. That's not a great look for him professionally. 
 
BERMAN: Because it means you're not testifying, because it might incriminate yourself, which in theory, a lawyer shouldn't be in the business of incriminating himself for anything he might say, right?
 
RODGERS: Right. And it's probably not true, right? I mean, the government at least doesn't think that he actually was involved in this conspiracy. They think that Trump lied to him. So they either would go challenge that invocation or probably just give him immunity. So they're going to get at it anyway. 
 
BERMAN: So he's got to answer just about everything. 
 
RODGERS: Yeah. I mean, everything that he didn't answer before, they had him in before. So now they're just going back to the questions that he said, attorney client privilege, invocation and asking those. 
 
BERMAN: All right, while that is going on in Washington. Here in New York today, I joke nothing's happening with Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney's investigation into Donald Trump regarding the Stormy Daniels hush money payments, things connected to that. The grand jury is not meeting today. We think they are going to meet again on Monday. Donald Trump overnight put out this statement on his social media platform where he cited the possibility of death and destruction if Alvin Bragg presses charges, dangled that theory out there. 
 
I don't want to ask you, an attorney, about the propriety of a human being saying that he also continues to say things that are racist. If you are in the office of Alvin Bragg, if you are a prosecutor, how do you react to something like that? 
 
RODGERS: Well, it's really hard to be under -- first of all, this kind of scrutiny. Of course it is around this whole case, but those kind of threats are really disturbing for anyone. I mean, listen, Alvin is a professional. I promise you I know him well. He will not be daunted by that sort of shenanigans by the former President. But it is troubling, I mean, obviously they'll have additional security and those sorts of things, but to be under that kind of attack is really disturbing. But in the end, you know, it won't matter to him. They'll, of course, move ahead with their case. 
 
BERMAN: Jennifer Rodgers, great to have you here. Thank you very much. 
 
The U.S. and Canada have struck a deal to address a sharp increase in migrants over the northern order. We are live in Ottawa as President Biden is set to speak to the Canadian Parliament. 
 <br>[09:15:07]
 
Shocking video of a shooting in broad daylight. Four gunmen spraying more than 60 rounds into a home, putting two teens in critical condition. What police are saying about the search for suspects. The TikTok CEO getting into heated exchanges with lawmakers looking to ban the platform in the U.S. We will speak to an expert who says that may be harder than you think. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BERMAN: This morning, President Biden is finishing up his first trip to Canada as president, meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Now, we are waiting to see if the President comments on the attack in Syria overnight. 
 
This afternoon, the President will address the Canadian parliament. The two leaders are expected to announce a deal regarding asylum seekers. CNN has recently reported on the increased flow over the Canadian border. 
 
CNN's Paula Newton is live in Ottawa. First, though, let's go to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez in Washington. With the reporting, Priscilla, on what this new asylum deal would do?
 <br>[09:20:03]
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN REPORTER: And this would ultimately, John, restrict the migrants who are seeking protection in Canada. Because what's happening here and what's become urgent for Canada is that there's been an influx of migrants coming from the U.S. into Canada. So what is this agreement? It's called the Safe Third Country Agreement. It was signed in 2002, implemented in 2004, and it applies to individuals crossing at official border crossings, also known as ports of entry. 
 
So if they cross through, they can seek protection in Canada. But if they came from the U.S. and they can also claim asylum in the U.S., which is deemed a safe country, then Canada can push them back to continue that claim in the United States. 
 
What it didn't apply to, though, was unofficial border crossings. And what has been happening as of late is there's been an influx of migrants crossing in Roxham Road, that is a street connecting New York and Quebec, and they have seen an influx of migrants crossing there, nearly 5000 in January. Canadian authority, according to Canadian statistics. 
 
So what the Canadians have been trying to do is close that loophole. And now we know that they have reached a deal. So that means that migrants who cross at that road as well could be turned back to the United States and vice versa. 
 
Now, of course, we've been hearing from the Biden administration about an influx of border crossings on the U.S. southern border. They're also seeing migrants cross from Canada into the U.S. Those numbers, though, still low, nearly 2000 since October into February. In a day, John, just to give you some perspective on the U.S. southern border, authorities can encounter up to 5000. So of course these numbers are still small in comparison. But it was a point and an issue that needed to be raised between the U.S. and Canada, and one that after years, is being resolved in. 
 
BERMAN: And Paula Newton, you had a chance to speak with the Canadian Prime Minister. What's his thinking on the immigration situation? 
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, it's been top of mind here, despite the numbers that Priscilla just pointed out. And I can tell you, John, I've been along that road for several years have gone and you can see U.S. border Patrol doing nothing to stop at times hundreds of migrants in a day from crossing illegally into Canada. What we're going to learn is that that is about to change. I want you to listen now to Justin Trudeau talking to me yesterday in a sit-down interview about what he hopes this new agreement mean. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER:  Canada is always willing to do more. We're a country that has been built like the United States on welcoming people from around the world. We just need to make sure we're doing it in responsible, proper ways to continue to have our citizens positive towards immigration. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: So when we talk about doing more, what does he mean? He means actually helping out the United States by taking in more asylum seekers, perhaps even from that southern border. Now, John, a busy day ahead here. I'll tell you, it's bright and beautiful, but pretty cold. The President will be inside addressing a parliament. After that they'll have a joint meeting of both cabinets and after that, a joint press conference. This issue about doing more, John, the whole theme about the United States coming here with their officials is they want Canada to step up in many areas, including defense spending. 
 
U.S. officials, quite frankly, have told me for weeks that their expectations were low. Perhaps they set them deliberately, John, because they have this immigration deal, something they didn't think was possible. Also looking for more, as I said, though, on defense spending. They may have more announcements to come later this afternoon. John.
 
BERMAN: Paula Newton in Ottawa. I think it is the Canadian national slogan, bright and beautiful, but pretty cold. Thank you for being with us. Priscilla Alvarez, our thanks to you as well. 
 
So a one-year-old child is safe, in safe hands this morning after U.S. border patrol agents say a smuggler left the child at the U.S.-Mexico border. Cameras captured someone coming out of the Colorado River with the child and leaving the child on U.S. land next to a barrier. The adult later goes back to the water while the child stands there. 
 
Moments later, a Border patrol agent arrives and grabs the child. The Border patrol later released a photo of the one-year-old being cared for by agents. The child is now in the care of Health and Human Services in the Office of Refugee Settlement. 
 
A brazen shooting in broad daylight in Philadelphia. The latest on the search for the gunman who shot three teams. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:28:45]
 
BERMAN: A brazen shooting on the streets of Philadelphia has left two teenagers fighting for their lives. Four gunmen, at least one with a semiautomatic weapon opened fire. It happened in broad daylight. The victims were two 16-year-olds and a 13-year-old. Two of them are in critical condition. CNN's Brynn Gingras is with me now. Brynn, what do police know about the suspects? 
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, John, I mean, this is one where the video shows it all. I mean, it's brazen and it's terrifying. Authorities are now looking for five people who are part of this shooting, one being the getaway driver. But, yes, those victims, they hit three teenagers, one just 13 years old, a 16-year- old. They're in critical condition in the hospital. But you can see the video there, authorities say those four people went and fired those guns like you said. 
 
One of them, a semiautomatic rifle, 60 rounds were shot. And I'm told by authorities that this is an area of the city of Philadelphia that is quite vibrant. There was plenty of people around when this took place. I want you to hear more from the captain in the Philadelphia Police Department. 
 
CAPT. JAMES KEAMEY, PHILADELPHIA POLICE: An automatic gun going off with broad daylight, broad daylight, on the streets of city of Philadelphia. Four males just shooting up the block. Shooting up, you know, with no care in the world, it seems to me. It's very concerning. It's disappointing. And these people need to be held accountable. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GINGRAS: And, of course, they're still looking for those people.</pre>
