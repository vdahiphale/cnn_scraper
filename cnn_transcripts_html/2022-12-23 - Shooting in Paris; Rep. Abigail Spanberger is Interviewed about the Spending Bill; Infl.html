DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: We appreciate what you do. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Merry Christmas.
 
LEMON: Thank you, sir. Merry Christmas.
 
GARETH "OX" LEA, OWNER, OX &amp; SON TOWING: Merry Christmas, guys. 
 
LEMON: Yes, he's a good guy, man. 
 
So -- and that's a tough job. 
 
SIDNER: Yes, it is.
 
LEMON: New this morning, we are learning of a shooting in Paris that we need to tell you about. We have the details for you. That is next. 
 
SIDNER: And, what we're learning from the just released January 6th committee's final report, ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
LEMON: All right, so we have some breaking news to tell you about here. At least three people are dead and four others are injured in central Paris. This after a gunman opened fire this morning. 
 
Straight now to Nada Bashir in London.
 
Nada, please inform us. What happened?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, Don, this is certainly still an ongoing situation. An investigation has been launched. As you laid out there, at least three people confirmed dead, four others injured after a gunman opened fire in what is said to be a Kurdish community center in central Paris, reportedly according to a local mayor and nearby local restaurant and barbershop was also impacted in this attack. 
 
Now, of course, we have learned that the gunman has been arrested. An investigation has been launched. But what is interesting to note is that this gunman was previously known to the authorities who got in two previous in incidences, including one previous attack at a migrant tent camp encampment. So, there is certainly concern about what may have motivated this attack. At this stage, that is still unclear. The investigators will be working to determine this. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
But what is most important to note is that the gunman has now been arrested by police. But, of course, that tragic news, at least three people dead so far, four others injured. We are still waiting to learn more details around the casualties impacted in this attack. 
 
Don.
 
LEMON: Nada, and as you get more information, we'll get back to you. 
 
Nada Bashir in London with our breaking news out of Paris this morning. 
 
Thank you, Nada.
 
SIDNER: Now to some other news.
 
On the heels of President Zelenskyy's historic visit to Congress, the House is set to vote on a bill to avoid a government shutdown before funding expires today. The Senate passed its massive $1.7 trillion spending bill on Thursday, which includes roughly $45 billion for Ukraine, funding for prosecutions related to the January 6th attack on the Capitol, and a provision aimed at making it hard to overturn the certified results of a presidential election. 
 
Joining us now to discuss is Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.
 
Thank you so much, Congresswoman, for joining us. 
 
REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): Thank you for having me. 
 
SIDNER: Let's first talk about this $45 million that has been earmarked for Ukraine, as it's in the midst of fighting -- trying to fight Russia, keeping it from taking over the country and has done an incredibly -- an incredible job at doing that on their own but they are asking for more help. Is this money well worth spent or do you have concerns? 
 
SPANBERGER: This money is absolutely an investment that the American people are making in supporting our Ukrainian allies, but also in supporting the cause of democracy throughout the world. I think it's important to remember that while we are making substantial investments in Ukraine, we are also leading the way for our allies throughout the world to do the same. We are not alone in providing substantial support, and we have led our partners and allies in the provision of aid, be it lethal aid, humanitarian aid, and also in sanctioning Russian oligarchs and those who are behind and supporting this horrific invasion and war in Ukraine. So I am proud to support this additional provision of aid. It is vitally important that we continue to support the Ukrainian people as they fight for their own democracy and the cause of democracy worldwide. SIDNER: Both Don and I have been on the ground there. It is incredible
 
 to see the work of regular everyday people who do keep saying, look, we just need more weapons, we need more money to try and fight this. But there are those on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, some of the extreme parts of the party as well saying things like, you know, Zelenskyy is the puppet or the shadow president of the United States, getting all this money. How do you respond to them? And do they have any -- is there anything that you can see there from their side of things that they're worried about things like what's happening at the border and yet spending this kind of money, giving it to Ukraine? 
 
SPANBERGER: So, there's a couple things that I bring to this conversation. One, I'm a former CIA officer. I worked under cover with the CIA for the entirety of my time. And among the things that I focused on was understanding the threat of covert influence coming at us and certainly our work throughout the world to understand the Russian threat towards the United States, toward our people and, more broadly, around the world. 
 
And what we have here, unfortunately, is people who are falling prey to Russian talking point, to Putin's talking points. The idea that Putin continues to try and divide the United States, not only here domestically, but divide us from our allies, create divisions and sow distrust or dissension among our ranks. And so the conversations I've been having with colleagues are very simple, do not fall prey to Vladimir Putin's talking points, do not give any favor or support to what it is that he would try and push the world round, which is denigrating Ukraine, changing the world's view of what has been a brutal war where they are murdering and raping civilians and just horrific atrocities. 
 
And, importantly, we are investing in their ability to fight their war, right? The Ukrainians are asking us for aid, they're asking us for the weapon systems that we have that will allow them to continue fighting on their own. They have shown tremendous bravery, tremendous resilience and what they have been asking from us from the very beginning is access to and support of -- access to our weapons systems and our - and support to their efforts to wage this war. 
 
And, notably, there's no reason to believe that once Putin, if he were to conquer Ukraine, that he would stop there. And importantly, as a member of the NATO alliance, the United States should remember, and certainly every elected official should remember, that the minute they cross into a NATO country, that's the point in time when it is U.S. soldiers who are being asked to join that fight. 
 <br>[08:40:09]
 
And that is an eventuality that we have the ability never to see by making these investments and allowing the Ukrainian people to fight their own war and support them in doing it. And when it comes to funding, this funding bill supports domestic priorities here at home, fighting the opioid crisis, investing in mental health. Provisions that I put forth that have been included in this legislation. Major support to our border security, hiring additional CPB officers, investing in technology so that we can stop the scourge of fentanyl that's being trafficked by transnational criminal organizations across our border and leading to the deaths of people across our communities. We can do both. We must do both. And that's the message that I've certainly been delivering to my colleagues.
 
SIDNER: We can walk and chew gum at the same time. 
 
SPANBERGER: That's right.
 
SIDNER: And you were talking about that 4,000 page omnibus bill that I'm sure no one has gotten completely through. But there's also this 845 page final report from the select committee to investigate January 6th. And I do want to ask you lastly about the conclusion, which is that Donald Trump should never be able to hold public office again. 
 
Do you agree? 
 
SPANBERGER: I absolutely agree. It it's why I voted to impeach him when he tried to leverage support for Ukraine and military aid to Ukraine, trying to extort a political favor from President Zelenskyy. It's why I voted to impeach him for inciting an insurrection, as he did on January 6th. And certainly anyone who would stoke that type of violence, lie to the American people over and over and bring about the eventuality that we saw on January 6th and has not backed down from those lies and those incitements to violence ever since should not hold public office ever again. 
 
SIDNER: All right, Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, thank you so much. I know that you were put in the position of leadership for the Democrats' battleground leadership and I congratulate you on that and also happy holidays to you. 
 
SPANBERGER: Happy holidays. Thank you so much. 
 
SIDNER: Sure.
 
LEMON: Some key inflation data is just coming in. Our Christine Romans has the breakdown for you, next.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:46:26]
 
LEMON: So, we just got some brand new data in from the Fed's favorite inflation measure for the month of November, and it shows prices moderating for consumers. But the person who can explain this better than any of us is our chief business correspondent Christine Romans. 
 
So, what do the numbers show? Good morning, by the way.
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Oh, another little piece of evidence that inflation may have peaked. Prices are moderating for consumers. Prices fell for consumers for gas. Prices, of course. Food prices were up a little bit. But, overall, you're looking at something called the PCE price index, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge grew just 0.1 percent from October to November. That's fine. And year over year up 5.5 percent. 
 
In normal times, that 5.5 percent would really freak me out, but that's down from 7 percent just a few months ago. So, you've seen it month after month. If you look at a line chart, you can see the signs of how that appears to be peaking. You see that. So 5.5 percent. We want to see this trend continue, of course. But this is just another little piece of evidence to tuck over there in the inflation is peaking argument camp. And I think that's what you'll be seeing people talk about today, economists talk about today, that this looks like the worst of the inflation, the red hot, 40-year high inflation appears to be behind us. 
 
LEMON: Looks like. It looks like, yes.
 
ROMANS: It looks like. You know, look, I don't know what's going to happen next year. I mean the forecasts are very, very iffy for the whole next year. But gas prices coming down, consumer confidence went up this week.
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
ROMANS: GDP in the third quarter was strong. So, you see these pillars of the economy that seem strong heading into the end of the year. And that strength in the economy, you know, spewed all this inflation. 
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
ROMANS: And that inflation looks like it's cooling. So -
 
SIDNER: Right. You never know what's going to happen. 
 
LEMON: Thank you. Merry Christmas. 
 
SIDNER: Thank you. Merry Christmas.
 
ROMANS: Merry Christmas, you guys.
 
LEMON: Merry Christmas.
 
SIDNER: You look gorgeous. I love the color. 
 
ROMANS: Thank you.
 
SIDNER: It's a Christmas color. 
 
LEMON: So this morning's number is 79. Harry Enten standing by. 
 
SIDNER: Yay. You'll want to see this. The icon Dionne Warwick brings her exclusive story to CNN in the new film "Don't Make Me Over" premiering New Year's Day. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: Auntie Warwick has given us life for so, so long. It's going to be good.
 
LEMON: I can't wait to see that. Yes.
 
SIDNER: Now, Christmas Eve is tomorrow, as you know, and we're taking a look at all your Christmas favorites from movies to music to food. CNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten is here with us with all of the numbers this morning. 
 
All right, we're going to start with Christmas movies. I know I have my favorite. I'll keep it to myself for now. 
 
What did you learn? 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: OK, this morning's number is 79. Why? Seventy-nine percent of adults watch Christmas movies to celebrate Christmas. Among those who celebrate Christmas, which is the vast majority of folks. But let's dig into the numbers in terms of your favorite Christmas movie. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
ENTEN: OK, "It's a Wonderful Life" came in at 9 percent.
 
LEMON: That's it. That's it.
 
ENTEN: We have "The Grinch" at 7 percent. My personal favorite, "Home Alone," at 6 percent.
 
SIDNER: Really?
 
ENTEN: And I just wanted to note this because a lot of guys in our crew, "Die Hard" came in at 2 percent. So it - that's a --
 
SIDNER: That's for you, Jake Tapper, right there. It's not a Christmas movie, Jake. 
 
LEMON: Well, these guys too. It's not -
 
SIDNER: It's not a Christmas movie. 
 
LEMON: It's not a Christmas -
 
SIDNER: He said -
 
LEMON: This is it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it is. 
 
LEMON: Oh, wow, did you guys hear that? The voice of God. That's Elie (ph) our - that is -
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
LEMON: "It's a Wonderful Life." 
 
SIDNER: And this is all me right here.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
ENTEN: I have -
 
SIDNER: "A Christmas Story." I literally --
 
LEMON: Oh, my gosh.
 
SIDNER: Oh, my gosh. OK, can we roll the tape? I literally went -- there. Look. That is in the place where they shot it in Cleveland. And I could not help myself. 
 
LEMON: I have no idea what any of that means. 
 
SIDNER: You don't know what that -- have you not seen "A Christmas Story"?
 
LEMON: I - I - I don't really watch - 
 
SIDNER: I will fight you over that.
 
LEMON: I like older, traditional movies. I like the black and white old movies. I want to see Scrooge. I want to see "It's a Wonderful Life." I want to see "Rudolph." I don't want to see this new stuff.
 
SIDNER: I'm giving you straight attitude.
 
LEMON: Not interested.
 
SIDNER: If you do not - that is not new. It's from 1983, sorry, and it's set back in the '30s or '40s. 
 
ENTEN: Before I was born.
 
LEMON: It's new.
 
SIDNER: I mean - oh, Harry.
 
LEMON: That was in 1983. I was in high school. It's new. 
 
ENTEN: We're not - we're not talking about ages here.
 
How about some - a favorite non-religious Christmas song. "All I Want for Christmas is You," Mariah Carey, 4 percent, "Jingle Bells," 4 percent, "White Christmas," 3 percent, "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,' the Christmas song, at 2 percent, or "Rudolph the Red Noce Reindeer."
 
LEMON: Wait, that - "All I Want for Christmas," I've never heard that song. 
 
SIDNER: OK, Don, now stop lying.
 
ENTEN: All I want for Christmas is you.
 
LEMON: No, I'm just joking I love Mariah Carey. Just like I love Whitney Houston. But I used to joke with people saying, "I Will Always Love You," when it come on the radio, I'd say, I've never heard that song, what is it? Because it's always on the radio. 
 
SIDNER: It's always on. Yes, it's true.
 
LEMON: Always.
 
ENTEN: Because it's a number one throughout the year.
 
SIDNER: He actually threatened me, when he said, you'd better not say that your favorite is "all I Want for Christmas." 
 
LEMON: I love her. I love it. 
 
SIDNER: I do to.
 
LEMON: But, just, they play it a lot. 
 
ENTEN: Do you have a favorite Christmas cookie? 
 
SIDNER: All of them, basically. Hello. 
 
LEMON: Yes. That's it. Chocolate chip. 
 
ENTEN: Chocolate chip. 
 
LEMON: Chocolate chip.
 
ENTEN: I prefer - I think I'm going to keep it simple with sugar. Just - and one last little thing for you.
 
LEMON: Oh, I'm also weird. I also love pound cake. Not pound cake, fruitcake. 
 
SIDNER: Fruit - ew.
 
LEMON: And I love chocolate covered cherries. 
 
SIDNER: Wait, pound cake or fruitcake.
 
LEMON: Don't stop it. I love chocolate covered cherries and fruitcake. 
 
ENTEN: Artificial trees are where it's at, if you have one at home. 
 
LEMON: Thank you. I agree. 
 
SIDNER: Oh, no. No, no. 
 
LEMON: I agree with you. I used to love real trees.
 
SIDNER: No, the smell of a tree -- of a fresh tree.
 <br>[08:55:02]
 
ENTEN: Then you've got to gid rid of it. It's way to much.
 
SIDNER: Oh, (INAUDIBLE).
 
LEMON: All right, thank Harry and his promo. That's what they're saying. 
 
SIDNER: Harry, thank you.
 
LEMON: OK, so we're also counting down the days until we ring in the new year. Anderson and Andy are back with another global celebration. So, join them for New Year's Eve live from Times Square starting at 8:00 p.m. on CNN. And you can join me as well live from New Orleans. A global celebration, as it is very year.
 
SIDNER: Can I - can I show up for that?
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
SIDNER: Can I just show up and just walk in? Can the bosses hear? 
 
LEMON: We got this, though. Yes. Yes.
