CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. Here are some of the top stories we're following today. 
 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump is blaming technical issues for his voice sounding, quote, somewhat different and strange during his conversation with Elon Musk on Tuesday. At several points Trump's speech sounded as if he had a lisp or was slurring his words which attracted quite a bit of attention online. 
 
This November voters in Arizona and Missouri will weigh in on amendments that would establish a right to abortion in their state's constitution. There are now eight states with abortion ballot measures this fall. 
 
Tropical storm Ernesto is now close to category 1 hurricane strength as it lashes Puerto Rico and heavy rain and strong winds. Flash flood warnings are in effect there as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands where most people have also lost power and more than a hundred thousand customers are without electricity in Puerto Rico.
 
Now Greece's worst wildfire of the year has eased as strong winds died down and firefighters worked to put out the last of the blaze. More than 400 square kilometers or 156 square miles of forests in the Attica region and up to the suburbs of Athens have burned in the fast- moving fire. At least one person was killed and thousands of residents were evacuated as the fire came very close to the Greek capital where more than three million people live.
 
Emergency crews have been working to extinguish the fire which began on Sunday near the town of Varnavas. One resident describes the inferno.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): It was hell. The fire started from very high up and it came all the way down to the village. It was running at great speed. It was very windy. There was panic. There were sirens. A lot of people, police, people crying, screaming, shouting and it reached and burned all the way down to Athens.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) MACFARLANE: A local mayor told CNN at some point the fire was faster than the cars and trucks and he said that studies show that in the next 30 years similar fires could devastate everything under 300 meters leading towards the middle of Greece. 
 
Well across Europe there's no relief in sight for the heat wave, especially in the southeast. Volunteers have been distributing water and ice pops but some tourists in Milan, Italy say they were not prepared for the blistering heat.
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean yes we expected it but I didn't expect it to be like this warm and this like overwhelming.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: The temperatures are expected to remain in the mid to upper 30s, even reaching 40 degrees Celsius in some areas. CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau joins us from Rome. And Barbie this is not good news for those tourists queuing for that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the Colosseum in Rome.
 
BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN REPORTER: No that's absolutely right. You know there are 22 cities in Italy that are under a red alert. Now this red alert as defined by the Italian Health Ministry is not just for people who are vulnerable who have health problems this is for everyone.
 
They're saying that people no matter what your health condition, your age, should stay out of the Sun during the heat of the day which is basically around now or 11 o'clock a.m. until about 6:00 p.m. and for the next two days. We've got civil protection people around handing out water like you said in these cities. And it's so important for tourists to take a heed to this because so many of them come from places where they're not used to the heat. 
 
You know one thing you won't see though, Christina, is that the Italians are not out during the heat of the day. People who live in Southern Europe do not go out during the heat of the day. They know how to handle this sort of weather. You know they stay in their house, they dress you know with light clothing, they don't drink alcohol, all the things the tourists intended to do.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes and you know we were talking just now as well about the wildfires in Greece and how close that came to the capital of Athens, Barbie. I mean this the difference here is that these were residential homes, these where people have lived for years and years, not necessarily a tourist destination that was badly affected. I mean how are authorities looking at this now in light of the fact that this is only really going to get set to become worse?
 
NADEAU: Yes, you know that is the issue. You know we do this every year we talk about how hot it is. It gets hot every year but, you know, you're starting to see people think about changing the way they do their vacations, not coming during these incredible heat waves. 
 
Now two years in a row we've had really, really, really bad heat waves in Southern Europe. When you talk about Athens and those homes in the residential areas you know people there are talking about prevention, about things that they could do so that the fire wouldn't spread so fast.
 
We had a fire here not far from here in Rome last week that just spread very quickly too. You know it is really a lot about carelessness of people. So many of these fires are started by someone flicking a cigarette or not taking care when they're putting out a campfire or something like that.
 
These are the things that people have to learn and these are the things that the authorities are trying to say is that many of these fires are preventable. But once they start they are so, so hard to get control of because there's so much of Southern Europe right now that has been under drought conditions as well. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
No rain in sight, hot winds, incredible heat and you can just imagine for these firefighters how difficult it is under those conditions. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, really extreme. Barbie we appreciate you reporting for us there live from Rome. Thank you.
 
Now the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster fund has run out. It's the second year in a row the fund has been depleted before the peak of hurricane season. A trend one official tells CNN is because of climate change. The agency shifted into so-called immediate needs funding last week while it waits for Congress to pass a $9 billion supplemental funding request. A FEMA spokesperson says the agency does have enough resources to respond to impending disasters like Ernesto but will need to pause long-term recovery from previous disasters. 
 
And realtors across the U.S. are bracing for a seismic shift in the way they do business. Beginning Saturday new rules will overhaul the way realtors get paid to help people buy and sell their homes. CNN's Karin Caifa reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARIN CAIFA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): New rules for realtors will eliminate the long-standing 6 percent commission paid by a home seller and potentially lower overall home prices.
 
STEPHEN BROBECK, FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA: For a century, the industry has essentially set commission rates.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): The changes effective this Saturday August 17th are part of a settlement announced in March by the National Association of Realtors. For decades, a seller's agent typically charged the seller five or six percent of a home's purchase price intended to be shared with the buyer's agent. That puts sellers on the hook for an additional cost some experts say inflated home prices.
 
Now sellers will no longer be expected to make commission offers to buyer agents. Vanessa Perry interim dean of the George Washington University School of Business says the new rules provide more transparency but don't necessarily simplify the process.
 
VANESSA PERRY, INTERIM DEAN, GEORGE WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Increased transparency does not mean increased understanding.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): Additionally home buyers will have to sign a representation agreement with an agent before even touring a home, which could be challenging for less experienced buyers.
 
PERRY: They're trying to navigate an already complex set of transactions. Maybe the biggest transaction they'll ever engage in in their lives.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): That's why Steve Roback of the Consumer Federation of America says it's more important than ever to find an agent who knows the new landscape.
 
BROBECK: Consumers talking to agents who don't really understand the new marketplace need to find another agent.
 
CAIFA: Home buying is already a very complex financial process and both Roback and Perry said that consumers should not hesitate to ask questions. Realtors are going to be navigating this new process as well. The Consumer Federation of America says to feel free to ask an attorney or another independent expert to review any documents in the process before you sign them.
 
In Washington. I'm Karin Caifa.

MACFARLANE: Now Comcast and NBC Universal may have been the real U.S. winners of the Paris Olympic Games. The American media giant says their coverage drew an average of more than 30 million viewers across platforms. That's a whopping 82 percent jump in viewership compared to the Tokyo Games.
 
NBC streaming app Peacock featured more than thirty two hundred live events over the course of the games including generative A.I. daily recaps and a multi view feature where viewers could watch several events at one time. 
 
Now it's been a busy few days for the street artist Banksy. For anyone that's been keeping up the new artwork has appeared in London the ninth in his animal series.
 
A mural showing a gorilla freeing a seal and birds appeared at London Zoo on Tuesday. The street artist has posted an uncaptioned picture on this of the artwork on his official Instagram account. And of course discussion abounded on social media about the meaning behind it.
 
Something to do with caged animals and whether that's the right thing to do. No doubt. 
 
Now U.S. President Joe Biden is promoting a cause that's close to his heart. Still ahead, his multi-million dollar pledge towards fighting cancer in the U.S. 
 
Cleo Sol is just one of the artists on Barack Obama's summer playlist. We'll tell you who else made the cut.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: The governor of Belgrade, Russia has declared a region's regional emergency saying Ukrainian forces have launched drone attacks there. Russia claims its air defenses shot down dozens of Ukrainian aircraft type drones and four tactical missiles over Kursk. That's the region where Russia has -- where Ukrainian forces have been advancing.
 
It's been one week since their incursion shocked and humiliated Moscow and put Russian President Vladimir Putin on the defensive. Ukraine claims it's already taking control of more than 1,000 square kilometers, 40 of those in the past day alone. 
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian has been tracking developments. And I think for the first time since we heard of this bold move by Ukraine into Kursk, we're beginning to learn new details now about the motivation behind this and what they intend to do next.
 
What's the latest?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, look, first of all, on the speed of the advance 40 square kilometers, that's the size of Bakhmut, more or less, which took Russia 10 months to gain. So it's not quite the same, right? Ukraine is making it clear they don't want to annex anything, but they are, it seems, if you believe their reports, obviously impossible to verify at this point moving with some speed.
 
But you're right. Initially, we got nothing from Ukraine on this shrouded in secrecy, then sort of cryptic details came out. And now much more direct comments, both from the foreign ministry we got yesterday, and from the president on why they're doing this.
 
The foreign ministry is saying that the sooner Russia agrees to what they call a just peace, according to Ukraine's peace formula, that it's laid out, the sooner the raids on Russian territory will stop. So it seems there is some kind of endgame here. 
 
I think there's also a clear PR motive. This is coming in the context of waning Ukrainian morale when it comes to the war and President Zelenskyy very much trying to leverage this moment here. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): All of us in Ukraine need to act as unitedly and effectively as we did in the first weeks and months of this war, when Ukraine seized the initiative, and began turning the situation in favor of our state. We have done the same now, we have once again proven that in any situation, we Ukrainians are capable of achieving our objectives of defending our interests and our independence.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: So he's comparing it to the beginning of the war, where, of course, we saw Ukraine really defy expectations and take back territory. And I just want to bring you because another point that President Zelenskyy made in his speech on Tuesday was that his troops, he said, are, I quote, replenishing the exchange fund, essentially taking Russian prisoners of war. 
 
And we had this new video in this morning, which shows -- you can see it there -- a truck. This is a truck heading away from the Kursk region on the Ukrainian side of the border. 
 <br>[04:45:02]
 
It was filmed by AFP. And we've had to blur them out because it seems that they may be prisoners of war. But we believe Russian soldiers in the back of that truck, who have been blindfolded. Zelenskyy is saying that, you know, everyone is being treated according to international law.
 
But we have seen many, many exchanges of prisoners over the course of this war between Russia and Ukraine. The Russians on their side are reporting that they've taken some Ukrainians prisoners. So this is, this is another part of what's happening here.
 
MACFARLANE: All of this continues to be very humiliating for Vladimir Putin, especially videos like that. I mean, do we have any idea about how this is being viewed by the wider population in Russia, or indeed what they are being told?
 
SEBASTIAN: So we know what they're being told, for sure, because the propaganda has taken its cue very much from President Putin himself. And we saw him come out earlier this week prepared remarks to his which we believe, by the way, because state media have showed that his notes were handwritten, that he basically wrote those remarks himself. 
 
But that, you know, he's calling this a terror attack. He's blaming the West. He's trying to sort of make it clear that it's isolated to these few regions, all of the sort of human interest stories are now creeping through on Russian media, they're not so much talking about the military movements, and he's trying to claim that he's back in control. And so that's what the Russian people are being told.
 
And we see the chief propagandists who do these sort of influential nightly news shows pick this up and, you know, threaten revenge and make sort of thinly veiled threats towards the West. So that's what the Russian people are hearing. In terms of how they actually feel, you know, I think it varies. I've
 
 spoken to people who say that this was a huge surprise that they're not sure what to make of it at this point, that it is potentially a problem for Putin. But it's one that through this control of information, he is clearly trying to manage.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, 120,000 now fled the region in Kursk. And that's undeniable, isn't it? Clare, thank you.
 
Now, just into CNN, another political shake up in Thailand. In a shocking court decision, the country's Prime Minister, Srettha Thavisin, was removed from office. The court ruled he had violated the constitution by appointing a lawyer who had served jail time to the cabinet.
 
And the decision comes a week after the same court dissolved Thailand's popular Progressive Move Forward party. A new government must now be formed. 
 
U.S. President Joe Biden has announced more than $150 million in new research awards as part of a program amid helping reduce cancer deaths in the U.S.
 
The Cancer Moonshot program was founded while Mr. Biden was vice president and has been bolstered with billions in new funding since 2022. The initiative aims to provide cutting-edge research to halve the number of cancer deaths in the coming decades. 
 
Now, when we come back, the standout of the Coney Island skyline. CNN's Richard Quest rides the century-old Wonder Wheel alongside the man carrying on its legacy. 
 
Plus, from the breakfast table to the bedroom, a new cologne with an exotic ingredient is selling out on the internet. Stay tuned for that.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: New York City may be famous for its bustling streets and skyscrapers, but over in Brooklyn, there's something of an oasis. Coney Island is home to one of America's best known boardwalks and the famous Wonder Wheel, which is now more than a century old. CNN's Richard Quest stopped by for a ride.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DENO VOURDERIS, CO-OWNER, DENO'S WONDER WHEEL AMUSEMENT PARK: This is the jewel of Coney Island right here. 
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Right. 
 
VOURDERIS: That's the Wonder Wheel. It's 104 years old, but it's not a Ferris wheel. It's an eccentric Ferris wheel because it's part Ferris wheel, part roller coaster. It's part of the whole Coney Island, United States ingenuity. QUEST: What is the attraction to it?
 
VOURDERIS: I mean, it's full of history. It means -- what makes the Wonder Wheel so special is it means different things to different people. It could be a first date. It could be a proposal. It could be an anniversary. It's the most romantic ride in the world. And in 1920 was the most thrilling ride in the world.
 
QUEST: Are you looking to a good summer this year? What's your gut telling you, TJ?
 
VOURDERIS: My gut is telling me that people need, not want, people need a place to unwind. I mean, we're always looking down on our devices. We're not actually living anymore. So I think places like Coney Island are essential businesses.
 
QUEST: People meet here.
 
VOURDERIS: People meet here. My grandparents used to date right on the beach out here in 1948.
 
QUEST: And you, sir. You, sir. Come follow me around. Tell me what's your history -- come in. What's your history?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My parents met here on the beach. 
 
QUEST: Your parents met here on the beach.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They lived here in Brooklyn and they would take the train in. They came as two groups of friends and they met right here on this beach.
 
VOURDERIS: 1920, we have the Coney Island's oldest attraction. When COVID came by, everybody was cutting and running. We doubled down. We opened Coney Island's newest attraction. Because you either believe in what you're doing or you don't. OK, we believe in this place. We believe in its future. 
 
QUEST: Right. Should we go on this?
 
VOURDERIS: I mean, I'm ready. You ready? 
 
We haven't killed anybody all day. Let's go.
 
QUEST: All right, let's go.
 
VOURDERIS: You know about saltwater corrosion. Yes, so we're constantly repainting. We're constantly resurfacing. We're constantly x-raying all these pieces of metal to make sure there's no cracks. That's some new stuff that's been around now. But the Wonder Wheels definitely stood the test of time.
 
I'm not going to tell you when it's going to swing. We're just going to keep talking and we'll see what happens. You don't have to hold on. Hands up.
 
QUEST: No, no, no. 
 
VOURDERIS: You're not supposed to make that sound.
 
QUEST: Looks like we're swinging. Oh! 
 
VOURDERIS: There you go. But here it is. This is Coney Island, guys.
 
QUEST: What do you need? 
 
VOURDERIS: What do we need? 
 
QUEST: Yes, what do you need? As you look around at it? What is it that you actually now need in Coney Island?
 
VOURDERIS: I think we could use a little more investment. I think people are still a little afraid. I think we need more people to not be afraid.
 
When COVID hit, we knew the future of this place. And that's what always kept Coney Island coming back is there was always somebody who knew this place's potential. There was always somebody who believed in its future.
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
And honestly, I believe if we remember who we are, then our best days are ahead of us. There's so much potential. Coney Island's always had that reputation of being a little, you know, old New York, right? Let's say old New York. 
 
QUEST: Joey in your face.
 
VOURDERIS: Joey in your face. And you know what, some of it still is like that. And we don't want to lose everything that we are. But we want to kind of find that middle ground. And I think we're slowly getting there.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE: Well, I think it's quite charming, as is Richard Quest. 
 
Now, we know that former President Obama is reading, has released his reading list this summer, but now he's released his playlist. Take a listen to this.
 
(Shaboozy singing "A Bar Song (Tipsy)")
 
MACFARLANE: That is a bar song from Shaboozy. And it's one of the many tunes Obama is listening to this summer. And as usual, he's got a wide variety of genres from pop, country, soul, and this classic from the Rolling Stones.
 
(Rolling Stones, Satisfaction)
 
MACFARLANE: Still a classic. What a choice. And the other artists on his playlist include Charli XCX, Common, Etta James, and Bob Dylan. Now, a hot new scent for men is spreading across the gridiron this football season.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILL LEVIS, TENNESSEE TITANS QUARTERBACK: They try to define you, but you are the ingredient to your own success.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: That's Tennessee Titans quarterback Will Levis announcing his new cologne collaboration with Hellman's Mayonnaise. That's right. The fragrance is inspired by his love of the condiment.
 
It features notes of tart lemon and parsley with coffee, musk, and vanilla undertones, and, of course, mayonnaise. The cologne sold out within 90 minutes online. Not to worry, you can get a second helping starting today.
 
But obviously this, now let's see ketchup, let's see mayonnaise, let's see mustard. I want to see it all. I love it.
