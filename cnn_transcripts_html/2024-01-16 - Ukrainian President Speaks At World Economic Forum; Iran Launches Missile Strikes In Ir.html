BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
We are bringing you ongoing, in-depth coverage of the World Economic Forum here in Davos. It is important, a stark turn (ph) coming from Ukrainian 
 
 President Volodymyr Zelensky just moments ago here, sounding urgent and frankly agitated, Mr. Zelenskyy told the attendees here at the forum that 
 
 if anyone thinks the war in Ukraine is only about Ukraine, they are fundamental plea wrong. 
 
He also stressed that escalation worries in the west have lost Kyiv time in its struggle against Russia. Ukraine trying not to get lost in what is this 
 
 global shuffle of pressing problems, in Middle East crisis, AI fever, climate crisis. 
 
Top politicians, business leaders, billionaires, frankly, from across the world are here in Davos. And those attendees include China's president -- 
 
 sorry, China's premier, not the president, China's premier. He is all about his country's economy, which of course had a wobble in 2023. 
 
Now, he is saying it has, quote, rebounded and moved upwards more on that as we move through the hour. And I know you won't be surprised to learn the 
 
 geopolitics is front and center here as the U.S. condemns Iran for missiles strikes on northern Iraq. I'll bring you my interview with the Iraqi 
 
 foreign minister in the next hour. 
 
I'll also be talking to the head of G42. That is an AI company based in Abu Dhabi where I usually am. The tech giant has been furiously denying any 
 
 links with the Chinese government. 
 
Well, one thing President Zelensky is surely keeping an eye on while he is here in Davos is the race for the White House and the Iowa caucuses. The 
 
 first official contests leading up to Election Day in November is done. The outcome of that vote will shape the future of American support for 
 
 Ukraine's war with Russia. 
 <br>[09:25:08]
 
And the caucuses last night showing no question Donald Trump's base is standing behind him as he seeks a second term.
 
Well, senior global affairs analyst, and CNN anchor Bianna Golodryga is here with me in Davos. She was listening into Volodymyr Zelensky's speech. 
 
Bianna, what did he say today? And what was significant?
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, Becky, he spoke behind me about an hour ago in the room behind me, an urgency was really 
 
 front and center where you just saw some agitation in his words as well. I would sum it up with that one line where he said, I'm grateful, but. 
 
Clearly, this was a tight balancing act for him to once again, thank the West and its partners who have supplied Ukraine for now two years with 
 
 financial assets, with weaponry. And, of course, as you noted, given everything else what's going around, going on in the world given the U.S. 
 
 elections, given the crisis in the Middle East, he does not want Ukraine to be lost in the shuffle, which is why he once again reiterated that Putin's 
 
 war will not stop at Ukraine's borders, which he noted Ukraine had been violated, not just on a full scale level two years ago, but its been nearly 
 
 10 years since Russia illegally annexed Crimea and the Donbas in eastern Europe. 
 
And he went on to say that strengthening our economy will strengthen your security. Ukraine, highlighting that they're appreciative of the E.U. 
 
 accession talks that have the gun and obviously their ultimate goal once this war is over, is full membership in the E.U. and NATO. 
 
But he also acknowledged knowledge what many are stating right now, maybe where this war ends in that is at a freeze, at a stalemate. However, you 
 
 describe it, here's what he said: Freezing war to its end, nothing will happen with that. 
 
Any frozen conflict can reignite, especially with Vladimir Putin in Russia. He said the man will never change, making it clear that he knows him best 
 
 its better than anyone else. He also stated, one man has stolen at least 13 years of peace, replacing it with pain, pain, pain, and crisis. 
 
And, Becky, also, you can since the agitation that over $100 billion in aid, that's a combination from the E.U. and the U.S. has been stalled given 
 
 Hungary's standing in the way in Europe and the United States, a rather vocal minority of Republicans hopefully as President Biden and other 
 
 Democrats said something can be passed in the weeks to come, but every day that goes by, he sees more and more Ukrainian soldiers killed in the 
 
 fighting, and he's also stressing that despite this term stands stalemate being thrown around, there are victories being made each and every day. 
 
Just earlier this week, Ukraine shot down a Russian spy plane and he stated that the economy though taking a big hit, especially at 40 percent, but in 
 
 the first-year of wards expected to grow some four-and-a-half percent this year. 
 
So the big message is don't give up on Ukraine because if you go give up on Ukraine, the West is next -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Yeah, and let's just have a listen to what he said specifically with regard to Russia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  In fact, Putin embodies war. We all know that he's the sole reason why various wars and conflicts persist. 
 
 And why all attempts to restore peace have failed. And he will not change. He will not change. We must change.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  And, Bianna, I thought it was very telling that he came here to Davos where some of the world's biggest financiers are gathered. I see that 
 
 he shook hands with Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, who said, God bless you, Mr. Zelensky.
 
Look, he's clearly here looking to drum up support, not just from governments that he has concerns about at this point, not least the U.S., 
 
 in providing more aid also concerns about where that aid might come from and what it might look like from the West going forward. But also Bianna 
 
 from some of these key finance titans as Zelensky looks for further support.
 
What could Donald Trump victory, Bianna, which is looking certainly very more likely as far as him being the Republican contender is concerned after 
 
 Iowa and possibly as a matchup against Joe Biden polls suggesting that he could win, what would that mean for Zelensky and Ukraine?
 
GOLODRYGA:  Well, Becky, we don't have to hypothesize when it comes to what Donald Trump will do because he's projected almost all of his views when it 
 
 comes to this war, when it comes to how he views Vladimir Putin.
 <br>[09:30:03]
 
He likes to boast about their close relationship, saying that this war wouldn't have happened. And for a reason it didn't happen according to 
 
 former President Trump, when he was in office, but he has boasted about the fact that once he if he is re-elected, that this war would come to an end 
 
 on day one. 
 
And you don't have to be focused on this war and experts on this war to know that that would probably end in a bad result for Ukraine, not giving 
 
 them what they want right now. Instead, making Vladimir Putin very happy in terms of how long he's waited. He may not have gotten Kyiv, he may never 
 
 get Kyiv. But in terms of what he has control of, lets not forget it some 20 percent of the country right now, maybe some agreement, may be some 
 
 negotiations will have to come down the line.
 
But clearly, President Zelenskyy is not wanting that to happen anytime soon and not on Vladimir Putin's terms and not on Donald Trump's terms either. I 
 
 believe we have some sound from Donald Trump on how he views this conflict. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT:  Russia would have never attacked Ukraine, would have never done it. Putin and I get along fine. We get along very 
 
 well. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA:  So there he said it, it's a good thing, not a bad thing. I mean, Becky, you can insert any global hotspot and when it comes to 
 
 President Trump, that former President Trump's take, I mean, you could say the same thing about ending the war in Gaza in the Middle East. 
 
And so, a lot of concern among the Ukrainians about what a Trump presidency would mean. They are paying close attention to this election, of course, 
 
 and even Joe Biden's words. Remember, Becky, he was saying for a long time that the U.S. will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. That changed a 
 
 little bit in the last few weeks. And he said, as long as the U.S. can, and that didn't fall on deaf ears in Ukraine.
 
ANDERSON:  Yeah, absolutely. Bianna, it's terrific having you here. Your reporting and insight is absolutely invaluable. Thank you. 
 
Well, Israel accusing Hamas of psychological torture after multiple videos of these Israeli hostages were released over 24 hours by the militant 
 
 groups. CNN will not be sharing the videos, but footage in one released on Monday appears to show to male hostages killed. Israel believes hundred and 
 
 32 hostages are still alive and held in Gaza within the enclave, the U.N. head of relief says hundreds of thousands are now starving, facing a famine 
 
 that came on with, quote, incredible speed. Keep in mind, Israel has enforced a blockade of Gaza with full control of what can get in. 
 
Elsewhere in the region, condemnation against Iran. The U.S. criticizing what it calls reckless missiles strikes by the country in both northern 
 
 Iraq and northern Syria. Iran claims it destroyed what it called an Israeli spy base in Irbil in Iraq. 
 
A lot happening in the region, a lot to unpack. Let's break it all down. 
 
Paula Hancocks is with us out of Abu Dhabi.
 
And those strikes in Irbil. What do we know about them? We certainly heard, you know, sort of outright condemnation in region from many parties and 
 
 from the U.S., and I'm Western leaders. What's the latest? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Becky, what we know from the Iraqi side is that they say that four civilians were killed, six were 
 
 injured. And from the Iranian sites, they claim that the Revolutionary Guards launched a missile to strike and destroy what they called one of the 
 
 main espionage headquarters of Israel, claiming that that is where Mossad had one of its bases. 
 
Now from Iran side, they say that the reason they have done this is in retaliation for Israeli attacks which have killed some Iranian commanders 
 
 in recent times. Now, when it comes to what happened in Syria, we understand that they targeted an element which they said was an anti-Iran 
 
 terror group but specifying that this was to do with that deadly twin bombing just a couple of weeks ago in Kerman, which killed dozens of 
 
 people. 
 
Now, we understand that the ISIS claimed responsibility for that, but that is the reasoning Iran has given -- Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Good to have you. Thank you 
 
We're going to take a very short break. Back after this.

ANDERSON:  Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Davos for you today and you are watching a special edition of CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
Well, the first vote of the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign season it is in, and it is a big win for Donald Trump. CNN projects that the former 
 
 president won the Iowa Republican caucuses by the largest margin in that state's history, solidifying his standing as his party, the Republican 
 
 Party's front runner, 
 
Michael Sandel joins me here in Dallas. He is a professor of government at Harvard University and author of "The Tyranny of Merit". 
 
Can we find the common good couldn't have a better guest to be joining me as CNN projects, you know, a big, big win for Donald Trump in Iowa. 
 
And whatever Nikki Haley says at this point, are we looking at a rematch, Trump-Biden in 2024? 
 
MICHAEL SANDEL, PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY:  It looks like we are looking at a rematch and a rematch that most Americans don't want. 
 
 Some 70 percent don't want it but that's likely what we're going to have. 
 
ANDERSON:  What it what do we, what do we, what does it mean when we say most Americans don't want this? What do you think that means? They may not 
 
 want it. But if he wins, what are they going to get? 
 
SANDEL:  What they're going to get is make America great again, on the one hand, and democracy is imperiled from authoritarianism on the other. 
 
And people have more or less chosen upsides on that question. I think what people are looking for is something -- is a fresh vision and direction and 
 
 Joe Biden, since the economy's gotten better, why am I not getting credit? I think it's because he hasn't offered a compelling alternative vision. I 
 
 think that's what people are looking for. 
 
ANDERSON:  Well, whether or not you or I believe or our viewers believed that Trump's vision is fresh and new is by the by, perhaps, at this point. 
 
 I wonder in your conversations and its day two here at Davos what you are picking up from the rest of the world gathered here about the potential 
 
 for, one, a rematch. And two or Donald Trump victory. 
 
SANDEL:  What's striking to me is the running to many of the sessions is the question of trust, how to rebuild trust in institutions in the economy 
 
 and politics in democracy, and also trust in elites. 
 
And I think they're right about the problem to focus on the erosion of trust. I'm not sure they've got the solution right. And I'm not sure that 
 
 they've noticed or would agree that much of the mistrust that's created the polarization that is so ramping -- much of that mistrust may actual of 
 
 elite may have been earned by those elites over the last four decades, the way they've managed the economy, created the divide between winners and 
 
 losers and not taken seriously the dignity of work.
 <br>[09:40:07]
 
ANDERSON:  It would be wrong to suggest that every elite, as it were, to coin, your term about those gathered here, is a Biden supporter and would 
 
 not be in favor of a Donald Trump win, correct?
 
SANDEL:  I think that's right. I think there's a lot of uneasiness about the volatility in the unpredictability of Donald Trump. But also perhaps a 
 
 grudging and maybe slightly suppressed appreciation of what they expect will be his policies and the economy on taxes, on deregulation. 
 
But the real energy and we saw this in Iowa, the energy behind his support is loyal, devoted supporters. It has to do with a sense of grievance and 
 
 anger and resentment that has been building for some time going all the way back to the bailout, and they blame both parties, the mainstream parties, 
 
 for it. And the question is, is there a way forward addresses that grievance and resentment seriously in a way that's different from the one 
 
 this is a challenge for Joe Biden, different from the response that Donald Trump has to offer.
 
ANDERSON:  Good to have you, important day. Thank you for joining us. 
 
SANDEL:  Good to be with 
 
ANDERSON:  Right. We are going to take a short break, back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON:  Over and out. Roma has sacked manager Jose Mourinho and his staff after their latest loss over the weekend. So where does the special 
 
 one go next? And what happened? 
 
Patrick Snell is here with more -- Patrick.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Thank you. Yeah, it all unraveled rather quickly for Joseph Mourinho, didn't he? Just stand in the first seasons, he 
 
 wins the Europa Conference League, a great start to his career, two-and-a- half years there in the Italian capital, then its just all unravel that ninth. That's not good enough for a club of Roma's magnitude.
 
Where he might go next? Who is going to replace him in the short term there in the eternal city? We'll have all that in "WORLD SPORT" in just a few 
 
 moments, from now.
 
ANDERSON:  Good stuff. Patrick Snell on "WORLD SPORT" for you. That is up after this short break. We are back top of the hour for you. Stay with us.
