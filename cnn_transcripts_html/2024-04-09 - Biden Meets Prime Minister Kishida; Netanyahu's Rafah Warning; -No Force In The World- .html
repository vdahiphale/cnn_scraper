JAKE TAPPER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  You can listen to the show all two hours once you get your podcasts. All two are just sitting there like a 
 
 big, giant, delicious sushi. Our coverage continues now on CNN. I'll see you tomorrow.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  It's 7:00 a.m. in Seoul, 10:00 a.m. in Sidney, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And 
 
 wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome once again to "First Move." And here's today's need to know.
 
United by the China challenge, U.S. President Joe Biden welcomes the Japanese prime minister to the White House.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says no force in the world will stop Israeli troops from entering Rafah.
 
Arizona's Supreme Court revives a near-total abortion ban enacted in 1864.
 
And a climate change conquest? A group of Swiss women win a landmark case at the European Court of Human Rights, the consequences for governments 
 
 could be huge. All that and more coming up.
 
But we do begin the hour in Washington, D.C. as the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the United States formally gets 
 
 underway. Kishida and his wife are set to arrive at the White House to greet President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden any moment now.
 
The summit between the U.S. and Japan coming at a critical time in the relations between the two nations as they confront a more assertive China 
 
 in the Indo-Pacific region. Biden and Kishida are set to strengthen their already close security relationship.
 
They will also hold a first-ever trilateral summit with the president of Philippines, Fernando Marcos Jr. Together, the three nations have a 
 
 complex, turbulent history, yet the threat that China poses, particularly in the South China Sea, Taiwan, North Korea, even relations with Russia are 
 
 all common causes to unite them.
 
Biden and Kishida will also discuss the close economic relationship between their two nations, including whether the U.S. administration can see a way 
 
 to greenlight Nippon Steel's $14 billion offer to buy U.S. Steel. So far, President Biden has voiced opposition. And later in the show, we will hear 
 
 from the CEO of Japanese consumer products giant, Suntory Holdings, will be at the state dinner for Prime Minister Kishida held at the White House on 
 
 Wednesday.
 
His thoughts on the U.S.-China relationship doing business in China as a major Japanese and international business leader defending the Japanese 
 
 homeland, the impact cause of the rise in defense spending and much more.
 
And the moment that we see Prime Minister Kishida and his wife arrive at the White House for that meeting greet, we were looking at live pictures 
 
 there, we will bring them to you. There you go. There's the picture there as we await their imminent arrival.
 
We should see President Biden and his wife, of course, Dr. Jill Biden, the Japanese prime minister, and his wife as well arriving. When we see that, 
 
 we will take you there live. But for now, we'll move on.
 
The State Department says Israel has not briefed the United States on the date set for the invasion of Rafah. That's Gaza's southernmost city, where 
 
 around 1.5 million Palestinians are now sheltering.
 
Meanwhile, the Israeli prime minister insisting today that "no force in the world" will stop his troops from entering Rafah and that the IDF must 
 
 finish the job against Hamas. Jeremy Diamond has more. And a warning, his report does contain graphic images, including pictures of those recovered 
 
 from Al-Shifa Hospital.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Millions pick through the rubble in wake of a major Israeli withdrawal. Israeli Prime Minister 
 
 Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing this reprieve and the fighting will not last.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We will complete the elimination of Hamas' battalions, including in Rafah. No force 
 
 in the world will stop us.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Netanyahu's bellicose rhetoric coming after he faced recriminations from his right flank, with Israel's National Security 
 
 Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatening to pull out of the government if the war ends without an invasion of Rafah.
 
Overnight, Israel's military focus on threats from outside Gaza, fending off the latest attack from Houthi militants in Yemen. For the first time, 
 
 Israel is Sea Dome air defense system, a ship-mounted version of the Iron Dome, shooting down a Houthi drone over the Red Sea.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
Tonight, Israel's security cabinet convening to discuss start and stop negotiations over a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal. For now, 
 
 a deal seems out of reach. In a statement, Hamas says Israels latest position has not responded to any of the demands of our people and our 
 
 resistance.
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The ball is in Hamas' court. The world is watching to see what it does.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Hamas, continuing to insist on the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, an unfettered access for Palestinians seeking 
 
 to return to Northern Gaza. The ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for 40 Israeli hostages also still being negotiated.
 
Amid the ruins of Gaza's largest hospital, Palestinian crews and U.N. agencies sift through mounds of dirt and shallow mass graves, exhuming the 
 
 bodies of dozens who were killed during the Israeli military's two-week assault on the hospital, where Israel says it was battling Hamas militants.
 
Gaza's civil defense says 381 bodies have been recovered so far, in an effort to give some peace to the dead and their loved ones. Three weeks 
 
 after Ghassan Riyad Qunaitta says his 83-year-old father was detained by the Israeli army, he has found what remains of his body.
 
We have been looking for almost a week since they withdrew from the area, until this moment, he says. Five minutes ago, my nephew called me and told 
 
 me they found the body over there.
 
That sense of closure is cold comfort for Ghassan and his family. But others, like Dr. Nuah Swailem, are looking for just that.
 
I came to look for my husband, she says, explaining that he is a doctor who was detained by the Israeli military. Now, she does not know if he's alive 
 
 or dead.
 
Where are they? She cries. We don't know whether they are arrested or detained, underground or above ground. Where they? Tell us where they are. 
 
 Tell me where my husband is.
 
Search for answers that is far from over.
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem.

CHATTERLEY:  And now, as I mentioned moments ago, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his wife Yuko arriving at the White House for a visit 
 
 before the leaders of the two nations formally begin their summit and discussions on Wednesday.
 
And there you can see them there. Dr. Jill Biden, of course, President Biden and prime minister of Japan, Fumiko Shida, and his wife, Yuko, the 
 
 first time that we have seen a leader from Japan represented here at the White House in almost 10 years. So, a pivotal moment. A historic moment, I 
 
 think, for these two nations, particularly with the discussions to come.
 
MJ Lee is at The Whitehouse for us. MJ, two Nations united, I think, in their desire to keep the Indo-Pacific region as they would describe it free 
 
 and open and recognizing, I think, that if there is a more material conflict, whether it's Japan, China, South China Sea, Taiwan, North Korea, 
 
 they'll both certainly be involved. What does the United States hope to achieve with the discussions this week?
 
MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  You know, if I could first help set the scene here a little bit. Obviously, we just saw the Japanese 
 
 prime minister arriving here at the White House. And what we will see over the next day and a half or so is really a lot of pomp and circumstance in 
 
 addition to the serious diplomatic work that is going to unfold as well.
 
Just to give you a sense, tomorrow we will see President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida have a bilateral meeting followed by a news conference. 
 
 And then, in the evening, the day is capped off with a lavish state dinner.
 
And you know, you talk about pomp and circumstance, and there are few occasions here at the White House where you see that on more vivid display 
 
 than a state's dinner. The first lady's office and a number of the White House chefs just brief reporters about the decadent menu that we will see 
 
 tomorrow, the lavish decorations, all as a tribute to the U.S.-Japanese relationship.
 
And then, as for the diplomatic bilateral work that we will see in the next day or so, we do expect an announcement, a major update on the two 
 
 countries' military alliance. We also expect to see an update on two country's defense industrial cooperation and other areas of cooperation we 
 
 are told by U.S. officials, including artificial intelligence, on cybersecurity, semiconductor production, and even space collaboration.
 
And also, it goes without saying, of course, that there are going to be some areas of friction between the two countries that the leaders will 
 
 likely discuss, including Japan's desire to purchase U.S. steel.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
Now, I should also note, after the bilateral visit, a missed visit from the Japanese prime minister later this week, we will see President Biden 
 
 hosting the first-ever summit between the U.S., Japan, and the Philippines. This, of course, gets at the broader strategy that we've seen from the 
 
 Biden administration that is aimed at containing China's strength and aggression in the region. That, of course, has been sort of a hallmark of 
 
 the Biden presidency's strategy when it comes to the Indo-Pacific.
 
CHATTERLEY:  MJ Lee, it's going to be an interesting few days to see what comes of this, whether it's in deal making or discussions or beyond, and 
 
 that trilateral summit, as you mentioned, with the president of the Philippines is going to be fascinating to watch. Great to have you with us. 
 
 Thank you. MJ Lee there at the White House.
 
Now, Arizona could become the 15th U.S. state to ban abortion with very limited exceptions. That's after the state's Supreme Court revived a law 
 
 dating back to 1864 banning the procedure, except in the case of saving the mother's life.
 
The ruling could have far-reaching consequences for women's health and for election year politics in a battleground state. And beyond, Elie Honig 
 
 joins me now. Elie, I think we have to start with the basics here. How did we get to a point where you've got a state upholding a law that dates back 
 
 to 1864 before actually women had the right to vote in the state and actually before Arizona was considered a state in the first place? How did 
 
 we get here?
 
ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Julia, that's a great question. So, this story really starts two years ago when the U.S. Supreme Court 
 
 overturned Roe v. Wade. That was the Supreme Court ruling that had been in place for 50 years and protected a woman's right to an abortion across the 
 
 United States.
 
Now, two years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that in a case called Dobbs. And that essentially said, we're going to leave it up to each state 
 
 individually to decide what its laws will be on abortion. And as a result, we've seen wide divergence. There's some states where women have full 
 
 rights to abortions, and other states, including now Arizona, where it's been completely outlawed.
 
And you're right, this is a bizarre scenario where this 160-plus year statute has suddenly been revived. And according to the Arizona Supreme 
 
 Court, now that will be the law of the state for the time being.
 
CHATTERLEY:  It's unclear how and whether and when this law will be enforced. I saw some comments from the attorney general -- Democratic 
 
 attorney general, I should say, Chris Mayes, who said she would not prosecute anyone under the law, but local prosecutors could still do so.
 
I mean, there's no ability to appeal this. But if your prosecutors perhaps are saying, hang on a second, Elie, how do we move on from this moment?
 
HONIG:  So, that's a really good point. First of all, the state attorney general in Arizona has said that they will not enforce this particular law. 
 
 And I will say that is within a prosecutor's purview. We have something in the United States called prosecutorial discretion. It happens not 
 
 uncommonly that prosecutors say, I will not enforce the laws against, for example, marijuana in recent years, certain prosecutors have said. But as 
 
 you said, the other issue though is you have county level district attorneys who may not agree with that and they're on their own.
 
Now, there are a couple things legally that might happen to change this. First of all, the law is on hold for at least a couple weeks. Second of 
 
 all, the Arizona state legislature can repeal, can undo this law. And there actually is some bipartisan support. There are some Republicans in Arizona 
 
 who have expressed support for repealing it.
 
And then the final option is Arizona can amend its own state constitution. Now, that's a complicated process. You would, again, need some sort of 
 
 bipartisan support. They could theoretically appeal this to the U.S. Supreme Court. But as we said in the beginning, the U.S. Supreme Court has 
 
 said it's up to you, states. So, the Supreme Court is not going to be an answer here.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I'm going to ask you to expand upon your remit beyond the legal sphere into the political sphere, because I'm sure for our 
 
 international audience, they'll be wondering to your point about the politics here and it does matter. To what extent, whether it's Arizona or 
 
 beyond, this plays into the 2024 elections in this country? If you want to see something different, does it come down to how you vote?
 
HONIG:  So, abortion has consistently been polling as one of the top two or three issues that voters care about in the United States. And when the 
 
 Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade two years ago, there was a lot of uncertainty. How is this going to play politically?
 
And we've actually been surprised. We've seen certain states that lean conservative that have actually passed measures upholding abortion rights, 
 
 including Ohio and Kansas and other states.
 
So, I think politicians on both sides of the aisle have been surprised at the strength of the reaction against Dobbs, which overturned Roe v. Wade. I 
 
 think Republicans, and you can even see this in the statement that Donald Trump released just yesterday, are recognizing that taking extreme stances 
 
 on abortion like we see in Arizona has been hurting them politically. And on the flip side, I think we see Democrats trying to capitalize on that.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
And, Julia, if this stays on the ballot, that could spur voter turnout in Arizona in 2024, which will be one of the very few swing states which will 
 
 likely decide the presidential election.
 
CHATTERLEY:  We're also waiting for the Supreme Court, Elie, very quickly to give their verdict on whether or not to restrict access to a pill for 
 
 abortion as well. And that's something else now that we're watching.
 
How might that also play into this, particularly for a state like Arizona that we said is effectively going back to the dark ages here to potentially 
 
 restrict abortions and particularly in cases even where there's rape or incest in this case? How might that abortion pill access play into this?
 
HONIG:  So, the Supreme Court is in the process of deciding a case about the availability of mifepristone, which is an abortion medication that's 
 
 commonly used in the United States. Based on the oral argument that happened a couple of weeks ago, it looks like the Supreme Court is probably 
 
 going to keep availability to mifepristone in place, but they're considering whether to scale it back considerably, which put on top of all 
 
 the decisions that have come out of the Supreme Court recently, I think, would further elevate this as a political hot button.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Underscoring the previous answer.
 
HONIG:  Right.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Elie Honig, thank you so much for your wisdom.
 
HONIG:  Thanks, Julia. All right.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Great. All right. Now, to an unprecedented legal case here in the United States, a judge has sentenced the parents of a school shooter to 
 
 10 to 15 years in prison.
 
James and Jennifer Crumbley were both found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in separate trials over the death of four Oxford high school 
 
 students who were gunned down by their son, Ethan, back in 2021.
 
Jurors found the couple ignored their son's mental health issues and bought him the gun he used in the attack. Jean Casarez has more on the case that's 
 
 gripped America.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is the sense of this court, Ms. Crumbley, that you served 10 to 15 years. As the defendant James Crumbley, it is the sense of 
 
 this court. that you served 10 to 15 years.
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Historic sentences handed down for the parents of a teen who killed four students at a Michigan high 
 
 school in 2021.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is a goal of sentencing to act as a deterrent. These convictions are not about poor parenting. These convictions confirm 
 
 repeated acts or lack of acts that could have halted an oncoming runaway train.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over):  James and Jennifer Crumbley were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in separate trials earlier this year. The first-
 
 time parents of a mass school shooter have been held directly accountable for an attack.
 
On November 30, 2021, their son killed Madisyn Baldwin, Tate Myre, Justin Shilling, and Hana St. Juliana at Oxford High School using a gun gifted to 
 
 him by Jennifer and her husband.
 
CRAIG SHILLING, FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM:  The blood of our children is on your hands too.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over):  Family of the victims gave statements ahead of the sentencing.
 
NICOLE BEAUSOLEIL, MOTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM:  When you worried about what people thought of you and feeling threatened, I was learning your son 
 
 threaten my daughter and fatally shot her in the head.
 
While you were hiding, I was planning her funeral. And while you were running away from your son and your responsibilities, I was forced to do 
 
 the worst possible thing a parent could do. I was forced to say goodbye to my Madisyn.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over):  The older sister of 14-year-old victim, Hana St. Juliana says no punishment will ever be enough.
 
REINA ST. JULIANA, SISTER OF SCHOOL VICTIM:  I now have to live without Hana. My little sister, my best friend, my other half. To me, that makes a 
 
 maximum sentence being 15 years too short. Hana didn't I even have 15 years to live.
 
STEVE. ST. JULIANA, FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM:  Hana's murder has destroyed a large portion of my very soul.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over):  Both Crumbley spoke up on their own behalf. James Crumbley for the first time since his trial began.
 
JENNIFER CRUMBLEY, MOTHER OF SCHOOL SHOOTER:  To the victims and the families, I stand today not to ask for your forgiveness as I know it may be 
 
 beyond reach, but to express my sincerest apologies for the pain that has been caused. I will be in my own eternal prison for the rest of my life.
 
JAMES CRUMBLEY, FATHER OF SCHOOL SHOOTER:  I really want the families to know how truly how truly sorry I am. And I'll continue to feel this pain 
 
 for the rest of my life as well. If I could go back and change things, if I could go back and do things differently, then maybe none of us would be 
 
 here today.

CHATTERLEY:  OK. Coming up on "First Move," a landmark climate change ruling in Europe with potential global implications. Can a nation violate a 
 
 citizen's human rights by doing too little to tackle climate change? That's next.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And for all our viewers in the U.S., U.K., and Latin America, we hope you're having a terrific Tuesday. 
 
 For everyone beginning their day with us in Asia, happy Wednesday.
 
Although, it's a turbulent Tuesday on Wall Street topping our "Money Move" today. Volatile action for much of the session with the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 
 
 closing higher, however, continued nervousness before Wednesday's crucial report on U.S. consumer inflation happening here. A hot inflation print 
 
 would raise fresh doubt over whether the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates anytime soon.
 
In the meantime, a mixed session in Asia, Japanese stocks outperforming for a second straight session with consumer confidence there, rising to its 
 
 highest level in five years.
 
And an international court handing down a landmark decision Tuesday potentially opening the floodgates for future lawsuits. The European Court 
 
 of Human Rights ruled that Switzerland violated human rights by not doing more to address the impact of the climate crisis.
 
The ruling could force Switzerland to further reduce its use of fossil fuels and possibly push other European nations to do the same. It's the 
 
 first time the court has ruled on a climate lawsuit. And more importantly, the judgment is legally binding. The case was brought by more than 2,000 
 
 Swiss women who argued that climate change hurt their health and their quality of life. Clare Sebastian has more on what this might mean for 
 
 climate activism in the future.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the fact that three cases claiming government alleged inaction on climate changes violates people's 
 
 human rights made it to the European Court of Human Rights in the first place was already groundbreaking.
 
But the fact that one of the cases was partially successful is another major milestone for climate activists. It explicitly links national climate 
 
 change policies with a state's duty to protect the human rights of its citizens and it bolsters, of course, the body of proof that litigation can 
 
 be an effective tool alongside global treaties to force governments to do more to stop global warming.
 
Experts and activists say this will open the floodgates to more cases in Europe and globally where there is a growing trend of human rights cases 
 
 being brought over climate change, that a view shared by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GRETA THUNBERG, SWEDISH ACTIVIST:  This is only the beginning of climate litigation all over the world, and more and more people are taking their 
 
 government to court, holding them responsible for their actions.
 
And this -- the result of this can mean in no way that we lean back. This means that we have to fight even more, since this is only the beginning.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN:  Well, the two other cases, including one attempting to force 32 countries to do more to prevent global warming were dismissed for technical 
 
 reasons.
 
But the court's ruling in the Swiss case is binding, with no option to appeal. Switzerland will now be compelled to act, including possibly 
 
 reducing its greenhouse gas consumption. The Swiss government says it's analyzing the judgement and the "measures" Switzerland has to take for the 
 
 future.
 
Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  It'll be fascinating to see how the government responds now.
 
OK. Stay with CNN. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And a look at more of the international headlines this hour.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country will lose its war with Russia if the U.S. doesn't approve more military aid. And he warned 
 
 that if that happens, other nations will also be attacked. So far, the U.S. Republican House Speaker is refusing to hold a vote on passing a spending 
 
 package for Ukraine.
 
A charge has denied yet another bid from former President Donald Trump to delay the start of his hush money trial next Monday. Trump has asked for a 
 
 ruling on his gag order in the case. That challenge will still continue. It just won't be required to happen before the trial. Trump has repeatedly 
 
 tried to postpone the start of the New York trial, so far unsuccessfully.
 
Ireland swore in its youngest ever prime minister on Tuesday. Simon Harris follows Leo Varadkar, who resigned suddenly last month.
 
Harris used his first speech after being elected to condemn Israel's conduct in Gaza. He faces some daunting political challenges, including 
 
 unfavorable polls and a general election.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
And turning now to Gaza, Israel's war against Hamas is sparking fresh tensions in its relationship with Turkey.
 
Turkey announced on Tuesday that it will restrict key exports to Israel until there's a cease-firing Gaza and sufficient humanitarian aid 
 
 deliveries to Gaza residents. Scott McLean has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Since the war in Gaza began, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the loudest voices 
 
 against Israel, calling it a terrorist state, accusing it of genocide, and even making this comparison.
 
Is there anything Netanyahu does that is less than Hitler? No, he said in December. But despite the bark, there's been no bite, until now.
 
There can be no excuse to Israel preventing our attempt to send aid from the air to our Gazan brothers, who are fighting hunger, said Hakan Fidan. 
 
 In response to this situation, we have decided to take a series of new measures against Israel.
 
After Turkey accused Israel of rejecting a Turkish request to airdrop aid to Gaza, Turkey's foreign minister promised consequences. Ankara has now 
 
 banned the export of some metals, cement, industrial machinery, more than 50 products to Israel until it agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza and allows for 
 
 the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid.
 
The Israeli foreign minister promised to retaliate with its own export bans aimed at Turkey's inflation-battered economy, and said, Erdogan is once 
 
 again sacrificing the economic interests of the people of Turkey for his support of the Hamas murderers in Gaza.
 
MCLEAN:  While Turkish-Israeli political relations have been hot and cold through the years, lately economic ties have only been warming with annual 
 
 trade volume now into the billions. And while there were some smaller organized boycotts of Israel in Turkey at the outset of the war, Erdogan's 
 
 government has long resisted calls to cut trade with Israel.
 
AKIF CAGATAY KILIC, TURKISH PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER:  Well, there's no talk about sanctions at this point.
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  This was Erdogan's chief adviser in December.
 
KILIC:  But of course, the relationship is strained.
 
MCLEAN:  President Erdogan has called Israel a terrorist state, and I wonder why Turkey thinks it's OK to do business with a terrorist state?
 
KILIC:  Well, I mean, you're saying business but the fact is that there are certain companies that are based in Turkey, certain companies that are 
 
 based in Israel. This is not a state-to-state issue.
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  This week, police detained dozens of protesters on Istanbul's famous Istiklal Street who are calling for Turkey to cut off 
 
 trade with Israel.
 
And in local elections, less than two weeks ago, Erdogan was dealt a stinging defeat. Smaller parties promising to take stronger action against 
 
 Israel siphoned off votes from his ruling AKP Party.
 
MCLEAN:  You think that President Erdogan has heard the message from voters loud and clear?
 
SEDA DEMIRALP, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, ISIK UNIVERSITY:  Oh, yes. This is a very clear message. Wherever you look, you see pro-government 
 
 groups talking about how government failed to respond to domestic pressure, domestic demands about the Gaza war and about the economy, and how the 
 
 government failed to notice that complaints were this big before.
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  Scott McLean, CNN, Istanbul.

CHATTERLEY:  And residents in the Russian town of Orsk get angry about what they see as a lack of action to devastating floods. A state of emergency 
 
 has been declared after the worst flooding ever recorded in the region.
 
More than 10,000 residential buildings have been evacuated, and President Vladimir Putin so far has no plans to visit the area. Isa Soares has more 
 
 on the disaster.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Catastrophic flooding and thousands of lives appended across several regions in Russia, forcing many 
 
 to evacuate with just their pets and a handful of belongings.
 
At least three people are reported to have died so far. Authorities declared a state of emergency in the Orenburg region near Kazakhstan. After 
 
 the Ural, Europe's third longest river, swelled several meters and burst through a dam embankment in Orsk, a city of more than 200,000 residents.
 
The anger there was palpable on Monday, with protesters chanting, shame on you, at the local officials and Putin help over the government's response.
 
No one is helping is here, a man in this crowd shouts, the state is doing nothing, he says.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
The city mayor said the flood has now peaked, according to Russian state news agency TASS. And the Kremlin spokesperson described the deluge in 
 
 these regions as inevitable due to an abnormal increase in water levels.
 
Dmitry Peskov also said that President Vladimir Putin is currently not planning on visiting the affected areas.
 
Across the border, in Kazakhstan, the country's president said the floods were his country's worst natural disaster in decades.
 
In Russia, the country's emergency situations minister flew over some of the flooded zones on Tuesday to inspect the damage. And over in the Kurgan 
 
 region, melting ice and torrential rains caused another river to overflow.
 
This is not a joke, the regional governor says bluntly. Leave, take your papers, valuables, children, elderly relatives with limited mobility. You 
 
 need to do this now, he says.
 
Flood waters in Kurgan are expected to rise even higher over the next 48 hours, putting thousands more lives at risk and wreaking even more havoc.

CHATTERLEY:  OK. Coming up on "First Move," the Japanese prime minister at the White House, what it means for the Japanese business community, what's 
 
 their message? My conversation with the CEO of Suntory, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visiting President Biden in Washington ahead of Wednesday's 
 
 official meeting at the White House and the state banquet later that evening.
 
Earlier Tuesday, the prime minister visited Arlington National Cemetery and attended a roundtable hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
 
The summit between the United States and Japan coming at a critical time in relations between the two nations as they confront a more assertive China 
 
 in the Indo-Pacific region and have concerns over nations like North Korea, of course and the challenges surrounding Taiwan and their relationship with 
 
 China.
 
Now, earlier today, I sat down with the CEO of Santori Takeshi Niinami. And I asked him what the message was from Japanese and Japan's business 
 
 community.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAKESHI NIINAMI, CEO, SUNTORY:  We will tighten the relation between Japan, the U.S. in both areas, business and the government, working together, 
 
 especially toward the deterrence against any kind of what if. So, just like North Korea, China.
 
So, we work together between U.S. and Japan so that we keep the order in Asia. That makes us feel doing more business in Asia, perhaps including 
 
 China, but I don't know yet about what to do with China.
 
CHATTERLEY:  What would it take, speaking of China, for you to say, OK, now I'm comfortable enough to invest, to hire people in China? Because I think 
 
 at this moment, and it's not you, it's other nations around the world, it's a huge opportunity, but the risk reward at this moment is not there. What 
 
 would it take?
 
NIINAMI:  Two factors. One is anti-espionage act, because including Americans, including lots of countries in democracy, including, of course, 
 
 Japanese people are arrested. We don't know why they are arrested. So, we feel so fear to visit, you know, Beijing, Shanghai, those cities.
 
Though we know the relation between Japan and China is -- you know, we can't cut it off because we are so much intertwined.
 
Knowing that whether we invest or not, second factor is IP protection.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Right.
 
NIINAMI:  We are not sure about that. So, China will be able to join the CPTPP. In terms of a high standard, I think we can, you know, invest freely 
 
 to China, but I don't know when that will happen.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Defense spending, I think, is something for Japan that's going to be very much a focus, whether it's the -- again, the business relations 
 
 and how that works, but it also means a fundamental, mental shift for the Japanese people as well.
 
What do you think what we're seeing now in Japan means in terms of psychology, whether it's perhaps a bad thing in certain respects, but also 
 
 a good thing in terms of a greater sense perhaps of immediacy and risk and necessity to adjust?
 
NIINAMI:  I think the Japanese public nowadays admit that we have to increase our self-advancing capabilities working with the U.S. But the more 
 
 we have to think that we have to protect our own country on our own instead of asking for allied countries led by U.S.
 
So, I think most general public of Japan approved already that we should increase expenditures to military. But we don't talk so detail. And the -- 
 
 you know, ground picture is fine. But what to do with your detail, such as what kind of armaments, weapons, what kind of, you know, protection for the 
 
 country. What is the best for us is -- will be in discussion.
 
So, we decided to increase. But how to make use of that is undecided. Well, we know the plan, but we have to -- we means that the general public have 
 
 to discuss openly more.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, just saying it doesn't necessarily mean doing it.
 
NIINAMI:  Exactly. You're right. And what is the most effective way? And what to do with the defense industry of Japan? It's almost nothing. So, 
 
 should we rely on the U.S. or allied countries totally? Not really. But we have to maybe join the AUKUS, working with the Australia, U.K., and the 
 
 United States. Maybe JAUKUS, I don't know. But we have to be working together to seek efficiency eventually. And it's from tax, tax revenue.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, paying for it, to your point, is another aspect of this. Fast forward five years. Is Japan in a stronger politically and economic 
 
 position than it is today in your mind?
 
NIINAMI:  I think it will be more stronger. I mean, much stronger from now. Though a political arena is in bigger challenge from society because of 
 
 scandals and so forth. That happens in many democracies.
 
But I think our economy and government policymaking both are in good direction for Japan. I think because we are getting out of deflation, which 
 
 lasted as long as 30 years. So, the landscape of Japan has been changing.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
But we business leaders have to decide how we can pick up the wages and make it sustainable, working with the government, for example. Government 
 
 takes care of people like retraining, like, you know, digital, like the management capability. So, we have to work together to have the good 
 
 trajectory for Japan. I think that will happen.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I think you're a pragmatist. I also think you're an optimist.
 
NIINAMI:  Optimist.
 
CHATTERLEY:  What gives you hope, other than watching "First Move," of course, on CNN?
 
NIINAMI:  Yes, of course, your program. And plus, I think younger generation is taking lots of risks, like startups, which is peculiar and 
 
 very unique in our culture. And risk money is now available. Even Bank of Japan started to raise interest rates. But I think startups and the younger 
 
 generation, those are keys.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Because they're not afraid of failing
 
NIINAMI:  Yes. Well, those who haven't experienced a bubble burst, they don't have the risk-aversive position, which my generation has. But they 
 
 are more or less unleashed from the trauma, which we got through the double times.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Let's hope they never experience it.
 
NIINAMI:  Thank you so much.
 
CHATTERLEY:  You're the best. Thank you, sir.

CHATTERLEY:  And we'll hear more from him later on in the week about the business of whiskey in particular. It's great.
 
All right, next, UConn Gold, Connecticut College basketball stars take the NCAA title after a thrilling final game. More coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And to a slam dunk performance in men's basketball After a season that has thrilled fans across the United 
 
 States and beyond the UConn Huskies have claimed the biggest prize in the college division winning back-to-back championships in the NCAA. They beat 
 
 the Purdue Boilermakers 75-60 to claim the title.
 
Many eyes were on the player of the year Zach Edey who led all scorers with 37 points despite his team's loss. UConn was the first Division 1 men's 
 
 team to win back-to-back championships since the Florida Gators in 2006 to 2007.
 
Coy Wire has more on an electrifying end to the college season.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Purdue's 7'4" two-time national player of the year Zach Edey had 37 points 10 rebounds but UConn was just too much. They 
 
 are a collection of selfless players like 7'4" Donovan Clingan, Tristen Newton, Stephon Castle and Samson Johnson.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  UConn can bring this lead to double -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Samson Johnson.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Cuts. Comes to the ball. Another one. Special delivery to Johnson.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Johnson raining down with two thunderous dunks, putting an exclamation point on what would become a dominant win in front of more than 
 
 74,000 fans in State Farm Stadium, UConn steamrolls Purdue 75 to 60 to become the first repeat champs since 2007.
 
Coach Dan Hurley's 12 straight tournament wins all by double digits is a tournament record. I caught up with coach as he stepped off the court as a 
 
 champion again.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Coach, what's that mean cutting down those debts this time?
 
DAN HURLEY, CONNECTICUT HEAD COACH:  Oh, man, unbelievable. Feels like last year.
 
WIRE:  Any different?
 
HURLEY:  I mean, just incredible, incredible performance. To beat a team like Purdue the way we did, just incredible.
 
WIRE:  And you've dominated every team along the way. How? Why?
 
HURLEY:  Yes. We're the best program in the country right now. We've got all the right players.
 
WIRE:  Hold on. What do you have to say to all the fans watching back home?
 
HURLEY:  Oh, I know they can't wait for us to get back. We'll see them at the airport. We'll see them in Gampel. And I cannot wait for the parade, 
 
 the parade, man.
 
WIRE:  How are you going to celebrate tonight, Coach?
 
HURLEY:  We're going to have some cocktails, I think. Let's go, baby.
 
WIRE:  Coach, what do you have to say to all your seniors who poured their hearts out for you?
 
HURLEY:  I mean, incredible, the legacy. They're leaving in a place that's hard to leave a legacy. Just a place that's impossible to be historical 
 
 players and to have legacies that are as good as anyone that's ever put the uniform on. It's hard to do at UConn. So, I so couldn't be prouder and, you 
 
 know, we're going to miss them a lot.
 
WIRE:  Congrats, champ. Time's two.
 
HURLEY:  Let's go, man.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Fans back on campus in Storrs, Connecticut, elated as they celebrated the school's sixth national title since 1999. It's been a 
 
 quarter century of dominance.
 
The last two tournaments UConn has beaten their opponents by an average of 20 points. And against non-conference opponents, they have a record of 33 
 
 and one with all of those wins by double digits as well.
 
When I asked Coach Hurley this week to describe the mental makeup of his team, he said relentless. There's only been one program that's ever been 
 
 able to pull off a three-peat UCLA about a half a century ago, now UConn will get their chance.

CHATTERLEY:  Now, a rare total solar eclipse swept across North America on Monday plunging parts of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada into darkness in the 
 
 middle of the day. Millions of people were treated to a spectacular view as the moon blocked the sun. But it wasn't just humans who were affected by 
 
 the heavens. Animals could also be seen to be behaving in rather unusual ways too. Ed Lavandera has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was like momentarily walking into the classic comedy "Night at the Museum," a 
 
 glimpse into the secret lives of animals at the Dallas Zoo when humans aren't around to watch.
 
LAVANDERA:  Zebra started chasing him and then the ostriches got into the mix as well.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over):  Just as the zoo slipped into total darkness, a jolt of, well, animal energy seemed to shoot through the grounds. The 
 
 moment mesmerized Lisa Van Slett, a curator of mammals at the Dallas Zoo.
 
LAVANDERA:  So, did the total eclipse today meet your expectations?
 
LISA VAN SLETT, ASSOCIATE CURATOR, DALLAS ZOO:  It exceeded my expectations today. There was a lot more activity than I expected to see out of the 
 
 animals.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over):  Just before total darkness, an ostrich laid an egg and hovered over it for a time, protecting it. Zoo officials say it's not 
 
 clear if the moment was caused by the eclipse, but that the timing was certainly curious, they said.
 
Guinea fowl suddenly crowed wildly.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I can hear the -- I hear the birds are starting, yes.
 
LAVANDERA:  The birds are getting louder.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over):  Just before the moon covered the sun for almost four minutes, a young giraffe and its mother galloped around the enclosure. 
 
 The zebras joined in the chase as well.
 
Here and around the country, elephants grouped together and appeared to head back to the area where they sleep. Flamingos packed together in the 
 
 middle of a pond in their habitat. Primates apparently also thought it was bedtime.
 
Animal experts say the sudden darkness triggered a natural reaction among many of the animals.
 
VAN SLETT:  At nighttime, predators go out a lot more, and so they have to kind of huddle together to be safety in numbers and in case something's 
 
 coming, so they went into that instinct pretty quickly.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over):  At this doggy daycare in the Dallas area, this group of dogs seemed to stop, confused by the sudden darkness. When the sun 
 
 returned, the dogs started playing around again.
 
Another video captured a cat wanting to come inside its home when darkness struck. At the Toledo Zoo, a polar bear didn't seem to care about all the 
 
 fuss, nonchalantly dove into the water before the sun disappeared.
 
Texas Parks and Wildlife officials teamed up with NASA to set up these acoustic recording devices to monitor the sounds of animals in the wild.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
But not all animals were flustered or impressed by the total eclipse. Tebogo the giraffe mostly walked around, unfazed, ready to start chewing on 
 
 the lettuce the humans feed him when the sun came back.
 
LAVANDERA:  Because a total eclipse is so rare, there's very little documentation, very few studies that have been done on animal behavior 
 
 during a total eclipse. Because of that, zoo officials say they plan on sharing their observations and the data they gather, not just with other 
 
 zoos that were in the path of this eclipse, but as well as with other zoos across the country.

CHATTERLEY:  My sole animal was the one that was more interested in food there than whatever else was going on.
 
All right. And finally, on "First Move," Scrabble is one of the most beloved board games on the market, but it is perhaps too challenging and 
 
 competitive for a younger generation. Just asking.
 
Mattel is releasing a new version of the game called Scrabble Together for sale in Europe. Now, one side of the board is the original game, the other 
 
 side is a "less intimidating" version. Instead of competing, players collaborate on words. There's also helper cards if players get stuck.
 
Mattel says its research shows younger players just aren't as ruthless as they used to be. I guess I suppose that means fewer people will be hurling 
 
 letters across the room and upending the board in frustration. I never did that, by the way. I just read a dictionary to ensure I've won.
 
And that just about wraps up the show. Thank you for joining us. I'll see you tomorrow.
