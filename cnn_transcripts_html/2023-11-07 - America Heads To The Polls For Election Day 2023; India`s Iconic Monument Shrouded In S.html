THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And it`s your CNN 10. We`re putting your vocabulary word in tomorrow`s 
 
 show for #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. Put your word, definition, your school and teacher`s name in the 
 
 comment section of my most recent post. And we`re going to choose one winner to work into tomorrow`s show.
 
Today, though, it is Tuesday, November 7th, and it`s not just any Tuesday. It`s the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, A-K-A election Day 
 
 here in the United States. Federal elections have historically happened on this day to accommodate farmers across the country. Did you know? It`s 
 
 after the harvest, but before the weather gets too cold. 
 
Why Tuesday? Well, people didn`t want to travel to the polls on Sundays because of church. And Wednesday was a day that a lot of farmers would take 
 
 their goods to the market to sell. That left Tuesday as one of the most convenient days to hold U.S. elections, something we still observe to this 
 
 day.
 
Those who are heading to the polls today, they won`t be voting for president, that`s next year. But some cities will be voting for mayor, in 
 
 some states will be voting for governor, and other legislative and constitutional issues are on the table. The outcome of those elections 
 
 could give a better idea of how Americans are feeling about certain issues ahead of the U.S. presidential election next year. And you can follow along 
 
 right here with us on CNN.
 
Moving on now to another choice, multiple choice. Pop quiz, hot shot. 
 
Ten second trivia. One of the world`s most iconic structures. The Taj Mahal is located in which city in India?
 
New Delhi, Mumbai, Agra, or Kolkata?
 
Beginning construction in 1632, the Taj Mahal is located in this city of Agra. 
 
The Taj Mahal is considered one of the most beautiful sites in the world. In fact, it was named one of the new seven wonders of the world. But it 
 
 could become more difficult to see and to glimpse this glorious site because of pollution. It`s an unhealthy, even hazardous problem for parts 
 
 of India. Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai were among the 10 most polluted cities on earth this week, according to a Swiss company called IQAir. CNN`s 
 
 Michael Holmes explains what it all means.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  India`s iconic monument, almost lost in the smog in the city of Agra. It`s not the psych tourists nor the businesses, 
 
 which depend on them, want to see.
 
NIRANJAN SINGH, PHOTOGRAPHER (through translator):  We are facing difficulty in taking pictures of Taj Mahal due to pollution. The Taj Mahal 
 
 is not clearly visible. Tourists are also facing issues.
 
HOLMES: Every year, when the temperatures drop and farmers burn their fields, the air turns toxic in many Indian cities. Delhi is notoriously 
 
 ranked among the world`s most polluted cities and the current air quality there has once again, reached hazardous conditions, forcing primary schools 
 
 to temporarily close and many people to work from home or just stay indoors altogether. 
 
The problem is so serious. A recent air quality life index report says poor air quality could shorten an average Indian`s life expectancy by more than 
 
 five years. If World Health Organization guidelines on curbing pollution aren`t met. And it`s even affecting one of the country`s favorite pastimes. 
 
 India is currently hosting the quicker World Cup with Bangladesh set to play Sri Lanka in a match in Delhi. But the air quality is so poor. Some 
 
 players are wearing masks and both teams have canceled training sessions. The coach of Bangladesh`s team says the conditions have not been ideal.
 
CHANDIKA HATHURUSINGHE, BANGLADESH CRICKET TEAM COARCH:  Our doctors keep a close eye on players. Even for practice, we`re very conscious. We train 
 
 what we have to train, and they go back into the dressing room.
 
HOLMES: Unfortunately, for cricket fans and Delhi residents alike, officials say pollution levels are expected to be high for the next two to 
 
 three weeks. Michael Holmes, CNN.

WIRE:  Hey, Siri?
 
SIRI:  Uh-huh?
 
WIRE:  Call earth.
 
SIRI:  I don`t see Earth in your contacts, to who?
 
WIRE:  I`m trying to make a call to earth.
 
SIRI:  I don`t see earth in your contacts, to who?
 
WIRE:  Never mind. It`s time for CNN`s call to earth. And we`re going to go diving into our next story with a team of researchers exploring underwater 
 
 sites so deep. It takes some three hours to resurface. They`re hoping their studies can help us better understand and preserve our oceans.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GHISLAIN BARDOUT, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CO-DIRECTOR, UNDER THE POLE:  When you are a diver, you are always curious to go to see a little bit further. I think 
 
 every single diver in the world, when you are about to go up, you always have an eye to the depth, to the bottom. Little by little, you want to go 
 
 deeper because you wonder what -- what are you going to find?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ghislain Bardout with his wife Emmanuelle in 2007, he has conducted thousands of dives often to 150 or even 200 meters deep. His 
 
 crew has explored everywhere from the Arctic to the Canary Islands, French Polynesia to the Caribbean.
 
BARDOUT:  We are talking about new ecosystem that`s covered the entire planet. All the shore, everywhere. It`s just below 30 meters, 40 meters. 
 
 And there are, for sure, many species, many different ecosystem that all have a huge importance. So acquiring a better understanding of their, their 
 
 ecology is essential for the conservation of those depths.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With scientists aboard their boat under the poll aims to document these ecosystems for the first time and help preserve their 
 
 future.
 
BARDOUT:  The length of the missions are from months to years. It`s very demanding, very tiring. It`s a very big engagements, not only human 
 
 engagement. It`s a huge logistical organizational engagement.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ghislain`s team are preparing for a six-month expedition, in the Mediterranean next year. That will take them from Greece 
 
 to Italy, to France.
 
EMMANUELLE PERIE-BARDOUT, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CO-DIRECTOR, UNDER THE POLE:  If we spend 20 minutes at 130 meters, we will -- we will take three hours to come 
 
 back to the surface. And this is not negotiable. You have to take this three hours, whatever happens. You need to be technically ready and 
 
 psychologically ready also to make this type of dive. And, yeah, it takes years to be ready for that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In 2022, under the Pole help gain protection for black coral force in the Canary Islands. And they believe there is a similar 
 
 ecosystem to be explored on their Mediterranean voyage next year. 
 
BARDOUT:  In Greece, they already explored the depths with robots ROVs. So they know some fields of black corals, but are not able to study because of 
 
 the depths, because they do not have the diverse to do so. And I like those missions where there`s huge collaborations, you know, with different people 
 
 that can do together something they cannot do alone or just with their own team.
 
PERIE-BARDOUT:  Our mission is really to make the invisible visible, even if it`s deep, even if it`s very far away like in the polar regions, we need 
 
 this place and we need to protect it.

WIRE:  Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 looks like a really gourd time. What should you do with all those leftover pumpkins? Whatever you do, throw 
 
 them away before they get all moldy or gooey, or you could do with this middle school teacher in North Dakota did blowing up the pumpkins in the 
 
 name of science. Do not try this at home. 
 
He`s using the pumpkins to demonstrate a chemical reaction between water and a compound called calcium carbide. And this chemical reaction got a 
 
 great reaction from the students. 
 
Did you know, Jack O`Lanterns originated in Irelands to ward off evil spirits. But instead of using pumpkins, the Irish carved creepy phases into 
 
 turnips. It`s time to turn up right here on CNN 10. 
 
Our special shout out today goes to Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville, North Carolina, go Cardinals. Don`t forget to submit your 
 
 word for tomorrow`s show @coywire on the socials. We can wait to learn from you. I`m Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.
