THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[15:30:00] 
 
ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: And while he sits behind the defense table in that courtroom, his political team has been scrambling trying to figure out how to improvise his campaign schedule with him largely absent because of this case for anywhere from five to eight weeks. He is required to attend every single day on the trial, which will cut into his time in crucial battleground states in this incredibly tight presidential race. 
 
So our Kristen Holmes is outside the courthouse here in Manhattan with me as well. So, Kristen, how is Trump's campaign handling this unprecedented situation? Because it's, you know, they get one day a week. It's a Wednesday in the middle of the week. There's only so much you can do with the limited time that they have.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Erin. I mean, look, there was a little bit of denial here. They were hoping that this day would never come, that he would actually have to sit through this trial.
 
But they had been planning on him being in court every weekday except for Wednesdays and using Wednesdays and Saturdays as campaign days. But planning and reality are a little bit different. They are trying to now figure out what exactly that looks like.
 
As we saw, it's not always going to be perfect. And they're particularly concerned given the fact that they're looking at poll numbers in which it seems as though Biden is closing the gap that Donald Trump had. Now, this is all within the margin of error.
 
This is all very early. But, you know, Donald Trump pays attention to those polls. So what they have been doing was using Donald Trump to go to the cameras in the hallways at every opportunity they had, trying to keep treating these appearances as campaign stops.
 
But now there is some concern that that's not going to be enough. And what we saw last week was really an example of how this could go any which way. We saw the team celebrating after they had this kind of impromptu, politically motivated stop at a Harlem bodega.
 
But then they had a loss when they were supposed to have a campaign rally in North Carolina. Now, with nothing on the schedule, there is nothing for about over a week for him to do. Now, we'll see if they add any kind of stops.
 
They've been looking at ways to try to get him around the New York area, probably to places where he would be more popular, like Staten Island, not necessarily in Manhattan, and also looking for ways to utilize him being in court. Does that mean more local interviews? Does that mean setting up a studio within his Trump Tower to try and get his messaging out?
 
It's just unclear how exactly this is going to play out. But what is clear is that they are trying to find alternatives, despite, again, having known this schedule, the reality now sinking in that it can't just be Wednesdays and Saturdays in this kind of campaign.
 
BURNETT: Yes, it's just pretty incredible to think that they're in this situation. All right, Kristen, thank you very much laying out all of that for us. Wolf.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Erin, thank you very much. I want to bring in our senior political analyst, Gloria Borger. Gloria, this is just the first of potentially four criminal trials that Trump could face this year going into this presidential election.
 
He still needs to talk to voters. He has an opportunity when he leaves the courtroom every day to say something to voters, as opposed to just bad-mouthing what's going on.
 
GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, but that's what he's doing, though. He's leaving the courtroom and he's talking about what went on in court or how unfair the trial is. And that has effectively become his campaign.
 
And what Kristen is saying is that his advisers are beginning to realize that's just not enough. I mean, you see the Biden campaign getting more aggressive, having a president out there traveling. I mean, Joe Biden is doing the opposite of a Rose Garden strategy.
 
He's out there on the campaign trail. This is not to say that Trump was out there a lot before the trial, because he really would sort of jet in, do a big rally and then jet out. But he's got to do more than he's been doing.
 
And the trial handcuffs him, but he's got to figure out a way to get out of that and make some other political points that go beyond how unfair the trial is.
 
BLITZER: And listen to what Trump said after court today, just a little while ago. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If a lawyer puts in a bill or an invoice and you pay the bill and in the book, it's a little line, that's a very small little line. I don't know if you can even write more than two words. It's not like you can tell a life story. They marked it down to a legal expense. This is what I got indicted over. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER: What do you make of the way that Trump is handling trying to frame this criminal case against him when he leaves the court?
 
BORGER: Well, he's trying to prove his innocence outside the courtroom. You know, he's he believes he's his own best attorney. And what he was saying there was, look, you know, this was just a legal item and I was just paying my lawyer.
 
And that's what his attorneys are going to are going to say. But again, he's still making the case that is being made in the courtroom. And he has an opportunity to make another case about why he should be elected president of the United States again.
 
And he's really -- he's really not doing that. And so they're squandering, I think, some opportunities here that they could be using, particularly since he is kind of stuck.
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
BLITZER: And he gets a lot of airtime when he leaves the courtroom. It's he makes a statement to the press and people are watching.
 
BORGER: That's right. So if Joe Biden were to say something on the campaign trail one day, maybe Donald Trump could take the opportunity to respond to that or to sound like a political candidate who's running for president rather than talking about his poll numbers, which is what we hear all the time. 
 
You know, I'm ahead in the polls. I'm doing well. I mean, you know, now it's tightening up.
 
BLITZER: Yes.
 
BORGER: And they're worried about it.
 
BLITZER: Everyone should be worried. A tight race that looks like it's going to happen.
 
All right, Gloria. Thank you very, very much. 
 
It's just it was just over a week ago when we saw the House Speaker Mike Johnson and former President Trump standing side by side at Mar- a-Lago down in Florida. The former president offered Johnson a political lifeline. But now a Trump ally in Congress is calling for Johnson's job after this weekend's votes on foreign aid.
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BURNETT: As testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumes in New York tomorrow, the intrigue on Capitol Hill over whether House Speaker Mike Johnson will keep his job is heating up. Republican hardliner Marjorie Taylor Greene is calling on Johnson to resign or face a motion to vacate his speakership. She's accusing him of betraying Republican voters.
 
The threat comes after House Speaker the House speaker defied GOP hardliners by putting that foreign aid bill on the House floor that had $61 billion in Ukraine. It passed over the weekend and it now heads over to the Senate. So let's go to Melanie Zanona for more.
 
Now three Republicans at least are calling for the speaker's removal. And I know that, you know, technically they've only got a one vote majority. But in all of your reporting that you've been doing so tirelessly on this, Melanie, what's going on? Why haven't they acted on this threat?
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Yes, well, based on the conversations I'm having on Capitol Hill, Marjorie Taylor Greene really wants to build as much support as possible before she actually moves ahead with pulling this trigger on the motion to vacate. As you mentioned, right now, it's only three co-sponsors officially on that resolution. But most Republicans do not want to see another messy speaker fight, including former President Donald Trump.
 
They're worried that it would really undermine the party heading into November. But Greene is confident that when Republicans go home for this recess break, hear from their constituents, see how angry the base is, that there will be a pressure campaign that pushes more Republicans squarely into her camp. And she's also warning Johnson that if he does not step down on his own, they will try to push him out of the job. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Johnson has betrayed America. He's betrayed Republican voters. Under his leadership, he's passed the Democrat agenda, passed the Biden administration's policies, and fully funded them.
 
We're going to fight in Congress to do everything we can to stop this type of uniparty leadership. Mike Johnson's speakership is over. He needs to do the right thing to resign and allow us to move forward in a controlled process. If he doesn't do so, he will be vacated.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZANONA: Now, House Democratic leaders have not officially committed to putting up the necessary votes to help kill any potential motion to vacate. But behind the scenes, there is a lot of interest in doing so. And that is because Democrats appreciate the fact that Johnson put this foreign aid package on the floor, defied his right thing.
 
That was something that there was a lot of doubts that Johnson would actually do. But if Johnson is ultimately propped up by Democrats, that might fuel questions about his long-term political future. And meanwhile, even though former President Donald Trump has been supportive of Johnson, he obviously is preoccupied with his own issues right now.
 
So for Johnson, he's not going to be able to rely on Trump to offer him a lifeline. He's really going to have to depend on Democrats -- Erin.
 
BURNETT: All right, Melanie Zanona, thank you so much on Capitol Hill. 
 
Meantime, Columbia University is facing a security crisis. The Jewish holiday Passover is beginning now at the center of this.
 
Hundreds have taken part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at the campus, pushing the school to switch to remote learning in response, sparking growing concerns about the safety of Jewish students.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BLITZER: President Biden is decrying anti-Semitism that's seeping into a number of protests out on college campuses. Here's what he said just moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you condemn the anti-Semitic protests on college campuses?
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I condemn the anti-Semitic protests. That's why I've set up a program to deal with that. I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER: President Biden's comment comes after Robert Kraft, a prominent donor of Columbia University and the owner of the New England Patriots, blasted the school saying he is no longer confident in its ability to protect its students and staff amid the ongoing pro- Palestinian protests and suggesting he could withhold financial support from his alma mater. 
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval and Shimon Prokupecz are both in New York for us watching what's going on. Polo, first to you. Tell our viewers what you're seeing now.
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So this is a, you could call it a fairly rare perspective at the moment. That's because the Columbia University, still under restricted access guidelines after last week's operation together with the NYPD, led to the dismantling of an encampment here on campus. But that led to another one, which is what you're looking over here, Wolf.
 
This is still technically the heart of this campus, where we've seen, it was here a couple of days ago, there were no tents at this particular, the Gaza Solidarity encampment, but you can see the result now. This is a peaceful assembly of these students here, and we have not seen or heard any indication from Columbia University officials that they plan to once again, turn to the NYPD to make their way on campus and then remove this encampment here. We'll see if that changes. 
 
But what's also picked up on here is there's been intensified fears among some Jewish members of the school reporting that they feel uncomfortable. One student telling me that felt intimidated as well because of what he described as anti-Semitic language in some of these demonstrations. 
 
Now, to be clear, we have heard from some of the main student groups organizing this event, and they have actually been, through a statement, trying to really distance themselves from what they described as non-student protesters, calling those individuals, quote, inflammatory individuals who do not represent us. 
 <br>[15:50:04]
 
It's also important to point out that after hearing from the NYPD, that they have received several reports of Jewish students being harassed, but none so far of any sort of physical altercation. The concern, though, is that those fears do continue. 
 
Back out at this encampment, you can see there's even some flags around the perimeter, some of them with writing, an organizer here telling me that those are the names of dead Palestinians, and it really goes to the message that they're trying to send.
 
But at the same time, this is important to also see, because it is a representation of what either may happen or is happening at other major colleges and universities throughout the country, Wolf. Back to you.
 
BLITZER: All right, Polo, standby. We'll get back to you. I want to go to Shimon, who's also in New York, watching what's going on. What are you seeing, Shimon?
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: So, Wolf, we're outside the campus. We were in the campus, in the encampment last hour. We've now come outside.
 
And what's important about what's happening out here is that most of the people here, Wolf, I want to show you, it's not a very large group, but it's a very loud group. They've been out here for several days as well, and they're here to support the people that are on the inside, which are the students. And what happens is many of the students who are inside come to this gate and stand out here to sort of do a back and forth as you can hear some of the chants.
 
And a lot of the trouble that you have seen has started outside here. Fires burning, some of the interaction and confrontation between the community and some of the people who have been here, including some pro-Israel supporters who've been out here. 
 
The other thing I want to show you, Wolf, as we know, the NYPD is outside. I want to show you. This is where they have remained here on the perimeter, keeping an eye on the folks here. They're right now not allowed into the school. The city says that if they're requested by the school, they would allow the NYPD officers to go inside and help in any way that they need.
 
Remember, it was just a few days ago that the school did ask the NYPD to come on campus and to remove the tents, to remove the encampment resulting in those hundred students and faculty members and other people being arrested. That was a flashpoint in this, certainly. So anything that happens now is going to be something that the university is going to think about very carefully before they decide in allowing the NYPD inside.
 
But the NYPD is out here. The supporters of the students who are on the inside remain out here. And this goes on for hours, well into the night, Wolf, the folks out here standing, chanting. And then you have the students on the inside at these gates -- Wolf.
 
BLITZER: Shimon, what's been the reaction to that rabbi at Columbia University advising Jewish students, Jewish Columbia University students to stay home today? It's too dangerous to go back on campus.
 
PROKUPECZ: So I spoke to some of the Jewish students yesterday. We were inside on campus. Yes, there is concern on their part of what's happening here. They are concerned for their safety. But I also think they all feel that they need to stick together. They need to remain brave to face the adversity and some of the challenges that they're facing on campus.
 
So while some of them, of course, are afraid, they're doing things to minimize their risk. They're getting together. They're staying in groups. And most of them say they plan to remain here for now. 
 
A lot of the concern that these students are getting are coming from their parents. Their parents are very worried about them.
 
But for now, the students said, yes, we don't feel entirely safe. This is not what Columbia is. This is not what we came here for. So we are worried for our safety. Some have said that they have been harassed, but they're going to keep coming. They're going to keep coming to campus.
 
It is the first night of Passover. Some of them plan to have a Seder together. And the key for them right now is to stick together in solidarity and also to protect themselves.
 
BLITZER: Yes, I hope it's going to be safe over there at Columbia University. All right, Shimon Prokupecz, Polo Sandoval, to both of you, thank you very, very
 
 much.
 
And we'll be right back.
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BURNETT: Michael Cohen has just responded to comments made outside the courtroom this afternoon by his former boss, Donald Trump. Earlier, Trump told reporters this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: He is a lawyer, or was a lawyer. And also the things he got in trouble for were things that had nothing to do with me. He got in trouble, he went to jail.
 
This had nothing to do with me. This had to do with the taxicab company that he owned, which is just something he owned. And medallions and borrowing money and a lot of things, but it had nothing to do with me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BURNETT: Shortly after those comments, Cohen tweeted that Trump's attacks, quote, stink of desperation. 
 
He goes on to write, and I quote him: We are all hoping that you take the stand in your defense. 
 
Now, Trump, of course, Wolf, is under that gag order, was ordered by Judge Merchan not to comment by any witnesses in the trial.
 
BLITZER: And just to fact check what Trump said in that soundbite. Cohen served time in federal prison after pleading guilty to breaking federal campaign laws when he facilitated the payment to Stormy Daniels, which is directly linked to the charges right now against Trump. 
 <br>[16:00:00]
 
As for the taxi medallions that Trump referenced, Cohen was also sentenced for tax evasion related to a taxi medallion enterprise and lying to a bank in relation to a home loan.
