(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST, FIRST MOVE: A warm welcome to "First Move", great to have you with us for another busy hour ahead. The DOW's summer 
 
 rally stands at an impressive eight for eight the blue chips bulls refusing to be underweight.
 
Tesla revenues a Musk read but I have to say price cuts do great. And Netflix subscriptions jump that sales guidance in a weaker state. And the 
 
 Women's World Cup kicks off in New Zealand I hear England's team is pretty great have to say plenty of times today too.
 
We've got an update from football excitement to global market enlightenment in the United States tech getting packed pre market as Netflix, Tesla and 
 
 IBM results fail to meet lofty expectations and valuations based on the recent rallies for these stocks details on their earnings reports just 
 
 ahead.
 
Europe in the meantime, as you can see solidly higher after a mostly lower handover from Asia. Japanese stocks piecing the regional declines with the 
 
 NIKKEI of more than 1 percent just to be clear, though context, it's still up more than 37 percent year-to-date.
 
China's Central Bank in the meantime leaving interest rates unchanged and that dashed hopes for more economic stimulus as deflationary fears there 
 
 grow. Inflation, of course, still the key economic concern, this time in Turkey, the country's central bank hiking interest rates by another 2.5 
 
 percentage points that takes base rates now to 17.5 percent. Eye watering levels to be sure that the second underwhelming stab at controlling pricing 
 
 pressures in a row analysts in fact we're expecting rates to rise to 20 percent.
 
In the meantime, the violence in Ukraine fueling volatility in commodities, wheat prices turning higher after some earlier weakness currently up by 
 
 around 1.5 percent just to give you the context on this too wheat up some 15 percent in price terms the past week. As Russia exited that Black Sea 
 
 Grain Deal, and now appears to be targeting grain infrastructure in the south.
 
And that's where we begin today's show with another terrifying night in Odessa. Russia using a combination of missiles and drones to target the key 
 
 Black Sea Port City for the third straight night at least one person died in the attack. Ukraine says its air defenses were able to intercept just a 
 
 quarter of those missiles overnight as Alex Marquardt reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This city has never seen anything like this since the beginning of this 
 
 war. I can't overstate the terror that the citizens of this city have had to experience over not one but the last three nights and it is no mistake 
 
 that Odessa is home to Ukraine's most famous port.
 
I want to show you some of the destruction from last night. This is an administrative building. It looks like it was around four storey's high. 
 
 You can see it has completely collapsed. We are told this is still a search and rescue operation.
 
We know that at least one young man was killed there were several people who were injured. You can see those firefighters trying to put out the 
 
 fires in this building both in from among the rubble and up on that ladder up there.
 
There are firefighters there are rescue workers. There are volunteers and residents of this neighborhood who are just trying to make sense of what we 
 
 experienced last night. We are on the edge of the port, the one of the biggest Port in Ukraine which we can't show you for security reasons.
 
But that is almost certainly why according to Ukrainian authorities, Russia has been carrying out these strikes on Ukraine. Now this attack started 
 
 just before 2 am local time. It was a combination of drones and missiles. We could hear those drones very clearly buzzing the rooftops in downtown 
 
 Odessa.
 
I want to play you some of the video that sorry, we're just going to get out of the way these -- this water. I want to play you some of the videos 
 
 shot by Photo Journalist Scott McWhinnie of one of the explosions of the missiles here in Odessa last night. Take a listen.
 
That is the kind of thing that we heard for an hour and a half. Now it was not just Odessa that was hit it was also Mykolaiv, which is another 
 
 Southern Port City there 19 people were wounded. This was an incredibly sophisticated attack almost 40 drones and missiles from most of the 
 
 missiles got through.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
Russia used long range strategic bombers, supersonic bombers. They used four different kinds of cruise missiles. They used those Iranian kamikaze 
 
 drones. Just the symbolism of what they use is sending a very large message to Ukraine. President Zelenskyy has said it is very clearly Russia trying 
 
 to target the grain infrastructure just a few days after Russia pulled out of that critical grain deal.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Thanks to Alex Marquardt, there in Odessa. OK, let's move on now to some football fever and to be specific female for Footie fever. The 
 
 Women's World Cup is underway and it's being held in the southern hemisphere for the first time.
 
The two host nations already in action this Thursday, New Zealand stunning with a win over Norway in the opening match and Australia, also beating 
 
 Ireland both matches, a moment of silence was observed too before kickoff after a shooting in New Zealand claimed two lives.
 
Amanda Davies joins us now. Amanda, this is very exciting, not only an expansion, actually of the number of teams that are playing and therefore 
 
 the number of women but I believe actually the prize money for winning this up 300 percent since the 2019 World Cup which pleases me greatly not there 
 
 yet, but improving.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Yes, I think it's fair to say Julia that anybody you speak to involve with women's football says huge progress has 
 
 been made. But there is still a very long way to go.
 
And I was lucky enough to co-host the draw for this tournament back in October in Auckland. I was there on the stage alongside two time winner, 
 
 Carle Lloyd and you couldn't help but get drawn along by the real buzz and momentum looking ahead to this tournament, which is set not only to be the 
 
 biggest ever football Women's World Cup, but the biggest ever women's sporting event on the planet.
 
And I think it's fair to say the opening day has been a real roller coaster of emotions. With that news emerging in the hours before the opening game 
 
 in Auckland of the deadly shooting that had taken place in the center of Auckland taking the lives of two people putting a number of others in 
 
 hospital.
 
World football's governing body FIFA did release a statement having spoken to authorities and the police and the governmental officials in New Zealand 
 
 confirming it was completely unrelated to the tournament but just really awful timing when the momentum and the excitement had been building.
 
So as you rightly said both the game in Auckland and Australia holding moments of silences ahead of the action kicking off. And you could see just 
 
 what this moment meant for both of these two sides. New Zealand is a team who had never before won a match at a women's world cup.
 
15 matches they had played 15 matches they had failed to win. And then in their 16th they finally got that victory on home soil Eden Park such an 
 
 iconic sporting victory. Ali Riley the captain, who is playing in her fifth world cup who has represented her nation across the world playing domestic 
 
 football. She was overcome with emotion in the end saying she has done it.
 
This is the statement that they really wanted to make and they're hoping that this will be a real platform to bounce from as the tournament goes on. 
 
 And then it was over to Australia. Australia with the really bad news announced just an hour before kickoff just at full time with New Zealand's 
 
 victory over Norway.
 
That their talismanic Captain Australia's all-time record goal scorer Sam Kerr had been ruled out not only of this their opening match against the 
 
 Republic of Ireland but also their second match against Nigeria having suffered a calf injury in training on match day minus one yesterday as 
 
 people are away from football knowing.
 
That was could have been a really telling blow but Samko -- Samko she was there on the sidelines, cheering her side on it was Steph Catley the person 
 
 who took over their captain's armband for this one who ultimately scored the goal that made the difference.
 
So both of the host nations off to a winning start and if today's football is anything to go by, we really are set for a pretty special month of 
 
 action of course all roads leading to that final in Sydney, Australia on August 20th Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I can't wait. I was going to ask you about to England's prospects but we've run out of time, which is probably good thing. We've 
 
 got plenty of time to discuss in the future. Great to have you with us thank you Amanda.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
OK, no world cup trophies just yet for tech. The star players of the NASDAQ beginning to report second quarter results and investors unimpressed let's 
 
 call it that with the state of play so far. Shares of Tesla, IBM and Netflix are all lower pre market as their results underwhelm versus great 
 
 expectations let's be clear.
 
The NASDAQ up some 37 percent year-to-date, lots of pressure on the high tech high fliers to deliver and justify their rich valuations. And that's 
 
 the key too. Clare Duffy joins us now. Let's talk about Tesla because I think we got record quarterly revenues, earnings, lower margins because 
 
 they've been cutting prices. I wonder whether some of the disappointment was tied to perhaps a production slowdown or what we didn't hear about 
 
 things like the cyber truck.
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Yes Julia, I mean, I think there's a lot for Tesla to talk about here. And that company did sort of hint that they 
 
 would be having a summer slowdown in production in some areas.
 
But the big question going into this report was these price cuts that the company has been making in recent months, due to increased competition over 
 
 EVs? And the question has been how is that going to weigh on the company's results?
 
The company reported better than expected increase in profits earnings of $3.1 billion, up 20 percent year-over-year. But as you said, that profit 
 
 margin is lower 18.2 percent, which is lower than the 25 percent that the company reported a year ago.
 
And so I think you're starting to see those price cuts weigh on the company's earnings. You know, as investors in some ways we're sort of 
 
 expecting but you know this is going to continue to affect the company through the rest of this year, at least.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, still want to watch. And what about Netflix too, I think this is a story two of them great expectations, whether it was the 
 
 crackdown on password sharing, or the additional ad supported tier that was supposed to bring in more revenues too? What do you make of these results?
 
DUFFY: Yes, I mean, it was a big report for Netflix in terms of its subscriber numbers. The company added 5.9 million global subscribers 
 
 bringing its total to 238 million. That's huge after the same time, last year; the company lost 1 million subscribers.
 
The company's revenue grew to nearly $8.2 billion, but it missed expectations and so I think you're seeing, you know, the company's goals, 
 
 these sort of strategies, this rollout of the page sharing and the ad supported tier are starting to pay off, but it still has a long way to go.
 
I think you're also seeing investors react to this actor strike and this writer strike in Hollywood, that could start to impact the company's 
 
 ability to create content this year and going into next year.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's also going to save some costs, at least in the short term, but you have to assume there's going to be a catch up afterwards. But 
 
 I think that chart, the share price says everything in terms of the reaction today, they've gone a long, way higher this year. So a little bit 
 
 of a modest reaction makes sense to me, Clare, thank you great to have you with us.
 
DUFFY: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Now to the latest on the U.S. soldier who fled into North Korea Private Travis King was supposed to be sent back to the United States but 
 
 after passing through airport security in Seoul he reported his passport missing and didn't buy the flight. The next day while visiting the 
 
 demilitarized zone witnessed the say King dashed across the border. Will Ripley is there and reports from near the DMZ in South Korea.
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Korean DMZ the demilitarized zone is one of the most heavily fortified border areas in the 
 
 world. That's the reason why you have barricades and spike strips and all of these military checkpoints trying to prevent people from being able to 
 
 go in or come out.
 
There's a reason why this road has tank traps basically, if a tank were to come rolling down, they would blow up to stop an invasion from the north to 
 
 the south. And the North has similar booby traps set up as well. So obviously, it's a highly secured area.
 
How did this U.S. Army Private just run across? Well, we're learning that on Monday at Incheon Airport, about 90 minutes' drive from where I'm 
 
 standing right now. He was supposed to get on an American Airlines flight to Dallas. But he told after going through all of the procedures, all the 
 
 security right at the gate to the plane.
 
He claimed that he had lost his passport and was escorted back outside of the airport somehow made his way here on Tuesday where he was able to board 
 
 -- get on a tour he had booked a tour. It was apparently the passenger manifest was approved by the United Nations Command.
 
And he along with about 40 other people took a bus down this road over this unification bridge and less than five miles that way is the Joint Security 
 
 Area where he was able to basically according to others who were on the tour with him run across ignoring the calls of guards and get into a North 
 
 Korean van where he was whisked away.
 
Now where he is now after being in North Korean custody for Wednesday and now Thursday? Still an open question because the North Koreans have not 
 
 released any information publicly. And it may be quite some time before we officially know anything about this soldier's whereabouts or when he might 
 
 have a chance of getting back to the U.S. Will Ripley, CNN South Korea near the DMZ.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK, coming up here on "First Move" Google's billion dollar drive to improve job seeker skills, helping them bridge the digital gap and 
 
 climb the jobs ladder. That's later, stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move". We're only halfway through the year and already extreme floods in places like India, wildfires in Canada, 
 
 Switzerland and Greece and tornadoes in the United States have not only put lives at risk, but have also meant heartbreaking scenes like this when 
 
 property owners returned to survey the damage and then calculate the cost to rebuild.
 
And that's where insurance plays a vital role. According to the Swiss Re Institute, their research arm of the insurance giant global economic losses 
 
 tied to natural disasters reached $270 billion last year, of which less than half was covered by insurance and it's not just the extreme weather 
 
 that matters.
 
Rising inflation also means that the cost of fix the damage has soared too. Two years ago as well Swiss warned that with no action to redress climate 
 
 change, the impact of global warming could slice a massive 18 percent off the global economy by 2050. And some countries in Southeast Asia could lose 
 
 half of their GDP by mid-century.
 
Joining us now is Jerome Haegeli; he's the Group's Chief Economist at the Swiss Re Institute. Sir, fantastic to get you on the show! Let's just start 
 
 by talking about natural catastrophes.
 
JEROME HAEGELI, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, SWISS RE INSTITUTE: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: And the extreme weather that we've seen, I believe last year was the fourth highest on record in terms of losses. And judging by the 
 
 weather this year, I'm assuming a similar kind of growth rate.
 
HAEGELI: Yes, absolutely. I knew you're saying it and we are feeling it whether you're in North American in U.S. or whether you are in Europe or in 
 
 Switzerland, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophe of climate change is very much interacting also with the environment with the economic 
 
 environment.
 
And we are seeing more heat waves. We are seeing more precipitation of rain, but also more floods. And in terms of global economic losses if you 
 
 look at our sigma, Swiss Re sigma records actually had about $270 billion of losses.
 
And if you look at what drove it last year, Hurricane Ian. And if you look at Hurricane Ian, it's actually the second costliest Hurricane after 
 
 Hurricane Katrina, so definitely a very serious environment with climate change having a real impact on economics.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: There are two drivers here. It's not just the losses that we're talking about that result from the natural catastrophes. There's also the 
 
 replacement cost, as I mentioned in the introduction of whatever needs rebuilding, and due to the high levels of inflation that we've seen 
 
 globally.
 
That's also contributing to the loss rates that we're seeing and that the lack of insurance cover. I believe, in certain cases, just explain the 
 
 sorts of double whammy that we've seen of high inflation impacting us too?
 
HAEGELI: Absolutely! And you said it is double whammy. 2022, if you think about it, Hurricane Ian just mentioned, it was really the perfect storm, in 
 
 terms of the inflation shock interacting with natural catastrophes, higher inflation means higher prices, and higher prices what does it mean?
 
It means also higher costs of replacing goods or replacing physical goods, but also of costs of physical losses. So that's why it's really important 
 
 to act and keep obviously the risks on the check by various means. But yes, absolutely, the inflation shock has greatly increased the loss of the 
 
 climate effects that we had seen last year and probably will continue to see as we speak.
 
CHATTERLEY: And that's the key, insurance to me is about planning for the unexpected. You pay a premium, and then if something goes wrong, you're 
 
 given them the cash back to rebuild your life in whatever ways required. But if events like we're seeing happen regularly enough.
 
We start talking about things being predictable on an annual basis then insurance is surely no longer the right product, because it's predictable, 
 
 rather than unexpected. I know you're an economist rather than a scientist, but are we getting to the point where you have to go back and look at the 
 
 sort of risk pricing models that you're using and say, some of these events sort of fall into a different category?
 
HAEGELI: Yes, well, for sure, if the event is always happening at the same place with the certain predictive nature frequency, it doesn't make sense 
 
 in the first place to build there. And there, we need to have clarity as well. When I think about building zones don't build where you're always 
 
 going to be exposed, right to two floats, or to the weekend.
 
So that's point number one, and yes the risk of climate change that needs to have a price and talking as an economist, I think what we need to do is 
 
 need to internalize the costs of climate change, because it's an externality, which has great effects in terms of the environment in terms 
 
 of also our well-being.
 
But it also will have great effects, its significant effects on regions on the global economy. And if you don't act today, and now the costs are just 
 
 going to increase. The flip side is I think that's also an important point to make is that if you invest into adaptation, to mitigate the effects of 
 
 climate change.
 
You also do something very much not just for the environment, but also for economic growth. And I very much believe that once you get inflation shock, 
 
 under control, and price stability is also super important, because lower prices will also make it cheaper to fight climate change. And they should 
 
 also allow for more investments into sustainable infrastructure, for example, and as a growth is a great growth, multiplier doom.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, we have to talk about that, because I've mentioned the worst case scenario of not doing enough or anything to try and hit those 
 
 Paris targets and the cost of the global economy as a result, but you've also done research into the cost of transition, and the impact on 
 
 businesses.
 
And that is desperately unequal in terms of impact around the world. How, in your mind, based on the data that you haven't seen is the best way to 
 
 tackle financing this gap?
 
HAEGELI: That's a great question. Thank you. So how do we best what is first of all, what's the climate financing gap? And then how do we plug the 
 
 holes? Well, we also did some research in terms of climate financing gap looking at decarbonization, what is needed to get to net zero by 2050.
 
And what we find and confirmed by all the literature out there is you need actually about $10 trillion per year. So we're not talking billions, we are 
 
 talking trillions.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
There's 10 trillion dollars missing in terms of financing to get to decarbonize our economies, and to get to net zero, and $10 trillion below 
 
 is huge. It's about the size of China. Definitely, it is possible. If I look at what's out there, and I hear come to the solution, if I look at 
 
 what's possible, how to get the financing, rolling fact is five only about 5 percent of debt out there.
 
Debt instruments out there are really sustainable. So sustainable debt, or sustainable financing is still a niche. And we need to get niche become 
 
 mainstream. We need to lower the investment barriers, especially for long term investments, lower investment barriers for green and sustainable 
 
 infrastructure investments that would go a long way to actually notice climate financing gaps.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I looked at your research on this as well.
 
HAEGELI: So basically we need to create these markets -- .
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I was just going to say I looked at your research on this, and you were talking about the imposition of a global carbon tax of $100 
 
 per metric ton. And you looked at the earnings capabilities of companies in utilities materials in the energy sectors.
 
And they would obviously be the most impacted and would lose between 40 and 80 percent of their earnings per share as a result. I mean, there's a lot 
 
 of industry players that are saying a carbon tax is unworkable. But you understand the resistance in some of these industries, when you see numbers 
 
 like this.
 
Jerome, in the short term, sort of final question, what concerns you most or what actually gives you greatest optimism of all the talks that are 
 
 being had about financing, the shift in climate change, particularly for poor nations, because the talks are happening?
 
HAEGELI: The greatest optimist smacking cause for optimism is that we understand that we need to get the climate financing piece, right? And 
 
 there's a lot of attention there. And I think if you look at last cope event, that's where we had some break too. The biggest cause for not being 
 
 so optimistic is that a lot of glitches out there need to make sure that pledges also turn to actions.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes.
 
HAEGELI: But I think it's good that you also see the costs of the climate change. And, again, put a price tag of climate change and absolutely Co2, 
 
 it needs to have the correct level of price at 50 or $75. But don't it's just too cheap. It needs to be at least $100. Having a Co2 tax is not going 
 
 to be a silver bullet. But we have to start somewhere.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. OK, that's a whole separate conversation. And we'll come back to that great introduction to you and your work at the institute. 
 
 Thank you so much for joining us today, Jerome, fantastic to talk to you.
 
HAEGELI: Thank you so much. Thank you, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Thank you sir. OK, so to come, Hollywood Studios embrace artificial intelligence as actors strike over the use of the technology and 
 
 more. I look at how AI is already being used in movies and what jobs could be at risk as a result, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move", with U.S. stocks up and running on a pretty turbulent Thursday for technology stocks. The NASDAQ beginning 
 
 the session lower, after underwhelming results from Netflix and Tesla, the DOW though higher after posting its eighth straight winning session on 
 
 Wednesday its longest winning streak in almost three years.
 
Solid earnings results though in the space beyond tech drug giant Johnson and Johnson as well as American Airlines upping their profit forecasts. 
 
 United Airlines seeing a strong third quarter two as demand for tickets remains strong and energy prices remain relatively tame.
 
Here's a look at how Tesla and Netflix are faring in early trade shares of both companies sharply lower at this moment Netflix, in fact taking the 
 
 biggest hit down over 6 percent. Now Netflix may be celebrating a bump in subscribers but now there's the angst over the race to provide fresh 
 
 content to keep them, why?
 
Well, Hollywood actors and screenwriters continue to strike. And one issue they say is the potential for studios to use less humans and more 
 
 technology like artificial intelligence. Our Donie O'Sullivan looks at how the technology is in fact already being adopted.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATT PANOUSIS, COO OF MARZ: This is where we started it's an automated solution for cosmetic and de-aging work.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Through some technological wizardry, 80 year old Harrison Ford looks exactly like 40 year old Harrison Ford. Do you 
 
 understand how they did that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not completely.
 
DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In the latest Indiana Jones movie Harrison Ford is de-aged for a flashback where he fights the 
 
 Nazis.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not photo shopped or anything. It doesn't look that way.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): Hollywood studios are moving beyond traditional visual effect technology and embracing artificial intelligence turning to 
 
 companies like MARZ.
 
O'SULLIVAN (on camera): What does MARZ stand for?
 
PANOUSIS: Monsters, Aliens, Robots and Zombies.
 
O'SULLIVAN (on camera): I think that's the best name I've heard for a company.
 
PANOUSIS: Thank you.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): The latest Spider Man movie released in 2021 features villains like the Green Goblin and Dr. Otto Octavius characters 
 
 who haven't been seen in years.
 
JONATHAN BRONFMAN, CEO OF MARZ: So they took the villains from previous versions of Spider Man movies and they wanted to bring them back in that 
 
 moment then when they originally performed that character. So without naming names, we helped Marvel do that on a certain character.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): MARZ says it's de-aging. AI technology knocks thousands of man hours off the visual effects process, but they say they 
 
 aren't killing jobs.
 
BRONFMAN: The demand for visual effects way outstrips the supplies but there are a finite number of artists in the world that are able to execute 
 
 on that demand.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): MARZ has also built an AI dubbing tool aiming to make awkward out of sync voiceovers like these a thing of the past. MARZ 
 
 uses deep fake technology to reconstruct an actor's lips to match the dubbed audio. They tried it out on me first we sent them this short clip I 
 
 shot in a CNN studio.
 
O'SULLIVAN (on camera): I've always been terrible at speaking any language other than English. In fact, I struggle with English sometimes.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): With that they were able to do this.
 
O'SULLIVAN (on camera): -- Donnie O'Sullivan is a Correspondent to CNN, -- . That is very impressive. My lips look French.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know who you are.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): This technology can even put other people's words in your mouth. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills. If 
 
 you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you.
 
O'SULLIVAN (on camera): My fellow Irishman as well.
 
PANOUSIS: Lip dub was built for the purpose of allowing studios to take content in their native tongue and put that content across the globe in a 
 
 way where it looks native to the viewer.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): For its part, MARZ says it is not in the business of replacing actors. Its technology is meant to enhance performances, not 
 
 create them.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's not a question of the technology is how you use it. Look, you know, I can be hit by a bus tomorrow. And that's it. But 
 
 my performances can go on and on and on and on and on and outside of the understanding that it's been done with AI or deep fake. There'll be nothing 
 
 to tell you that it's not me and me alone.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): Fears of how AI will be used as party why sag after the actors union is on strike, saying the studio's want to replace 
 
 them with artificial performances. The movie studios are pushing back on that claim.
 
BRONFMAN: Technology cannot replace an actor full on so you cannot go head to toe and redo the entire face and expect that to be photo real. The 
 
 technology just isn't there right now. Now as it relates to writers, I think they can more easily be replaced by artificial intelligence.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice over): Donie O'Sullivan, CNN, Toronto, Canada.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Fascinating conversation. OK, coming up after the break Google on the search for solutions to narrow the digital skills gap and help 
 
 workers find better jobs. More on its $1 billion education program, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move", in the United States today, 6 million people are looking for jobs. Now the good news is there are nearly 
 
 10 million vacancies out there. The bad news is employers say they can't find the people with the right skills. In fact, 65 percent of HR 
 
 professionals believe that their own organization suffers from a skills gap, according to U.S. publishing giant Wiley.
 
Now a crucial part of this gap comes from a lack of college education whether or not a specific role even requires it.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
But also things like digital training and data skills. And that's where Grow with Google's project comes in. It's a $1 billion program providing 
 
 digital training in key areas such as IT support, project management and data analytics. It also offers industry recognized qualifications that have 
 
 helped tens of thousands of people move into higher paid jobs in tech.
 
And joining us now is Lisa Gevelber. She founded the program. She's also the Chief Marketing officer for Google, Americas. Lisa, fantastic to have 
 
 you on the show, Grow with Google, in your own words, how you recognize that people within Google actually could help provide skills to 21st 
 
 century workers that they need, but don't yet have?
 
LISA GEVELBER, FOUNDER OF GROW WITH GOOGLE: That's right. Yes, thanks for having me. Yes, we started Grow with Google based on an important value 
 
 that we have at Google, which is that the opportunities that are created by technology should truly be available to everyone. And one of the ways we 
 
 knew we could add value is by sharing our expertise to help fill that digital skills gap.
 
CHATTERLEY: Explain what some of the courses are actually like. And I understand that, I mean, the data is clear two thirds of Americans actually 
 
 don't get college degrees. But a lot of these jobs, say a college degree, is prerequisite. You don't care about previous experience, or the level of 
 
 education for those that take the courses. Is that correct?
 
GEVELBER: That's right. There is this really important problem in our society that most jobs that have great career potential and pay? Well say 
 
 they require a degree, but most Americans don't have one. So we created an alternative pathway to get to great jobs. And it's called the Google Career 
 
 Certificate program.
 
And we know that people are amazing learners. So all we needed to do was help them get the knowledge and the skills they needed. So we teach six 
 
 different career fields. It's all taught by Google experts. And it's all online on demand. So people can do it, when they have time and at their own 
 
 pace.
 
Most people will finish in three to six months a part time study, and they can get into really in demand high paying careers, like data analytics, or 
 
 cybersecurity, IT support or digital marketing or project management, all things that are really in demand. There's, about 2.5 million open jobs just 
 
 in our six career fields right now in the U.S.
 
CHATTERLEY: And these certificates are being recognized by employers, I know you've run a sort of dating or a matching scheme as well with 
 
 potential employers, which I think is important, too. It's not just a nebulous course that you do you try and help with that too. And even 
 
 colleges, I believe, now, for separate courses, are looking at these qualifications and saying these are worth having for our students.
 
GEVELBER: That's right. This opportunity is so large that even Google, can solve it by ourselves. And what we're excited about is, we have over 150 
 
 big national employers, people like Verizon, Walmart, Accenture, Deloitte, and of course, Google who are hiring our graduates of the Google Career 
 
 Certificate program.
 
As a matter of fact, when you finish the program, you instantly get access to our job board with thousands of jobs in it, and that you're already 
 
 qualified for. And it's really exciting also to see educational institutions get excited about helping people earn these amazing 
 
 certificates and really learn the in demand career skills.
 
So we work with over 400 educational institutions right now, everything from high schools to community colleges, and now even to prestigious four 
 
 year universities as well.
 
CHATTERLEY: Something that caught my attention, and we talked about it nonstop on this show is the use of artificial intelligence. And one of the 
 
 ways that you're also helping some of these people is with interview practice, which I think is so important, because most people, even if 
 
 you're doing this online.
 
That's one thing actually being in front of somebody or having to talk to a stranger and tell them why you want the job is tough. Explain the use of 
 
 artificial intelligence, and how that helps these individuals practice for a hopeful future job.
 
GEVELBER: Yes, that's right, in a -- really can be daunting. And we know that practice makes people better. So we created a special tool, we call it 
 
 the Interview Warmup tool. You can find it by just Googling Interview Warmup tool. And it helps you practice as a matter of fact that questions 
 
 are generated by experts in the field.
 
So they're asking you questions that are about the career field that you're applying for. And then you get to practice the responses, and it gives you 
 
 feedback. So really, really useful way for you to brush up your skills and get feedback before you're doing the real interview. It's super useful.
 
CHATTERLEY: I should ask very quickly, so how much do these courses cost? Do people have to pay to do them?
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
GEVELBER: Yes, so the courses cost that $49 a month and most people finish in three to six months but if needed there's also scholarships available.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, but the accessibility of that relative to other forms of education is vast. OK, to continue the point about artificial intelligence 
 
 and these conversations, when I look at some of the trainings that you offer data analysts, IT supports specialists.
 
I sort of wonder what proportion of these businesses at least chunk of these future careers will be replaced by technologies like artificial 
 
 intelligence by some degree of automation. I sort of feel if you were, again, a parent, looking at your child and say, how, and where should you 
 
 head?
 
Whether it's before you get to the workplace or for someone in the workplace? How do you know that something that you're training for isn't 
 
 going to be sort of taken over by a computer or technology before you've even really got there?
 
GEVELBER: Yes, for sure, technology is going to have an impact as it always had. But we think it's really a great complement to people's skills. It's 
 
 going to really assist us as we all try to expand on our creativity and become more productive, I think it'll be an important tool.
 
And as a matter of fact, I think new jobs will be created that didn't exist before, just as they have historically, imagine flight attendants before 
 
 there was commercial aviation. And it's really exciting to think about what the possibilities will be when people have these tools at their disposal.
 
CHATTERLEY: So how do you prepare in that case, you stay flexible. You learned and expand your ranges as much as you can and not panic about the 
 
 things that you don't know about the future and the jobs that don't yet exist?
 
GEVELBER: Yes, I think that's right. And also, we know our focus is really on teaching people, not just the technical skills. They need to be 
 
 successful in these careers, things like data analytics, but also really durable skills that will be needed no matter what things like problem 
 
 solving, communication, critical thinking. We actually teach all of those durable skills as part of the Google Career Certificate program as well.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, fantastic to get you on. It's interesting to hear what some what's going on behind the scenes at some of these big tech companies, 
 
 Lisa, great to have you on thank you very much for your time, the Founder of Grow with Google.
 
GEVELBER: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Thank you. OK, still to come. The allure of the Cote d'Azur, plenty of that, Richard Quest is in Nice, Nice finding out what makes this 
 
 holiday destination so nice -- .
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back. Now for long time capitalism was a dirty word in Cuba. Well, now budding entrepreneurs have more freedom to explore but no 
 
 place to learn the ABCs of business. Patrick Oppmann reports, they're now getting a bit of a crash course courtesy of the U.S. government.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A business seminar and hotel meeting room may not seem that groundbreaking, but not long ago in 
 
 Cuba world capitalism used to be outlawed, it would have been impossible to imagine.
 
All the more so since the man teaching this business boot camps organized by the U.S. Embassy in Havana is Cuban American development expert Gustavo 
 
 Arnavat who left the island as a young boy to flee Fidel Castro's revolution. He's been invited by the U.S. government to share his knowledge 
 
 with Cuba's trailblazing entrepreneurs.
 
GUSTAVO ARNAVAT, BUSINESS SEMINAR INSTRUCTOR: What they need is, they need capital, they need an idea, they need persistence, and they need to really 
 
 work through very difficult times. Every entrepreneur is going to have good days and bad days. Some bad days are going to be extremely challenging. 
 
 They're probably going to you know, give up, again, no different any other country, but here's particularly difficult.
 
OPPMANN (voice over): Particularly difficult because for decades following the 1959 revolution, all private enterprise was banned in Cuba. Cubans were 
 
 required to work for the state, then following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Official prohibitions on self-employment slowly began to ease.
 
OPPMANN (on camera): The first entrepreneurs in a generation here face a unique problem. There are no businesses schools, scarce knowledge that can 
 
 be passed down about self-employment. Cuba's budding capitalists have had to learn by doing.
 
OPPMANN (voice over): Juan Carlos Blaine is turned a side business selling hamburgers into a restaurant franchise, a small supermarket and logistics 
 
 company. Altogether, he says he employs more than 60 people attending the business boot camp, he says helped him to identify areas of future growth.
 
We've done courses on E-commerce marketing, risk capital private financing, he says. They're very current things very modern and things that we can use 
 
 a lot. Even though the U.S. government says it wants to help Cuban entrepreneurs, U.S. economic sanctions intended to impact the Cuban 
 
 government also hurt business people here.
 
Making it all but impossible for them to access the U.S. banking system or receive financing. The U.S.'s top diplomat in Havana says the Biden 
 
 administration is studying if sanctions can be eased for Cuban entrepreneurs.
 
BENJAMIN ZIFF, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES AT U.S. EMBASSY IN HAVANA: -- there's a shortage of food, there's a shortage of gas, shortage of water. The Cuban 
 
 state economy is no longer able to provide for its people. And the answer to that is not a necessary evil private sector it is more better, more 
 
 empowered private sector.
 
OPPMANN (voice over): So far, the U.S. Embassy in Havana says about 200 entrepreneurs have taken this boot camp and the hope is that they can move 
 
 beyond the decades of hostility between the U.S. and Cuba to not only transform their lives, but their country. Patrick Oppmann, CNN Havana.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Now the dazzling Cote d'Azur conjures up images of fabulous frippery yachts, designer clothes and permutations. In fact, it sounds a 
 
 little bit like Richard Quest to me, and he was there too, apparently for work. He says, watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is amongst the most spectacular, expensive and desired destinations in the world. The Cote 
 
 d'Azur, this is where the Alps meets the Mediterranean and here, they do things all a little grander, a place where to be sure, the rich and famous 
 
 are on Davao where celebrities start the Cannes Film Festival red carpet.
 
And billionaires preen on their mega yachts. If you want to drink it's a martini. And it must be shaken not stirred preferably but the Monte Carlo 
 
 Casino.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know that's not half bad.
 
QUEST (on camera): I don't want to overstate it but the thing about Nice, is it is a little less snobby than the other places on the Cote d'Azur, 
 
 then can Saint-Tropez and certainly about Monte Carlo. This is a city with a downtown, an old town a new town, different areas, different feelings, 
 
 different moods, nice, as they say, is different.
 
QUEST (voice over): For more than two centuries, Kings and Queens have made the good dizzier their summer home. Intellectuals and artists have argued 
 
 their way round the core niche. Pablo Picasso was a favorite, Rock 'n' roll royalty like, The Rolling Stones. Ballet moved here in 1971 to avoid 
 
 British taxes.
 
They recorded Exile on Main Street in the basement of the Nellcote villa. Millions of people come here to enjoy the unique experience of the South of 
 
 France.
 
QUEST (on camera): The Cote d'Azur is amongst the most desirable seaside settings in the world, which is interesting because the beach itself at 
 
 Nice is far from perfect.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
It is all pebbles and rocks at least the public parties but then you get to the private beaches where for the right price, a deck chair and umbrella 
 
 and a perfect view is --
 
QUEST (voice over): Here I couldn't watch one of the great holiday destinations come to life. Oh, yes. Nice is so nice.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Tough job. And finally on "First Move", up raw in Germany. That's the biggest hint you're getting now. Just watch this. What do you 
 
 think it is? This -- was briefly caught on camera on the southern edge of Berlin and yes, it seems that a suspected lion is on the loose. Police are 
 
 urging people to stay indoors for their safety.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL GRUBERT, MAYOR OF KLEINMACHNOW GERMANY: As of 1310 I can inform you that the lioness has not yet been cited. This means that our measures here 
 
 and climate show are still running at full speed at the moment. We're searching together, the police and also other forces are trying to find the 
 
 lioness.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Now, apparently the police say no zoos have even reported a missing lion. I hope that keeper wasn't breakfast on the way out, joking. 
 
 That's it for the show. "Connect the World" is up next. We'll see you tomorrow.
