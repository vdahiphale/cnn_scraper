PAULA NEWTON, CNN HOST:  Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I am Paula Newton. Ahead right here on "CNN Newsroom," U.S. President Joe Biden heads to Poland to marks the one-year anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine. What his visit signals to Russia and China. 
 
And in this hour, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to meet with Turkey's officials as the country recovers from that devastating earthquake. 
 
Plus, North Korea carries out another missile test, this time launching two ballistic missiles into the sea. We are live in Seoul. 
 
And we are nearing the one-year mark in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and U.S. President Joe Biden plans to mark that grim anniversary in Poland. Now, Mr. Biden is set to travel to the Polish capital in the day ahead where he will meet with his Polish counterpart and speak Tuesday at the Royal Castle of Warsaw. 
 
The president is expected to express continued U.S. support for Ukraine as fierce fighting continues to rage on the front lines. And of course, right now, there seems to be no end in sight. The president's visit comes on the heels of the Munich Security Conference where Vice President Kamala Harris said the U.S. has determined that Russia has, in fact, committed war crimes against humanity in Ukraine. The Polish prime minister explained what he is expecting from Mr. Biden's visit. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, POLISH PRIME MINISTER:  We have to change the paradigm and we have to say Ukraine must win and Russia must be defeated. And I believe that the words of President Biden will reassure all Europe that the United States is with us in this fight for freedom and peace. 
 
(END VIDO CLIP) NEWTON:  So, meantime the U.S. believes China might provide military support to Russia amid its continued invasion of Ukraine. During the meeting with China's top diplomat, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he warned Wang Yi of consequences if this should happen. U.S. ambassador to the U.N. echoed those sentiments. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  If there are any thoughts and efforts by the Chinese and others to provide lethal support to the Russians and their brutal attack against Ukraine, that that is unacceptable. Again, that would be a red line. 
 
We made clear to the Chinese that there will be consequences should they make that unfortunate decision. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  So, Blinken also said that Chinese companies have already been providing nonlethal support to Moscow. Wang is expected to visit Moscow, in fact, and the first visit from a Chinese official to Russia since the start of this war. For more on all this, I'm joined by CNN Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang, but first we want to go to our Clare Sebastian who is standing by for us in London. 
 
And Clare, what is Biden hoping to achieve with this trip given everything we just laid out. You know, obviously, it will be very symbolic, but what will he bring to the table and how is Russia likely to view it? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, this, Paula, is clearly about reaffirming U.S. leadership and this transatlantic alliance that we have really seen as material to Ukraine, holding off a Russian victory thus far. So, they'll be looking to reaffirm that. Of course, coming off the back of both Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Europe last week. 
 
Yes, it will be messaging, yes it will be optics. Ukraine is clearly looking for some concrete action and, in that respect, U.S. leadership has been material. For example, we saw with the whole tank issue that Germany was unwilling to offer its own tanks until the U.S. had done the same. So, the U.S. not only by far the biggest donor to Ukraine in absolute terms, but also a key catalyst for other donors.
 
So that is important, I think in terms of messaging at home. Biden will be looking to provide evidence that the almost $50 billion that the U.S. has committed so far has not been in vain although the war is still ongoing. We heard him about 11 months ago also in Poland saying that Russia's invasion had, in a sense, backfired because it had led to a sort of reinvigorating, he called it, of the world's democracy. So, we may hear more of that kind of messaging as well.
 
I think there is a regional threat to talk about. We're hearing a lot about Moldova. Ukraine and Moldova warning about potential Russian plots there. He'll be meeting with the Bucharest nine, a part of NATO that goes along the eastern flank of NATO, along Russia's western border. 
 <br>[02:05:00]
 
Of course, they are reaffirming U.S. leadership there. In terms of how Russia will see it, we're going to see some counter programming. President Putin also set to give a big speech on Tuesday, and I think this will be presented as more evidence as Russia continues to say, of U.S. direct involvement, NATO direct involvement in the conflict. We just heard the Russian ambassador to Washington say that Vice President Kamala Harris's conclusion, accusing Russia of crimes against humanity was, quote, "an excuse to escalate the war." So, we'll see more of the same, I think, from Moscow. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, definitely a lot on the table as well in terms of that unity that you just talked about allies. But you made an important point, Clare, right, that even in U.S. politics, Biden will be looking to send a clear message to people who might be wavering at this point. 
 
Stephen, to you now, and I know you're watching closely what kind of Chinese reaction we might get in the coming hours, but we did have a sit down between both China and the U.S.'s top diplomat. There was pointed language. And specifically, I want to ask you how is China reacting to the U.S. and its warning, its very stark warning, do not arm Russia through this conflict? 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF:  Yeah, Paula, they may be responding very soon given the foreign ministries daily press briefing is ongoing right now. But they have offered some clue in the readout on that Blinken-Wang Yi meeting in Munich over the weekend, basically saying they do not accept the U.S., quote/unquote "finger-pointing and coercion" on the (inaudible) issue because their relations with Russia are bilateral sovereign matters. 
 
Now, this kind of language may not be strange, but the timing of this revelation from the U.S., of course, is very interesting because Wang Yi it's actually going to Moscow after Munich to meet with senior Russian officials and likely Putin himself on the eve of the anniversary of the war. 
 
And according to Russian media, paving the way for Xi Jinping to go to Moscow later this year. So, that's why it's clear the U.S. is increasingly frustrated with China's role in this conflict and they're trying to turn up the heat on Beijing because despite Beijing's public pledge of quote/unquote "neutrality," what's been happening in the past year of course is China and Russia are growing closer, both politically, but especially economically with bilateral trade, for example soaring to a new height. 
 
And that's part of the reason why Blinken mentioned from day one that U.S. had been concerned about China helping Russia dodge severe western sanctions. And now, of course, this new assessment which also comes on the heels of that spy balloon saga and that fallout, obviously, is going to make things even more difficult for China to be willing to work with the U.S. on the Ukraine issue. 
 
But interestingly, Wang Yi also met with his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich and at least publicly saying China still respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the reality of course is Chinese state media still refuses to call this Russian military campaign an invasion, not to mention Xi and Putin have talked on the phone and in-person multiple times in the past two years, whereas Xi has yet to talk to Zelenskyy even once. 
 
So, all of that is (inaudible) despite all the public posturing, it's clear Beijing is sticking to Russia despite the growing isolation of Moscow on the global stage. And that's why all the assertions that Beijing made about them being the only peacemaker, just rings very hollow to many people. Paula? 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. And as you said, we continue to await perhaps more response there as the foreign minister gives its updates. Steven Jiang for us in Beijing, and our thanks as well to Clare Sebastian in London. Appreciate it. 
 
Now, tensions are escalating at the same time in the Korean Peninsula as North Korea launched two more ballistic missiles Monday morning. Pyongyang says the tests are in response to the joint military drills held by the U.S. and South Korea. Now, in a statement, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's sister said that Beijing (ph) the presence of U.S. forces in the region a threat and would take corresponding measures. The United Nations have strongly condemned the launch. 
 
For more now, we go to CNN's Paula Hancock and she joins me now live from Seoul. And Paula, as you've reminded us many times, right, when these drills are going on, North Korea flexes its muscles as well. But what are these latest missile launches tell us about North Korea's capabilities at this hour? 
 
PAULA HANCOCK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Paula, the interesting one to look at really is what happened on Saturday. So, over the weekend, North Korea fired a missile and then on Sunday they said that it was an intercontinental ballistic missile, which they have in the past claimed can hit mainland United States. But specifically, Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the North Korean leader said that it has approved that they have at the missile re-entry technology, which they have been trying to achieve. 
 
Now of course, it's impossible to tell independently whether or not that is accurate, that is what Pyongyang is claiming at this point. So that it's really the missile that we should be looking at, at this point, and it's a technology and a capability that is part of this five-year plan, the military monetization plan that Kim Jong-un annexed a couple of years ago. 
 <br>[02:10:00]
 
And one by one, he is working his way through that military wish list. So, what we saw on Sunday was a response from the U.S. and South Korean air forces. We saw a B-1 bomber coming over the Korean Peninsula when it was also escorted by South Korean fighter jets as well. 
 
And then this morning, this Monday morning local time, we saw another launch from North Korea, this time two launches, two missiles, according to the South Korean and Japanese side and North Korea itself, said that it was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise, and it was to show their displeasure saying it is also a means of tactical nuclear attack. 
 
So, the past couple of days has really been tit-for-tat, but certainly that is a significant launch that we saw on Saturday. Now, it's not likely to ease these tensions and potential tit-for-tat retaliation in the coming days or weeks because we know that this week at the Pentagon there is a nuclear table top drill that's happening between the U.S. and the South Korean side.
 
It's very likely to irritate Pyongyang and there could well be some kind of response to that. And then also next month, we have far bigger joint military drills here on the Korean Peninsula. Paula? 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. Certainly, very active right now with North Korea trying to send its own messages as these military drills are going on. Paula Hancocks for us in Seoul, appreciate it. 
 
Still to come here for us, prayers are continuing to pour in for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who is now in hospice care, including from current president, Joe Biden. Details from the White House after the break. 
 
Plus, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is calling for accountability following the Ohio train derailment that is raising concerns about the environment. We'll have that up next as well. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:15:00]
 
NEWTON:  Americans across the country are praying for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter after the news about his declining health. The 98-year-old is now receiving hospice care at home. He is surrounded by his family, but he is now decided that he will forego further medical treatment. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has more now from the White House. 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  President Joe Biden sent love and prayer to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who has begun to receive hospice care according to an announcement from the Carter Center. In a tweet over the weekend, President Biden said, quote, "We admire you for the strength and humility you have shown in difficult times. May you continue your journey with grace and dignity and God grant you peace."
 
Now, President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter have a long-standing relationship dating back to Biden's time as a young senator when he endorsed them Governor Carter for president. The two last saw each other in 2021 when President Biden visited him at his home and the two according to Biden at that time, talked about the old days.
 
Now, Jimmy Carter is the oldest living former president at the age of 98 years old. He's kept a low profile especially over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, but has still spoken about the risk to democracy and has been a champion for human rights. And over the weekend, after the announcement from the Carte Center that he has begun receiving hospice care, received outpouring support from lawmakers. 
 
Now, the president has been advised of Carter's declining health and has been in touch with the Carte family, which is seeking privacy at this time. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House.
 
NEWTON:  Now, I'm sure many of you are curious about what hospice care will actually mean for Mr. Carter going forward. Here's how one doctor explained it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN:  So, what is hospice? Basically, you are eligible for hospice if your physician thinks that you are in the last six months of your life. You can enter hospice for any other number of reasons, cancer, dementia, heart failure, or many, many other diagnoses. And what it means when you enter a hospice is that you're going to be focusing on managing your symptoms, pain, shortness of breath, other physical symptoms, but also focusing on managing your emotional and spiritual needs.
 
What folks find when they enter hospice is that they do have a health care provider who is dedicated to managing medications. They also might have access to physical therapy, or occupational therapy, to home health aides, people who are dedicated to making sure that they get to spend the last weeks, or months of their life the way that they want. 
 
One additional detail about hospice that most people don't know, is that it's not necessarily permanent. If you decide that you do want to go back and try to get curative treatment, if they are no treatments available, or something changes in your personal or family situation, you are not stuck with it forever. But for those who do enter hospice, they find that it makes those final weeks or months so much more pleasant.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON:  Now, we did hear from the Carter Center and they said in a statement that the former U.S. president decided to spend his remaining time at home and with his family, and that was after a series of hospital stays.
 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is calling for accountability from the Norfolk Southern Rail company and demanding stronger rail safety measures after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio two weeks ago. Buttigieg raised his concerns in a letter with the company's CEO on Sunday, this as concerns remain that the quality of the air and the water in the area, residents have been concerned.
 
In fact, a resident who lives near the crash site shared this video. You're seeing it now with CNN. It shows clouds bubble on the water surface in a creek located near East Palestine. And that's not the only video residents have been posting.
 
Meantime, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says the air and water in East Palestine is in fact safe, but saying that, look, everyone understands the resident's concerns. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:19:56]
 
SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH):  They are right to be skeptical. The EPA administrator when I was there, both the state and the federal EPA administrators said that. But when you return to your home, we think the water is safe, but when you return to your home, you should be tested again for your water and your soil and your air, not to mention those that have their own wells. 
 
Then, they don't invest in safety rules and safety regulations and this kind of things happens. That's why people in East Palestine are so upset. They know that corporate lobbyist have had far too much influence in our government and they see this as the result. This kind of thing should not happen. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  Senator Brown there speaking on CNN "State of the Union" Sunday. Now, a dramatic escape took place at a New Jersey gas station earlier this month. That's where a New Mexico's woman terrifying year- long abduction ordeal came to a dramatic end with help of the station's owners. CNN's Polo Sandoval has the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  It was a dramatic end to what police described as a nearly year-long cross-country kidnapping. The woman seen running into this New Jersey service station in early February is escaping her suspected captor who is close behind, a man later identified as James Parrillo, Jr. 
 
The year-long ordeal started in New Mexico where the couple first met last February. The woman says she agreed to give Parrillo a ride to Arizona. They eventually made their way to California where she says the relationship took a violent turn. That's where police say Parrillo physically assaulted the woman taking away her phone and debit cards.
 
Eventually the pair made their way cross-country in what New Jersey state police describe as a year-long nightmare. Cameras inside the store captured the moment the bare-footed woman deadbolts the door preventing her alleged kidnapper from entering.
 
BOBBY MADAAN, GAS STATION OWNER:  You can hear her screaming like, I've been kidnaped. 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  Bobby Madaan is the owner of the service station. He remembers the frantic look of the woman desperate to get away. That lady was really scared like she was really scared. She's looking
 
 at the back wall in the office thinking that he's going to come through the back door or break the door to come in. I told her -- I just reassured her that you're fine. You're safe. Those doors locked. Nobody is coming in and the police is on their way. And she just kept repeating that, you know, he's kept me against my will. And eventually the state troopers did get there. 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  New Jersey state police are looking into the possibility that Parrillo may have held other women against their will in the past. He's already been charged with kidnapping and aggravated assault in connection with what police say was a heroic escape. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANDOVAL (on camera):  New Jersey State authorities actively reaching out to investigators and other jurisdictions as well hoping to make contact with anybody who may have known Parrillo. Meanwhile, CNN did reach out to his attorney and we have not immediately heard back. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York. 
 
NEWTON:  Police are investigating the murder of a catholic bishop in Los Angeles. Auxiliary Bishop David O'Connell was found shot to death at a home in the Hacienda Heights area on Saturday afternoon. The local archbishop said O'Connell had been a priest and bishop in Los Angeles for some 45 years and described him as a peacemaker with a heart with the poor and immigrants. 
 
Okay, still ahead for us this hour, the top U.S. diplomat visits Turkey after it was ravaged by that powerful earthquake. Details on his pledge to help the region with more American aid. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
NEWTON:  Welcome back to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton and you're watching "CNN Newsroom." Now, any moment now, the U.S. Secretary of State and his Turkish counterpart will deliver remarks after they held talks on the devastating earthquake in Turkey. It comes a day after Antony Blinken announced an additional $100 million in disaster relief from both Turkey and neighboring Syria. 
 
Now on Sunday, the top U.S. diplomat surveyed the earthquake damage and some of Turkey's worst hit areas. He said the rebuilding process would be difficult, but that America will be there to help. Blinken also met with Syria's White Helmets to discuss their rescue efforts in the rebel-held northwest and thanked them for their extraordinary work. CNN's Nada Bashir has been following all this now and she's in the southern city of Adana, Turkey. And Nada, good to have you there on the ground.
 
Blinken is set to speak in just a little while. In terms of what's going on though, it is sad, isn't it, Nada, to realize that at this point in time those rescue efforts are coming to a close? NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  They certainly are, Paula. And you know,
 
 for the last two weeks it has been miraculous to still see survivors being pulled from the rubble, but the window for finding survivors is certainly closing. AS we've heard from the Turkish authorities, search and rescue operations are only continuing in two of the 11 affected provinces. So that gives you a sense of where this is heading. 
 
Now, the focus is shifting to providing support for those who did survive, of course thousands and thousands of people across southeast Turkey, not only lost their loved ones, but have been left homeless and left with absolutely nothing. And we have seen this huge groundswell of support, not only here in Turkey but across the globe from the international community. 
 
And as you mentioned there, Secretary Blinken has been touring those affected areas with the Turkish foreign minister announcing that stepping up of funding by the U.S. government, $50 million in refugee migration assistance, another $50 million in humanitarian assistance. That brings the total amount of U.S. funding thus far in response to the effort to around $185 million. 
 
Meanwhile, the United Nations itself is also appealing for further funding from the international community. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that now is a time for the world to stand behind Turkey, appealing for $1 billion in aid over the next three months. That follows an appeal for northwest Syria of nearly $400 million. And of course, the need here is great. It is a huge challenge not only for the Turkish government, but for those who have lost so much to come to terms with.
 
And there is going to be a huge infrastructural challenge ahead. The Turkish government itself has committed to rebuilding the affected areas within a year. That is a huge feat to overcome and they already plan underway to rebuild some 30,000 departments from March in some of these affected areas. 
 
But as we've seen in the southeast right now, many families are living in IDP camps. There have been tents brought in by the United Nations, by other international partners, and this is going to be a long process for Turkey.
 <br>[02:30:02] 
 
We're already seeing families -- we're already seeing families being evacuated to other parts of the country including in Istanbul where we were able to meet some of those families as well. But the loss here is hard to grasp, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes. And when we talk about marshaling resources to actually try and rebuild as you just said, the Turkish government continues to give that timeline. But as I know of, you've been looking at this in the last few days. They will then have to ensure that these new buildings are in fact, earthquake proof in a fashion because so many allegations persist that this was shoddy building?
 
GOLD: Yes, absolutely. I'd say there has been a growing sense of frustration, even anger, here in Turkey, among some who feel that there was not enough done by the government to prepare for a catastrophe like this, that there should have been more safety measures in place that aid didn't get to those in need quickly enough. And as you mentioned then, the question of this building codes, whether they were properly implemented, whether they were followed.
 
And the Turkish government has said it is carrying out investigations into this. More than 200 public prosecutors have been appointed to oversee that investigation processes. So far, at least 400 people within the construction industry identified as potential suspects in relation to allegations of construction, negligence. At least 120 people, according to state media have been arrested thus far.
 
And this is going to take weeks, if not months for the process to be followed through. But of course, this is something that the Turkish government is really pushing for. They said this investigation is part of that process of seeking accountability following the outbreak. And let's not forget, there are elections upcoming and this could have a significant impact on President Erdogan's popularity as well.
 
Some questions as to whether or not the government had an adequate response, whether aid, whether search and rescue teams got to the affected areas quickly enough. And as people begin to grapple with laws, begin to really see the reality --
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
NEWTON: I'm just going to -- I'm just going to --
 
GOLD: -- devastation across the southeast.
 
NEWTON: I'm going to stop you there. I think we do have now that live press conference. Let's listen in.
 
MEVLUT CAVUSOGLU, PRIME MINISTER OF TURKEY (through translator): Many U.S. institutions and enterprises are actually providing humanitarian assistance activities in this area. And many individuals and many institutions in the USA is -- some -- companies and my distinguished friend met with some of them, as well as NGOs, are providing assistance and are organizing assistance campaigns.
 
And we are grateful for the support both to the U.S. administration, as well as to the people of the United States of America. We would like to thank them before the solidarity and support they have extended in these dire days. Distinguished members of the press, we have an extensive agenda with USA. And we met in Washington with my distinguished counterpart a month ago for the strategic mechanism meeting.
 
And we agreed that we should have been meetings twice on an annual basis. And we would like to conduct the second meeting in the second half of this year. For the rich, the professions are ongoing. Our common aim is actually to increase the opportunities existing in our relations, as well as turning these into concrete gains, and also effectively managed the problems and the issues raising. And of course, this is the main philosophy behind the strategic mechanism. Economy and trade is actually one of the pioneering items of the positive agenda. Last year, the trade volume reached $32 billion. And we would like to continue working to reach the $100 billion for target. The mutual investments are increasing military relations are an important dimension of our strategic partnership.
 
But of course, due to unilateral sanctions, the cooperation in the field of defense industry is facing difficulties. And we need to overcome these difficulties and the sanctions. We expect them to be lifted in the earliest opportunity. We also review today's status quo pertaining to our F16 request. And we discuss this with our colleagues. The U.S. administration strongly supports our request. We're thankful for the support.
 
And the official notification if it's on to the Congress in the earliest opportunity and the ratification process is completed at the earliest opportunity possible is going to be benefiting for both sides. Of course, there could be difficulties arising in the U.S. Congress. But the delays or the obstruction by certain circuits in this process should not be allowed. The U.S. Congress should not be obstructing and rather undertaking a role of support.
 
Of course, meeting this request is important in terms of our bilateral relations, but it's also important in terms of the NATO defense capabilities. And of course, in the dialogue with the U.S. Congress, the U.S. administration have really underlined the fact.
 <br>[02:35:01]
 
Of course, the fighting against terrorism, counterterrorism is amongst the items of our joint agenda. We have certain expectations pertaining to the support to render to 2 PKK/YPG and the ending of the existence of (INAUDIBLE) and we have once again underlined our expectations, and the U.S. side is aware of this. There were certain issues of consular matters, which we undertook during the meeting today with our colleagues.
 
Especially the visa application processes, there are serious delays. There was -- there's some acceleration at one point, but there is now a waiting period up to six months and we extended our request for the acceleration, and of course, are in relation to security threats. We do believe that we should have a coordination and cooperation with respect to such declarations, and warnings and security.
 
During our meetings, we discuss also the international and regional issues. In addition to bilateral matters, we talked about the southern purposes. And the recent periods, both me and my distinguished friend, Tony have contracted both the Azerbaijan as well as the Armenian side. Our aim is to have a stable peace and stability in southern purposes. And we will continue to strive to this end.
 
In relation to the expansion of NATO which was another matter that we discussed. We underlined once again, our expectations from the two candidate members to NATO. In the coming period, the permanent standing committee meeting is going to take place, which is going to take place in Brussels and NATO. And our colleagues will discuss which steps have been taken and which steps are not being taken, or together with their colleagues from NATO and also participating countries.
 
This will give us an opportunity and transparently identify this issue. We also discussed the Israel and Palestine issue. We're worried about some of the steps that have been taken, especially in the illegal settlements. And also, the steps that have been taken needs to be finalized. The declarations of the United States side, so we do believe are very positive. We also discussed the issue of Syria.
 
And we discussed the issue of systems that is going to be provided to Syrian people following the earthquake. And we also had an opportunity to bilaterally discuss these issues. I would like to thank you for this very open and frank and productive meeting into my distinguished counterpart. And I would also like to thank them for siding with us and supporting us during these difficult times.
 
And thank you for your visit my distinguished friend, the floor is yours.
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: Mevlut, my friend, thank you very, very much. This has been an important opportunity to visit our Turkish allies and friends in a moment of real need and to bring a clear message from President Biden and from the American people. The United States is here to support you and your time of need. And we will be by your side for as long as it takes to recover and to rebuild.
 
Yesterday, as my first stop on this trip, I visited Incirlik Air Base, which, as you know, is the hub of the United States efforts to support the disaster response. With the foreign minister, with Mevlut, I had the opportunity to fly over Hatay province to look at some of the devastation firsthand. And as I said yesterday, it's hard to put into words, countless buildings, communities, streets, damaged or fully destroyed.
 
I met with a number of the responders, U.S. military officials, our team from the U.S. Agency for International Development, members of the incredible American Disaster Assistance Response Team, search and rescue teams from Los Angeles on one coast to Fairfax County, Virginia on the other where I live. Our White House with partners in Syria. All of them have seen the staggering toll of this catastrophe.
 
All of them are committed to being there for our friends in this moment. We began our own assistance to the rescue and relief efforts within hours of the first quake. When President Biden directed the heads of our federal agencies to rapidly mobilize to assist the government of Turkiye and our humanitarian response partners in Syria. We have said hundreds of U.S. government personnel to the region, including the Disaster Assistance Response and search and rescue teams.
 
And also, emergency managers, paramedics, hazardous materials technicians, and engineers. We've spent approximately 1.8 million pounds of relief supplies for survivors, shelter, kitchen sets, blankets, hygiene kits and more and more is on the way. [02:40:08]
 
We're continuing to announce additional assistance, new funding to support these efforts. Yesterday, I announced an additional $100 million from United States on top of the $85 million we've already provided. The American people, communities and businesses, as Mevlut said, have seen the heartbreaking images. And they have been standing up too. We have nearly $80 million in donations from the private sector in the United States, individuals.
 
When I visited the Turkish Embassy in Washington, I almost couldn't get in the front door because boxes were piled high throughout the driveway to the embassy. Now, Turkey faces a long road ahead to support those rendered homeless and to rebuild. The U.N. Secretary General has put out a very important urgent appeal for $1 billion for long-term assistance. And we're committed to providing support.
 
Just as allies and partners show up for each other in our darkest hours. We also stand side by side in confronting common security challenges. And that's certainly been true in our response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Turkey's clear voice in support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity has been critical. Its diplomatic leadership. The Foreign Minister's personal role in brokering the U.N. Black Sea Grain Initiative has been critical and critical to making sure that food and food products could get to people in need around the world, including many people in low-income countries.
 
It's continued implementation of the mantra convection, deterred naval escalation in the Black Sea, and help protect Ukraine's coastline. Turkey's humanitarian economic support for Ukraine, providing initial safe haven for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian onslaught. Supplying hundreds of generators for cities and blackouts, as Russia continues to attack the electricity grid that has saved lives in Ukraine.
 
And its position as a key energy transit hub has bolstered energy security, bringing alternative natural gas supplies, international LNG as well as Caspian Sea gas to Europe. The United States greatly values Turkey's contributions as a long standing and active member of the NATO alliance, and will keep working together to strengthen and grow our lines, including through the session of Sweden and Finland, which will help deliver even stronger and more capable assets to the alliance.
 
Turkey the United States are also partnering to fight global terrorism, and to advance peace in the Balkans in the Caucasus and other global hotspots. We very much appreciate the positive steps that Turkey is taking to improve relations with Greece, with Armenia, with Israel, whose citizens, by the way, have been working side by side with their colleague's (INAUDIBLE) in response to the earthquake.
 
And we're committed to maintaining our very close defense cooperation, including by ensuring that Turkey remains a highly capable airpower contributor within the NATO alliance. We're focused on expanding the robust trade, investment and economic cooperation between our countries as Mevlut revolute said, we've had a very good year last year. Trade exceeded a record $30 billion.
 
We're going to build on that foundation to pursue new opportunities, particularly in the renewable sector. Turkeys invested over $16 billion in renewables over the last five years, and is pursuing ambitious goals to increase capacity over the next five years. We look forward to setting up a climate and energy dialogue to accelerate these efforts, while also creating jobs and inclusive economic growth for both of our countries.
 
Beyond the shared interests, United States and Turkey have a relationship that is built on shared values, either democracy, respect for basic universal freedoms, for human rights. And today we had an opportunity to discuss those principles, as we always do in our conversations. And like all good friends, I had states in Turkey do not agree on every issue. But like good friends (INAUDIBLE) a partnership that has withstood extraordinary change, and some significant challenges and will continue to do so particularly because we're able to speak so directly and candidly to each other.
 
Later today, I'll have the privilege of visiting the Anitkabir, the resting place of the founder of the Turkish Republic. In the heart of our own capital, stands a monument to one of our own great independence leaders and founders, George Washington. 170 years ago, when the Washington Monument was being constructed, Sultan Abdulmejid sent a marble plaque to be placed on the obelisk.
 
And the words on that stone were inscribed by the same calligrapher whose workplaces (INAUDIBLE) his message can still be made out 170 years later in support of eternal friendship. Today, that commitment not only endures but continues to grow and to flourish as I convinced it will for generations.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ajam Tuplar (ph) from (INAUDIBLE) T.V. This is going to be question to both ministers. Minister Cavusoglu mentioned this during his remarks. The sales of F-16 fighter aircraft to Turkey, you indicated that the U.S. administration supports that. But this process in the Congress is not clear. When we expect a push notification to do that? And is there an expectation that there will be an obstruction? Because we know that certain senators have written to President Biden.
 
And in addition to this, for Turkey, there is one billion payment that has been made for F-35? What is the last situation and the status quo and this payment?
 
BLINKEN: Thank you very much for the question. With regard to the F- 16s, the Biden administration strongly supports the package to both upgrade the existing F-16s and to provide new ones to Turkiye because as a NATO ally and partner, it is in our national interest in the security interest of the alliance that Turkey continue to be able to operate at the highest standards of NATO to make sure that we have full interoperability.
 
On this particular matter, I can't offer you an assessment or get into the process until after we formally notify our Congress. But it's something that we were working on. And we've made very clear to Congress our strong support for the F-16 modernization. We have long- standing defense and security ties. And as the President has said, as President Biden has said, Turkish NATO interoperability remains a priority for us.
 
CAVUSOGLU: Thank you very much. As I mentioned during my remarks, we clearly stated our expectations pertaining to the F-16. There is a will on the U.S. administration side. And we are aware of certain letters that have been written by some circles and some senators. On one hand, we are working on this in terms of delegations, technical delegations. And if the U.S. administration has firm stance, and if we work together, we believe that we can overcome this resistance that might exist.
 
These are two independent issues especially pertaining to states becoming full member to NATO. It will be the precondition of the purchase of F-16. These are not related issues that they are different negotiations for both two sides and reason MOU that has been signed, trilateral MOU. So, it will not be corrected to put this as a precondition. Or of course, it will not be possible for us to purchase F-16 with certain conditions, our hands should not be tight.
 
So, we should have a common stance as the administration of Turkiye and administration of U.S., this is critical. On the issue of the F- 35, we were a partner to the F-35. And because of the hot sanctions, Turkiye was taken out of this partnership, this was a unilateral decision. It wasn't our decision. There is a payment that we have made $1.4 billion. And if Turkiye is not in the program, of course, expecting that this money is to be paid back to us is only natural and negotiations are continuing on.
 
This on 18th of January, when we met with my counterpart in Washington, D.C. The experts also discussed the issue of F-35 on the same day, and of course, it will be beneficial to reach a conclusion to this ASAP.
 
HUMEYRA PAMUK, REUTERS CORRESPONDENT (through translator): Thank you. Reuters Humeyra Pamuk. Minister, the relations between Turkey and US have been continuing in a negative way that there are differences of opinions. The (INAUDIBLE) F-16s, Sweden and Finland are also on the issue of earthquake. You have indicated that there is strong solidarity. Do you believe that that this tragedy that we experienced will be an occasion for a new page in the relations between two countries?
 
NATO countries and the U.S. is -- are expecting Turkey to ratify the membership application of both Sweden and Finland before the new summit, will Turkey be able to meet this requirement?
 
Ties between your two countries have been in a bad place. You yourself describe Turkey in your confirmation hearing two years ago at the so- called ally but I wonder if the experience of the earthquake has created an opportunity for a reset between the two countries.
 <br>[02:50:08] And the follow up to my colleague's question on the F-16. You just said you can't assess the timeline for the formal notification. What exactly is the United States waiting for? Are you waiting for Turkey to approve the Nordic expansion? And what will you do to convince the U.S. Congress to be on board? Thank you.
 
BLINKEN: (INAUDIBLE) 
 
CAVUSOGLU (through translator): Thank you very much. Of course, the solidarity that has been extended during difficult times always have a positive effect on relations and it contributes to those relations. We might have differences of opinions with the United States of America. And these issues are clear, but the positive agenda and focusing on the positive agenda and there is also will to develop our relations further.
 
Therefore, during the meeting in Rome, President Biden and President Erdogan discussed the establishment of the strategic mechanism. The aim behind this, as I have mentioned that the philosophy behind this is to focus on the positive agenda and develop relations on a bilateral basis and different platforms. Increase cooperation in regional and global issues. The second aim is actually to discuss the existing problems and discuss how these problems could be resolved and take steps accordingly.
 
In this direction, both at expert level and at the ministerial level, we met twice. And I do believe that such meetings have been very beneficial. When Foreign Minister of Greece visited our country as I said, during the press meeting, for developing relations or for resolving existing problems, we should not wait for disasters take place and we should take sincere and concrete steps in this direction.
 
The membership of Sweden and Finland, if you follow for the declarations on our side, and I do know that U.S. following this closely, we have a trilateral memorandum of understanding between these three countries. And it's very clear as to what steps needed to be taken by which side. Relatively our problems with Finland are less. So, the calendar that you have shared with respect to the NATO summit in the news, these are tied in relation to the steps that are to be taken by Sweden.
 
There have been some positive messages, there have been legislative amendments and constitutional amendments undertaken by the Swedish side. But unfortunately, the PKK supporters and also in relation to financing of terrorism, the records for terrorism, as well as the terrorist propaganda, all activities are continuing. And these are taking place in the center of Stockholm, in front of the city building.
 
And they are trying to eliminate Sweden's membership to NATO. But of course, it's up to Sweden to take relevant measures to eliminate such activities. We saw the sincere efforts of the prime minister. And he also had an opportunity to see the stance of all political parties in our parliament. This is just a matter of the government's position. So, the pastor and the better, the Swedish side takes the steps, it would -- they take steps that will convince our parliament and our people, then we will take the relevant steps as well.
 
Of course, on the issue of Finland we have indicated that there should be a different methodology followed. This was the message that our president shared with the Secretary General of NATO last week. Here we are -- especially waiting for the Swedish society to take concrete steps and everybody should support Sweden to take these concrete steps. Thank you.
 
BLINKEN: Humeyra, thank you. I don't share the premise of the question about the nature of our status of our relationship as I laid out in my opening statement. Turkey and the United States, we're working closely together across multiple fronts, whether it's in our bilateral relationship, whether it's in the region, you're broadly or for that matter around the world, and it's a partnership that we greatly value.
 
With regard to the F-16s, I can't give you a timeline on formal notification. What I can tell you is I've already been actively engaged in speaking to Congress about the administration's strong support for the F-16 package. The upgrade modernization package. And I have shared again, our view that this is very important for ongoing NATO interoperability and in the national security interest of the United States.
 <br>[02:55:12]
 
The matter of Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO is not a bilateral issue. Of course, as you know well, we strongly support air admission as quickly as possible. Both our members already and NATO's partnership for peace, NATO's enhance opportunity partnership. Their military's work seamlessly with the rest of alliance. We're confident that NATO formally welcome them in soon.
 
And when that happens, it will enhance the security of every NATO member including the United State, including Turkiye. Finland and Sweden have already taken concrete steps to fulfill the commitments that they've made under the trilateral memorandum of agreement that they signed with Turkey on the margins of the NATO summit in Madrid. We welcome and appreciate those steps. I think they're quite significant.
 
REID: And we are just wrapping up there a press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It is his first visit to Turkey as Secretary of State. And I don't have to remind you, it comes at this really crucial time for Turkey as they have suffered such a devastating loss during this earthquake. Of course, Secretary of State there saying that they stand by Turkey for "as long as it takes."
 
But I have to point out, this is a very complicated relationship with somebody who was a NATO ally and also plays a crucial role as this conflict between Ukraine and Russia continues. There have been some contentious points that they both went at pains to try and smooth it over. And that includes in fact, whether or not Turkey will quickly approve Sweden and Finland joining NATO. A lot of other continued contentious issues there on the ground which we will continue to cover here at CNN. I want to thank you though, for right now for spending part of your day with me. I'm Paula Newton. But stay with us. As I said, so much news ahead. CNN NEWSROOM continues now with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo after a short break.
