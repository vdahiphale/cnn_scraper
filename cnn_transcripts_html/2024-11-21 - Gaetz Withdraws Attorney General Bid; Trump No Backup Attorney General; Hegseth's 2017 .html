THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[18:00:00]
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. Chad Myers, thanks so much. And you can follow me on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, formerly known as 
 
 Twitter, and on the TikTok, @jaketapper, you can also follow the show on X, @TheLeadCNN. If you ever miss an episode of The Lead, you can listen to the 
 
 show, all two hours of it, whence you get your podcasts. The news continues on CNN, with one Mr. Wolf Blitzer, in The Situation Room. I'll see you 
 
 tomorrow.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE:  It's 7:00 a.m. in Shanghai, 10:00 a.m. in Sydney, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. 
 
 And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome to "First Move." And here's today's need to know. Gaetz, gone. The former congressman no longer in the running for U.S. attorney 
 
 general after acknowledging he'd become a, quote, "distraction." Dangerous precedent. Israel rejecting the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant 
 
 for Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of war crimes in Gaza. Tempering tariffs. China's plan to help exporters facing potential higher U.S. costs. 
 
 And under the hammer. We find out what's hot and what's not in the global art world with the CEO of world's largest online marketplace, Artsy. That 
 
 conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, we begin with the first post-election setback for U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump, the decision by Matt Gaetz to withdraw his 
 
 embattled bid for attorney general. Gaetz saying in a post on X that momentum for his nomination was, quote, "strong," but that he was unfairly 
 
 becoming a distraction from the critical work of the Trump fans team. All this as new details about his alleged sexual misconduct began surfacing, 
 
 Gaetz denying he did anything wrong, and but one Republican on Capitol Hill says Gaetz did the right thing by dropping out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND):  It was made clear that there's not a path, and if there's not a path, you're going to spend a lot of political capital for 
 
 losing cause. And it wouldn't have been worth it. I know enough people that were a hell no in the conference to know that -- the path would have been 
 
 very, very difficult if possible. And I doubt it was.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  The Trump team now forced into a rethink to fill one of their most important cabinet positions. Sources telling CNN that the president-
 
 elect had no alternative attorney general candidate in mind.
 
And in other Trump transition news, the president-elect's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, was on Capitol Hill Thursday to drum support for 
 
 his nomination. Hegseth continuing to address allegations of his own sexual misconduct, saying, again, that he's been completely exonerated.
 
Stephen Collinson joins me now. Stephen, wow is all I can say, and good grief to follow it. Not perhaps so unsurprising in the case of Matt Gaetz. 
 
 What do you make of this, and now what, for the transition team in finding a new candidate for attorney general?
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER:  I think it does show that there are at least some laws of political gravity that apply to Donald 
 
 Trump. He could hardly have chosen a more controversial figure than Matt Gaetz and won, who incidentally is deeply disliked even among Republicans 
 
 on Capitol Hill for this job of attorney general, but he turned it into a show of strength, believing that he could force Gaetz through and get him 
 
 confirmed soon after he was inaugurated president next year. A sign of hubris, I think, by the president.
 
I don't think we should go too far, however, in describing this as a defeat, I think we're going to see an avalanche of controversies and chaos 
 
 and outrage in the next two months before Trump is inaugurated, and this will be a very disruptive and turbulent presidency. I don't think, in the 
 
 long-term, this really affects Trump's strength in the Republican Party.
 
Gaetz was quite a unique nominee. And in some ways, having stood up to this nomination, I think some Republican senators might now be more willing to 
 
 vote to confirm some of those other deeply provocative picks for his cabinet that Trump has already made.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Also, some of the suggestion in the beginning that it was a case of perhaps there's going to be a big fight over this one and that 
 
 allows some of the other quite controversial at times picks to sort of slip under the net or slip through the net, for example.
 
What about the defense secretary position now? Again, accusations that he's facing, nothing proven. One could argue where are the arrest warrants, if 
 
 there's a concern over conduct and behavior in the past, but also another candidate, Hegseth, looking concerning perhaps.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
COLLINSON:  Yes, and I think the withdrawal of Gaetz immediately turned the full spotlight on Hegseth. You know, in any other administration, these 
 
 people would never have been picked, but Trump is looking for people that are completely loyal to him. He wants people who will shake up these 
 
 government departments who he believes are deeply biased against him. In the case of Hegseth, he wants him to go after generals who Trump believes 
 
 were an impediment to his attempts to wield unchecked power during his first term.
 
I would also look for the nominee of the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, who traveled to meet 
 
 President Assad of Syria, who appears to have sometimes amplified Russian propaganda. Her nomination has been overshadowed, I think, a lot by the 
 
 Gaetz and Hegseth stuff. That is going to get more scrutiny now as well.
 
There are a bunch of Republicans, especially sort of foreign policy hawks who have great reservations about her. But I think history tells us and 
 
 Trump's strength in the GOP tells us that, you know, Republican senators tend to genuflect towards Trump when they face great pressure. So, this, I 
 
 think, is, as I said, a unique case and perhaps will not set a pattern going forward.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And we're still waiting, of course, on a treasury secretary pick, which is looking relatively dull by comparison to all the others, 
 
 which perhaps is a good thing. Stephen Collison, for now, thank you so much for that.
 
We're also following news that the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the 
 
 former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes. The prime minister's office dismissing the move, calling it absurd and anti-
 
 Semitic. A warrant was also issued for a top Hamas commander who is believed to have been killed in an Israeli strike earlier this year.
 
Nic Robertson joins us now. Nic, a historic first for the leader of a democratic nation. It doesn't guarantee an arrest, but it could impede 
 
 their travel to ICC member nations just as a first thought.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yes, it really will. We've already heard from France, Italy, the Netherlands. We've heard as 
 
 well from Canada, the prime minister there, Justin Trudeau, saying they stand for international law. And if Prime Minister Netanyahu lands in his 
 
 country, which is a signatory to the Rome Statute, which means they have an obligation, therefore, to send anyone who has an arrest warrant from the 
 
 ICC to the ICC, 124 countries actually on that list. So, this really could have an impact on travel.
 
Let's look for a second at Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, who also faces similar charges from the ICC. He decided not to go to South Africa 
 
 for a summit there, where he would normally have gone, because of the potential that he could have been arrested and sent to the ICC.
 
There -- so, there are going to be real world effects for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Of course, a couple of his favorite allies like the United 
 
 States and India are not signatories to the Rome Statute. He'll have no problems traveling there. But yes, this is going to circumscribe what he 
 
 can do and how effective he can be a leader on the internet on the international stage, places he used to go to without thinking one second 
 
 about it. I don't think it's going to have such a big impact at home though.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Israel, not a member of the ICC, so not recognized there and been summarily dismissed, but to your point, more potent internationally. 
 
 Nic, good to have you. Thank you so much. Nic Robertson there.
 
Now, we're also following Vladimir Putin's latest comments. The Russian president says his country is, quote, "entitled" to strike nations 
 
 supplying weapons that are used against it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military objects of those 
 
 countries that allowed their weapons to be used against our objects. And in the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond just as 
 
 decisively and in kind.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  He's referring there to Kyiv's use of longer-range western missiles. He also says Russia has fired a new type of weapon against 
 
 Ukraine. Western officials say it was an experimental missile carrying multiple warheads. The attack was carried out on the City of Dnipro. This 
 
 video appears to show the moment of impact. CNN has been able to geolocate it, but the type of weapon remains unclear. Fred Pleitgen has more from 
 
 Moscow.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The moment one of Russia's newest missiles dropped its payload on one of 
 
 Ukraine's largest cities. Several sub warheads impacting in Dnipro, apparently not fully laden with explosives, causing no explosions on the 
 
 ground, but aiming to deliver a strong message from the Russian leader.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
In combat conditions, one of the newest Russian medium-range missile systems was also tested. In this case, with a ballistic missile in non-
 
 nuclear hypersonic equipment. Our missile men call it Orezhnik.
 
The Ukrainians exclusively sharing these photos of the missile debris with CNN. Kyiv saying the speed, trajectory, and impact of the rocket bore the 
 
 hallmarks of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying thermonuclear warheads. Although, western officials say it was not an ICBM.
 
Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is and how he despises dignity, freedom, and people's lives in general, Ukraine's 
 
 president said.
 
Russia's strike comes only a day after Ukraine, for the first time, used U.S. supplied ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles against targets inside 
 
 Russia.
 
PLEITGEN:  Vladimir Putin says that the Russians used this new intermediate-range ballistic missile as a direct response to the Ukrainians 
 
 hitting targets deep inside Russia using longer-range weapons provided by the United States and the United Kingdom.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The Ukrainians say Russia's new missile was launched from the Astrakhan area of Russia near the Caspian Sea. Russia has 
 
 test launched ICBMs from there in the past. Russian officials refusing to comment most of the day. The foreign ministry spokeswoman even getting an 
 
 apparent order to remain silent during her press briefing.
 
MARIA ZAKHAROVA, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SPOKESWOMAN (through translator):  Yes. I'm having a briefing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  On Yuzhmash and the ballistic rockets, about which the Westerners started talking about, we are not 
 
 commenting at all.
 
ZAKHAROVA:  Yes, OK. Thank you.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  She later said the caller only clarified a topic for her press conference. On the ground in Dnipro, the damage from the new 
 
 weapon seemed minimal, but Putin's message has been delivered. Russia is capable of unleashing much greater havoc on Ukraine and its western allies 
 
 if it chooses to do so.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Fred there. Now, Australia, considering banning social media accounts for children under the age of 16. If it's approved by 
 
 lawmakers, tech companies will have to enforce the age limit or face fines of up to $32 million dollars. The proposal was inspired in part by one 
 
 family's heartbreaking loss. Hanako Montgomery has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For all the positive connections, the joy social media can create, it can also 
 
 quickly strip it away, destroy it forever.
 
KELLY O'BRIEN, MOTHER OF CHARLOTTE O'BRIEN:  I will miss your hugs, your kisses, your laugh, your beautiful, beautiful smile.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  In September, 12-year-old Australian girl, Charlotte O'Brien took her own life, after years being bullied on social 
 
 media. Her parents quickly joined a political fight to protect children from online harm. The Australian government says the best way to do that is 
 
 to ban anyone under 16 from using social media.
 
ANTHONY ALBANESE, AUSTRALIA PRIME MINISTER:  Social media is doing social harm to our young Australians, and I am calling time on it. The safety and 
 
 mental health of our young people has to be a priority.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Under new legislation introduced to Australia's parliament, there would be consequences for social media companies caught 
 
 systematically breaching the age restriction and other safety measures, fines reaching tens of millions of dollars. But children or parents won't 
 
 be punished for breaking the new rules.
 
Instead, the government says the ban will help moms and dads to say no to young people who want to stay online.
 
BEN KIOKO, 14-YEAR-OLD:  Yes. So, being autistic, I have a really, really hard time connecting with others and doing that online makes it a lot 
 
 easier.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Some experts too say that a catch-all approach may not be helpful.
 
JUSTIN HUMPHREY, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY:  Even though the age is really fundamentally important that we need to get right, what we're talking about 
 
 when we say we're going to introduce a ban by age is that it negates the fact that young people have very, very different levels of maturity.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  But advocates of the ban point to age limits on alcohol, gambling and smoking, arguing social media can be equally damaging 
 
 for those too young to use it.
 
Hanako Montgomery, CNN.

CHATTERLEY:  Straight ahead on "First Move," Alphabet, regret. Shares of Google's parent company fall on breakup fears. Why dominance in search 
 
 could leave Google in the lurch.
 
Plus, a banana bonanza. The world's most expensive piece of fruit is a multimillion dollar hit at Sotheby's. What it all means for the global art 
 
 market and how everyday investors can get in on the action should they want to. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to a chip flip and a Dow wow. In today's Money Move. U.S. stocks finishing Thursday's session higher with the Dow 
 
 industrials the star of the show, rising more than 1 percent. NVIDIA had a pretty volatile ride today. The A.I. chip giant posting strong results that 
 
 nonetheless disappointed. Some shares whipsawing all day, but finish the session half a percentage point higher, as you can see there.
 
And crypto continues to delight. Bitcoin leaping once again, closing in on that landmark $100,000 per Bitcoin milestone. It's currently up 4.5 
 
 percent. You can see that 98 and a half thousand dollars per Bitcoin, the current level.
 
And another big market story taking place in India. We talked about it in yesterday's show. Shares of Adani Group companies plunging on news that its 
 
 chairman and other executives have been indicted in the United States for fraud. They're accused of paying bribes to Indian officials and then lying 
 
 about it while raising money from U.S. investors. Adani Enterprises falling 23 percent, double digit losses as well for Adani Energy Solutions and 
 
 Adani Green Energy, the company at the heart of those allegations. Kenya's president also announcing that he's cancelling an airport project with the 
 
 group.
 
Elsewhere in Asia, NVIDIA volatility also helping pressure tech stocks across the region as well. We'll see if the Asia tech can turn it around 
 
 when Friday's session gets underway very soon. We're also following China announcing fresh financial support Thursday for exporters who will be hard-
 
 hit from higher Trump tariffs. It's just one example of the nervousness being felt around the globe as nations await Trump's new trade moves and no 
 
 country has more at stake than China, as Marc Stewart reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  China is known as the world's factory, and we want to show you why. This is the Bairong World Trade Center in 
 
 Beijing. This place is massive, it is sprawling, floors and floors of Chinese-made merchandise, things like bikes, stuffed animals, hair dryers, 
 
 as items made in China are often a big part of American lives.
 
As talk of further tariffs on all Chinese goods heats up, as promised by President-Elect Trump on the campaign trail, a few things worth 
 
 remembering. China is the world's top manufacturing country, making about 30 percent of all of the stuff used around the world. Electronics like 
 
 these phone cords, top the list, furniture, toys, and clothing aren't far behind.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
No surprise, China is also the world's top exporter, shipping almost 3.4 trillion dollars' worth of goods globally. But China's strength isn't just 
 
 about money, including often criticized government subsidies, it's about the ecosystems.
 
Everything that's needed to make anything, the entire supply chain, it's already here. And once things are made, China has the means to move 
 
 merchandise quickly. A key goal of Trump's threatened tariffs is to bring more jobs and industries back to the U.S. But look at all of this 
 
 merchandise. China's system has a grip on the world, and unseating it as a top maker and seller, it's a task much easier said than done.
 
Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Marc Stewart there. Now, the U.S. government going after Google. The Justice Department has formally asked a federal 
 
 judge to force the sale of the tech giant's Chrome web browser. This comes after a landmark decision found Google has an illegal monopoly with its 
 
 search engine.
 
TechRadar's editor at large, Lance Ulanoff, joins us now. Lance, fantastic to get your wisdom on the show. Surely this is not just about how many of 
 
 us use Chrome as a web browser, it's about the far bigger ecosystem as an access point for other Google tools and products. Why is the U.S. 
 
 government though taking this stance? Let's start there.
 
LANCE ULANOFF, EDITOR AT LARGE, TECHRADAR:  Well, I mean, what you said is very true. You know, so, Google Chrome is -- basically, it's a platform, 
 
 right? It's a platform within our platform. So, you are -- you live in there and then you're using all of Google services, starting with search 
 
 because in your address bar, when you type something in, you're immediately triggering Google search, unless you go in and choose otherwise.
 
And once you bring up a webpage, what do you get? If you get search results, you get search, Google search ads. Google gets paid for that. If 
 
 you go to a website that isn't Google, but there are ads on it, guess what, a lot of those ads are served by Google too. Google's constantly getting 
 
 paid. And of course, they have a lot of control on all of this because you're going through the Google Chrome browser, or you're on your Android 
 
 phone and you're using Chrome or you're using your iPhone and you're in Safari and Google pays $20 billion a year to Apple so it can be the default 
 
 search engine in that.
 
So, you know, there is this feeling of control because, you know, Google's fingers are everywhere. But, you know, the question is, how did they get 
 
 there?
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, and that's the key. I was going to say, it's very powerful to leverage other interests like advertising revenue, to your 
 
 point. You know, there's a reason for me, at least, and this is my opinion, not fact, that Googling is a verb. Because every time I try and use any 
 
 other search function or web browser, it's rubbish. Quite frankly, compared to the Google search engine. I'm just being honest.
 
How is a breakup and a separation of Chrome going to help me as a consumer? And never mind a small business, for example, or a developer. How is it 
 
 going to help me as a consumer?
 
ULANOFF:  I don't know if it is going to help. You know, again, Google's been around for 25 years as a search engine, right? And, you know, the -- 
 
 when they arrived, they weren't the leader. They weren't the leader as a search engine. And when they launched Chrome, they weren't the leader on 
 
 web browsers. And why did they become the leader? They didn't pay people at that point to start using it, they just did things better and people sort 
 
 of marched on over to them.
 
And if you take away the Chrome browser, if you separate it from Google, you're going to -- you know, there's going to be some other company that 
 
 has different interests that is going to start to program it in a certain way that is going to basically break that marriage, right? And what's going 
 
 to happen is consumers going to be left as sort of the children of divorce. I don't think that we're going to be happy with that.
 
And in fact, when I was just doing these brief surveys, anecdotal surveys on social media, people are like, I don't want this, you know. So, you 
 
 know, look, I'm not going to say that Google's blameless. I'm not going to say that something needs to be done here, but I think there are other 
 
 remedies that we can pursue that really focus on, you know, their control of the ad market, which I do think is problematic and the control of how we 
 
 use the web, because search engine optimization, you know, every website you go to is built to serve Google because everyone knows Google's the 
 
 number one search engine.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes.
 
ULANOFF:  So, maybe there's some control we can pull back on there.
 
CHATTERLEY:  There's a different way to inject competition, perhaps that could be beneficial to users of all forms that doesn't involve necessarily 
 
 something as extreme as this. I mean, Google themselves are saying, look, it's an unprecedented government overreach. The interesting thing is the 
 
 government's going to change in a couple of months. What happens next and what difference perhaps could administration change make in this regard?
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
ULANOFF:  You know, it's an excellent question. It just seems like it's so binary. It could be that, you know, the messaging we've got has really been 
 
 confusing. So, it could be that they accelerate it. They go, absolutely, let's go. Or they make changes at the top of the DOJ. and they -- the whole 
 
 thing just fizzles out.
 
You know, a lot of people think that the incoming administration is going to be much better for big business, much better for businesses merging 
 
 together. So, you know, pulling things apart seems the opposite of that, but we really don't know because then there's the question of how this 
 
 administration feels about the content and the search results of Google and have they been fair?
 
So, I wish I could tell you. It is such a big question mark. But, you know, Google obviously is going to -- is responding right now. It's not -- it's -
 
 - nothing's happening right away, but it'll be a long fight if it goes forward with the next administration.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, I did like in their comment, they said it could jeopardize America's global economic and technological leadership precisely 
 
 the moment it's needed most, which, whether you agree or disagree with the level of power, and we've said perhaps more competition in certain spheres 
 
 could be added. That point, I think, is valid, particularly at this moment in time. Lance, Good to have you. No doubt we'll talk about it again soon. 
 
 Lance Ulanoff, thank you.
 
ULANOFF:  A pleasure.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, winter weather finally here. Skiing season kicking off in the Alps with a flurry of snow, yippee, while California is bracing for yet 
 
 another storm. The Western U.S. still recovering, of course, from the last one. Some Amtrak passengers had a near miss earlier this week when their 
 
 train collided with a tree felled by a windstorm. Some incredibly dramatic images there. Take a look at that. The good news is no passengers were 
 
 injured. An engineer, though, was taken to hospital and later released. Incredible, actually, given those images that no one was injured.
 
For more on all of this, we're joined by Chad Myers. Can we talk about the good news? Skiing. Ski season.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  For you, I know you love it. So, there you go. It's raining at the lower elevations, but yes, we are getting snow in 
 
 the higher elevations and it will be an absolute, again, pleasure of a Thanksgiving for some of those that do want to go skiing, especially out 
 
 west and of course, in the Alps, as you said.
 
Now, this is an atmospheric river. This is all the rainfall coming into San Francisco and to the points of north. This is now the second day of this 
 
 rain and it's not stopping. We've already had 12 inches. So, you know, you put that together, we're talking about 300 millimeters of rain, only 20 
 
 inches of snow, so not that much, but this is very heavy, wet stuff. This is going to be difficult to ski in, I'm afraid. And it's raining on top of 
 
 that snow right now in California. That could really exacerbate the flooding problems.
 
When it rains and there's already snow on the ground, the snow kind of clogs up the drains and the water just wants to run off. And we can pick up 
 
 another 300 to 400 millimeters of rainfall. We could see some significant flash flooding here.
 
Now, we turn our attention to Europe. Rarely do we see almost every country picking up some type of weather alert, and that will be the case for 
 
 tomorrow, especially Romania. You're going to have the wind and the snow, and we're talking about somewhere in the zero visibility in the higher 
 
 elevations there of Romania. But now, as we look ahead as the wind forecast, not only the snow, but the wind will be down into parts of Turkey 
 
 and also lots of snow there, likely 30 centimeters.
 
Now, let's move into Northwestern Europe for the end of the weekend, maybe getting a little early shopping done up here, but you're going to do it 
 
 with your hand on your hat because we're going to have wind gusts 50 to 70 kilometers per hour and maybe 100 along the coast. So, an awful lot going 
 
 on here.
 
Cold air coming in still for Turkey. Of course, you don't get snow without that, but that's pretty far south. And then, look what happens to the up 
 
 and down for Paris, snow overnight, warming up to five today and then up to 19. So, it's just kind of that up and down kind of season, hot, cold, hot, 
 
 cold. Well, we'll take the snow for you, but not for me because I have to shovel it.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, exactly. You can find someone to help you with that, Chad. That's what I do. We should try. Chad Myers, thank you so much for 
 
 that.
 
MYERS:  See you tomorrow.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, a volcano in Iceland has now erupted again. It's actually the 10th time in just three years. The volcano lies only 30 kilometers, 
 
 that's just under 20 miles, from the nation's capital city, which, luckily, unharmed. The system has laid dormant for 800 years before it reactivated 
 
 back in 2021. A nearby town was evacuated late last year due to the threat of lava, if you remember, and scientists warned these eruptions could 
 
 continue for decades or even centuries. Thank you to the producer who took out the name of that, by the way, because I do remember it and I would 
 
 butcher it if I tried to say it. So, thank you for that.
 
More "First Move" after the break. We'll see you soon.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more of the international headlines this hour. The Illinois Supreme Court has 
 
 overturned a conviction for Jussie Smollett in an alleged hoax back in 2019. The actor was on the TV drama "Empire," which filmed in Chicago. 
 
 Prosecutors said he staged an attack on himself because he was unhappy with the studio's response to hate mail he'd received. Smollett's appeal argued 
 
 a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after the county initially dropped the charges.
 
Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been indicted in connection to an alleged plot to kill his successor. CNN Brazil reports federal police 
 
 accused Bolsonaro of having, quote, "full knowledge" of the alleged plan. Bolsonaro and 36 others were named in the indictment. He has denied 
 
 allegations of attempting a coup.
 
And the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 
 
 The prime minister's office rejects the decision, calling it absurd and anti-Semitic. Nic Robertson has more.

ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seen here on a visit to Gaza this week, now faces the most serious international challenge 
 
 to his authority ever. Accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. A result of his leadership leading to the deaths of more than 44,000 
 
 Palestinians in Gaza.
 
The ICC says it has reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes, including starvation as a method of warfare 
 
 and crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts. Netanyahu is accusing the ICC of anti-Semitism.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  This is an anti-Semitic measure that has one goal, to deter me, to deter us from 
 
 exercising our natural right to defend ourselves against our enemies who rise up against us to destroy us.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Israel's former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who opposed some of Netanyahu's tactics in Gaza, is also accused. He is 
 
 pushing back, saying the ICC is creating a dangerous precedent for self- defense.
 
The ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas' military chief, Mohammed Deif, whom the IDF says it killed in July. 
 
 Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, two other Hamas leaders who had been on the potential arrest list in May, are also now dead.
 
Netanyahu is now in an unenviable club. Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, also wanted by the ICC and unable to travel 
 
 freely. Any of the 124 countries that are signatory to the Rome Statute will be obliged to arrest him, or Gallant, and send them to face trial at 
 
 the ICC in the Netherlands. An obligation, the E.U. foreign policy chief says, must be upheld.
 
JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF:  It is not a political decision. It is a decision of a court of justice, of a court of justice, an 
 
 international court of justice.

CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Nic Robertson again. Now, the U.S. embassy in Laos is advising travelers there to be on the alert for tainted alcoholic 
 
 drinks. Several visitors to a popular destination have recently died or fallen dangerously ill. It's suspected their cases are linked to drinks 
 
 laced with methanol and alcohol found in cleaning fluids.
 
Mike Valerio joins us now. Mike, what do we know about how these individuals got sick or in certain cases died and what are authorities 
 
 saying about Finding potentially suspected drinks?
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, they're sending out a warning, specifically the American embassy, in Laos saying, you know what, 
 
 if you're a backpacker who's on the trip of a lifetime and you're in Laos, watch out for bottles that look like they're tampered with. If you see a 
 
 label on your bottle of alcohol that looks like, you know, maybe it came from a bootleg printer, just to be aware.
 
Because, Julia, the why we care factor of this story with so many other things going on in the world, it has a growing international dimension. 
 
 When you're on, you know, YouTube, TikTok, Reels from IG, you can see so many of these travel influencers saying, if you want a trip of a lifetime, 
 
 Laos is this unspoiled corner of Asia, beautiful, idyllic trips, especially to this town of Vang Vieng, right in the middle of Laos, where this 
 
 outbreak of alcohol, fatal alcohol poisonings are happening.
 
So, Julia, over the past 24 hours, we've been able to follow the storylines of two poor Australian teenagers, both 19 years old, we're talking about 
 
 Holly Bowles and Bianca Jones, and their family members tell our affiliate in Sydney that both of them, again, on a similar backpacking trip of a 
 
 lifetime, before they both go off to university to engage in their, you know, studies, to set them on the course for the rest of their lives.
 
They're both in Laos, have some celebratory drinks. A week ago today, and they both start falling violently ill, organs fail, bad enough to the point 
 
 where they have to go to Bangkok, and one of them has died, Bianca Jones, again, at 19 years old.
 
So, you know, Julia, in sum, when we started reporting this story, with a special shout out to CNN reporters Helen Regan, Isaac Yee in Hong Kong, Eve 
 
 Brennan, who updated the story this morning in London, we thought, what in the world? Like, methanol poisoning? What is methanol? As you mentioned at 
 
 the top, cleaning fluid, doing in drinks?
 
So, it's a cheap way, our reporting has shown. If you have a little bit of methanol, it makes you drunk. But also, a little bit of methanol, Julia, is 
 
 toxic and it is a much cheaper but much more hazardous way to manufacture something like moonshine, you know, counterfeit alcohol.
 
So, that is what we're dealing with right now in this corner of the world. We're seeing if this storyline expands even further. But now, two people 
 
 from Denmark, one American, one Australian, and one citizen from the United Kingdom who are dead in this one town with this suspected outbreak going 
 
 on, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, heartbreaking end to, as you said, the trip of a lifetime for some of these young people. We'll continue to watch the further 
 
 developments on this story. Mike, good to have you. Thank you. Mike Valerio there.
 
VALERIO:  Thanks, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, this just in to CNN, Donald Trump just announced Pam Bondi as his new pick for attorney general. Posting on Truth Social, Pam 
 
 was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on violent criminals and made the streets safe for Florida families. Then, as 
 
 Florida's first female attorney general, she worked to stop the trafficking of deadly drugs and reduce the tragedy of fentanyl overdose deaths, which 
 
 have destroyed many families across our country.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
She did such an incredible job that I asked her to serve on our Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission during my first term, and we saved many lives. That 
 
 just an excerpt of that. He said, we'll do and she will do a terrific job as attorney general, as you can see that, replacing Matt Gaetz, who decided 
 
 to step back from the process today and immediately a new pick for the president-elect. Any further details on that, we will bring them to you.
 
For now, we're going to take a break. Coming up on "First Move," Major League Baseball about to announce the most valuable players for the season. 
 
 Will my favorite player make history once again? We'll find out. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  It's been a blockbuster week for art and the art market, with high bidders at New York's auction houses painting a rosy picture for a 
 
 broader sentiment within the market. This surreal masterpiece by Magritte is setting a record this week, fetching more than $120 million at 
 
 Christie's.
 
But fine art doesn't always have to mean infinite price tag. Artsy, the world's largest online art marketplace, connects users to thousands of 
 
 galleries and more than a million artworks and new artists too, allowing its clients and customers to keep up with the latest moves and shakers in 
 
 the art sector.
 
Jeffrey Yin, CEO of Artsy joins us now. Jeffrey, fantastic to have you on the show. Just for our viewers that may not have seen the interview that 
 
 we've done in the past with your platform, just remind us what Artsy is and what it provides.
 
JEFFREY YIN, CEO, ARTSY:  Thanks, Julia, for having me. Artsy is the world's leading fine art online marketplace. And as you mentioned, we 
 
 connect users with over 4,000 gallery partners, auction partners and fares globally. And our mission is very simple. It's to make our more accessible 
 
 to everyone. We have 1.6 million works of art on our platform representing 100,000 artists, 4,000 partners that are located in 100 countries. And so, 
 
 our mission and our goal is to bring the art world closer together.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And one of the things that I personally love about the art market is the degree of opacity, certainly at the top end over things like 
 
 valuations, and it's one of the last unregulated markets in the world. But I also love that you aim to connect and shed light on what's going on and 
 
 give people -- more people access.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
What if I don't know much about art, but I'm eager to learn, that I have a finite amount of money to spend and it may not be that much? And also, if 
 
 I'm a newer artist, perhaps that's looking for a marketplace, what's on the platform for me?
 
YIN:  Yes, certainly, as a collector, one of the things that we try to think of ourselves as is an art adviser in your pocket. And I'm not 
 
 suggesting we want to replace the human art adviser, but what we provide are things like editorial insights, personal recommendations, pricing, 
 
 transparency and transact ability for works of art.
 
And so, for example, just the other week we wrote an article about what determines the price of an artwork. And so, if you're new to the art market 
 
 and you're not really sure what you should be looking for, we provide a lot of informational content, educational content for you to start learning 
 
 about the market. And then, as you interact with the site and start liking, following, saving works of art. We start to bring more and more of that art 
 
 that you are expressing an interest in right to you so that it becomes easier and easier for you to discover it and then, ultimately, fall in love 
 
 with the right work of art and take it home with you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, I'm biased. I happen to love the platform. It educates me and I keep abreast of what's going on in the sector. It is the sort of 
 
 marquee week, at least in New York this week, where all the big auction houses are selling art. And I think the level of money that was anticipated 
 
 to be raised was somewhere between $1.2 and $1.6 billion dollars. And yet, as with every article it reads like, oh, this didn't sell or this didn't 
 
 sell. And there's sort of an air of doom, I think, across the market that it's not as good as last year.
 
Jeffrey, what do your numbers tell us about what's going on in the art market? And do you push back on some of the doom mongers who are suggesting 
 
 that perhaps the market is softer than it might be?
 
YIN:  I actually do push back a little bit on the naysayers. I actually think that the global art market -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Naysayers, that's the word.
 
YIN:  I think the global art market is actually showing some signs of market resilience. I think anytime a work of art is selling for more than 
 
 $100 million dollars in an auction, that is a really strong signal of what is happening at the upper end of the market.
 
What I think is equally interesting is what is happening for, you know, those of us who are not in the market for $100 million works or even $5 
 
 million works. But if you're looking for, you know, the $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 work, there's a robust market that is still happening.
 
What we're seeing on Artsy, for example, our e-commerce transaction activity is actually up 38 percent year over year. And we're particularly 
 
 seeing a lot of strength in prints and additions, which are up 60 percent on a year over year basis.
 
So, yes, the upper end of the market is showing a little bit of softness, maybe compared to a couple years ago, but certainly, not a bad week for the 
 
 top auction houses. And what I'm seeing in the rest of the market is a continued resilience. The collector continues to fall in love with works of 
 
 art, discover new artists, want to collect those paintings or prints and additions and bring them home with them. And so, that activity is still 
 
 occurring.
 
CHATTERLEY:  OK. This is so important because we talk about the art market, we need to segment it into the different spheres and genres and also price 
 
 points as well. Very quickly. Sotheby's selling a banana taped to a wall for $6.2 million. Jeffrey, what do you make of that? Very quickly.
 
YIN:  I don't know if it was the banana or the duct tape that sort of drove up that price. But in all seriousness, you know, that as a conceptual work 
 
 of art is on everyone's lips, and it is a provocative work of art. It is challenging us to think about what is art. What is the value of art? But I 
 
 think there are really two key takeaways from the sale of that work. The first is those conceptual works are creating some buzz and engaging new 
 
 audiences. And that I think is really important for the art market.
 
The second is, you know, the buyer is somebody who generated a lot of wealth from digital currency. And so, what I think you're seeing is a real 
 
 evolution of the art market. It's bringing in new types of collectors, new vectors of wealth and purchasing activity. And I think you're going to 
 
 continue to see that as we move forward.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, Justin Sun is -- was -- has been on this show, and I think he tweeted out that Elon Musk could take it to the moon. I'm not 
 
 quite sure who's having the last laugh here, but I certainly am. Jeffrey Yin, CEO of Artsy, great to have you on the show, sir. We'll keep in touch. 
 
 Thank you for your time.
 
YIN:  Thank you.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  And talking of the banana, I just want to share the work of one of my very best friends who sent this to me this morning, Lucia, who 
 
 did her own banana work. And she said -- what was it she said to me? Hers is worth more. Well, I tell you, her friendship is priceless. Thank you, 
 
 Luci, for her version of the banana, not costing $6.2 million. More "First Move" after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back. It may be Shohei showtime once again. L.A. Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani is expected to be named the National League 
 
 MVP, the most valuable player. The Japanese slugger won the World Series this year and became the founding member of Major League Baseball's 50-50 
 
 Club. He would become only the second player in history to win the MVP title in both leagues and in the American League. Ohtani's World Series 
 
 rival, the New York Yankees' Aaron Judge, has just been named MVP, of course, too. Don Riddell joins us now. Don, will he get the title?
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  I mean, I think yes. They're keeping everybody on the edge of their seats, but I think when he finally gets it, 
 
 it's going to be the confirmation of the worst kept secret in baseball.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes.
 
RIDDELL:  I mean, how can you not get it? I mean, you know, you and I, Julia, have talked numerous times on this show over the last few months 
 
 about what an extraordinary season Shohei Ohtani has had with the Dodgers. Of course, helping them win the World Series, making history along the way.
 
You referenced he was the founding member of the 50-50 Club, 59 stolen bases, 54 home runs. His batting average was 310, 130 RBIs this season as 
 
 well. If he gets it, it would be his third MVP award. He won it twice in the American League in 2021 and 2023. So, if he gets it now in the National 
 
 League, he would be only the second player ever to do it in both leagues. And he would also make history by becoming the first designated hitter ever 
 
 to win it. And I believe, I've just been told, that he has done it. So, there we go.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Breaking news. We love it.
 
RIDDELL:  We talked it into existence. Yes. I mean -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes.
 
RIDDELL:  Everybody thought this was going to happen.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Breaking news. We love it.
 
RIDDELL:  And remember, he'd never even played in the playoffs before, and here he is now leading the Dodgers to the World Series in his first season 
 
 with them. And he did it by playing with an injured shoulder in the last three games of that World Series. So, just a phenomenal year. And we didn't 
 
 even see him pitch. He's been recovering from elbow surgery all year. So, hopefully, even more exciting things to come next season with him, both 
 
 pitching and hitting for the Dodgers, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Cannot wait. And I love the fact that we timed this so perfectly that you announced it live on television.
 
RIDDELL:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Fantastic. And congratulations. It is Shohei showtime once again.
 
RIDDELL:  Yes.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Don Riddell, thank you so much for that. All right. More now on our breaking news, Donald Trump naming former Florida Attorney General 
 
 Pam Bondi to run the Justice Department. The new attorney general pick coming just hours after Matt Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration.
 
And finally, on "First Move," he's endorsed everything from bibles to steaks, but few may have predicted Donald Trump would choose musical 
 
 instruments to sell also. Seems perfectly reasonable to me, but if you don't believe me, well, here is the president-elect's offering limited 
 
 edition guitars in a post on his Truth Social site, click on the get Trump guitars website, and you'll see they start at $1,000 not bad. But if you 
 
 want one autographed it will cost you 10 times more. It says there are only a few hundred of those available and that is a lot of autographs. So, get 
 
 on that website if you have musical inclination.
 
And that just about wraps up the show. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow.
