FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: All right. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta, alongside Wolf Blitzer in Washington. We'll get to you in a moment.
 
Wolf, we begin with our special coverage of the rapidly changing events in Israel and Gaza. After days of waiting, the Rafah Border Crossing between Gaza and Egypt has opened, and it did so earlier this morning. Very briefly, allowing 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid to cross into Gaza.
 
Water, fuel, and food are all running desperately low in Gaza. And the United Nations is warning that Gaza's hospitals are on the brink of collapse. One American trapped in Gaza described his situation to CNN this morning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABOOD OKAL, UNITED STATES CITIZEN, STUCK IN GAZA (via telephone): We thought that's strategic that we could stay close to the border because we have faith that the state department would work on extracting us or getting us out of Gaza through some type of an arrangement.
 
We've been here for a week. We're staying in a normal single-family home. Two floors with about 40 people sharing everything we can share from food to drinking water supplies.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: And smoke is still rising over parts of Gaza as airstrikes continue. The death toll, they are now stands at more than 4,300 people according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
 
Meantime, tens of thousands of Israeli troops continue to mass along the Gaza border. And today, the Israeli Defense Forces updated the number of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza to 210 people.
 
Two American hostages, a mother and her teenage daughter are now free, following their surprising release yesterday. They were visiting family at a kibbutz close to Gaza, when they were taken by -- taken hostage by Hamas. Wolf.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: All right, Fred. Let's get some more right now in the badly needed aid that just arrived in Gaza from Egypt.
 
CNN's Clarissa Ward is following all the late breaking developments from Cairo.
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, now, it's been two weeks of no aid, relentless bombardment, mass displacement. 20 trucks is obviously just a drop in the ocean.
 
But officials are saying that they're hopeful that this is the start of something more sustained, more continuous. The U.N. believes in hopes that potentially tomorrow or on Monday that more of their trucks could go through. Today, those 20 trucks were Egyptian Red Crescent trucks, they drove through the Rafah Border Crossing, they unloaded that aid with was food, water, medicine.
 
Palestinian trucks, then loaded the aid and drove it through to the Gaza side.
 
Now, there's a meeting today of Arab leaders here in Cairo. It's called, Conference of Peace. President Sisi, the Egyptian president spoke in the last hour or so. He said, this is a welcome sign, but it's not enough. We need to build on this and establish a sustained humanitarian corridor.
 
We need a humanitarian ceasefire as well. And beyond that, we need to work on, establishing some kind of a peace process, a two-state solution. So, quite a long list of things that need to happen.
 
Right now, there seems to be consensus, at least on that first step of trying to establish a more continuous or sustained humanitarian corridor.
 
The hospitals at this stage are barely functioning. The fuel supplies, according to one U.N. person who I was speaking to will be out or depleted in two or three days.
 
So, that is a vital resource that is desperately needed, and negotiations ongoing to try to get at least 100 trucks in every single day in what will be the beginning of a continuous corridor. And hopefully, eventually, also, the establishment as the Israelis had previously mentioned, and also, President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, of some kind of humanitarian zone, where some of the 900,000 displaced people inside Gaza could find some refuge and some respite.
 
We are still though a long way from that.
 
BLITZER: All right. Clarissa Ward, reporting from Cairo. Thank you.
 
So, what impact potentially could this aid have inside Gaza? CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is covering this angle for us.
 <br>[12:05:02] So, what are you learning, Salma?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER: Well, Wolf, as you heard there from our Clarissa Ward, this only begins -- doesn't even begin, honestly, to scratch the surface of the needs on the ground. And that convoy is going to face some serious challenges.
 
There is no fuel on it, airstrikes are continuing to rain down on Gaza, there are major infrastructure issues. I want to bring you a report to give you just a sense of the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza. But I do want to warn our viewers these images are graphic.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling. Everything is running out from surgical equipment to medicine, and the tiniest lives are left hanging in the balance.
 
We need power, we need access to clean water, this doctor says. Without basic services, this will be a humanitarian catastrophe.
 
Already, seven hospitals and 21 primary health care facilities here are out of service, according to Palestinian officials because of shortages.
 
After intense diplomatic efforts, prayers of relief at the Rafah Border Crossing, as a trickle of aid was allowed in from Egypt. But the 20-truck convoy is only a drop in the ocean of need here, equivalent to just three percent of what entered this enclave daily prior to the conflict.
 
More than 200 additional trucks of assistance remain stalled on the Egyptian side, according to the U.N., and every hour costs lives.
 
And so far, no civilians can leave the enclave. 10-year-old Palestinian American, Aiden, is among those trapped.
 
AIDEN BSEISO, PALESTINIAN AMERICAN: And we had no place to go. All the streets are bombed. They're literally gone. How are we supposed to go out? How? It's all closed.
 
ABDELAZIZ: Even if people are allowed out, it will be a limited number, most likely only those with foreign passports. Sealing some 2 million others, half of them children, into this hellscape.
 
But some refuse to go even if they could, fearing Israel intends to bomb and besieged them out of their homes, never to return.
 
Even as Mahmoud (PH) buries his children, he says he will keep fighting just to exist here.
 
We will still be patient. As long as we are alive on this earth, we will be patient, he says. We will never leave this land.
 
After the October 7th terror attacks, when Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel in a brutal surprise incursion, Israel vow to wipe out Hamas.
 
But with hundreds of airstrikes pounding the densely populated enclave a day, innocent blood is being spilled.
 
Innocent children were struck down while they were sleeping, this woman shouts. What did they do? Did they carry weapons? These are innocent children who know nothing. Tell us, when will this end?
 
There are calls for a ceasefire to get civilians out of the war zone and allow more aid into Gaza. But the please fall on deaf ears so far. Israel is preparing for the next phase of its operations, a potential ground incursion, that can only bring more suffering.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ABDELAZIZ: -- officials in Gaza, the death toll is over 4,000 killed so far, many more thousands wounded. And that humanitarian crisis is only intensifying by the hour as that siege cuts off basic supplies, as more wounded continue to stream into this healthcare system. The United Nations is appealing, is begging for a sustained corridor of some kind to allow assistance to flow through freely. Wolf.
 
BLITZER: All right. Salma, thank you very much.
 
Salma Abdelaziz, reporting for us.
 
The Biden administration amidst the all of this, is now asking Congress for $105 billion in security funding for Israel and Ukraine. Some additional money would also be provided for the U.S. southern border and Taiwan.
 
But the president faces an uphill battle on Capitol Hill right now. House Republicans have been unable to agree on a new Speaker for more than two weeks. So, Congress cannot pass any legislation until there is a new Speaker.
 
A growing number of House Republicans are also opposed to additional funding of Ukraine's ongoing war.
 
CNN's White House reporter, Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now from Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, where the president is spending the weekend.
 
Priscilla, what is the administration's plan to get this funding through Congress?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Wolf, I just got off the phone with a White House official, who told me that the White House legislative team is working over the course of the weekend to talk to members of both parties to shore up support for this supplemental request and underscore how necessary it is.
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
You mentioned, this is a $105 billion funding package. It breaks down the following way. There $61 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, over $9 billion for humanitarian aid, as well as funding for the U.S. Mexico border, as well as the Indo-Pacific region.
 
Now, the White House has said that they see bipartisan support in Congress for a package like this. But, as you mentioned, this still faces an uphill battle with the House of Representatives that has no Speaker.
 
In fact, the House Republicans wrapped the week, still scrambling to find someone after pushing Republican Representative Jim Jordan out of the race.
 
Now, over the coming days, new Speaker hopefuls will emerge. But there is still no conclusion in sight, which leaves all of this in limbo. And it's not just the lawmakers that the White House is trying to shore up support with, but also Americans.
 
This week, the president delivered a primetime address where he made a direct appeal to Americans over the need to continue to provide aid in these ongoing conflicts. Making the point that these aren't just conflicts playing out far away. but that they also impact U.S. national security.
 
So, all of this -- so, very much ongoing and up in the air. Wolf?
 
BLITZER: All right. Priscilla, thank you very much. Priscilla Alvarez, reporting.
 
I'm joined now by former Ambassador Ryan Crocker. He's the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. He's also a non- resident senior fellow over the Carnegie Endowment. Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us.
 
First of all, you know, these issues really well. How critical potentially is this aid package for Israel right now?
 
RYAN CROCKER, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, LEBANON, AND SYRIA: I think it's very important that -- as the state department has just said, that this be the first of a long stream of relief convoys moving into Gaza. I think the -- we have helped the Israelis understand how very important it is that they not be seen as the villain in this piece, by bringing new suffering to the Palestinian people in Gaza.
 
So, again, there is no balance here between Hamas and Israel, the attack on October 7th was horrific. And the focus needs to be kept on that strategically. And obviously, trying to take care of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, very important for Israel as well as the Palestinians themselves.
 
BLITZER: How do you think a delay in getting Israel, that additional U.S. security funding would impact it's a war that's ongoing right now against Hamas?
 
CROCKER: My guess, and it's just that, Wolf, they are -- they are OK, for the time being in terms of armaments. But indefinitely, it's going to be a huge problem. It already is a problem with Ukraine if we don't get that package moving, at some point. The Israelis are going to be short of the munitions they so desperately need.
 
BLITZER: As you know, President Biden, in his Oval Office, address -- cautioned Israel this week, not to make the same mistakes the U.S. made after the 9/11 terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda. And urged Israel to have a clear path as it prepares for an almost certain ground invasion of Gaza to try to destroy Hamas.
 
What is the message the president is sending Israel with these comments?
 
CROCKER: I think it's pretty clear. Wolf, and I'm glad the president said all of that, that this critical of the situation cannot be ruled by emotions. However, warranted those emotions might be after the massacres and the hostage taking that Israel suffered.
 
But they need to keep a level head. We need to help them do that. I think that president's statement was an important step in that direction, as is the presence in Jerusalem, including attending Cabinet meetings, emergency Cabinet meetings of our national security adviser and others.
 
So, we're locked up there with the -- with the Israelis, I think it gives us a chance to make sure they keep the focus where it needs to be and to avoid reactions that are going to come back and make them the villain rather than the victim.
 
BLITZER: As you know, Israel has talked publicly about destroying Hamas with this likely ground invasion into Gaza. Are you confident, Ambassador, that Israel has a plan for what would happen if that goal were achieved?
 
CROCKER: I think the Israelis are considering a number of different options just as we would if we were in a similar position. I think one of the options on the table is a partial reoccupation of Gaza. And I think that's -- the logic behind that is that given the ease with which Hamas crossed the border.
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
You've got to push forward and make it a greater distance with a number of troops in place. Kind of like what they did in Lebanon for 18 years.
 
It didn't work out in the end, 1,100 Israelis dead in the period from '82 to 2000, with final withdrawal. Absolutely unthinkable. And now, I think it is thinkable as they look at a range of options.
 
CROCKER: But, as you know, Israel says, it doesn't want to occupy Gaza again, if it were to remove Hamas. Who do you think, Ambassador, potentially, could fill that power vacuum and actually govern Gaza?
 
CROCKER: I'm afraid good governance in Gaza is a very long way off, unfortunately. But should they succeed in eradicating the current Hamas leadership? I think there is every prospect, you're going to see a new leadership emerge, as we have seen, with our own efforts in Iraq and Syria, with al Qaeda, morphing into Islamic State, which is still there in underground.
 
So, I would not expect free and fair elections to replace Hamas, as the governing authority in Gaza, would not expect those anytime soon.
 
BLITZER: And, you know, I think the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas could take charge?
 
CROCKER: Well, there is no way they could, you know, sort of move down from the West Bank and take charge. There would have to be an election. One assumes. And it's possible with a lot of good preparation, hard work and a plan for governance, that the Palestinian Authority could through elections extend its reach into Gaza.
 
But that is not going to happen, and that's not coming to a movie theater near us anytime soon. I got to tell you.
 
BLITZER: Ambassador Ryan Crocker, thanks so much for joining us.
 
CROCKER: Thanks for having me, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: All right. Coming up, law enforcement agencies across the U.S. are on high alert amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. How officials are using an array of very sophisticated tools and techniques to monitor potential threats? We'll have details when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:21:20]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Law enforcement agencies across the country are on high alert for lone offenders inspired by the Israel-Hamas war. CNN obtained a joint intelligence bulletin issued by several federal security agencies, including the FBI and Homeland Security. And it notes the FBI is seeing increased threats against faith communities.
 
Here to discuss this is Shawn Turner, a former director of communication for the U.S. National Intelligence. Shawn, great to see you.
 
So, sources are telling CNN that the FBI is working around the clock, fielding tips from the public. I guess, what are the distinctions between some tips as to why some are taken a lot more seriously than others?
 
SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATION FOR UNITED STATES NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Yes. Thanks for having me, Fred.
 
I think at a time like this, and when you're thinking about what makes these particular threats and particular rhetoric stand out, is it really cuts sort of comes down to what's happening in the broader environment. What the FBI is looking for is a sort of understanding what the status quo is. And then, understanding when we're seeing increases in specific threat -- threats, particular threats against groups or organizations. And so, you know, we're always monitoring, sort of hate field threats and rhetoric. But when you see a situation like we've got in Israel and Gaza, you begin to see a sort of pockets of dialogue creep up in various chat, chat rooms and chat areas. And you have to watch those things very closely.
 
What you're looking for, most of all, Fred, is you're looking for instances in which that rhetoric, this sort of discussion goes from talking about how people feel about the situation to talking about how they might actually react, what they may actually do?
 
Do you want to see a jump to behavior. When you see those indications, that's when law enforcement has to step in, and find out if what people are talking about is actually what they intend to do.
 
WHITFIELD: So, going to certain chat rooms or monitoring social media, that's one way in which to pay attention to conversations. But what are some of the other tools that law enforcement national security might be using to try to get ahead of threats?
 
TURNER: Yes. Well, you know, one of the best ways to get ahead of those threats is, you know, we've got intelligence fusion centers. On New York has one of the best New York -- the NYPD has one of the best intelligence fusion centers in the country.
 
We've got to make sure that when we're looking at all the resources that are available at the FBI, and through the intelligence community, that we sort of bring those together to make sure that we're seeing as much as we can.
 
But, you know, that's what law enforcement can do, Fred. But this is not just a law enforcement issue. In communities all across the country, people are talking about what's happening in Israel and Gaza, and they're hearing their neighbors, and friends, and family members, talk about what's happening there.
 
And as those strong emotions, so the rise to the top, it's -- the onus is on all of us to bring those things to the attention of law enforcement. So, I think, you know, a lot of times, we think about, you know, what's happening behind the scenes, why aren't we catching these things?
 
This is everyone's responsibility to make sure that we are raising these issues up. And also, Fred, you know, just making sure that we are trying to educate people about what's actually happening here.
 
WHITFIELD: And this week, the NYPD ordered all officers to report in uniform and be prepared for deployment. How important is it that some jurisdictions, even if there is no specific threat, to have the visibility of law enforcement act almost as a deterrent as well?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
TURNER: Yes. Yes. You know, absolutely, Fred. Look, this is -- this is the time for law enforcement agencies all across the country to not only act as, you know, to demonstrate they have a heightened sense alertness and awareness, but to show that in the communities.
 <br>[12:25:04]
 
We need law enforcement officers certainly out in the streets, out in communities, outside of faith and religious based organizations, making sure that they're showing a presence.
 
You know, it's -- on a much smaller scale, it's very much the same as why we have carrier strike groups in the region of Israel and Gaza.
 
We are there to show deterrence. We are there to send a message. We're there to help people understand that we're going to protect innocent people. And we need to do that all across this country in our cities and states and communities to make sure that people feel safe.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Shawn Turner, thanks for being with us. Appreciate it.
 
TURNER: Thanks, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. It's been nearly two weeks since Hamas launched its unprecedented assault in Israel.
 
Still ahead, CNN spoke exclusively with the Palestinian Prime Minister. That interview coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:04]
 
BLITZER: It's been two weeks now since Hamas launch this unprecedented terrorist assault on Israel, killing hundreds of Israelis. Many world leaders have come out in support of Israel since then especially its strongest ally, the United States. In retaliation, Israel continues to strike targets in Gaza. CNN's Becky Anderson spoke exclusively with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, and started by asking him if he condemned that attack against Israel on October 7th.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHAMMAD SHTAYYEH, PALESTINIAN PRIME MINISTER: The condemnation should be of killing every civilian, every human being that does not deserve to die should -- we should condemn that. More than 1,600 children has been slaughtered in Gaza, more than 700 women. The general mood in Israel today is a mood of revenge. And I think this appetite for killing should be stopped under any circumstances. None one single human being would like to see innocent people killed.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: You unwilling to say that you condemn the attacks, though, on October the 7th, why?
 
SHTAYYEH: Well, because you see, Palestinian story does not start on October 7th. Palestinian catastrophe has been there for 75 years. And we have been crying loud. And we have been shouting loud and clear, we need a solution. And what has happened yesterday is yesterday, the mood of revenge and the preparation for a ground operation which is going to cause a 10,000 Palestinian lives, this is where the focus should be. And that is what we should stop.
 
ANDERSON: Were you shocked, surprised by the ferocity of the attack on October the 7th?
 
SHTAYYEH: Everybody were. Everybody was shocked. This is something that has been unprecedented by all means. The Israeli government policy has to be held responsible for all what has happened. The Israeli strategy was to keep Gaza isolated, that people in Gaza were very angry, were depressed, the people of Gaza were unemployed, under poverty line. We have to make to provide meaningful life to the people that was not there. Gaza was a zone that was shrinking every single day. The situation was shocking to everybody. But the magnitude of distraction that we have seen today in Gaza is something that is a criminal act.
 
ANDERSON: Israel's defense minister has said his troops will soon see the inside of Gaza. And I quote him on that as Israel's military ready readies itself for the next stage. Just how concerned are you?
 
SHTAYYEH: Very concerned, if the Israeli army goes into Gaza with a ground operation, then our anticipation that thousands, additional thousand, maybe 10,000, 15,000 Palestinians will be killed. So we are more than concerned.
 
ANDERSON: Why the President Abbas walk out on what was scheduled to be a summit in Jordan with U.S. President?
 
SHTAYYEH: What's happened at the Al-Ahli Hospital was horrific scene. We asked one simple question, is the United States ready to say to the Israelis stop the incursion or stop the attacks, we were not assured on that. And therefore any meeting became meaningless. We the Jordanian and the Egyptians and by the way, and the Americans, they didn't fully understand that President Abbas had to walk away. And they also bade condolences to the losses of lives in the Al-Ahli Hospital.
 
ANDERSON: The U.S. has been absolutely clear that Israel has a right to defend itself and that it will support Israel in its efforts to destroy Hamas, whatever it takes. Your thoughts on that.
 
SHTAYYEH: The support of Israel blindly is a license for killing. And I hope that United States does not go into that direction. Israel is not under existential threat. The White House the President should call for the parties to sit down and work together a peaceful solution, encouraging Israel to destroy the people of Gaza that is not going to bring a solution. Look at the pictures. Look at the pictures. Who has been killed in Gaza, children, women, old men, churches, mosques, this is not a war on Hamas. This is a war on the Palestinian people wherever they are in Gaza and the West Bank and Jerusalem.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[12:34:42]
 
BLITZER: Our thanks to Becky Anderson for that exclusive interview. And our special coverage of the conflict between Israel and Hamas will continue right after a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right, major developments this week in Georgia where Fulton County prosecutors scored another victory in their case against former President Donald Trump's plot to overturn the 2020 election. The attorney who allegedly helped craft that scheme, Kenneth Chesebro, pleaded guilty on Friday to one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. He will serve five years probation, pay $5,000 in restitution and will testify in any future trials against the remaining 16 codefendants. But Chesebro's attorney told me last hour that this is what the guilty plea means.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCOTT GRUBMAN, ATTORNEY FOR KENNETH CHESEBRO: Mr. Chesebro was the architect of the fake elector scheme, some sort of scheme to bring down democracy which is what I've heard over and over for the last few months with the district attorney of Fulton County have offered him first offender probation, I really don't think so Fredricka. 
 
So I think this plea deal was offered because the evidence was not there that he was the architect of some sort of fake a lecture scheme. Mr. Chesebro willing to live with it and now he will fulfill the obligations that he committed to and he signed his plea deal. But in terms of whether he's flipping against anyone or anything like that, he's simply going to tell the truth. And if the jury decides that helps one side or the other, so be it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, and part of his soundbite was clipped a little bit, he said, if he was the architect, he was not making the statement that he was the architect. Chesebro joins former Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who also pleaded guilty this week. And if you're keeping track that now makes three of the 19 indicted in Georgia to admit guilt for their roles in the plot to overturn the election results.
 
Joining us right now is former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin. Good to see you, Michael.
 
MICHAEL ZELDIN, CNN FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Hi, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. So during a Friday's hearing, Chesebro, you know, admitted in court that he conspired with Trump to put forward fake electors in Georgia. But Chesebro's attorney told me last hour that his client didn't implicate anyone but himself. Do you believe that's the case?
 
ZELDIN: Well, I thought he pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to falsely set electors forth in Georgia. And a conspiracy implies more than one person. And the people who are at play in this conspiracy are Trump and Eastman and Giuliani. So maybe he's technically pleading to one count of filing false statements. But the implication of this is that he was working in a conservative way with others, and that if he testifies to what they did, that should be verse to those others.
 
WHITFIELD: And your plea deal would not be accepted if not for the fact that if you were called to testify, you know, or your admission will help lead to information about your coconspirators, I mean, there would be no real plea deal, if not for those things, right?
 
ZELDIN: Exactly. What he has to admit is guilt. And his lawyer seems to be saying, well, you know what, he's really not admitting to guilt so much as he's just taking the lesser of evils presented to him with Judge can take a plea under those circumstances. So he's admitting guilt, and the prosecutor is not going to allow him to plead to one count, when he was charged with seven, unless they believe he has valuable information to provide them in the pursuit of other convictions. So yes, I think he's going to testify universally. And he took a plea deal knowing that he violated the law.
 
WHITFIELD: OK. And Chesebro admitted that, you know, the purpose of the fake electors conspiracy was to disrupt and delay the joint session of Congress on January 6th, 2021, which is a key element of the federal charges Trump is facing. So how damaging is that admission for Trump's legal team?
 
ZELDIN: Well, it's damaging if Chesebro is a good witness. Remember, he says I'll testify truthfully. And he might have a, you know, a gloss on it, that is sort of more favorable to himself, and also to the Trump, Eastman, Giuliani, defendants. But if he comes forth with substantial evidence that they engage in this conspiracy to delay the election, and they knew it was criminal, which is important, then I think he's a very powerful witness. If he just tries to poo-poo this, then I think it'll be less damaging than it could be.
 
WHITFIELD: And then how significant is this for Trump's case, as he sees now two of his former attorneys, Chesebro and Sidney Powell, now cooperating with prosecutors?
 
ZELDIN: Well, if you're a codefendant, and you've got others of your team being testifiers against you, then that's not a good day for you. And each of them has something important to add in terms of Trump's liability. Sidney Powell, though she pleaded guilty just to election interference in Coffee County was present in the White House during conversations about the big lie strategy. And Chesebro is one of the so called architects of this, though they both will have information to see what Donald Trump's state of mind was, what his intentions were.
 
WHITFIELD: So three now have pled, do you see it's likely that they're remaining, if that includes, you know, the former president himself or not, but good number of the remaining who will also try to seek plea deals?
 
ZELDIN: Sure, I think that all of the second tier players will ultimately enter plea deals, especially if the prosecutors are offering probation and no jail time. The serious defendants Eastman, Giuliani Meadows, Trump, I think they have a harder time pleading guilty, but we'll see how much evidence they feel the codefendants who have pled guilty have it on them and that'll inform their decisions going forward.
 <br>[12:45:02]
 
WHITFIELD: All right fascinating. Michael Zeldin, thank you so much.
 
ZELDIN: Thanks Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, as the paralyzed U.S. House scrambles to find a new speaker. Today, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer entered a crowded candidate field for the gavel. The Minnesota Republicans official announcement comes with a clear message to his Republican colleagues. Emmer says GOP members must quote, look for a new path forward. Emmer are now joins a handful of other Republicans vying for House Speaker now. You see them right there.
 
More candidates are likely to add their names to the field in the coming days. Jim Jordan dropped out after losing three straight votes on the floor and then was ousted by his fellow Republicans in a secret ballot. On Monday, House Republicans will try again with a candidate forum. CNN's Melanie Zanona has the latest from Capitol Hill.
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, the Republicans are back at square one for the second time in two weeks, their GOP nominee for speaker has failed to win enough support within the party. Jim Jordan tried to take another vote to the floor on Friday, he failed to win enough support to win the speakership gavel. In fact, he bled even more support. And so after that vote, Republicans huddled behind closed doors and took a secret ballot vote where they essentially voted to dump him as their speaker nominee.
 
But there are serious questions about who if anyone can get the 217 votes it's going to require in order to win the speakership. A lot of members are really upset about the situation that they find themselves in. One of those members includes Dusty Johnson, he is a more moderate leaning member. Our Manu Raju caught up with him after that conference meeting. Let's hear what he had to say.

REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): America has got real problems. And this is a time where we need people interested in problem solving, not self- aggrandizement. It is time for big boys and big girls to stop with the nonsense and get back to work for the United States.

ZANONA: So now lawmakers will go home for the weekend. They will have another candidate forum on Monday with an internal speakership election on Tuesday. So that is the earliest we could potentially see a new candidate emerge. And already there are half a dozen Republicans who have jumped into the race. That includes Tom Emmer, he's the majority whip and the third ranking highest Republican. Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican who's also a member of the Far Right Freedom Caucus and Kevin Hearn, who leads the Republican Study Committee which is the largest Conservative Caucus in the House. But as of right now, it is shaping up to be a messy competitive race. These candidates have not had a head start. So it's going to be a while before anyone is able to unify around a candidate in the party. But as of right now, no speaker, no consensus, and no ability to govern.
 
Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, and take a look right now. You're looking at pictures from moments ago in the nation's capital, Washington, D.C., where the American Muslims for Palestine and U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations have been holding a march for Gaza rally there. Pro- Palestine rallies are expected in at least 19 cities throughout the U.S. today with events scheduled in Chicago, Brooklyn, Houston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

Our coverage of the war in Israel continues after a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BLITZER: It's been an unnerving two weeks since the deadly Hamas terrorist attack for people in Israel including of course those who live in the city of Ashkelon. The city has been repeatedly on the receiving end of rocket attacks coming in from Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond filed this report from Ashkelon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ADINA MORDECHAL, SUPERMARKET CASHIER: Go inside. Go inside. Go inside.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is life in Ashkelon.
 
MORDECHAL: (Speaking in Foreign Language)
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): The most fired upon city in Israel since Hamas launched its first rockets 12 days ago. Here, fear still gripped some, others carry on ignoring the sirens whales.
 
SHLOMO COHEN, ASHKELON RESIDENT (through translator): When we were outside, we're very careful. When we are inside, God is protecting us. Every missile has an address and don't need to be afraid.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): In a city where 90 percent of businesses have closed, this supermarket is a lifeline.
 
(on camera): There's a lot of businesses that are closed.
 
MORDECHAL: They're closed. But it's working because people have to eat. They have to drink.
 
DIAMOND: You come, what, once a week or?
 
ETI GILBOA, ASHKELON RESIDENT: Once a week, enough, and they are very afraid. If they send now rocket, I was lying on the road and to put my hands on my head.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Getting to a bomb shelter isn't an option for everyone here, prompting the city to help evacuate thousands.
 
HEZI HALEVI, ASHKELON CEO: We still have Around 35,000 people that actually live without shelters. So each and every rocket it means direct risk for them. So we are trying to find solution for them.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): More than 1,200 rockets have targeted Ashkelon, and while most are intercepted by the Iron Dome, about 200 have made direct hits, displacing families from their homes, causing casualties and shuttering businesses like this bakery.
 
DOR MACHLUF, BAKERY OWNER (through translator): When we got here, everything was in pieces. The door was out of place. There was a smell of gunpowder. A lot of nails and shrapnel would spit out. Everything was destroyed. We are starting to put things right.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): In the basement of an unassuming building, Ashkelon CEO takes us into the city's emergency operation center where officials try and shorten response times tracking incoming rockets headed for the city.
 <br>[12:55:11]
 
HALEVI: Rescue teams, police, ambulances, everything is going from here.
 
DIAMOND (on camera): So before the rocket even lands, you can see where it would land?
 
HALEVI: Yes. We have some estimation where it's going to land.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Until then, the first responders wait and pray.
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Ashkelon.

BLITZER: Thank you Jeremy for that report. For many people on the ground in Gaza, it's a nightmare scenario. Coming up next, we'll speak with an American citizen who is trapped in Gaza with his family. We'll have more on his efforts to try and get out that's coming up just ahead.
