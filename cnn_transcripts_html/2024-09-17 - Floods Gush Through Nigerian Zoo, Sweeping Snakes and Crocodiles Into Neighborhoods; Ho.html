COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Welcome to CNN 10. I want to start today`s show with a big shout-out to all the teachers out there 
 
 finding ways to keep your students informed and inspired. Thanks for making me and my team part of your day. 
 
Hey, Mr. Rothwell, love your creativity on TikTok. You and all your students at Bridgetown in Cincinnati, Ohio, bringing that energy, rise up.
 
Let`s start today with the latest from Nigeria. First, over a million people have been impacted by severe floods in northeastern Nigeria. Parts 
 
 of the region are seeing chest-high water levels with people, crops, and livestock devastated.
 
Nigeria`s Borno state has been hit the hardest by floods, worsened by the collapse of a dam there. Its capital city, Maiduguri, is seeing the worst 
 
 flooding there in 30 years. The heavy surge of water inundated half the city, damaging buildings, infrastructure, and severely damaging the city`s 
 
 zoo.
 
Officials say weeks of flooding across Nigeria have led to hundreds of deaths and hundreds of thousands of people being displaced. Floods are not 
 
 uncommon in northern Nigeria, but scientists say human-caused climate change is heating the planet, and they expect extreme rainfall events to 
 
 increase in frequency and intensity across almost all of Africa. This affected region of northeast Nigeria is a significant one.
 
Maiduguri has been a hub for humanitarian operations for years, while Borno state has been at the center of a 15-year armed rebellion by terrorist 
 
 group Boko Haram. Millions were already displaced there by that fighting, making those populations already living in camps particularly vulnerable.

MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  Delivering food in the most desperate of ways. It takes a good arm to throw supplies to people trapped on balconies and 
 
 rooftops in flood-soaked Maiduguri. Floods have affected up to one million people, with many residents still trapped in their houses after heavy rains 
 
 caused a dam to overflow.
 
Thousands of others managed to flee the flood zone, trudging through waist- deep water and climbing aboard army trucks, but after escaping one life- threatening situation, they are now faced with another.
 
EMMANUEL BIGENIMANA, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME:  Many, many people, I`m talking about over 200,000, 300,000 displaced people who are overcrowded in several 
 
 IDP camps, and also on the streets.
 
HOLMES:  Children scrape the bottom of a pot of rice at one displacement camp where thousands of evacuees are being held. Food and water already in 
 
 short supply, and people say the cost of goods has shot up since the central market flooded and local crops were destroyed. Some families say 
 
 they were given a tent and little else.
 
YAGAMBO MALUM-KACHALLA, DISPLACED PERSON (through translator):  I must go out and find some food for my family to eat. I have no money, and my elder 
 
 brother also has no money. I don`t even know where he is now. He must have gone out scavenging.
 
HOLMES:  The Maiduguri Zoo also flooded, killing more than 80% of the animals, although crocodiles, snakes and even an ostrich were washed into 
 
 communities. Miserable conditions all round that could get worse, especially for those in temporary shelters where threats like hunger and 
 
 disease are also likely waiting.

WIRE:  Pop quiz hot shot. During what Olympics were medals first made using precious metals recycled from used electronics? 2012 London, 2016 Rio, 2020 
 
 Tokyo or 2024 Paris?
 
The Tokyo Olympics are your answer here. Almost 80,000 tons of discarded devices collected from the public were used to extract precious medals for 
 
 the winner`s medals. 
 
Olympics organizers aren`t the first to recycle heaps of devices to extract precious medals. All over the world, mobile phones, digital cameras, 
 
 handheld games, laptops and more are dismantled and melted down to extract gold, platinum and rare earth medals. 
 
In Afghanistan, workers are doing this tedious job of stripping electronics for precious metals with little technology to assist them. In one of the 
 
 least developed countries in the world, the work offers a profitable salary, but workers fear the future of the trade may be short-lived, as 
 
 precious metals are increasingly swapped out for cheaper ones in newer electronics.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  In a workshop filled with TVs, computers and cell phones, these electronics are only as useful as what`s found 
 
 inside them. Workers break them apart using pliers or their bare hands, searching for gold in their circuit boards. Once the metal is extracted, 
 
 the micrograms are accumulated and stripped with acid.
 
It`s a job both tedious and risky. Those in wealthier nations often rely on technology with better safeguards for the same process.
 
SAYED WALI AGHA, WORKSHOP OWNER:  It takes a long time to dismantle everything. We don`t have the necessary machinery and we don`t have much 
 
 equipment. We don`t have much acid, which we bring in from Pakistan. So we can`t extract anything except the gold, not even the silver.
 
NEWTON:  The men make a typical salary for Afghanistan, around $166 a month in this workshop, the owner says. But while profitable for some, the future 
 
 of the trade is bleak. According to workers, more and more electronics are being produced with cheaper metals, slowly diminishing the amount of gold 
 
 to be extracted from new items.
 
MOHAMMAD YASEEN, GOLD SMELTER:  Japanese electronic products are decreasing day by day on the markets. And Chinese electronic products that are 
 
 increasing on the markets contain less or no gold, which is why the quantity of gold is decreasing.
 
NEWTON:  The trade was revived alongside the Taliban`s return to power in 2021, when the acid used to strip the gold became available again, workers 
 
 say. Soaring gold prices have also contributed to the industry`s rebirth. But just as fast as it`s been revived, the recycling of gold from 
 
 electronics in Afghanistan could come to a halt.
 
AGHA:  The sector is not expected to grow. The new electronic devices are more durable, and they don`t contain gold. I don`t think this business will 
 
 develop any further and will disappear.
 
NEWTON:  For now, men work meticulously on the floor of the workshop, maskless and gloveless, to make a living for themselves and their families. 
 
 But while Afghanistan`s gold industry thrives, the trade of recycling it may not for much longer.

WIRE:  Our story today getting a 10 out of 10, a miracle penguin. A six- year-old Cape penguin named Pen was born in captivity. And during her first swim in the ocean, Pen became lost at sea for two weeks. Being born in 
 
 captivity lowered her survival odds in the wild, but the persistent penguin overcame the odds and a typhoon before zoo staff finally found her swimming 
 
 on a beach.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A runaway zoo penguin has been found safe in Japan after being missing for nearly two weeks. The six-year-old Cape penguin 
 
 named Pen escaped through a hole in her enclosure and paddled 45 kilometers in open waters. With no boats operating during a recent typhoon, Pen 
 
 avoided collisions and fishing nets. She was later spotted swimming near a beach unharmed in what her keeper called a miraculous survival.
