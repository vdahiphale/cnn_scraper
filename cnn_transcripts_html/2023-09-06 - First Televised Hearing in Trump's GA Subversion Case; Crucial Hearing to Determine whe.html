KATE BOLDUAN, ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL: Live from Fulton County, Georgia the first televised hearing in the criminal case against Donald Trump and others. We have cameras in the courtroom as the judge is set to consider the timing of the coming trial there.
 
SARA SIDNER, ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL: Very soon Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy after making a surprise visit to Kyiv overnight. It's a significant show of support for Ukraine as Russia's war rages on there.
 
JOHN BERMAN, ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL: Tropical Storm lead barreling through the Atlantic as the National Hurricane Center warns it could reach hurricane strength today. Where is it headed? And do I need my jacket? I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner and Kate Bolduan. This is CNN News Central.
 
BOLDUAN: And important first in the criminal case is facing Donald Trump is about to play out. Cameras in the courtroom in Georgia, a live broadcast of the proceedings everyone able to listen in and see the action in court for themselves 1 pm Eastern that's when it's happening, the judge is overseeing the 2020 election case in Fulton County, Georgia.
 
He's going to be hearing arguments over requests to separate the cases of the 19 co-defendants. Consider the timing request for trial to begin. And also consider the scope if you will the evidence that the district attorney says she has against the former president and others. DA Fani Willis, she wants all 19 co-defendants who as of yesterday have all now pleaded not guilty to the charges that they face.
 
She wants them to face trial together. She wants that trial to kick off in just over six weeks from now, October 23rd. But as we all know, Donald Trump's legal team is asking for a later date, a much later date for him to face his 13 criminal charges alone. CNN's Sara Murray, she leads us off this hour. She's joining us now. Sara, what is everyone going to be able to see this afternoon when the cameras turn on?
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're going to get our first look at the judge who is going to be overseeing whoever goes to trial in state court, how he runs things, maybe some insight into his thoughts about whether these folks should go to trial as a group, when he believes would be a reasonable trial date.
 
The heart of this hearing is supposed to be about two of Trump's co- defendants, Kenneth Chesbro and Sydney Powell, both attorneys who worked on Donald Trump's post-election efforts. Both of them want a speedy trial. They do not want to go to trial together.
 
They do not want to go to trial with the other defendants in this case, including the former president. So we're going to get a sense of how the judge is wrangling all of this. One thing we do know that we are going to learn today because the judge has made it clear in his order is the district attorney's office sense of their evidence and sense of how long these trials should take.
 
The judge made clear, the DA's team should come with a good faith estimate was how he put it, for how long it would take for all 19 defendants to go to trial together. How long it would take if these defendants are split up into sub groups and then the number of witnesses that she might call it a trial, the number of exhibits that she might put forward. So we also should get some insight into the district attorney's case.
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
But again, this is interesting, because we're going to see a lot of this on camera. It could be a precursor to if we ever see former President Donald Trump in this courtroom, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Absolutely, great to see you, Sara. Thank you. John, Sara?
 
SIDNER: All right. With us now is former Manhattan Prosecutor Jeremy Saland. Thank you so much for being here. We'll start here. How strong is the case for a speedy trial? I mean, a defendant can ask for this, this is a normal course of things.
 
JEREMY SALAND, FORMER MANHATTAN PROSECUTOR: It's not a strong case or not, it's a right, they have a right to ask for a speedy trial. But at the same time, the court can impose a speedy trial on someone who does not want it. It's to protect the -- accuse not to force a trial within a certain period of time. And keep in mind under Georgia law, if a person does not get that speedy trial, that can mean the case is gone, dismissed.
 
BERMAN: So we're going to see this today, for the first time and there are four criminal cases against Donald Trump, this is the first time we're going to see any of it play out in a courtroom. I know it's about logistics and scheduling, which might seem pretty mundane. But are there any signs that we can glean from this, anything we should look for, as we see it for the first time?
 
SALAND: To a certain extent, it'll be a little bit of a teaser to the feature film, not everything that you will expect. But yes, because you're going to hear some of the arguments, you're going to see some of the, I'll say the evidence, not necessarily testimony, obviously. But DA Willis is going to have to set forth well, hey, I have a certain timeline. This is why I think I can have it here are my exhibits.
 
Here are my witnesses, not necessarily going to each and every one. But we know a general number that she's going to provide and say, this is why I think I can do this in this period of time. So I think you'll get some color and some insight, but not necessarily to the extent that the public would want to see.
 
SIDNER: When it comes to something being televised. So doesn't it change things a bit? You see that people will play to cameras, you know, sometimes the jury is sitting there, and they're worrying because there are a lot of people who have been threatened in this case already. What are the difficulties here having this televised because we all want to watch it, the public wants to watch it. But there are some difficulties here.
 
SALAND: Well, I think there are some dramatic differences. And I think before we even discuss the difficulties, its one thing for all of us to sit here and pontificate and say what we think is going to happen and what we believe should happen. But when you see people in that courtroom and you hear that evidence directly from the person who was a witness to whatever occurred, or seeing a particular document, it's so powerful.
 
It's an incredible tool, not just to craft public opinion, but to make sure that the jury and the judge sees what actually happened. So it's not just about what someone's saying, on the outside view as a notch as a juror, but as a person in the public is going to go and to see this is actually what happened. Wait a second. It's not what I'm seeing on TV. It's playing out right in front of me in real time.
 
BERMAN: 19 co-defendants in Georgia, what's the likelihood in the incentive for any of these people to flip?
 
SALAND: I think that someone is going to flip and you're already sort of seeing that. And you look at some of the fake electors like, like Schaefer and the three of those at Latham, the people who came together on that front. They have a reason to say I may be in that pyramid of that Rico conspiracy, but I'm one of the foundation smaller people at the bottom.
 
Why am I going to take a fall and be a part of something that I had didn't have my hands in? The law aside, I don't know about that phone call. I didn't show up at this meeting. I didn't do these things. And if anything, I was working at the discretion of the former president and his people. So I would not be shocked, especially if one trial has happened before and there's a conviction that others sort of flock.
 
SIDNER: And you have former President Trump saying, I don't know some of these people, which may not be good for those who he doesn't actually have any communication with, but who were taking some orders. Thank you so much, Jeremy Saland. That was really great analysis there. All right, CNN, by the way, will carry the hearing live, special coverage begins this afternoon. 1 p.m. Eastern, you're going to be here.
 
BERMAN: CNN News Central South will be covering that. And I will be glued to the television. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: A major show of support for Ukraine this morning. Secretary of State Tony Blinken is in Kyiv right now. He arrived overnight for this unannounced visit. And soon he's going to be meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. He's also soon going to be taking questions from the press.
 
Blinken is the first Cabinet Secretary to visit since the counter offensive began. CNN's Kylie Atwood is at the State Department for us. She's got more details on this. Kylie, what's the goal of the visit for the secretary? Is it to listen or is it to send a message?
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: I think it's both Kate, I think first of all it is to send a message at this critical moment. And this isn't a new message, Kate. It's one that we have heard from the administration time and time again. The Secretary of State obviously felt that this was a critical moment, a strategic moment to make the case once again, that the Biden Administration that the U.S. is fully committed to Ukraine.
 
He has said that in his morning remarks as he made this unannounced visit to Kyiv today. And he's going to say it throughout the day that the Biden Administration is with Ukraine, both in supporting them militarily, but also in supporting them when it comes to building up their democracy and making sure that they have a resilient economy to make sure they come out of this war standing.
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
He's also meeting today with U.S. diplomats, that meeting just wrapped. And he expressed his gratitude from the State Department and also from the whole of the U.S. government for everything that those diplomats have done. How challenging it has been on the ground for them also for the local staff.
 
The Ukrainians who have been at the embassy, you know, working with U.S. officials there, while many of their loved ones are on the frontlines. Many of their communities have been destroyed. Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Kylie, thanks for being there. We're going to keep watching this very closely today. Sara?
 
SIDNER: All right. Just ahead, today, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to try to squash concerns over a pair of recent health scares where he froze in the public for several seconds. We'll take you live to Capitol Hill. And a judge just handed down the longest prison sentence for a January 6 case, 22 years for the former leader of the Proud Boys. What was behind that stunning sentence?
 
You're looking at live pictures in Austin, where the impeachment trial for the Texas Attorney General resumes this hour. The latest from the courtroom is ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
BERMAN: So shortly, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to address his health at a closed door meeting with Republican senators. The 81 year olds condition has become a point of concern for some after a pair of recent incidents where he froze while speaking to reporters. CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju was on Capitol Hill. Manu, I understand you just had a conversation with a key Republican senator.
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I actually spoke to several of them on the way into this Republican at this Senate Judiciary Committee meeting. And still the question that is still percolating here in the halls is exactly whether or not Senator McConnell can continue to do his job. How long he can continue to do his job. And what exactly caused the situation, we saw two freeze ups and causing a lot of alarm among Republicans and Democrats alike.
 
And speaking to one of them just now, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, someone who has been an ally of Mitch McConnell for some time, he indicated that he is concerned about Senator McConnell's health, and also said that he supported him continuing staying in the job as long as he is able to do so, listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any concern about McConnell's recent freeze ups?
 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I saw him on the floor yesterday? Yes, I'm concerned about Mitch. He's my friend. He's my colleague. He's my leader. And I will continue to support him. Apparently, the medical report by the House physician was positive. So I am behind Senator McConnell continued to do his job. And we'll see where you know, hopefully medically this disc is fixed.
 
RAJU: Continues to be more transparent. Should he be more transparent?
 
GRAHAM: I don't know what more you could do that mean, he had the doctor released, he never explained why he froze up. Well, then he went to the doctor. I mean, I don't know why, do have what I do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAJU: Yes, so there are still questions here in the capitol among even some of the GOP senators who will be listening to Senator McConnell what exactly what happened there. We did see that the doctor's note that came out yesterday and said, really what it was not, according to the doctor, no stroke, no seizure disorder, no Parkinson's disease, among some other major issues.
 
But exactly why this keeps occurring? Will it happen again? That is one question that some of the senators have risen to me as I have spoken to them. And they want to hear Senator McConnell detail that in a bit and provide a little bit more transparency to the whole situation.
 
And we do expect Senator McConnell to talk about that for the behind closed doors. And this will be the first time he has met with them for since then, for over the last five weeks when the Senate has been in recess, so a lot of questions.
 
The question will be whether Republican senators are satisfied, how long Senator McConnell will stay in this leadership position. And we do expect also to hear from McConnell when he talks to reporters after that closed door meeting.
 
BERMAN: I know that discussion will be behind closed doors. But if I know you Manu, you will get a detailed play by play of what Mitch McConnell says behind those closed doors. We look forward to hearing it. Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. Thank you so much. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: And joining us now is a former Democratic senator from Alabama, Doug Jones. Senator, thank you so much for coming in. You like anyone who's served in the Capitol, you know, how busy this period of time is. This right after August recess, the sprint, if you will, to the finish all of the work that needs to gets done in the priorities in front of everyone in September. And then you have this concern over Senator McConnell and these freezing episodes. What did you think when you saw those episodes of him freezing?
 
FORMER SEN. DOUG JONES (D-AL): Well, you know, I was concerned too, I got to know Mitch, we disagree on so many things, but I respected as his position of a minority leader. So like a lot of people, I was concerned, the President of the United States, called him and expressed those concerns to.
 
I just don't think that he is in real jeopardy of losing his spot as Majority Leader at this point. That Dr. Monahan from the House has got incredible respect among the senators. He travels with senators, they know him. So I think his word goes a long way in kind of allay the fears of folks. But I think folks are going to be watching as we go forward, because it is going to be a busy fall.
 
BOLDUAN: It is going to be a busy fall. And in the midst of all this, we also have presidential primary that's playing out. And which means a lot of Republican candidates speaking out. I want to play for you, you've probably heard this, but what Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, said just last week about the Republican leader in these freezing episodes.
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIKKI HALEY (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I will say is right now the Senate is the most privileged nursing home in the country. I mean, you know, Mitch McConnell has done some great things and he deserves credit. But you have to know when to leave.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) BOLDUAN: As you said, you don't see eye to eye with McConnell, politically, basically on anything, but there's no question that he has long been a very effective leader or the Republicans in the Senate. What do you think it would mean, if he would decide in this period we're in right now to step aside from leadership duties or is forced to?
 
JONES: Well, I think it would be unfortunately, I think it would be a win for the Maga extremes of the Republican Party, they're the loudest right now, Kate that is calling for him to step aside. They're really the only ones calling for him to step aside. So I think it would be a win for those extremists, no matter who the minority leader is.
 
Now Mitch, is just really becomes an institution. And I think as minority leader, he can stay this course right now. Try to keep the Republican Party on a path that is a little bit sane in the Senate. What you're seeing is bipartisan efforts in the Senate. We've seen it for the last two years.
 
And I think that that's important for the country. I think it's important for democracy. So we'll see how things go. I think it's really, I find Nikki Haley's comments fairly distasteful, not only as a former senator, but also as an American and someone who is also getting on up there in age at some point, as she will. You know, I just think that we have to respect folks a little bit more than just playing the political game that she's played.
 
BOLDUAN: Let me ask you this. You know, the Democratic caucus has faced age and health related questions as well. There's lingering concern still for Senator Dianne Feinstein included. And it offers an opportunity to raise a topic that is often discussed, but never settled, which the topic of term limits is. Why will this never happen in the Congress, Senator?
 
SEN. JONES: Well, because he's got to be passed by the very people that you're going to limit their terms. And once they get in office, I mean, I think Senator Johnson is the best example of that -- on term limits. But then when it was time to give it up, he decided to the people of Wisconsin wanted another term.
 
And in fact, they voted for him another term. You know, the term limits think Kate, is at about, there is term limits every six years for the Senate in every two years from members of the House. And I think that that has worked well for 250 years, or whereabouts. And I think it'll continue to do that as we go forward.
 
BOLDUAN: You are not only, not only were you a senator from Alabama, your background is also, as so many people know, is a well-known civil rights attorney. Just yesterday, a federal court threw out Alabama's congressional map, again, after the Republican led legislature ignored the Supreme Court's decision and refused to draw a second black majority congressional district.
 
What's your reaction to this? I mean, they essentially said thanks, Supreme Court, no, thanks, we're not going to do exactly what you're telling us to do. What's going to happen now? JONES: Well, I think that you're going to have a special master, like the court said, special master, who has got up a mapmaker, they're going to draw a map that the court is going to give both parties an opportunity to talk about, and the court is going to approve amount.
 
I mean, you know how Kate, that's the way we do things in Alabama. We're the make me state and this legislature was just poking a finger in the eye of the United States Supreme Court, and the district courts. It was stunning, that they just completely ignored. The map that they had was worse than the one that we got right now.
 
And the court found that and it was a 200 page opinion, well documented, just like the one a couple of years ago that the Supreme Court upheld, ultimately upheld. And I think that this Court is going to do the right thing. I've always believed this Court was going to do the right thing.
 
And this is going to be a big event, I think for not only Alabama, but also for the South. And to really start making sure that we have a congressional delegations that reflect the diversity of the South, the growing diversity of the South. There's going to be changes coming in this country. They're going to come from the south.
 
BOLDUAN: Former Senator Doug Jones, thank you so much for coming in. Sara?
 
SIDNER: The former leader of the Proud Boys will spend 22 years in prison. What prosecutors say led to the sentence it's the longest one yet for a January 6 Capital attack case.
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER: Judges handed down, one of the longest sentences for a January 6 Capital attack defendant to the former leader of the Right Wing extremist group, the Proud Boys. Enrique Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison. A jury determined the chairman of the Proud Boys helped organize the attack on the Capitol in January of 2021.
 
Earlier this year, though, Tarrio was convicted on six charges including seditious conspiracy and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding of Congress. Prosecutor said Tarrio and his group came dangerously close to actually succeeding in their plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from then President Trump to the newly elected President Joe Biden.
 
Before sentencing yesterday in federal court, Tarrio apologize for the pain and suffering of law enforcement legislators and others that day adding, "The trial showed me how wrong I was". But the prosecutors pointed to my interview with Tarrrio in February of 2021.
