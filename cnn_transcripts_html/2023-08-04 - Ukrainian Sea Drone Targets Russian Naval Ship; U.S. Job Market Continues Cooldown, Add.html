(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Sources in Ukraine tell CNN that they targeted -- Ukraine targeted a Russian naval ship with an unmanned sea drone this morning in the Black Sea. Take a look at this video. This was obtained by CNN.
 
What this shows -- it appears to show the unmanned drone approaching the ship. It all plays out over about 30 seconds before the drone armed with explosives hits the ship. There were reportedly around one hundred Russian servicemen on board.
 
Russia's response? That it essentially didn't happen. They say they repelled the attack and that there was no damage to the ship.
 
But take a look at this. Another video has come in and appears to show a ship listing -- very clearly listing to the side and being towed in.
 
A satellite image taken this morning shows the vessel closely resembling the ship tied up at a dock at that port. CNN though unable to verify that -- the -- verify the -- conclusively the identity of that ship, John.
 <br>[11:35:14]
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Kate, let me show you roughly where that port is where this Russian vessel was hit. You can see Crimea here. This is the port the war took place right there on the Black Sea.
 
I'll pull out a little more to show you in relation to the entire Black Sea where that is. It's right here. The exact port's not on the map, but you can see where it sits there.
 
I'm joined now by Steve Anderson, a retired U.S. Army Brigadier General. General, great to see you. So, when we're looking at the Black Sea, and the ability of Ukrainians to strike Russian vessels inside Russian territory here, what's the strategic value of that for the Ukrainians to keep the Russians from feeling safe there?
 
BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Well, thank you, John. Now, what it means is there's no sanctuary for the Russian ships in the Black Sea. I mean, there's just about nowhere that they can't hit. You recall last April when they took out the Moskva you know, the battleship and the flag ship. They've been able to hit the Kerch Bridge a couple of times. Now, most recently, about two weeks ago, they took out the Markova or at least damaged it back in October.
 
I mean, this should not surprise anybody that they have the technology to be able to do this. I mean, that Ukraine has always been essentially the premier intellectual capital in and technology developments Center for the Soviets. And Ukraine, it -- was behind the development of like the Antonov-124 and the helicopters.
 
Igor Sechin -- Serkinski -- excuse me, Sikorsky is from Ukraine. So, the fact that they have this technology and they can leverage it, shouldn't surprise anybody. They've been able to make these surfboards on steroids carrying almost a thousand pounds using onboard cameras and a joystick.
 
I mean, every 11-year-old's dream is to be able to drive one of these things in new ship and make it blow up. And that's exactly what they've been able to do. They're leveraging their technology, and they're taking it to the Russians.
 
We've already seen the air drone attacks on Moscow. Now, they're doing the same thing to this port. This very, very vital port of which two percent of the world's oil goes through, then able to hit that.
 
BERMAN: So, General, often we try not to ask people in the military, political questions here. This isn't a political question, but it does involve a political poll. CNN just asked the American people should the U.S. Congress authorize more funding for Ukraine. And for the first time in our polling, a majority says no. 55 percent say no. The U.S. should not authorize more funding for the battle in Ukraine.
 
From a military perspective -- you know, look, Ukrainians can see this. They see our polling. So, when they see this, what actions might that spur for them or what concerns might it raise?
 
ANDERSON: Well, they're concerned obviously, on the election, the 2024, and how perhaps the Americans' support could change. And that's a very, very sad event if it were to occur. I just don't believe that the Biden administration has done a good job of selling this. The need to make this fight.
 
These people, the Ukrainians are fighting for all of us, not just themselves. I mean, the world order will change if this outcome goes against the Ukrainians. We've got to step up. We got to continue to support.
 
Recall 15 years ago, John, the United States was spending $300 million a day supporting the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. What we've done thus far for the Ukrainians is about two and a half months' worth of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
And this is a far more important. This is an existential threat to our nation. And we've got to support the Ukrainians. They've got to win. So, when I see polls like that, it disappoints me greatly. And I believe it's because the Biden administration simply hasn't sold the war to the American people like they absolutely need to do.
 
BERMAN: General Steve Anderson, great to see you. Thank you so much for your time, Sir. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: Coming up for us. A strong jobs market hasn't been enough to keep Americans from feeling sour about the economy. I'm speaking of those poll numbers. But in the eyes of the Fed, are today's new numbers exactly what the country needs? A closer look at the data.
 
But first, here's Dr. Sanjay Gupta with today's "CHASING LIFE."
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta host of CNN's "CHASING LIFE" podcast. We're experiencing a really hot summer and we're hearing that there's going to be a lot more dangerously hot days ahead. And when it gets really hot, you need to look out for heat exhaustion. You may start to feel nauseated, dizzy, have excessive thirst, muscle cramps, clammy skin. You can have a fast pulse or a weak pulse or both. Headaches, heavy sweating.
 
Now, if you experience any of these symptoms, you are probably in the throes of heat exhaustion. Obviously, you need to cool down, move to a cooler place, try a cold shower. If things get worse, however, if you start throwing up, for example, or you experience confusion, that's when you probably need to get medical help.
 <br>[11:40:06]
 
People with pre-existing heart conditions need to be especially careful in the heat as do the elderly. So, make sure your parents, your grandparents, your neighbors have working air conditioning so you can get somewhere cool. And everyone should also drink lots of water, obviously when it's hot outside.
 
If temperatures are high, make sure you're drinking water before you even go outside. If you have to work outside, try to drink at least one cup of water every 20 minutes. And you can hear more about how to optimize your health and chase life wherever you get your podcasts.

BOLDUAN: OK. New this morning, the July jobs report is out. And CNN's Business Editor At Large, the one the only, Richard Quest is back with us. 187,000. Explain to me why bad news is good news.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR AT LARGE: Because the trend is there. This is what the Fed wants. The reality is the Fed's medicine is this -- of higher interest rates is designed to slow the economy. And that's what they're seeing. This is the evidence. If you look over the last few months at the chart, you will see we have had a succession of lower numbers. And what's even more interesting, the revisions are getting lower, as well.
 
So, as a result, the Fed is saying what they want to see. Will it prevent one more rising interest rate? That's a moot question. I mean you'll have to see other data -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Why is that a moot question?
 
QUEST: Because it doesn't really matter whether you get one more or not. We're just about at the terminal rate, regardless.
 
BERMAN: Usually, we get to ask the question before we're told they're moot. Just to be clear. That's how we like to do it.
 
QUEST: Right.
 
BERMAN: But -- 
 
QUEST: I'm the -- but what it does mean -- what it does mean, just to sort of make it clear, is that this is going to last longer. If the rates will stay higher, for longer.
 
BERMAN: But the job growth too. And, look. The Dow seems to be happy with it. The stock market seemed to like it. Yes.
 
QUEST: That -- for exactly that reason because it suggests that they are done with raising rates, particularly the NASDAQ. Look at that. It's a very impressive gain on the NASDAQ. So, those growth stocks are showing -- Amazon's up 10 percent today on other issues.
 
BERMAN: You know, one thing I want to say -- 
 
QUEST: Yes.
 
BERMAN: -- is that we keep on saying 187,000 below analysts' expectations. Part of the reason I think, and you could tell me if I'm wrong as I'm sure you will.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: But the markets like this -- you know, if the -- if that's the war, if that's bad news if 187,000 jobs is bad news, then things are great.
 
QUEST: Right. Exactly. This is heading towards the soft landing. Now, there's a thousand and one things that can go wrong before then and Fitch still says there'll be a recession in Q4. But yes, it gives me great pleasure -- huge pleasure to say you're right.
 
BOLDUAN: What?
 
BERMAN: Richard Quest, you will be invited back again. Thank you very much. BOLDUAN: I love you, Richard.
 
BERMAN: Senior citizens replacing their pills with plants. CNN explores how medical marijuana may be life-changing.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Over the last 10 years, Dr. Sanjay Gupta has reported how medical cannabis has been life-saving for many, focusing several times on young children. This Sunday, "THE WHOLE STORY" with Anderson Cooper brings you the latest installment of the award-winning series, Weed. 
 
In it, Dr. Gupta examines how life-changing it might be for older adults ages 55 and up. Sanjay met with a group of seniors on a bus they called the CannaBus that was taking them from their retirement community to a dispensary in Southern California.
 
GUPTA: So, what are we doing today? What's about to happen?
 
BARBARA OILAR, CANNABUS PARTICIPANT: Well, we're going to have some fun.
 
GUPTA (voiceover): 72-year-old Barbara Oilar is a CannaBus veteran. And if that surprises you, it surprises her even more.
 
OILAR: Sure, I grew up in the 60s was a weed at the time you know. And it -- man, it was something new -- a new state (INAUDIBLE) because it was scary.
 
GUPTA (voiceover): But as the years went by, her body started to betray her. A bad knee, painful back. Given the choice of opioids or cannabis, her decision was easy.
 
OILAR: There are so many seniors who know what the value of using cannabis is. Because at our age, the joints, the aches, the pains, the -- you know.
 
GUPTA (voiceover): It's one of the biggest challenges of our health care system. There are too many pills. In fact, 1/3 of all Americans in their 60s or 70s, take five or more prescription pills every day.
 
GUPTA: Do you believe that cannabis can help replace what the medications are they -- 
 
OILAR: One hundred percent.
 
GUPTA: That's incredible.
 
OILAR: I truly do.
 
GUPTA (voiceover): 56-year-old Robin Savage was more hesitant. This is her first ride on the CannaBus.
 
ROBIN SAVAGE, CANNABUS PARTICIPANT: This is such a sting bond to it, but I wanted to be more knowledgeable about the cannabis. So, that's why I came today.
 
GUPTA: Do you get to know the other people on the bus here?
 
OILAR: Yes.
 
GUPTA: Have they become friends of yours?
 
OILAR: Yes. Yes, we do. Yes. We have a Cannabis Club.
 
GUPTA: You had a Cannabis Club?
 
OILAR: Yes.
 
GUPTA: What happens on the Cannabis Club?
 
OILAR: Well, we get together and talk about cannabis.
 
SIDNER: CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here with us now. You've been looking at this for a decade, and the effects of cannabis on people's bodies from children and now to older adults. What does it help with? What are you hearing from the older adults?
 
GUPTA: You know, first of all, you hear how many people are taking prescription meds, especially when you get to that age.
 <br>[11:55:01]
 
There were sort of three main categories, which I refer to as sort of the nuisances of aging. And they have to do with aches and pains, sleep, and mood. And you know, there's a lot of medications prescribed for this, Sara. I mean, opioids as you heard from Barbara, but also sleeping pills and antidepressants and things like that.
 
So, people are increasingly going to cannabis. This is the fastest- growing demographic of cannabis users in the country.
 
SIDNER: Wow.
 
GUPTA: And a lot of it is to treat -- or help treat things like that.
 
SIDNER: We had a map of -- just a second ago, there was like 38 states now that allow medical marijuana to be dispensed.
 
GUPTA: Yes,
 
SIDNER: When you take a look at this, is there some sort of standard medication or standard that is being used when it comes to cannabis?
 
GUPTA: That is probably the biggest challenge. This is still a schedule one substance, so this has been a very uneven evolution. Even though you have 38 states and DC, it is still federally illegal.
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
GUPTA: Which means that if people are watching right now saying, you know what, maybe I would think about this instead of an antidepressant or instead of an opioid, what strain, what dose, how to get it recommended. It's still a real challenge for people. And that's the problem when you have something that is federally illegal, but the people have spoken at the state level to get it, you know, more accessible. It's changing, Sara, but it's pretty slow.
 
SIDNER: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, thank you so much for this. Appreciate you.
 
GUPTA: You got it. Thank you.
 
SIDNER: And be sure to tune in to a new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER." One whole story, one whole hour airs Sunday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific only on CNN.
