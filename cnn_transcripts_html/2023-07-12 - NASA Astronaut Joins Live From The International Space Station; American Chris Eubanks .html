THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[07:30:00]
 
STEPHEN BOWEN, NASA ASTRONAUT, EXPEDITION 69 FLIGHT ENGINEER, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (via Skype):  Yes, it takes a while when you first get here. And as you said, I've been here before but I've only been here for very short periods of time. So, on a shuttle mission you're only here for a couple of weeks. You kind of just worked your way through.
 
Up here, now, when you're up here for six months it takes a significant amount of time -- probably about five to six weeks before it feels normal. And then -- even then you're still adjusting and adjusting. I'll probably be adjusting until the day I leave. And it's amazing.
 
You're very busy every single day. You basically work from 7:30 to 7:30 GMT time, so this is about mid-day for us. 
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR:  You know, Stephen, you talk about the long work days and part of that has been spacewalks. I want to show some video of you on a spacewalk. Frankly, this is absolutely terrifying to me -- the idea of a spacewalk. 
 
But I've always been intrigued -- kind of the process. How often do you do them? You spend several hours out there. How do you get out there? How do you get back in? Walk people through that. 
 
BOWEN:  Yeah. I mean, obviously, the process actually begins months and even years ahead of time -- our training. But also, the development of the procedures and the ground team coordination in getting all the systems and equipment ready. And then we do maintenance on board on the suits to get them ready. So, really, it takes a long process just to get to that morning of the EVA. 
 
Nowadays, when you get up in the morning for an EVA you start about normal time, but then you work continuously for the first six hours or so before you even get out the door to start your spacewalk. It takes that long to get your body adjusted and get the suits configured and everything ready to go so that you can go out and execute the plan.
 
And then, obviously, the coordination during the spacewalk is just beautiful choreography, actually. It's amazing to see the whole process and the huge team that comes together to get spacewalks done. And that's one reason you don't do it very often. PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR:  You have had such a fascinating career. You were a submariner. You're an astronaut. So you've been -- you've gone to the depths of the ocean. Here you are in space. 
 
I'm wondering what your views are on climate change given your perspective, right? I mean, the weather from space -- it might look beautiful but, of course, we can't say the same here. I mean, we've been talking about this all morning long. We've had catastrophic flooding. We've had extreme heat. Wildfires in Canada.
 
What perspective do you have from up there on the impacts of climate change and how we as citizens of the planet should respond to this challenge?
 
BOWEN:  Well, I think the biggest realization is that we live on a dynamic Earth. I mean, it's only recently -- even in the past century -- that people have started to realize now the impact that we all have. The impact that everything that we do has on the planet. 
 
And that dynamic sense I think is really what we're coming to grips with as we look out, whether it be in the ocean -- and during my time in submarines we were looking at -- so the northern reaches and Arctic and Arctic ice. 
 
And now, even during our increment, looking at the wildfires in Canada. That was impressive to see. As we flew over Ohio, the Great Lakes, New York, up over New England you could see the smoke as it layered over New York and D.C. You can see that dividing line actually, which is interesting, where -- I think it was a low-pressure system with the rain and New England was kind of keeping the wildfires south of them -- that smoke south of them.
 
So I think the realization that we live on a dynamic Earth is really what is the civilization we're coming to grips with. 
 
BROWN:  All right, we've got to wrap it up there. No floating mic but that's OK because we got a lot of interesting info and perspective from you up there in the International Space Station.
 
Stephen Bowen, live from that Space Station, thank you so much -- fascinating. And I'm just like in awe that we're able to even connect with him 250 miles above Earth.
 
MATTINGLY:  It's amazing stuff. Stephen, thank you.
 
BROWN:  Oh, floating mic. There it is.
 
MATTINGLY:  There it is. There it is.
 
BROWN:  There it is. He did it for us -- yay.
 
MATTINGLY:  This is your happiness.
 
BROWN:  Yes.
 
MATTINGLY:  This is your -- BROWN:  This is it.
 
MATTINGLY:  This is your happiness.
 
BROWN:  I'm done for the day.
 
MATTINGLY:  All right. Well, back here on Earth, or really on grass on Earth, American Chris Eubanks will take the court again in just a couple of hours in the chance to extend his incredible Wimbledon run. On the line, a shot at the semi-finals on tennis' grandest stage.
 
The 27-year-old Eubanks, who was toiling in tennis' minor leagues with some degree of obscurity only months ago, stunned fans by beating world number five Stefanos Tsitsipas on Monday. That win guaranteed him $439,000 of prize money, raising his career total more than 20 percent. 
 
Now he faces world number three Daniil Medvedev. Here's what he -- what the Russian said about Eubanks ahead of their match.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANIIL MEDVEDEV, RUSSIAN TENNIS PLAYER:  Here, he's on fire again. He just won ATP -- his first title. And here in the quarters beating Stefanos five sets -- unbelievable. So I know that I need to be at my 100 percent and absolute best to physically, tennis-wise, and mentally to try to beat him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[07:35:13]
 
MATTINGLY:  Well, joining us now because he had so much fun yesterday -- and we did, too, so we absolutely had to bring him back -- tennis Hall of Famer and Eurosport's tennis commentator Mats Wilander. 
 
I want -- I want to start with -- look, as somebody who won seven Grand Slam singles titles in his career, this moment for Eubanks -- we talked a lot about the mental element of this right now. Clearly, he kind of has flipped the switch to some degree. How does he hold on to that going into this grand stage?
 
MATS WILANDER, FORMER PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER, EUROSPORT TENNIS COMMENTATOR, TENNIS LEGEND:  Yes, thanks for having me again, guys.
 
I think you can because I remember -- and I was much younger when I reached my first quarter-finals at the French Open in 1982. I was only 17 years old. But I think that's irrelevant. You are heading into the unknown so you always get the question weren't you nervous? No, not at all early on because I don't know what happens if you -- if you win or lose in such a big stage.
 
So I think for Chris Eubanks -- I think it's the same thing. I think he's just playing another top player. And also, the style of game. I mean, he's in control of the points most of the time because he serves -- he has a very hard serve. He's six-foot-seven. Hits the ball hard from the baseline and he comes to the net.
 
So he asks his opponent a lot of questions but he also has a lot of answers but then he makes unforced errors -- but he is in control. So I think he's sailing way. He's not going to space but he is -- he's a very, very tricky opponent.
 
Now, Daniil Medvedev is so consistent. Here you have a player who doesn't make mistakes. He's won a Grand Slam at the U.S. Open. He runs better than most players. But he hasn't had great success on a grass court so there is no advantage for him there. 
 
In fact, Eubanks, with nine matches in a row, might actually feel like he has an advantage because he's got more grass-court tennis.
 
But very difficult to pick, to be honest.
 
BROWN:  I bet Eubanks would say also to what you said, don't underestimate me. Maybe I will be going to space. We'll see, right?
 
MATTINGLY:  Yes, it could be -- it could be.
 
WILANDER:  Yes.
 
BROWN:  All right, let's talk about the -- you know? And then look how far he's come given to where he was.
 
All right, let's talk about Ukrainian Elina Svitolina. She beat the world number one-ranked player to head to the semi-finals. To add to that, she is a new mom having just had her first child last October -- that's incredible. And she spent a year away from the sport raising money to help with the war efforts in her country. Just how surprising and inspiring was this victory?
 
WILANDER:  It's so inspiring. It's completely surprising, actually, because she's playing better tennis now than she did before she had her daughter in October. And, I mean, I'm guessing the mental strength comes from starting a family, so losing is not such a big deal because you come home and your daughter doesn't know that you even play tennis.
 
And then I do think that Ukrainian situation -- somehow, she has figured out how to use that as a strength when she's playing matches. We have some other Ukrainian women that have struggled with it and can't really compartmentalize the two, but she has. 
 
And Iga Swiatek -- you have to put that in there, too. She's done so much relief work for the Ukrainian people that emotionally, this match was nearly uncomfortable to watch. And then you realized that no, these two are pros and they are just playing tennis right now. 
 
So it's a Cinderella story and she can go far. She can go further. She can win the title -- Elina Svitolina -- and I cannot believe that I'm saying that. 
 
BROWN:  Amazing. I'm pulling for her.
 
MATTINGLY:  Yes, no question.
 
Mats, we've got like 10 seconds left but I do have to ask you --
 
WILANDER:  Yes.
 
MATTINGLY:  -- she said after the match her preparation for the next round would involve beer. Would you suggest that as a tennis Hall of Famer?
 
WILANDER:  Well, as a mom, I would suggest it -- yes, Phil. Well, I don't know. I -- you know, she -- the reason she's trying so hard is because she is more relaxed when she's on the court --
 
MATTINGLY:  Yes.
 
WILANDER:  -- whatever is going on in her private life, and she's even said that. So I don't think one beer would hurt that much.
 
BROWN:  Yes. Whatever she's doing is working for her so go have that beer and enjoy it.
 
MATTINGLY:  It's working. Same with Chris Eubanks. Do whatever you're doing, guys.
 
BROWN:  Yes.
 
MATTINGLY:  We love watching it.
 
Mats Wilander, we appreciate it, sir. Thanks so much.
 
BROWN:  And in just about an hour from now, President Biden and President Zelenskyy will hold a bilateral sit-down. We have learned that Biden and G7 leaders will soon announce new efforts to help Ukraine and its fight.
 
We're going to speak to national security adviser Jake Sullivan ahead of that announcement, so stay close.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:43:24]
 
BROWN:  In just about an hour, President Biden and President Zelenskyy will hold a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit. And just before that meeting, President Biden and G7 leaders will announce new efforts to bolster Ukraine's military capabilities. We're going to bring you that announcement live. But it likely won't touch on Zelenskyy's most pressing request -- an official timeline for when Ukraine can join the NATO alliance.
 
Joining us now, national security adviser to President Biden, Jake Sullivan. Thank you for making time for us. I know how busy you are. 
 
So, first, I want to ask you about this exchange at the NATO public forum that you had with a Ukrainian activist. It was a tense exchange and this activist was really questioning the decision by NATO, including the U.S., not to allow Ukraine into NATO right now until after the war is over and the different reforms that the U.S. wants to see from Ukraine. And you responded that look, you believe that U.S. and Americans deserve more gratitude. 
 
I'm wondering was that a preview of what the president will convey to Zelenskyy in the next hour, and does it just really highlight the tensions that you're kind of feeling and seeing on the ground?
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on, and greetings from Vilnius.
 
What I was really trying to communicate in my -- in my answer to that activist was the basic reasoning for why NATO, including the United States, but really all 31 allies were not prepared to admit Ukraine at this summit into NATO. 
 
And the reason is really quite straightforward. If Ukraine were admitted to NATO today that would mean NATO would be at war with Russia today. It would mean that the United States would be at war with Russia today. And President Biden and the other NATO leaders were not prepared to do that because they did not see that as a reasonable step at this point.
 <br>[07:45:14]
 
Secondly, every member of NATO has to meet certain democrat reform requirements before coming into the alliance. That's true also of Ukraine. It has made substantial progress along the reform path and there are more steps to take. 
 
So what the alliance said with one voice last night was we look forward to a future with Ukraine and NATO. We will work with Ukraine along the pathway to NATO. But we are not prepared to invite Ukraine today.
 
President Zelenskyy obviously had a different view of that. But President Biden will be straightforward today with him as he has been in every phone conversation and meeting they've had, laying out his reasoning, laying out his thinking, and then listening carefully to what President Zelenskyy has to say.
 
MATTINGLY:  Jake, I think one of the frustrations from the Ukrainian side has not been -- they understand the conflict piece of that. Have you -- have NATO members detailed specifically the democratic and security sector reforms that would be needed -- that they would need to show in order to gain an invitation?
 
SULLIVAN:  Well, actually, the way this process works it's not just NATO detailing to Ukraine specific reforms. It's Ukraine working with NATO on what's called an Annual National Program. That sounds like kind of bureaucratic but what it fundamentally means is that Ukraine has a plan that it has authored for the steps that it needs to take, including in security sector reform, including in democratic reform, including in anti-corruption. So that's all detailed in an existing Annual National Program that was referenced in the communique. Now, that program gets updated. And what the communique says is that
 
 NATO and Ukraine will work together on a set of priority reforms to put a special emphasis on moving quickly in certain areas to improve the resilience of Ukraine's democracy. But that will be a joint effort between NATO and Ukraine and that's well built into the process of obtaining membership in NATO.
 
BROWN:  I want to ask you because I think it seems like part of the frustration on Ukrainians' part and Zelenskyy's part is also just the ambiguity of after the war. I mean, what does that look like? When will that be? 
 
Some say look, this war is never going to end. Russia's never going to stop. Russia's been attacking Ukraine, annexing Crimea years ago. They're not going to stop. They're just going to continue.
 
What does the end game look like in your view? What does that timeline look like? I mean, we're more than 500 days in now.
 
SULLIVAN:  Look, I well understand Ukraine's desire to be in NATO as fast as possible. That is absolutely their right to seek admission and to press for it, and to advocate for it as President Zelenskyy has done. But every NATO ally, including the United States, needs to look squarely at the fact that admission to Ukraine into NATO at this juncture means war with Russia. That is an inescapable fact. 
 
Now, you ask a fair question. So do we have to wait until a certain time or day relative to the war? Do certain conditions on the ground have to obtain? We didn't put a mechanical formula down because war is dynamic. The situation is dynamic. And NATO needs to be able to retain the flexibility working closely with Ukraine on its pathway to make a determination about when down the road it makes sense to admit them.
 
And in the meantime, we're not just sitting around. We are providing an unbelievable amount of weaponry and military assistance to Ukraine. And today, the G7, led by President Biden, will stand up with President Zelenskyy to announce we're prepared to provide that security assistance long out into the future and certainly for the duration of the period while Ukraine is working its way on the pathway towards NATO.
 
MATTINGLY:  Jake, I do want to ask before we let you go do you believe that by the end of today -- I think Sen. Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is having a pretty consequential meeting with a Greek representative. Do you believe by the end of the day Menendez will be on board with sending F-16s to Turkey?
 
SULLIVAN:  I will leave that to Sen. Menendez. All I can say is that President Biden has been clear about his view that those F-16s should be transferred. It's in our interest and it's in the NATO alliance's interest that Turkey get those planes, but we want to do that carefully and in consultation with the Congress. And Sen. Menendez has an important voice in this so we will continue to stay in close touch with him.
 
BROWN:  Quickly before we let you go, there was a dinner with NATO leaders. President Biden decided to skip that. The explanation was he had a busy schedule. But they're NATO leaders. They had a busy schedule, too.
 
Why did he skip the dinner?
 <br>[07:50:00]
 
SULLIVAN:  Well, President Biden has spent, I mean, literally countless hours with NATO leaders over the course of the period since this war began -- multiple NATO summits, including a whole day yesterday, including a whole day today. So last night he wasn't the only leader who wasn't there.
 
But last night he thought -- he didn't have to attend and that he would have every opportunity to sit with all of his colleagues at length on all of the significant issues of our time. And not just to sit with them but, frankly, to lead. Because it has been President Biden who has driven the unity, the purpose, the forcefulness of this alliance over the last 17 months. And it is President Biden who has led the world in rallying a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
 
So his ability to galvanize, and persuade, and organize the entire alliance to a point where it is more unified, and more determined, and more decisive than at any point in NATO's history -- it's also larger than at any point in NATO's history with the admission of Finland and Sweden. That's President Biden's legacy when it comes to NATO and it's one that he can be very proud of.
 
MATTINGLY:  All right, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. This is the first foreign trip I've missed from this administration and based on my views of Vilnius I think I made a terrible mistake. Jake, we appreciate the time, man. 
 
BROWN:  Clearly having FOMO.
 
Well, overnight, Iowa Republicans passing a bill banning most abortions after six weeks.
 
MATTINGLY:  Plus, more than a dozen homes in Southern California have been evacuated because of landslides. What officials say is causing the ground to move.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We only have like 20 minutes when I saw the fire chief, so that was not enough to retrieve a whole life of memories.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[07:55:17]
 
BROWN:  New overnight, the Iowa State Legislature passed a ban on most abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Demonstrators representing both sides of the abortion rights debate packed the statehouse. The bill includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the
 
 pregnant woman is threatened, and fetal abnormalities that would result in death. There are also exceptions for rape reported within 45 days, and incest reported within 140 days. 
 
Now, Gov. Reynolds says she intends to sign the bill Friday at which point the ban would immediately go into effect. And this will put Iowa with a growing list of states limiting or outright banning the procedure.
 
MATTINGLY:  And in California, more homes have been evacuated -- Los Angeles County, specifically -- after the ground shifted, causing a landslide and extensive damage. 
 
Twelve homes were evacuated in Rolling Hills on Saturday. Now, a break in a sewer main has forced the evacuation of another five homes, bringing the total number to 17. 
 
The cause of the landslide remains unclear but some believe excessive rainfall after a drought created a ground fissure causing the ground to shift. 
 
BROWN:  And ahead, we are getting ready to hear from Presidents Biden and Zelenskyy at the NATO summit. Our live coverage continues next.
