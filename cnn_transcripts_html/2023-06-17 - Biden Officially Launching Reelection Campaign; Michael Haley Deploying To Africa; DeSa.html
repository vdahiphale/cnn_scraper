JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening.
 
On this Saturday, President Biden officially launching his re-election bid in Philadelphia as he picks up a critical endorsement from the AFLCIO along with 17 other big labor unions. His speech delivered a strong pro-labor message about the critical importance of American jobs.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Let me tell you something, when Republicans comes after what I've done, when they come back to try to get rid of all these clean energy investments and they try to stop the plan on infrastructure, when they try to do these things, guess what, they're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your future. They're coming for the future we're building for your kids and your grandkids.

ACOSTA: CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has more for us from Philadelphia. Priscilla, no surprise, the president wanted to launch his campaign in Pennsylvania, it's been part of his political identity for decades. And, you know, the 2024 campaign could come down to Pennsylvania. That is not beyond the realm of possibilities. Tell us what you saw today.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: It's a crucial swing state, Jim, and that was not lost on President Biden, just as much as he is counting on unions, as you mentioned earlier. These unions have really buoyed his political ambitions.
 
And so, President Biden was calling on them today to do the same going into 2024, and that's really what this rally was. It was revving up his re-election campaign as well as sort of threading the needle between his political ambitions and -- or I should say political identity and his personal identity. This is a region that he knows very well. It is one that he comes from, and it is also a place where he has sought support and crucial support going into these elections.
 
So, unions were a big part of today. Obviously, this was a union rally. And we heard from union members earlier, right before his remarks, all of whom were ticking through the issues where they have seen President Biden sort of succeed, including where the unemployment rate is today, inflation, manufacturing, clean energy, and President Biden ticked through those issues himself. But what it always came down to during his remarks was just how important these unions were going to be moving forward. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: If this room didn't show up for work tomorrow, this Monday, the whole country would come to a grinding halt. So, tell me, tell me who matters more in America? Folks, I'm look looking forward to this campaign. I want you to know why, because you got a story to tell. We've got a story to tell. We've got a record to run on. And most importantly, we're not only changing this country, we're transforming it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVAREZ: And when you talk to union folks, Jim, they also talk about knowing that President Biden was going to be pro-union back in 2020 during his campaign, but then they've seen the follow-through, giving them the momentum to come together is and coordinate this endorsement. The AFLCIO endorsed the president this week. It was the earliest that they have endorsed a presidential candidate. President Biden spoke to that and was grateful for that during his remarks today.
 
But these union groups really rallying and having that enthusiasm during this rally, which was about 2,000 people. So, a pretty significant event for President Biden as he revs up that campaign. Jim.
 
ACOSTA: All right. Priscilla Alvarez, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
 
Today in Charleston, South Carolina, GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley appeared at the citadel to attend a deployment ceremony for her husband who serves in the South Carolina National Guard. Michael Haley's brigade is heading to Africa in support of the United States African Command.
 
One person familiar with the details of the deployment told CNN that Michael Haley is likely to remain deployed through the spring of 2024 just as primary season is getting underway and when the former South Carolina governor is in full campaign mode.
 
In Gardnerville, Nevada, another Republican presidential hopeful made a pit stop at the Annual Basque Fry. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was the guest speaker and delivered his own pitch for change.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think what we're going to see in this election coming up is America's got to make a decision because we need to restore sanity in this country. We need to restore a sense of normalcy to our communities. We need to make sure our institutions have integrity.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Meantime, the latest CBS News polling finds little change in the race for the Republican nomination, 61 percent of likely Republican voters naming Trump as their current pick. 23 percent naming DeSantis. Let's discuss the 2024 campaign and more of this week's top political headlines.
 
Joining us now to share their insight, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist, Alice Stewart, and CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona. They host the podcast "Hot Mics From Left to Right." You got to check that out.
 <br>[17:05:00]
 
Alice, you know, even after this, you know, felony indictment of the former president, these poll numbers haven't changed for Ron DeSantis. Is he at risk of losing this status of being the sort of leading non- Trump contender for the Republican nomination, and who else might emerge if DeSantis just can't, you know, move this campaign higher up in the polls?
 
ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: It's really too early to tell because DeSantis is just now getting out there in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and connecting with the people and delivering his message.
 
But it's the darnedest thing, the fact that Donald Trump's poll numbers have not only solidified but they've increase in large part because of this indictment. Republican voters across the country, I'm speaking with many people and elected members of Congress as well who feel as though the Department of Justice is weaponized, the government is out to get Republicans, and they feel that Donald Trump is the victim, and he is using that to his advantage, and he is obviously campaigning on this.
 
And I've spoken with several of the campaigns, DeSantis including, and asked how this is challenging them out on the campaign trail, and they say, look, they're trying to push their message of what they can do for the economy, what they can do to fight crime. And they say, look, people aren't frustrated with Donald Trump, they're frustrated with the Department of Justice. And I think it's just a matter of time as we get through summer and we get to the issues of it's the economy.
 
ACOSTA: I guess, you know, my question about hearing this weaponization of the Justice Department stuff that we've been hearing this past week is why would President Biden want to see Donald Trump prosecuted, as many Republicans allege, when it seems President Biden wants to run against Donald Trump?
 
STEWART: Well, I mean, that's the grand question. You know, of course, Maria will say Joe Biden and -- President Biden is not the one --
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Joe Biden has nothing to do with it.
 
STEWART: -- that's doing the -- 
 
ACOSTA: Isn't there a little bit of a contradiction there?
 
STEWART: It is when he takes credit of what the Department of Justice does on other occasions.
 
CARDONA: But he has nothing to do with this. And as you know, there is a barrier between even Merrick Garland and what he is doing because of the Special Counsel. And so, I think that is the focus of what is going on with Trump.
 
But to go back to your question about DeSantis and not being able to move forward in the polls, it seems like the more Trump gets indicted, the higher his polls go up. The more that Ron DeSantis is out campaigning, the lower his polls and the worse he gets.
 
And so, to me, it's a question of -- you know, Ron DeSantis was right, this is a question about sanity, but it's about sanity in the Republican Party, because there is none. There exists absolutely zero sanity. What's going on now in the Republican Party is nothing but a conversation about chaos and criminality. And the big contrast with what is happening today with Joe Biden and his rally is that Joe Biden is able to talk about the 13 million record amount of jobs that he's been able to create, the huge accomplishments that he's been able to put forward for the American people, for the working class -- 
 
ACOSTA: Yes.
 
CARDONA: -- for the middle class. He's been talking about historic investments. Republicans have to talk about historic indictments.
 
STEWART: If I can just sort of interject my dear friend Maria, speaking from the looney bin of the GOP. Look, the good thing about Republicans is we have options. Obviously, right now, Donald Trump is the front runner and looking by all accounts to do well in the primary, but we have options. You have President Biden, and look, you have many Democrats that don't even want him to run for re-election. His approval ratings have been 40 percent and below for months and months, and that goes with the economy as well as national security. So, you have an uphill battle. With might be crazy --
 
CARDONA: Joe Biden has dinner whenever anyone underestimates him. He has gone his whole life being incredibly underestimated. And in 2020, look what happened. In 2022, look what happened. Every single time that Joe Biden has said, I'm going to get this done in a bipartisan manner, everyone comes out, and even, you know, people in my own party say, no, he can't do it. He's delusional. You can't work in a bipartisan manner. He's not going to be able to get this done, and he does in a historic manner.
 
So, I -- you know, I'm going to bet for him this time around. I'm not saying it's going to be easy. Nothing is going to be easy this election cycle, but he's going to be focused on everything that he has done thus far in getting things done for the American people.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. Former Vice President Mike Pence, you know, he has weighed in on this legal trouble for his former boss and current political rival. Let's listen to this is and talk about it on the other side.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know why some of my competitors in the Republican primary presume the president will be found guilty. Look, all we know is what the president has been accused of in the indictment. We don't know what his defense is.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[17:10:00]
 
ACOSTA: It's interesting. Mike Pence is sort of giving Trump the benefit of the doubt here for a period, but perhaps it goes to what you're saying, Alice, in that going after Trump right now is not really paying a lot of dividends. Asa Hutchinson, Chris Christie are kind of in the back of the pack and maybe Mike Pence is thinking he's got a -- what?
 
STEWART: It's a delicate dance.
 
ACOSTA: Clinging close to the -- sort of the vest for the moment, I guess.
 
STEWART: Exactly. I mean, obviously, the objective is not to alienate Trump's base and make sure that they understand that you're not attacking Donald Trump and it's more about the weaponization of the DOJ. What's interesting, you know --
 
ACOSTA: But how does that issue work for you? It seems like that issue would work for Trump? How does that work for Mike Pence?
 
STEWART: The interesting -- 
 
ACOSTA: Yes?
 
STEWART: It was just a few days ago the former vice president was talking to the Wall Street Journal and said the actions of the former president are something he cannot defend.
 
ACOSTA: Right.
 
STEWART: And we're seeing Nikki Haley and Tim Scott also saying that these are very serious allegations. But, you know, there is an argument to be made, we'll give him this, everyone's innocent until proven guilty, and let's hear his case in the court of law. But it's hard to argue when he acknowledges on tape himself that he's holding documents. ACOSTA: I do want to play another bit of sound for you, Maria, California Governor Gavin Newsom has long said he's not going to challenge Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination next year. But this week, during an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity he refused to say whether supporters have urged him to run against the president. I mean, Newsom was definitely taking it to Hannity, that was something that a lot of folks latched onto.
 
CARDONA: Yes.
 
ACOSTA: But he had this comment as well. I just want to play this as well.
 
CARDONA: Sure.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: How many times does your phone ping a day, people saying you need to get into this race, because they agree with me that he's not up to the job? That's a fair question.
 
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): I see where you're going with that, Sean.
 
HANNITY: I'm asking.
 
NEWSOM: No, and I'm not answering.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: He's not answering. Maria, what's going on there? What do you think Gavin Newsom is up to? Do they like this over at the White House that he goes out there and every once in a while, does these sorts of, you know, eyebrow raising interviews?
 
CARDONA: You know, I don't -- yes, I don't think he's up to anything. You know, Gavin Newsom has long been a huge leader in the Democratic Party, and there's no secret that he probably has broader ambitions. But the more that he is out there taking it to the Republican Party, whoever it is, Donald Trump, every single other candidate who can't seem to get a foothold in the primary, Sean Hannity, you know, all of it, I think, is even better for Joe Biden because that gives Joe Biden the opportunity to, you know what, Jim, he doesn't have to say a word about the criminality and the chaos that's going on in the Republican Party right now because it is so obvious to everything.
 
And like I said earlier, he gets the opportunity to talk about historic investments in America, while Republicans have to talk about historic indictments.
 
STEWART: All I know that when Sean Hannity asked if he's planning to run for president, it's a simple yes or no answer, what I think.
 
ACOSTA: Yes.
 
CARDONA: I can tell you right now, he's not running for president. ACOSTA: Let me ask you about Nikki Haley, we were mentioning her a few moments ago and we're talking about her husband going overseas. Hats off to him as always. But, you know, she's firing back -- she's going after President Obama -- Former President Obama a little bit after he called out Republicans of color for downplaying racial inequality. Nikki Haley tweeted this, we can put this up on screen, Barack Obama set minorities back by singling them out as victims instead of empowering them.
 
Why would she get into all of that? What's that all about?
 
STEWART: Well, look, it's an unfortunate argument, I think.
 
ACOSTA: That's not really true, is it?
 
STEWART: Yes.
 
ACOSTA: That he didn't do that?
 
STEWART: No, no. And this stems from a -- I saw a wonderful interview he did with David Axelrod on his podcast, and he was simply trying to make the case that, you know, he's, you know, mentioning certain people, but he felt that while you can be a minority and achieve great things and show that you can be victorious, he said that there needs to be an acknowledgment of our past and where -- how far we need to go. He was acknowledging -- he was mentioning that we need to be more of an acknowledgment of the racism in the past and what we still have today.
 
Nikki Haley and Tim Scott look at it from a different situation in terms of they have been minorities. They have risen through the ranks. They have succeeded and they are examples of the progress we have made on racism as opposed to victims.
 
CARDONA: You know, it's the whole argument of the minorities should be able to pull themselves up by their boot straps. Look, when my family came to this country from Colombia, my father felt that way. My father voted for Reagan, but he also understands that there are many people who come to this country and have no boot straps. So, how are you supposed to pull yourself up if you don't have any boot straps?
 
The government is there to do some good, to level the playing field, to maybe have some boot straps available so then people have the opportunity to pull themselves up. That's what Democrats are always talking about, leveling the playing field, giving everyone the opportunity to start from the same level playing field.
 <br>[17:15:00]
 
The fact of the matter is, though, that our history is such with the racism, with slavery, with a lot of the xenophobia and hatred that is out there, these sort of non-equal ways of doing things exist. And so, when you have African Americans, Latinos, immigrants trying to make it better in this country, there has to be programs that give them the ability to get to the same place where others already are. And that's not something that anyone should be negative about, it is something to be celebrated in this -- 
 
ACOSTA: And it's one of the great reasons why we have a Juneteenth holiday now in this country.
 
CARDONA: Exactly.
 
ACOSTA: I mean, it's one of the -- 
 
STEWART: That's exactly right.
 
ACOSTA: -- things that, you know, it's just been part of our past that's just not been talked about enough. I think that's what Barack Obama was trying to say in that interview.
 
CARDONA: Yes.
 
ACOSTA: All right. Alice Stewart, Maria Cardona, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.
 
CARDONA: Thanks, Jim.
 
ACOSTA: All right. In the meantime, some asylum seekers who were flown to California by people in Florida, now they say they feel confused, angry and betrayed. We have some exclusive interview material with them. That's coming up. That's next.
 
Plus, why the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico has moved onto an army base for protection.
 
And the guilty verdict the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, what members of the community are saying about the jury's decision. We'll talk about that in a few moments. You're live in "CNN Newsroom."
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:20:00]
 
ACOSTA: This week, California's attorney general submitted a public records request to Florida officials, including the governor there, Ron DeSantis, after DeSantis's administration chartered flights that flew dozens of migrants from New Mexico to Sacramento earlier this month. CNN's Camila Bernal traveled to Sacramento to meet the asylum seekers and find out more about their journey and what their future holds.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Walking the streets of Sacramento is a dream come true for this 31-year-old migrant. But the first time she set foot in the California capital, she felt confused, angry and betrayed.
 
Unfulfilled promises, says the migrant who asked not to be identified for legal reasons. It was in a shelter in El Paso, Texas, where she says two men approached her with the offer of a lifetime. A paid trip on a jet to California, and the promise of a job and housing. BERNAL: She said they offered her a job, so she was happy and signed.
 
BERNAL (voiceover): This, after she spent two months traveling from her native Colombia to the U.S./Mexico border. She describes the difficulties of the jungle, the train, starving, sleeping on the streets, begging for money.
 
BERNAL: She is emotional and says it's the worst, because you feel like you are at your lowest.
 
BERNAL (voiceover): The offer in the end was too good to be true. But it was made to a total of 36 migrants who traveled on two separate charter flights.
 
When we got here, we didn't have a job, nor a house, nor direction in life, said this 34-year-old Venezuelan migrant who was part of the first flight. The migrants are at the center of a political battle over immigration policy, with Republican governors like Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida sending thousands of migrants from Texas to Democratic-led cities.
 
BERNAL: We didn't come here for political reasons. We came here for work.
 
BERNAL (voiceover): But he says he wants people to understand their suffering and their desire to work.
 
BERNAL: She says they're human beings with feelings and families.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL (on camera): And the attorney general here in California is looking into these flights and into potential criminal liability. He pointed to kidnapping and false imprisonment. In the meantime, though, these migrants are really just trying to get used to living in the U.S., they say, after all the mental and physical suffering, they're just really happy to be in a place where they're being welcomed with open arms. Jim.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. Great interview there. It's just sad to hear some of those stories what they've been there. All right. Camilla Bernal, thank you very much for that report. We appreciate it.
 
The mayor of a Mexican border town is in protective custody after receiving gang threats. That's according to Mexico's president who says the Tijuana mayor has to live at an army base. The mayor herself says she expects the move will be permanent following an attempted attack on May 17th when she says one of her body guards was shot at. CNN's Rafael Romo joins us with the latest. What do we know about this case?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, what we know is that for the time being, Mayor Montserrat Caballero says she will continue to sleep at the army base with her son and her pets. Although, she continues to carry out her daily duties at city hall and other places at all times, as you can imagine, escorted by her body guards. She's the mayor of Tijuana, as you mentioned, a major boarder city in Mexico and a place frequently visited by Americans because it's located just across the border from San Diego. Mayor Montserrat Caballero has said that she was already the victim of an attempted attack, according to the mayor on May 17th. One of her body guards was shot at. That's when she made the decision to seek protection from Mexico's military. And now, she's announced she will be living at the army base.
 
Why is she being targeted, you may ask? Caballero says that since taking office last September her police force has seized 1,700 weapons from criminals and arrested 60 murder suspects, in addition to 1,700 other suspects accused of different crimes. But she told CNN she doesn't know who's behind the threats. Let's take a listen.
 <br>[17:25:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAYOR MONTSERRAT CABALLERO, TIJUANA, MEXICO (through translator): We found some banners where they asked me to stop the work I am doing. The banners were not signed by any criminal group, and I also had some phone messages asking me to stop working that weren't signed either.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And, Jim, just to give you an idea of how bad the situation is in California State, a former governor and also another public official have also been threatened by these criminal groups. Back to you.
 
ACOSTA: All right. Rafael Romo, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
 
Nearly five years ago, the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history, 11 innocent souls murdered by a gunman at a Pittsburgh synagogue. This week, the verdict. What the community is saying about it next. You're live in the "CNN Newsroom."
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:30:00]
 
ACOSTA: A jury has found Robert Bowers guilty of carrying out the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. 11 people died in the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The trial now moves to the penalty phase, and those same jurors must decide whether to sentence Bowers to death or to life in prison without parole. CNN's Danny Freeman explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Silence in the courtroom Friday morning as the Judge Robert Colville read the verdicts, 63 federal charges, guilty on all counts. 22 of those charges punishable by death. The jury agreed with federal prosecutors that the man who killed 11 Jewish worshippers and injured six other people in October 2018 targeted them specifically because they were Jewish.
 
JO RECHT, DOR HADASH PRESIDENT: I am feeling a sense of relief that after four and a half years, the world has heard again about the horrific acts on October 27, 2018, and the shooter has -- is being held accountable for those awful acts.
 
FREEMAN (voiceover): Throughout more than two grueling weeks of testimony, prosecutors showed how the defendant turned a sacred house of worship into a hunting ground. Body camera video and 911 calls revealed chaos and terror.
 
Jurors heard 84-year-old Bernice Simon's 911 call as she held a prayer shawl to her husband's bullet wounds. We're being attacked. I'm scared to death, she cried out, before she was shot and killed while hiding in a pew.
 
The defense did not dispute their client killed the 11 worshippers, but the shooter's attorneys tried to argue the attack was motivated by immigration-related conspiracy theories, not by a hatred of Jews. Prosecutors called that argument absurd.
 
JEFF FINKELSTEIN, JEWISH FEDERATION OF GREAT PITTSBURGH: This was an anti-Semitic incident, period, end of statement.
 
FREEMAN (voiceover): Community leaders in Pittsburgh say Friday's result was a victory, but the death penalty phase looms large.
 
FINKELSTEIN: While we're pleased with the verdict, very pleased, we know that there is still more to come. This only the first phase.
 
STEVEN COHEN, NEW LIGHT CONGREGATION: It's difficult to say the emotions we feel right now. One of relief, obviously, that the jury returned a full verdict of guilty to all 63 counts, but there's also a degree of trepidation, because this is just the first third of the trial. And in a sense, it was the least complicated part.
 
FREEMAN: Now, as we look ahead to the death penalty phase of this trial, one of the things we'll be looking for is exactly what kind of defense will be mounted. Remember, in this guilt phase, the prosecution called 60 witnesses to the stand, while the defense team called no one. But now, the gunman's attorneys will be fighting to spare his life.
 
Danny Freeman, CNN, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

ACOSTA: Here with us now is Jeff Solomon, a member of the Tree of Life Synagogue and co-chair of REMEMBER. REBUILD. RENEW., a campaign to strengthen the Tree of Life organization and fight to end anti- Semitism.
 
Jeff, thanks for joining us and talking to us about this. What does this verdict mean to you?
 
JEFF SOLOMON, MEMBER, TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE AND CO-CHAIR, "REMEMBER. REBUILD. RENEW." CAMPAIGN: Well, it's the closing of a chapter. You know, I think it wasn't really ever in doubt, because we know what happened there. It gives us, you know, some closure, a little bit, but also, a chance to talk about the path forward, and I think that's a really important part of the healing process. Glad to be through with this phase. Ready to be on to rebuilding.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. And you and your wife grew up in this neighborhood and were even married by a rabbi at the Tree of Life. You've been there for so long, have been a crucial leader in that community trying to rebuild and restrengthen the ties there. How do you move on from such a devastating tragedy like this?
 
SOLOMON: Well, first and foremost, you honor the lives of the victims and their families. I think it's -- you know, we're very thankful to the Department of Justice for the case that they ran. But we're also, you know, looking forward to how do we rebuild, how do we make the Tree of Life center a center that combats anti-Semitism and other forms of identity-based hate, how do we bond together as a community, both here locally, in Pittsburgh, but also, nationally and internationally.
 
It's an opportunity for us to use these tragic events as a way to launch forward into building a center that was really dedicated to not only, you know, memorializing the lives lost and creating a space for prayer, but also, a chance to create a center that really gives us an opportunity to combat and end anti-Semitism and other forms of identity-based hate. And that's really what we're doing at the Tree of Life, at the new center, it's a real opportunity to do something good for the rest of the world.
 
ACOSTA: Absolutely. And it's a topic that we tackle on this program all the time, and it is such an important subject. But, you know, I guess I'm wondering in reflecting on all of that, how did the country -- have you given some thought to this -- how did the country get to a place where something like this could happen?
 <br>[17:35:00]
 
SOLOMON: There's many, many root causes. I mean, you know, bias and identity-based -- honestly, identity-based hate has been a part of the American fabric for a while. And I think -- listen, today is the seventh anniversary of the events in Charleston, and we stand in solidarity with that community.
 
You know, this is not an isolated event. So, we need to look at these opportunities as a chance to band together. I think this is really the crux of it. You know, there's plenty of reasons why there might be division in the country, but each of us, any of us, all of us have had -- know exactly what it feels like to be excluded, and everyone has their own version of otherhood.
 
And one of the things we're tapping into here is the idea that all of us who have been excluded, no matter whether it's your race, your ethnicity, your religion, your sexual orientation, you can band together and work towards repairing the world. That's a key Jewish tenet, tikkun olam. And there's an opportunity for all of us, I think, who have ever been -- who ever faced discrimination to be in a position where we band together.
 
And that's part of what the center is going to be like and I think there's a real opportunity for all Americans to get involved here, if you want to help us to be -- to make the world a better place, certainly, the events of the past are an inspiration, and we'd like to be able to use that as a way to build forward.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. I mean, we mentioned you're the chair of the REMEMBER. REBUILD. RENEW. campaign. Tell us about that work, and it sounds like you're working with other communities who have been through similar tragedies. How do you see things moving forward?
 
SOLOMON: Well, it's a big project, and I think, first and foremost, we've got to honor the lives of those that were lost and their families and there should be a proper memorial. And for those that don't know, the congregation is still not back in the building yet. It's not a place where we can do Jewish prayer, but it will be, and I think a lot of us are motivated by the opportunity to ensure that there's Jewish prayer on that corner in perpetuity because that stands in the face of these terrible acts.
 
We are a community that's faced this kind of discrimination before and throughout history. And so, there's an opportunity for us to create a center that's end at aiming anti-Semitism. But anti-Semitism is not just a Jewish problem and it's a non-Jewish problem.
 
And so, if we're going to find a path forward, it's a path forward with everyone. And honestly, that's -- for those of us that grew in Squirrel Hill, that's what this community is actually about. For those of us that grew up in Pittsburgh, in Mr. Rogers neighborhood, you know, these acts -- this act is not emblematic or representative of who we are. And for those of us that live in the Pittsburgh diaspora and in the Jewish diaspora, which is what I am, grew up here, but I live in New York now, we're dedicated to rebuilding this because the world needs to know that there's a path forward of tragedies like this, and that's really what we're dedicated to doing.
 
ACOSTA: Well, you're doing great work, Jeff. Really appreciate your time and all the best to you and friends and family and people in that community. I remember when that happened, and it was just heartbreaking.
 
SOLOMON: Well, thank you.
 
ACOSTA: And moving forward, just all the best to you. Thanks so much for your time. We appreciate it.
 
SOLOMON: Well, thanks, Jim, and appreciate the opportunity to come in and talk about it. You know, when we have events like this, it's to honor those whose lives have passed. Really appreciate the opportunity.
 
ACOSTA: And we do honor those. We remember them. And we always will. Jeff Solomon, thank you very much. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:40:00]
 
ACOSTA: A landmark climate trial is playing out in Montana where the plaintiffs, all under the age of 22, are fighting to make the state greener. The case centers around a rare explicit reference in that state's constitution. CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): In big sky country, it's a story fit for a big screen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You got these guys. We love you.
 
WEIR (voiceover): On one side, 16 young people from ranches, reservations, and boom towns across Montana ranging in age from five to 22. On the other side, the Republican-led State of Montana, which lost a three-year fight to keep this case out of court, but is still determined to let fossil fuels keep flowing despite the warnings from science that burning them will only melt more glaciers, blacken more skies, and ravage more rivers.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Based on the evidence you have seen, there's a point to harm for these youth plaintiffs.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Harm now and accelerating harm in the future.
 
WEIR (voiceover): And the whole plot pivots around the Montana constitution that promises the state shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment for present and future generations.
 
NATE BELLINGER, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY, OUR CHILDREN'S TRUST: They filed seven different motions to try and have the case dismissed, and none of those motions have been successful.
 
WEIR (voiceover): While the first week included scientists testifying to the data -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. Stanford has fishing for bull trout and native cutthroat trout already been impacted by climate change?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, very definitely.
 
WEIR (voiceover): The emotion has come from plaintiffs laying out their stories of loss.
 
SARIEL SANDOVAL, PLAINTIFF, OUR CHILDREN'S TRUST: You know, it's really scary seeing what you care for disappear right in front of your eyes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How does it make you feel knowing that the state is not considering climate impacts in its permitting decisions?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It makes me feel like the state is prioritizing profits over people because they know that there is visible harm coming to the land and to the people, and they're still choosing to make money instead of care for Montanans.
 <br>[17:45:00]
 
WEIR (voiceover): While the states attorneys briefly questioned the plaintiff's ability to connect her mental health to the climate, they've mainly saved cross-examination for the experts.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the judge ordered that we stopped using fossil fuels in Montana, would that get us to the point where these plaintiffs are no longer being harmed in your opinion?
 
STEVEN W. RUNNING, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA: We can't tell in advance because what has been shown in history over and over and over again is when a significant social movement is needed, it often is started by one or two or three people.
 
RIKKI HELD, LEAD PLAINTIFF, OUR CHILDREN'S TRUST: I know that climate change is a global issue, but Montanans take responsibility for our part of that, and you can't just blow it off and do nothing about it.
 
WEIR (voiceover): Judge Kathy Seeley doesn't have the power to shut down any extraction or usage of fossil fuel, but a judgement for the young plaintiffs could set a powerful precedent for our Children's Trust.
 
BELLINGER: I think we're really at a tipping point right now.
 
WEIR (voiceover): The Oregon nonprofit is also helping kids in Hawaii sue their state over tail pipe emissions. And they've revived Juliana v. United States, the federal case that could end up before the Supreme Court.
 
CLAIRE VLASES, PLAINTIFF, OUR CHILDREN'S TRUST: I just recently graduated high school, but I think it's something everyone knows is that we have three branches of government for a reason. The judicial branch is there to keep a check on the other two branches, and that's what we're doing here.
 
WEIR (voiceover): Claire Vlases grew up in beautiful booming Bozeman, and like the other kids too young to vote, she sees the courts as the only place for someone like her to have a voice.
 
VLASES: It's hard knowing the power to make a change is in the hands of other people, especially my government, and I hope that as a young person we might actually have a chance to make a difference and for my life and for my kids' life, you know, not all hope may be lost.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: And our thanks to Bill Weir for that report. The young plaintiffs, we should note, wrapped their case on Friday, and the state has all of next week to mount a defense, and we'll be right back.

ACOSTA: Could so-called magic mushrooms ease depression and anxiety or even help fight substance abuse? Tomorrow night at 8:00, CNN's David Culver takes us on a mind-altering journey on the whole story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Embarking on a psychedelic trip requires a willingness to be vulnerable, to hold nothing back.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This wasn't easy. I imagined for any of you to just say, yes, let me jump in. And you're here for a reason.
 
CULVER (voiceover): Documenting it with cameras for a story to be shared with the world? Well, that suggests a near total surrender to the unknown.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let go. Let go with it and just go with the flow.
 
CULVER (voiceover): The experiences you're about to witness, they're intimate, they're exhilarating, and exhausting. After taking a dose of psilocybin, the psycho active compound in magic mushrooms, you wait.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Psilocybin brings you what you need, not what you want.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: David Culver joins us now. David, fascinating topic. The footage looks very interesting. What did you learn?
 
CULVER (on camera): I think, Jim, the realization is that this is not an if so, much as a when. I mean, psilocybin and the legalization of it is happening right now. It's happening in places like Oregon. So, what we wanted to learn was how is it going to roll out in the U.S. as it starts? It is going to Jamaica, a place where it's legal to grow, legal to consume. It was an opportunity to do that.
 
Now, partaking in it, that was another step obviously. And the reason I went forward with it was because of the people around me, the participants. You realize this is a really deeply, personal, intimate journey for them, and to have somebody just standing there with cameras, not really fully involved in the process, was not comfortable for them. So, they said, if you're going to partake with us, then we would be comfortable going along the journey with you and sharing.
 
ACOSTA: Wow. And that is a reporter involvement, no question about it. I mean, were you a little hesitant at first when you decided to do this and what was the experience like?
 
CULVER: Yes. I was very hesitant at first.
 
ACOSTA: OK.
 
CULVER: The reason -- but the reason I did end up doing that was because, one, my doctor signed off on it and ultimately, I wanted to do it, too. I mean, I'm not somebody who really pushes the limits on a lot of those things. Drinking for me didn't happen until it was legal for me to do it. I mean, I just play by the rules, right?
 
So, this was something that as I kind of navigated the process and talked to the individuals involved, I realized it was an opportunity to do it. And then, more so, to be a conduit for their stories, and that's the transformation you're going to see tomorrow night, Jim.
 
ACOSTA: There's a lot of talk about what the therapeutic potential is, medicinal potential is for all of this, I'm sure that's all going to be tackled. It looks fascinating.
 
CULVER: Yes.
 
ACOSTA: David Culver, thanks so much. Best of luck with the rollout of that special tomorrow night. And don't miss the all-new episode of "The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper" tomorrow night at 8:00 Eastern and Pacific right here on CNN. Stay tuned for that.
 
In the meantime, this week's CNN hero lost her two-year-old son in a hit and run accident. She needed to find a way to channel her problem into something positive. Meet the incredible Mama Shu 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[17:55:00]
 
MAMA SHU: After Jacoby got killed, I needed to just basically change grief into glory, pain into power. Folks thought that I was crazy, like, that lady crazy. She's about to buy that block and fix it up. Because they didn't see. I saw it crystal clear what it could look like.
 
It took about eight years or so to actually clean up the block. We started buying the lots next door. And now, we have 45. There were so many things inside of my head that I wanted to actually build for the people. I felt that that is what we deserve.
 
Beauty is healing. You can change your environment. You really can. Sometimes I just sit and I just smile, but then I say, you know what, I'm not done yet.
