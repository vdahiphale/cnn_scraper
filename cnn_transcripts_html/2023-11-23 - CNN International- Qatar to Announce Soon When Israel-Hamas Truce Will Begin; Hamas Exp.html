MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back. An update on our breaking news. Qatar's foreign ministry says it will announce in the next few hours when the truce between Israel and Hamas will begin. A diplomatic source says it's likely to start Friday, as early as midnight local time or 5:00 p.m. Eastern.
 
The hostage release and Israel's pause in its military campaign in Gaza were delayed on Wednesday. Hamas is expected to release at least 50 women and children over the next few days. A source tells CNN the U.S. has a working list of hostages they believe are likely to be freed first. Hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails are also set to be released. The White House says the delay is due to logistical details.

JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Well, we're not going into this with hubris or arrogance or ultra-confidence. We're grateful that we were able to get this deal secured. But as I said, it all now comes down to execution. And so, we're -- nobody's doing any touchdown dancing here. There's still work to be done and a long way to go.
 
We're hoping, hoping that implementation will start sometime in the next 24 hours or so and then continue for the next few days, both days of a pause where there will be no fighting so humanitarian assistance can get in at an accelerated rate and of course, getting all those 50 plus hostages out. Now, they'll come out in increments. They won't all come out together and that's why this is a multi-day process.

FOSTER: Joining me now, Ruby Chen, father of a missing IDF soldier who's believed to be kidnapped by Hamas. And our thoughts are with you today, because realistically, he's not going to be on the list, is he, as a serving member of the military?
 
RUBY CHEN, FATHER OF MISSING IDF SOLDIER:  Morning 48 to you as well. No. So, our expectations are as you stated, but we have 240 new family members. And I'm sure, you as well, when you have a family member in a joyful event, you should celebrate together with them. And that's how we feel as well.
 
FOSTER:  What do you make of the deal and you know, how it's played out? Do you agree with it? Are there other things about it you don't like?
 
CHEN:  I think it's difficult to comment on that without having full information of the dynamics. What we do see, and are hopeful, is that the framework that was established here, I think we need to thank the Biden administration and all of its team members that have been working around the clock to make this deal happen, as well as the Qatar government as being the broker here to have this framework duplicated for the next leg of release of hostages until all of the hostages are released, as this is a humanitarian issue.
 
FOSTER:  What went through your mind when you heard about the delay?
 
CHEN:  Again, I think it's known tactics that we've seen in the past. You know, when you get to the finish line, you're not at the finish line until you pass the finish line. So, I think hopefully what has been noted in the past, different logistic issues that need to be put in place.
 
One thing that is still a bit unknown is the ability of the international, like, costs to be able to visit the remaining hostages and provide the medical attention. I think this is something that we should be spending some time on discussing.
 
We -- I think all of us have something here in common where on this planet, you know, we walk the planet together. And while walking on this planet, there are certain protocols that have been put in place, even in time of conflict. And unfortunately, Hamas is not abiding to the international law when it comes to times of conflict and how to deal with hostages. And I think the question that we need to ask Hamas, is this an organization that wants to walk with all the other civilized people in this planet, or they want to be treated like ISIS?
 
And they should and they must provide that attempt on the international that cost 48 days to be able to meet -- to see the hostages and see that they're being taken care of and provided medical attention.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
FOSTER:  And some of the other families pretty furious, as you'll be aware, with the government saying they should be focusing on getting the hostages out before destroying Hamas. Is that your view as well? How widely shared is that view amongst the families? CHEN:  Again, going back to my previous comment, it's difficult to comment when you don't have full information. But I do think that the components of the timing, the hostages has changed a bit on behalf of the government of Israel after seeing -- excuse me -- the full support of the population of the State of Israel being behind the hostage family.
 
And because of that, I think that the Israeli government has been highly motivated to get a deal done. And this is what we've seen and also been conveying -- conveyed by other governments that have been supporting this process that Israel indeed wants a deal to get done.
 
FOSTER:  Ruby Chen, I really appreciate your time at this very difficult time for you. Thank you.
 
Now, as people in Gaza wait for a pause in the fighting that's part of that hostage deal, Mohamed Khaled, a Palestinian teen, says he hopes the humanitarian truce is extended and becomes permanent.

MOHAMED KHALED, LOST LEG IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN GAZA (through translator):  I want them to extend this to a full humanitarian truth so we can live free and safe. Four days will not be enough to even bury the martyrs. And even if they are able to do so, the tragedies will then resume. I wish they extend the truce and we have a permanent ceasefire.

FOSTER:  The 13-year-old lost a leg in an Israeli air striking Gaza. Now, he's in Egypt for treatment. The teen says he was at home with his family in Central Gaza when a missile went through the ceiling of their home and exploded next to him. It's severed his leg.
 
Still ahead, Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's war with Hamas will go on even after the release of the hostages. We'll look at the political fallout for the prime minister.

FOSTER:  We're waiting now for a word on when the truce between Israel and Hamas will begin. Qatar's foreign ministry says it will make an announcement in the next few hours with a diplomatic source saying that truce is likely to start on Friday.
 
The news comes after Israel said on Wednesday that the expected release of hostages and a pause in fighting with Hamas were delayed. Both U.S. and Israeli officials pointed to logistical details for that delay.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Citizens of Israel, I'd like to be clear, the war continues. The war continues. We will continue with it until all our goals are achieved. To bring back the hostages, to demolish Hamas.

FOSTER:  Joining me now from Jerusalem, Yaakov Katz, senior columnist and editor at "The Jerusalem Post." Thank you so much for joining us.
 
There's still a lack of clarity as to why this truce was delayed. What's your understanding about these logistical details they've been heading into?
 
YAAKOV KATZ, SENIOR COLUMNIST AND EDITOR, THE JERUSALEM POST AND AUTHOR, "SHADOW STRIKE":  These are very complicated situations, right? We -- Israel is not talking directly with Hamas. It's only working through intermediaries and mediators such as the Qataris who are in Doha. The Qataris are talking to Hamas leaders that live in Doha, but they also don't necessarily have direct line to the Hamas leaders who are underground, they're hiding inside some bomb shelter or bunker in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. So, it's very technical, it's very complicated, and the steps move very slowly.
 
With that said, it's also -- there's a lot of pressure, right? Israel still has forces on the ground inside Gaza. Those operations are continuing. And part of what Hamas's strategy, I think, here is to get Israel to stop for a few days so it can regroup, rearm, redeploy and be better prepared for continued offensive later on.
 
FOSTER:  There's been opposition, obviously, within Israel to this pause in the fighting. One of the reasons being that it may mean that the battle to topple Hamas is over. Just explain that thinking.
 
KATZ:  You're right, Max. You know, on the one hand, you have the situation where everybody wants to do whatever is possible to get back these hostages. The fact that so many civilians were taken, there's over 235 Israelis who are still being held inside the Gaza Strip -- or hostages in the Gaza Strip, and they're under this deal, they're only getting back about 50 of the women and children, and the elderly women, but there's still going to be a lot who will be left inside Gaza.
 
So, Israel -- Israelis are very much aligned that everything needs to be done to get back the hostages. With that said, Israelis are also very aligned and support the government's offensive and the military operation to take down Hamas, to degrade Hamas's capabilities, to remove it from power in Gaza and prevent it from ever, ever being able to carry out the atrocities and massacre like it did on October 7th.
 
Now, if the operation stops now, when only half of Gaza has been conquered by Israel, and still so many thousands of Hamas fighters alive and still armed to the teeth in the south of Gaza, with the Hamas leadership still intact, the operation is not yet a success. And I think the concern is that we could very see how this plays out, that ultimately, the operation just comes to an end.
 
There will be international pressure. Hamas will trickle out hostages every single day. Under the deal, it's 10 a day. They'll offer at day five. Give us another couple of days. We'll give you a few more. The Americans, the Europeans will be pressuring Israel to agree to a long- term ceasefire. What does this mean for the continued security, though, of the State of Israel? And that is the question that hovers above everything right now.
 
FOSTER:  And what position is Netanyahu in right now? Because you've seen the polling showing his polling numbers are pretty awful. But I guess as long as he keeps that coalition cabinet together, he stays in post.
 
KATZ:  Netanyahu stays in post for now, and he's able to keep that cabinet and the coalition together for now. And I mention -- I emphasize for now, because the day this war is over there will be a day of reckoning that will also have to come to his doorstep. He's been the one official from looking at the top military security establishment and the defense minister.
 
Everyone has said, we take personal responsibility for the failures of October 7th that led to the outbreak of this war and to Israel being caught by surprise. He's the only one who refuses to take responsibility, even though he's been asked so many different times. And I think it's telling. There's two reasons why.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
One is he doesn't believe he's responsible. But the second one is that he believes he has the day after politically. So, if he takes responsibility now, he's essentially preventing himself from being able to stay in power. He wants to stay in power, even though, my opinion, I think the opinion of a lot of people, and you said the polls, right, his rating, his approval ratings are in the 20 percentile -- percentiles, is that he believes that he can stay in power, even though he is the ultimate person who should be held responsible for what happened here.
 
FOSTER:  And what do you make of the international support amongst Israeli allies? Is that fracturing? Because some are suggesting that perhaps European leaders, you know, they remain behind Israel's right to defend itself, but at the same time feel that the number of civilian casualties is too high, and there needs to be a reset there. So, perhaps a slight separation between the views of the U.S. and Europe on this one.
 
KATZ:  You know, Max, you touch upon a very important point, and that is the international support for Israel's continued offensive in Gaza. And it's important, right, because the military operation requires the resilience of the Israeli people, it requires the military to have the capabilities, the munitions, the arms, the military platforms it needs, but it also requires Israel to have the international legitimacy and for its allies to support it.
 
Today, we saw the visit of David Cameron, the former British prime minister, now foreign secretary, visiting one of the Israeli communities that was ravaged and rampaged through by those Hamas terrorists on October 7th. He's here in Israel.
 
I think the support still stands, and I'll tell you why, I think that the political leadership in these countries, they all understand that what happened here in Israel on October 7th, it started here, but it could -- they could easily envision and imagine it one day happening in their own countries.
 
When you look at the bridge of London and you see the hundreds of thousands of people who are walking there and chanting intifada and they are chanting for jihad and you see the pictures that are coming out of France and the explosion of antisemitism, this is a battle against all of the values that we should all share, all people of the West and all democratic people.
 
And while today they attack Israel, tomorrow it could be in the U.K., it could be in France and Germany, it could be in the United States of America. And that is why these leaders should stand strong and understand that this is a battle for all civilized life today on this planet.
 
FOSTER:  Yaakov Katz in Jerusalem, really appreciate your analysis today. Thank you.
 
KATZ:  Thank you.
 
FOSTER:  Multiple U.S. border crossings into Canada were shut down on Wednesday when a speeding car exploded in a fireball on the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls. The latest on the investigation just ahead.

 <br>[04:50:00]
 
FOSTER:  Welcome back. Recapping our breaking news, Qatar's foreign ministry says it will announce in the next few hours when the truce between Israel and Hamas will begin. A diplomatic source says it's likely to start Friday midnight local time at the earliest.
 
The news comes after Israel said on Wednesday that the expected release of hostages and a pause in fighting with Hamas were delayed. An Israeli official tells CNN part of the reason for the day was Israel had not yet received the names of the first hostages to be released. However, CNN can report U.S. officials have a working list of 10 hostages likely to be released on day one.
 
Ahead of the expected truce, Israeli forces continue their ground and air operations on Wednesday, striking parts of Northeastern and Central Gaza. And despite pledging his full support for the hostage deal with Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, the war against Hamas will continue.
 
I want to get some other stories from around the world for you now. The FBI has concluded that a deadly car explosion on Wednesday morning near the U.S. Canada border was not a terrorist act, but rather a tragic incident. Investigators believe a husband and wife had left a casino sometime before their vehicle crashed in a fireball near the Rainbow Bridge crossing in full view of surveillance cameras. CNN's Brynn Gingras has the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  New York Governor Kathy Hochul saying there is no indication of a terrorist attack at this point in the investigation of that explosion that happened at the Rainbow Bridge crossing there, the crossing between U.S. and Canadian border.
 
What we're learning from sources is that a vehicle was traveling on a local road in Niagara Falls at a very high rate of speed before it hit a curb, went airborne and then eventually collided and exploded really into the secondary screening at that border crossing.
 
And investigators from the federal -- at the federal level, state level and local are looking at surveillance video in that area, getting a registration for that car and sort of tracing its movements prior to this explosion happening to get a better sense of exactly what happened.
 
The governor actually saying that the debris field of this explosion spans about 13 or 14 boosts at that crossing, and only an engine is left of that car. So, that, of course, as you can imagine, is making this investigation go a little bit slower than typically one would go because of the size of that debris field.
 
But the big point here, though, is there -- at this point, it does not seen there's any indication of terrorist activity, which was, of course, something that everyone was concerned about as we're all in a state -- in the height -- especially authorities are in a state of heightened alert in response to what is happening overseas, but also because of what is happening right now in this country is our Thanksgiving holiday.
 
We know also in response to this in the immediate aftermath that borders were -- the border checkpoints were all shut down. We know that some have reopened and we also know that there was extra security measures that were taken at the airports in that area and even really in some U.S. major cities in the northeast. But we know some of that has been tamped down.
 
But certainly, heightened security is the theme here as we head into the holiday, and that was the case even before this incident happened. But again, the headline here that it does not appear to be a terrorist incident.
 
I'm Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York.

FOSTER:  Kentucky has declared a state of emergency and is urging residents of Livingston to evacuate their homes after a train derailment nearby. The CSX railway company says at least 16 cars jumped the tracks on Wednesday afternoon. Two cars contain molten sulfur which spilled and is burning.
 
The fear is that that could lead to the release of sulfur dioxide. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the chemical can cause irritation and breathing difficulties. The railway has sent air monitoring equipment to the area.
 
Most of the U.S. will see dry weather this Thanksgiving Day with seasonable temperatures expected across much of the country. Weather across the eastern part of the country disrupted travel on Wednesday. But the roads and skies have largely cleared up with no major storms expected today and few people on the go.
 
But fresh snow is expected to powder the Rockies just in time for some holiday skiing. And then the temperatures will drop in the days ahead as a cold front sweep across the central U.S.
 
In just a few hours this year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off in New York. The holiday tradition enters its 97th year with an earlier start time. Police say there are no credible or specific security threats that could derail the festivities, which include live music performances from singers and marching bands from across the country. The weather expected to cooperate as well. And seven new balloons this year expected to dazzle the crowds.
 
Thanks for joining me here on "CNN Newsroom." I'm Max Foster in London. I'll be back with more of our continuing coverage of the Israel Hamas war next.
