ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world, and to everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church.
 
Just ahead, two of the Democratic Party's biggest stars electrified the crowd on night two of the Democratic National Convention, as Barack and Michelle Obama each made a forceful pitch for Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.
 
And America's top diplomat wraps up his latest trip to the Middle East. But a concrete deal to end the fighting in Gaza and bring Israeli hostages home remains elusive. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, This is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Well, delegates to the Democratic National Convention are raving about a pair of speeches from two of the party's biggest stars, Barack and Michelle Obama. The former president delivered a rousing endorsement of Kamala Harris Tuesday night, calling her one of the most qualified people ever to run for president. 
 
Obama also paid tribute to Joe Biden as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a time of great danger.
 
Former First Lady Michelle Obama defended Vice President Harris against attacks from Donald Trump, accusing him of ugly, misogynistic, racist lies, and she got some of the loudest applause of the night with the line Hope is making a comeback.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: And throughout her entire life, that's what we've seen from Kamala Harris, the steel of her spine, the steadiness of her upbringing, the honesty of her example, and yes, the joy of her laughter and her light. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Earlier, delegates heard from the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff. He told the story of how he and Harris met, eventually getting married 10 years ago, and he praised her ability as a public servant standing up to bullies and relying on her empathy as her strength. 
 
DOUG EMHOFF, SECOND GENTLEMAN OF THE UNITED STATES: Comma is a joyful warrior. It's doing for her country, what she has always done for the people that she loves. Her passion will benefit all of us when she's our president. 
 
And here's the thing about joyful warriors, they're still warriors, and Kamala is as tough as it comes. Just ask the criminals, the global gangsters and the witnesses before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

CHURCH: Ron Brownstein is a CNN senior political analyst and a senior editor at The Atlantic. He joins me now from Chicago. Great to have you with us. 
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Rosemary, hi, good to be here. 
 
CHURCH: So, the second night of the DNC offered up a stunning line up of speakers and performers, with the headliner address from former President Barack Obama, who called this an all hands on deck moment, while the former First Lady Michelle Obama spoke before him, saying, hope is making a comeback. 
 <br>[02:05:12]
 
So, how critical is it for Kamala Harris to have this caliber of support in such a tight race? 
 
BROWNSTEIN: It was an extremely strong night for the Democrats, I thought, much more thematically interesting and coherent than the first night.
 
You know, on the one hand, we saw a number of speeches that were more about humanizing Kamala Harris than about explicating her agenda, really trying to convince voters that she would defend the middle class because she was a product of the middle class, essentially the connection that Bill Clinton made in his famous I still believe in a place called Hope speech in 1992.
 
But even more striking to me was the way that this night of the convention dealt with the potential threats of a second Trump term in a very different way, I think, than Joe Biden had been doing.
 
Because tonight was less about preventing the darkness that could come from a vindictive Donald Trump in the White House again, than it was about encouraging voters to envision the morning, which, you know, we heard specifically, almost like a morning in America of a less divided America. It reminded me that a Democratic consultant said to me last week that the last voters Harris needs, she has to inspire, not scare. And I thought tonight was a striking pivot in that direction. CHURCH: Right. And we also saw Republican speakers Tuesday night at the DNC, including former Trump Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who revealed Trump's true feelings about his own supporters, and it wasn't complimentary. 
 
What do the Democrats gain from a lineup of GOP speakers like this who have had direct dealings with Trump? 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, first of all, it is a way to reinforce what I just said. I really think the overriding message of tonight was, as a country, we don't have to live like this. We don't have to live at this nice edge with, you know, politics interrupting every Thanksgiving dinner and Sunday afternoon.
 
President Obama's speech emphasizing the opportunity, the necessity of seeing kind of the shared experience, even in people you disagree with, I think, was summoning voters toward envisioning something different, and it gives another dimension to that, we can't go back. We're not going back argument. 
 
Now, you know, electorally, there are not a lot of hardcore Republicans who are going to vote for Kamala Harris, no matter how deep their concerns about Donald Trump, but there are clearly, I mean, in the last few elections, we have seen -- the results we have seen in states like Georgia and Arizona and even Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin would not have been possible if there were not a substantial number of independents who previously leaned toward Republicans, who are now voting for Democrats because they can't abide the Trump definition of the party, and this was clearly an attempt to create a permission structure for more of those voters to make that transition. 
 
CHURCH: And Ron, we have learned that more people watched the first night of the DNC than the first night of the RNC. And given Trump's obsession with crowd size and ratings, how do you think he is processing that information? 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, I think it's the entire reaction to the Harris ascendancy after that kind of the somnolence the Democrats are in. There's almost this torpor, this defeated kind of walking, you know, days, has obviously tremendously unnerved him, and the ratings underscored what we talked about before the convention. 
 
You know, opinions about Harris are probably less deeply held than for any nominee arriving at their convention. I think since Wendell Willkie, the Republican businessman in 1940. I mean, she's the first nominee in roughly 60 years who was not either an incumbent president or had to run through the primaries. The initial reaction has been positive, but people don't really know a lot about her, and that creates, obviously, a risk that Republicans could fill that in, but it creates the opportunity that more people would tune into the convention precisely because they want to learn something about her, and the Democrats would have more opportunity than is usually the case at a convention to define their nominee, because so little space on the canvas has been written on yet.
 
And so, it'll be interesting to see. I would not be surprised of the audience for her acceptance speech is higher than Trump's. 
 
And don't forget, half of all the people who watch Trump's acceptance speech watched it on Fox, and that was an indication, I thought, an early indication, of what ultimately occurred, which is he did not get much of a bounce out of his convention. He did not really speak to people beyond those who are already in his camp. She clearly has an opportunity to do that. Barack Obama was kind of summoning her precisely to do that, and we'll see if she can deliver on it on Thursday night. 
 <br>[02:10:06]
 
CHURCH: That's a critical point. Ron Brownstein, many thanks for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
BROWNSTEIN: Thanks for having me. 
 
CHURCH: Well, meantime, new protests erupted on the streets of Chicago as the convention entered its second night, dozens of demonstrators clashed with police near the Israeli consulate, just three kilometers from the convention site. Tens of thousands of protesters have descended on the city to voice their opposition to the war in Gaza. 
 
CNN's Ryan Young has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RYAN YOUNG, SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, a lot of back and forth tonight with protesters and police. I want to give you the scene the officers who stacked here, ready in their riot gear, their helmets, they're on the right. Now, that's where protesters have been most of the night. They moved them back this direction. 
 
Now, you can also see on the other side of the street, there's another group of officers who have all lined this street right here. They created this barrier so that the protesters could not leave this boxing intersection. 
 
The building they were all protesting is right over here. If you walk this way, you can see this building right here at central tower. That's where the Israeli consulate is. Some of those protesters obviously wanted to get inside, but that was stopped by the large police presence. 
 
Now, you look over here, that's the last bit of group of protesters that has left, a small fracture of them took off in another direction, and there were bike officers who followed them as well. 
 
This has been intense, and I have to say that, because there's been real pushing and shoving between protesters and police officers, and we believe at least one person was taken into custody. 
 
At some point, officers addressed a large group of protesters and asked them through the area. We walk this direction, you can see the mess that has been left behind by some of the signs that were thrown out here, but this is really the intersection of where everything we've been talking. 
 
So, protesters like this one here have continued to stay in the street, get in the face of the officers, yelling, and there's been back and forth.
 
So far, it doesn't seem like there's been any injuries. 
 
Now, a counter protesting group showed up about a half hour ago. They were on the other side of that large continued police officers. I'm going to ask my cameraman to raise his camera up just a little bit, and if you look in the distance, you can see that the officers have actually shut down that backside of the road as well. 
 
So, this was a coordinated effort to make sure this entire intersection was protected, but at the same time, the intensity of this situation really, really got pushed into a corner at some point, as people started falling or running, that was shut down. Doesn't seem like anybody was injured at this point, but we continue to watch the action that's going on here on the streets.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: More than 40 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza in the past 24 hours, as mediators push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. A warning, the images you're about to see are graphic. 
 
Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza on Tuesday, frantic scenes as the victims were rushed to al-Aqsa hospital, already overwhelmed after 10 months of war.
 
In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians killed eight while search operations are ongoing for four missing people. 
 
The Israel Defense Forces says it conducted, "Precise strikes on a Hamas command center hidden in the school."
 
Meanwhile, Israel released video of its operation to recover the bodies of six hostages. It says soldiers found them in Hamas tunnels under Khan Yunis. All but one of these six hostages had previously been declared dead. The Israeli military is investigating what caused their deaths. 
 
Gaza's ceasefire talks are expected to resume this week amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the war. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with top officials in Egypt and Qatar to get the latest on what they're hearing from Hamas. Blinken says Israel has agreed to a bridging proposal meant to close the remaining gaps in a potential Gaza cease fire agreement. 
 
Now, this comes despite reported comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that cast doubt on a potential deal. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Israel has now accepted that proposal. I heard that directly from Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, and we hope and expect that Hamas will do the same. Time is of the essence. Time is of the essence, because with every passing day, the wellbeing and lives of the hostages are in jeopardy. Time is of the essence, because every single day, women, children, men in Gaza are suffering without access to adequate food, medicine, and at risk of being wounded or dying in fighting that they didn't start and they cannot stop.

CHURCH: We want to go live now to central Gaza, to Arwa Damon. She is the founder and president of the nonprofit relief group INARA and a former CNN Senior International Correspondent. Thanks for talking with us, Arwa.
 
So, you were at the al-Aqsa hospital when the ambulances started arriving with all the injured from this Israeli strike. What was the scene there? 
 
ARWA DAMON, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, INARA: It was complete and total chaos, as you can imagine, and as you are probably quite familiar with the images, the ambulances come screaming and they are packed with the injured. I saw two very bloody children being carried out, a woman screaming on a stretcher, another woman shouting, looking for her relatives, for any sort of information, you know, a bunch of other injured being carried in.
 
And you know, Rosemary, as horrific as that scene is, and as tragic as it is, what makes it even more so is the reality that al-Aqsa doesn't have what it needs, nor does any other hospital here really to handle these types of casualties when they do end up coming in en masse. 
 
I was in al-Aqsa's ICU 24 hours earlier, and there they have a 13- year-old boy who has 60 percent of his body covered in second and third degree burns. And the reason why this child is in the ICU is because the hospital didn't have enough bandages to be able to keep his injuries, his burn injuries, sufficiently sanitized, and that resulted in a blood infection and early sepsis. 
 
There's also a little girl. She's a year and a half. She needs to be moved to another facility for a surgery, but they're missing a small little piece of plastic, basically to be able to insert a tube into her chest that would then potentially allow her to be stabilized. But they don't have this particular piece in pediatric sizes. 
 
There are no free beds in the ICU, and so when you look at scenes of these mass casualties coming in, you can't help but think, you know, if one of them needs to be in the ICU, if one of them needs these basic supplies, the hospital just can't provide it because it's not available. 
 
CHURCH: Yes, and that's -- you had the opportunity to talk to doctors and staff members, because you were at that hospital, at the al-Aqsa hospital, the day before this Israeli strike, talking about these conditions and what these young children were enduring. But also, the staff members, how were they dealing with this, with a lack of supplies, trying to save people's lives under these dire circumstances?
 
DAMON: They're dealing because they don't have a choice. They are literally scrapping around using whatever they can find. 
 
So, you know, tubes that aren't meant to be used for urine collection are being rejiggered to be able to use them for purposes that they were not intended for. The level of innovation, actually, that doctors and other medical staff are having to, you know, create is quite impressive.
 
But some of it -- I mean, so much of this actually feels like it is rather absurd. I was also down at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis yesterday, and there they're missing cannulas for pediatric sizes. They don't have cannulas for small children, for babies, and so you end up scrapping around trying to find that, they don't have bed space. 
 
And what this means is patients end up either just coming in for treatment or having to be very quickly turned over. So, you may have seen these images of these horrific skin rashes, skin diseases, infections that are spreading all over children and the worst of them, it kind of looks like this blister that then passes open results in a scab, it's very itchy and is very, very contagious. 
 
This particular skin infection disease is highly contagious, and if it is left untreated, it can result in kidney failure, which can result in death. But they are not able to hospitalize all of the cases that need to be hospitalized because they quite simply don't have the bed space. 
 
I was talking to one doctor, and he was describing how they end up having to triage, even when it's a non-triage scenario, because when they get in a child who, for example, has pneumonia, let's say and actually should be in the ICU for two to three weeks, that's one ICU bed that's going to be used by one case for that time span. And they have to make a calculation in their head of, do they give that ICU bed to that one child, or do they reject this child because they know that they'll be able to use that one ICU bed for four or five patients that won't need it for such a long duration. 
 <br>[02:20:10]
 
And when you talk to doctors about the impossibility of having to make these kinds of decisions, one of them was saying to me, look, when we're in the hospital, we have to, we have no choice but to harden our hearts, but when we go back to our tents, when we leave the hospital, all we do is cry. 
 
CHURCH: It is a tragic situation, and all of this time, we wait and hope for a ceasefire and hostage release deal that seems elusive at this juncture, at least Arwa Damon reporting there or talking to us there from Central Gaza. Many thanks. Appreciate it. 
 
And coming up, Russia insists it's repelling Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region, but the reports and video from the battlefield tell a very different story. Back with that and more in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Crews and divers in Italy are expected to begin a third day of searching for those missing from a yacht that sank off Sicily. At least one person is confirmed dead, the chef of the ship, who was from Antigua. 15 people were rescued, and six others remain missing, four Britons and two Americans. A maritime historian weighs in on why the yacht went down. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAL MERCOGLIANO, MARITIME HISTORIAN, CAMPBELL UNIVERSITY: This vessel got hit by that tornado at sea. And what probably happened is, because of that type of wind, a very hard burst of water and wind at the same time, probably placed the vessel on its beam end, basically pushed it over on its side. 
 
And unless all the hatches had been secured and everything had been battened down, the vessel would have flooded. And based on that report, indicates the vessel probably took on a lot of water very quickly and went down to the bottom. And that is nightmare for the crew on board, being asleep, and then all of a sudden, waking up to a ship in the room you're in, being on its side and flooding with water heading down to the bottom.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: The Super yacht was linked to the wife of British tech tycoon Mike Lynch. He is among the missing passengers, along with the international director of financial services company Morgan Stanley.
 
Argentina's government will quarantine a cargo ship in its waters after reports of one of the crew members showing signs of mpox, previously called monkeypox. 
 
It comes just days after the World Health Organization declared the virus a public health emergency of international concern.
 
CNN's Ivan Perez Sarmenti has details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
IVAN PEREZ SARMENTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Health authorities here in Argentina announced on Tuesday they will inspect and quarantine a cargo ship in its waters after a crew member from India showed symptoms of mpox. The inspection is carried out by the border health service and its medical personnel will board the ship and inspect whether the crew members symptoms are compatible with mpox. 
 <br>[02:25:09] If they are, they will take samples for study. In the meantime, the entire crew will be quarantined until the results of the test are available according to the health ministry statement. 
 
So far, authorities have not said how many people are on board this ship named Ina-Lotte with Liberian flag. It was sailing to San Lorenzo port in Argentina, and comes from Brazil with glass docked at Santos port. Previously, between June and July, it was in Russia, and it has not had any port calls out of Europe since at least before April. 
 
According to the health ministry, so far, Argentina has not registered any cases of the Clade 1b variant of mpox. 
 
Nevertheless, on Friday, local authorities called for strictly important health control measures all over the country two days after the World Health Organization declared public health emergency of international concern due to an outbreak of mpox in parts of Africa, other Latin American countries such as Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela and Mexico have announced similar surveillance measures.

CHURCH: Russia says it will repel Ukrainian forces who are gaining territory in the Kursk Region, but they're not having much success so far. Russia's military is building temporary bridges across a key river in the region. Ukrainian forces have destroyed at least two bridges there in order to weaken Russia's supply lines. 
 
This video shows a Ukrainian drone targeting one of the new makeshift pontoon bridges. A satellite image later shows it's no longer there. 
 
Ukraine's top commander says his forces have now captured more than 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory. Russia insists it is countering Ukraine's advances and taking Ukrainian prisoners, but that's not what the United States is saying. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We have seen indications of Russia moving a small number of forces into Kursk -- the Kursk region to respond, I would say, generally speaking, though, Russia has really struggled to respond, and you continue to see some Ukrainian advances in that regard. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin spent Tuesday in the Caucasus region. He laid flowers at a memorial in Beslan in northern Ossetia, the site of a deadly attack in 2004. A group of Chechen militants had seized a school and taken more than 1,000 people hostage after a three day siege, the crisis ended when Russian forces moved in. More than 330 people, mostly children, were killed. Putin drew parallels with the war in Ukraine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As for those opponents and enemies of ours that I mentioned, they continue this work of trying to destabilize our country, this is obvious, and since we fought terrorists, today, we have to fight those who commit crimes in the Kursk Region in Donbas and Novorossiya. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Putin also visited the Chechen capital of Grozny for the first time in 13 years. He met with Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, and inspected troops who were preparing to fight in Ukraine.
 
Kadyrov says Chechnya has sent more than 47,000 troops to the front lines. 
 
Next here on CNN NEWSROOM, a Palestinian woman recounts the attack in Gaza that killed her husband and daughter and the harrowing encounter with Israeli soldiers who wound up saving her life.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:31:33]
 
CHURCH: Health officials in Gaza have reported more than 40,000 Palestinians killed in the Israel-Hamas war, and each new death means another family torn apart. CNN's Jeremy Diamond met one woman whose husband and daughter were killed in an attack in their neighborhood. She and her other daughters share their painful story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Five-year- old Sham's eyes are a portal to the past she cannot forget. There are the streets and homes scarred by war, this building where she recited her final prayers, and then there is the indelible sight of her father and sister shot dead before her eyes. Sham's mother Sanaa, who suffered burns as a child, will never forget that day.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ, SURVIVED ATTACK THAT KILLED HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER (through translator): I wish we hadn't returned. I lost the most precious people. I lost the most precious thing for me, my daughter.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): But there is more to that story than tragedy and loss in war-torn Gaza. Sham and Sanaa's story is unlike any other we have come across in ten months of war. That's because Sanaa doesn't just accused Israeli troops of killing her husband, Akram and daughter Yasmeen, an Israeli soldier may also have saved her life.
 
On November 24th, the week-long truce between Israel and Hamas begins, thousands of people begin heading back to their homes in northern Gaza. Sanaa and her family are among them. But as they approach the Salati (ph) neighborhood where they lived, they find themselves walking alone and then shots ring out.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): May God bless her soul, Yasmeen. One bullet in her back and one in her shoulder. I was hit in my leg and my husband was hit in his stomach. So we all sat on the ground. We couldn't move and we were bleeding. Sham is the only one who wasn't hit.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Her husband soon decides to crawl away to try to find help. But moments later, he is shot again, fatally. Sanaa lies on the ground bleeding, cradling her eldest daughter, Yasmeen.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): She was saying, 'Mom, did you die? Please don't die and leave us. I'm still alive.' I held her and I told her, 'No my dear, we are not going to die. The ambulance is coming.' I was trying to give her hope even though I know there was no hope.
 
DIAMOND: As a mother, I mean, you must have felt absolutely helpless in that moment.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): I wasn't able to do anything and that was the hardest situation. I couldn't. She was even asking for water, and I couldn't give her water.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Yasmeen soon died in her mother's arms. For hours, Sanaa lies here with Sham, unable to move, until she finally finds the strength to crawl down the street and into this nearby home. We obtained footage from that house after our first interview with Sanaa. This is the first time she and Sham are seeing it.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): This is the bathroom we hid in.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): And Sham begins to tell my colleague, Abeer Salman, what happened to her.
 
ABEER SALMAN, CNN PRODUCER (through translator): What happened in the morning?
 
SHAM ABU TABAQ, SURVIVED ATTACK THAT KILLED FATHER AND SISTER (through translator): The tanks came.
 
SALMAN (through translator): How do you know the tanks had come?
 
SHAM ABU TABAQ: I heard their sound.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): I told her, 'They've reached us.' We recited the Shahada. She said, 'Hid me so I don't see them when they shoot me.'
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): An explosion then rocks the bathroom. Israeli soldiers enter the house and call out in Arabic. What happens next is captured on muted body camera footage provided by the Israeli military. Two soldiers treating Sanaa's gunshot wounds.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): I told him, 'Please have mercy. Didn't you see my daughter who was killed at the door? I beg you, please don't kill us, it's enough.' He told me, 'It wasn't us who killed her. It was Sinwar.' I told him, 'I have nothing to do with Sinwar, or anyone else. You took my daughter and you took everything.'
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): The medic soon realizes her condition is serious. She needs to get to a hospital.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): The one who spoke Arabic started to make his calls. Then he told me, 'We decided to help you and take you with us.'
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Israeli soldiers carry Sanaa out of the building on a stretcher, her hands clutching Sham. Nothing about this footage should be extraordinary. Militaries must protect and care for wounded civilians when possible under international law. But in this war, this site is exceedingly rare.
 
For eight months, Sanaa and Sham have lived in this Jerusalem hospital. Their journey here was no less traumatic. Interrogation and strip searches came before treatments at an Israeli hospital. Israeli authorities are now planning to send them back to Gaza next month, unless another country takes them in.
 
The Israeli military for its part told CNN in a statement that Sanaa and her family were caught in the crossfire. The IDF says its soldiers issued verbal warnings after the family stumbled upon a concealed military position, drawing a militant attack. The four people who entered in the area were caught in the intense exchange of fire between the terrorists and our troops. The troops did not open fire at the four people, nor did they aim at them.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): They are lying. There was nobody in that area.
 
DIAMOND: I wonder what would you say to that one soldier if you could see him again.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): It's true he helped me. But he also took from me the most precious thing I had. I can't event hank him because he had mercy for us by the will of God, not by his own will. Because if he had compassion, he wouldn't have deprived me of the dearest people to my heart.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Sanaa's pain is as raw as ever and seeing her home again in footage filmed this spring brings a flood of emotion.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): These are Yasmeen and Sham's shoes. I bought these shoes for Eid.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Mundane objects are transformed into relics.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): This is Yasmeen's dress and this is Sham's dress. She always loved pink. This is her dress.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): And Sanaa is taken back in time to the life she will never get back.

Three young girls were killed and several others hurt in Southport last month while attending a dance class featuring Taylor Swift music. The king met with some of the injured children and their family members and expressed his sympathy and empathy for residents. The king also spoke with ambulance drivers and emergency service workers who took calls during the July attack. 
 
Southport was the scene of a second crisis when riots broke out after the knife attack. Hotels housing asylum seekers were the focus of violent rioting after false claims spread about the identity of the attacker.
 
Bennifer is breaking up again. Jennifer Lopez has filed for divorce from actor Ben Affleck. It comes exactly two years after their wedding ceremony and after months of reports that the couple had fallen out and were living separately. Lopez canceled a concert tour earlier this year to focus on her family. The two first met on the set of the movie is 'Gigli' in 2002, had a brief engagement soon after, and rekindled their relationship in 2021. CNN has reached out to their representatives for comment.
