JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. 
 
The world's largest active volcano is quickly becoming Hawaii's newest tourist attraction. The lava spewing out of the Mauna Loa volcano is now two and a half miles away from the main road connecting the west and east coast of the Big Island. It looks fast-moving here but down below it is slowing enough that authorities can give at least 24 hours' notice if that highway is in danger. 
 
There is no immediate threat to people at the moment. But the state health department warns that there could be vog, that is the volcanic version of smog, especially with the nearby Kilauea volcano erupting for more than a year. Officials are urging people to watch this latest spectacle from a safe distance. 
 
CNN's David Culver reports on the volcano's first eruption in nearly 40 years. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The nighttime glow of Mauna Loa's oozing lava, well, you just have to pull over and properly admire it. 
 
(On-camera): It's basically the middle of the night, and you guys are out here. Why? 
 
PIILANI ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT: Well, I mean, this is a once-in- a-lifetime opportunity to be able to experience this, and we decided to come early in the morning so we didn't have to sit in the traffic. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): Having hopped from Oahu to here, the Big Island, this family, three generations, came to respectfully honor the Hawaiian eruptions. 
 
ZYCH: It's all beautiful to us, and so we pay huge reverence to this. It's very culturally significant for us as well. So it's a big deal. 
 
CULVER: A sight made even more alluring with a side of sunrise, which brought the crowds to Old Saddle Road. Officials turning this stretch into a one-way street, allowing passersby the chance to stop and let the views seep in. 
 
(On-camera): And that keeps drivers from pulling over and stopping on this, what is one of the main highways connecting one part of the island to the other. USGS and state officials warn the lava flow, while slowed in recent days, is inching closer to cutting off this highway. It's within three miles now. 
 
The other worry, not here on the ground, but up in the air. What looked like plumes of smoke experts say those are acid gases. Officials monitoring the levels warning it could become toxic for residents and visitors of the Big Island. 
 
(Voice-over): Mauna Loa is the second of the Big Island's five volcanos currently erupting. Kilauea still rumbling after destroying more than 600 homes here in 2018. 
 
ERECH ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT: This is very significant. Like, my wife, we made these on Oahu, we brought them over here, and we gave it as an offering, you know, just you come with respect. 
 
CULVER: But many Hawaiians see the potential path of destruction as simultaneous creation surfacing from this, the world's largest active volcano. 
 
(On-camera): And with the eruption continuing at its current pacing, officials feel like they should be able to give folks up to two days' notice should the lava make its way onto that major thoroughfare cutting off that highway. But they also warn when it comes to the flow of lava there is no forecasting. 
 
David Culver, CNN, Hawaii. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ACOSTA: And joining us now by phone is Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono. 
 
Senator Hirono, thanks for being with us and giving us this update. You know, a lot of people are curious to see this up close and they've been rushing to that area, as you know. The eruption propelled lava up to 148 feet in the air. We understand at least one lava is several yards thick. 
 
What's your message to people there in Hawaii. I know they want to look at this but they've got to be careful. 
 
SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI) (via phone): Well, that is the message that they should be careful and if they're driving along either the DKI Highway, the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, which is the highway that everybody is talking about, the lava reaching it at some point, they should be very careful. Having said that, though, I know that the governor is asking people to continue with their travel plans that, there will be time for any kind of safety warnings to be issued if there is a need for that. 
 
But in the meantime, this is a spectacular. Hawaii is one of the few places where one can get relatively close to a volcanic eruption and to understand that geologically all of the islands were created through volcanic activity. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. I mean, I've been to Hawaii several times, I've been to the Big Island Volcanos National Park. You know, from that visitors station you can watch the orange glow. It's just a remarkable sight. 
 <br>[15:05:01]
 
I mean, anybody around the world, if you ever get the chance to go, go. But what do you think, Senator Hirono? I know it's still safe or it's deemed safe to travel now. Might that change? 
 
HIRONO: For right now, that is not the situation. (INAUDIBLE). Follow through on their travel plans and there will be ample time for any kind of warning. The main thing is that for visitors, as well as residents alike to be alert to the news as they're driving along the highway to drive safely because there are probably a lot of people on the highway trying to get as close as they can to the lava flow. 
 
ACOSTA: And it's the first time we've seen this volcano erupt in, what, nearly four decades? And sciences are unsure -- 
 
HIRONO: Forty years. 
 
ACOSTA: Forty years. 
 
HIRONO: Yes. 
 
ACOSTA: And they're just -- and the sciences are baffled by this, I suppose. I mean, they're watching this just like the rest of us, wondering how long this is going to last. Are we learning anything new from officials on the ground? 
 
HIRONO: Well, I'm certainly keeping in touch with the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Park Service, the mayor's office, civil defense. What you said about the volcano eruption, it's not that easy to predict when. We knew that there was going to be some activity, but we don't know when it's going to stop. We don't know how much lava will pour out. And that's why the situation is being monitored very closely. 
 
ACOSTA: And any concern about these dangerous gases being released? 
 
HIRONO: I think that for people who suffer from asthma, et cetera, I think they should be careful about the presence of vog. At the same time, the Department of Health will be issuing any appropriate warnings along those lines having to do with any respiratory issues. 
 
ACOSTA: And Senator Hirono, I just wonder what this means to you as a Hawaiian, what do Hawaiians, native Hawaiians, what does this mean to them? We heard from one gentleman on our piece a few moments ago from our David Culver, there was one gentleman who was talking about an offering for the volcano. Is there an emotional pull to this? What does it mean? 
 
HIRONO: So I am a resident of Hawaii, I'm not a Hawaiian. Only native Hawaiians can refer to themselves as Hawaiian. But we do have some volcano pele, P-E-L-E. The volcanic eruption, really, it's got (INAUDIBLE) so there are cultural aspects to what is happening. I think that there is a sensitivity to the cultural issues involved with the volcanic eruptions. And we should -- be sure to understand as I say the cultural aspect to native Hawaiians. 
 
ACOSTA: When you look at the beauty of this, Senator Hirono, it just reminds me and I'm sure people around the world what a special place Hawaii is. 
 
HIRONO: Yes. 
 
ACOSTA: It's just remarkable. 
 
HIRONO: And in fact, even as this volcanic eruption is happening, there is another island that is created off the island of the Big Island, which we monitor. It will be a number of million or so years before another island pops up. But to understand, as I said, that all of the islands are created through volcanic activity and anyone who's driven along the (INAUDIBLE) areas of the Big Island can see that the lava flow -- past lava flows and to understand that it takes a long time for the lava to break down for any kind of development nor anything along those lines that can occur. So we are still a young state geologically speaking. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. And a beautiful state. Senator Mazie Hirono, thank you so much for -- 
 
HIRONO: Yes. Everyone -- 
 
ACOSTA: What's that? Say that again? 
 
HIRONO: Thank you, Jim. And everyone, stay safe. 
 
ACOSTA: Absolutely. Thanks so much. And you as well. We appreciate your time. 
 
Now to Qatar and heartbreak for Team USA. The men's national team falling to the Netherlands 3-1 in the first match of the knockout round, ending the World Cup. And it was an emotional finish for the young U.S. team. Players hugged each other and the tears were flowing after the final whistle blew after a promising start to the tournament with the tie against England and that gritty win against Iran. Team USA was hoping to secure a place in the quarterfinals. Instead, the team will be making the long journey back home. 
 
But for the Dutch, today's win gets them one step closer to becoming World Cup champions. And Dutch fans here in the U.S. could not contain their excitement as CNN's Andy Scholes found out. 
 <br>[15:10:03]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: -- hoping. Oh, no. The Netherlands just scored. As you can see, there's lots of Dutch fans behind me, pretty excited about that. That's pretty brutal for Team USA. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: All right. Is Andy in Amsterdam or Atlanta? It's hard to tell. All right. CNN's Don Riddell joins me now from Doha, Qatar. 
 
Don, you were at the game. You know, I was watching from home. You know, tears in my orange juice there as we were watching here in the earlier morning hours in the United States. But, you know, they put on a heck of a fight. They had an amazing run there to qualify to the knockout run. But one of the problems for the U.S. team is they just could not score during those golden opportunities, a few golden opportunities early on. 
 
What's it look like on your end and how is Team USA reacting? 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, WORLD SPORT: Yes. Well, look, you're absolutely right, Jim. One of their issues coming into this tournament was that they didn't have an out-and-out goal scorer. And so it proved there, they only scored two goals in their three group games. Only one today. And of course that wasn't enough. And I think if you're looking on the bright side, what was so good about that performance was that they kept hold of the ball. 
 
They had more of the possession. They had just as many shots as the Dutch. But they just couldn't take them. They just couldn't put them away. And when the Dutch got the ball in the danger areas, their finishing was just clinical. And that really was the difference. So the Dutch will -- sorry, the American team I think will leave here with their heads held high. 
 
Remember, they were one of the youngest teams in the tournament. 25 of their 26-man squad had never even experienced the World Cup tournament before. And they always saw this tournament as a steppingstone to 2026, which they're co-hosting along with Canada and Mexico. And that's when they're really, really expecting to flourish. But it was disappointing of course both for the players and for the fans, some of whom I spoke with afterwards. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was an incredible showing. I've been here for a week. It's been an unbelievable showing. But yes, I'm proud of them. But sad. I think the coaching tactics were a little off. I mean, I think that we probably could have been a little bit more agrees and more creative. Our lineup wasn't strong to start with. But I think -- and the adjustments in the second half weren't quite there. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You saw Christian Pulisic in the last game, getting kicked in the cajones. That's what it feels like right now. It's rough out here. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) RIDDELL: That's one way of putting it. The coach says it was bitterly disappointing. Captain America Christian Pulisic said he's proud of his team. One of their star players McKinney said that the four-year run to get to this point has totally redefined how the rest of world sees American soccer. So they have made a huge amount of progress. 
 
Meanwhile, Jim, happening right now, the second knockout game between Lionel Messi's Argentina and Australia. Argentina 1-0 up at halftime, it is a game that many would expect them to of course win. They say it's Messi's one-thousandth game. I haven't counted them but that's what they're saying. It's his 100th time captaining Argentina. It's his fifth World Cup, and would you believe, it's the first time Messi has scored in the knockout round? 
 
ACOSTA: Wow. 
 
RIDDELL: So, so far Argentina doing well. And they would play the Netherlands next if they can see this one through. 
 
ACOSTA: The legend of Messi continues. All right, Don Riddell. It's been an exciting World Cup. Thanks as always. We appreciate it. 
 
And with me now is two-time Olympic gold medalist, a World Cup soccer champion, Briana Scurry. 
 
First of all, I've got to get your reaction to all this, Briana. I'm sure you were watching this morning. It was hard to watch. Very early on in the game, it looked like Pulisic had a chance to score there. Couldn't knock the ball in. What were your observations? 
 
BRIANA SCURRY, WORLD CUP SOCCER CHAMPION: Jim, I will tell you, I was heartbroken. I got a sick feeling when that goalkeeper from the Dutch saved Pulisic's initial shot. I was hoping it wasn't going to be one of those days. And unfortunately it turned out to be. The Orange, which they are also known as, were absolutely ruthless in their attacking and their counterattacking, their finishing. 
 
I mean, three different players scoring. Dumfries was amazing. Number 22. Two assists and a goal. And the U.S. team did enough. They did enough to get the goals but they just weren't nearly as clinical as the Orange were today. And it's encouraging to me actually when you look at it from that point of view that our guys did manage to create enough chances to win. But unfortunately, like was spoken about earlier, the same issues of not being able to find the goal-scoring touch plagued them today. 
 
ACOSTA: And, Briana, the U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner said the team had hoped to create moments for people back home to fall in love with soccer and that this game wasn't one of those nights. But we saw fans across the country coming together, cheering on the team. 
 <br>[15:15:03]
 
President Biden tweeted, "Fellas, you've made us proud. We get up and keep going. Here's to a bright future in 2026 back here at home." 
 
I guess what's your message today? 
 
SCURRY: I understand Matt Turner's viewpoint. But I will say that showing well and making the country proud by the way you represent, which the men have done incredibly well on the pitch and off the pitch as well, that the heart and soul that they played with, with being one of the youngest teams in the cup, and having a fantastic showing in this World Cup, obviously as a springboard to 2026, I think, you know, they've won some people over for sure. 
 
People were, you know, cheering them on today. Just completely gutted by the fact we didn't win but every time our men's team makes the World Cup and the women's team makes the World Cup, you add, you know, millions of soccer fans. So Matt should be rest assured that he did a great job, the team did well. It may not have gotten the win today but they definitely garnered more popularity and more lovers of the beautiful game. 
 
ACOSTA: And I want to ask you as well about the fight for equal pay in soccer. Under this new landmark agreement between the U.S. Soccer Federation and the Men's and Women's Players Association, the men's and women's team split all World Cup earnings. But the pay disparity is so wide that the women's national team earned more money from the men making it to the knockout round than it did from winning the entire World Cup tournament in 2015 and 2019. 
 
Am I right about that? What's your reaction to that? And for folks who don't understand this, lay it out for us. 
 
SCURRY: So let me tell you the disparity between what FIFA pays the men and the women is upwards of 35 to 40 times difference. 
 
ACOSTA: Wow. 
 
SCURRY: And that's why that stat that you said about having the men getting through the knockout phase with money to them than winning two World Cups for the women, FIFA has been so far behind the ball on this valuing the women's game. And so what was able to happen at the highest level of U.S. Soccer by Cindy Parlow Cone, who is now the president in both the men's and women's teams, they came to an agreement in their collective bargaining agreement to split the winnings because the guys voted and they said, you know what, we want to do the right thing. The women deserve it. And that's how it was able to come to fruition. And now we have this great unity between both teams and the federation. 
 
ACOSTA: Is it because they're just jealous because the women win all the time? 
 
SCURRY: I wouldn't say they're just jealous, Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: At least on the American side you came up. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SCURRY: They're good guys. You saw they're good guys. No, the thing is, you know, we have been representing the United States, we as the women's team, with honor, with dignity, with winning. And the men are coming along. And to their credit, they knew the right thing to do would be to give the women the opportunity they had earned and deserved. And so the guys deserve a lot of credit for making that decision and deciding to go forward with making everything equal. And they showed well. I'm very proud of them. 
 
ACOSTA: No, I am as well. Let me ask you about Pele. Very sad news. There's been an outpouring of well wishes for Pele, the 82-year-old legend of the sport, remains hospitalized. Here's what some fans in Doha said. Let's watch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Watching him was the first professional game I ever saw in '75. And because of that, one of the reasons -- this is my 11th World Cup. And I've been going since Spain because that really hooked me. Watching him and his ability hooked me to coming in to watching soccer and watching the World Cup. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So he was sort of this mythical figure, Pele, that had scored all these goals and done all these wonderful things for Brazil. And, you know, so that was sort of the original image of the, sort of the superstar can do anything type of football. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: What does Pele mean to the soccer world? I mean, I remember watching him as a kid. You know, he's just an amazing athlete. 
 
SCURRY: He truly is. And you know, he not only brought so much glory to the sport with the way he played, especially to Brazil, but he is literally like the grandfather of soccer showmanship, the grandfather of soccer camaraderie. He brought so many different countries into loving the game because he plays it so beautifully. I mean, with flair, with fire, with joy. And you can see it in the way he plays. 
 
And also he did so much off the pitch, too, for his country and for, you know, just underserved communities in Brazil and around the world. He is a true great ambassador for the game. 
 
ACOSTA: He really is. And you are as well, Briana Scurry. Thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it. And we'll be cheering on the women the next time we see them. Thanks so much. 
 <br>[15:20:04]
 
SCURRY: Thanks, Jim. Thanks for having me. 
 
ACOSTA: Appreciate the e time. 
 
Coming up, the cruise ship passenger rescued after spending hours stranded all alone, threading water in the Gulf of Mexico. What he is saying now only deepens the mystery of how he got there. You're going to watch that next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ACOSTA: An American woman has died after a massive wave slammed into her cruise ship during an Arctic cruise on the way to Argentina. Authorities say a glass surface on the Viking Polaris collapsed from the impact of this rogue wave. Four other passengers were also hurt and had to be treated by the ship's onboard doctor and medical staff. Rogue waves are typically larger than twice the size of surrounding waves. Viking Cruises says this ship's next trip has been canceled. 
 
Another frightening cruise ship mishap. This one very mysterious. A man on a cruise with his family somehow went over the side and managed to survive for hours. 
 <br>[15:25:00]
 
CNN's Leyla Santiago is taking a closer look at what happened. 
 
Leyla, this man says he does not even remember going overboard. Just incredible. 
 
LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right. And when you say hours, I mean, we're talking about a lot of hours here. He somehow ended up in the middle of the ocean Wednesday night and wasn't rescued until the next day, which was Thanksgiving, around 8:30 in the evening. So he was out there forever, it seems like. But somehow he survived it. He was rescued by the Coast Guard. Still a lot of questions as to exactly how he ended up there. 
 
Believe me, I asked him several times. And he says he just doesn't have any recollection. The last thing he remembered was having fun with his family on the cruise ship Wednesday night, admitted to having a few drinks but says he was far from inebriated. How he survived? He said he just tried to have a positive frame of mind and was really taking note of what was surrounding him, which includes jellyfish. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAMES GRIMES, STRANDED AT SEA FOR 15 PLUS HOURS: I know I swam through two big schools of jellyfish. At one point, I was swimming (INAUDIBLE), just right the slime up in my arms and just slinging it. And I had one attached to the back of my neck. Got a pretty little spot there. But yes, I can remember going through the jellyfish and actually I was opening my eyes in the water because out there I pretty much got adjusted to the water. And I was looking around, you know, seeing what was out there with me the whole time. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANTIAGO: Something else he said, he prayed a lot and also sang a lot of songs to himself, including sitting on the dock of the bay. Except he said he would sing to himself, I wish I were sitting on the dock of the bay. So definitely had a sense of humor about it, stayed positive. Never once he says that he think he wasn't going to make it out. He said I never thought if someone was going to find me, I just when they will find him because he was confident. His mother would send out quite the crew to find him. He describes himself as a pretty average guy. But I think when you
 
 realized that someone has survived something like this, many would argue he's anything but -- Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: Above average luck I would say, Leyla. And I mean, this sounds like a Tom -- 
 
SANTIAGO: Yes. 
 
ACOSTA: Tom Hanks "Castaway" sequel or something like that in the works here. Just unbelievable. 
 
SANTIAGO: Right. Where's Wilson? Yes. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. Something like he needed Wilson at that moment, I think. 
 
All right, Leyla Santiago, as always, thanks much. We appreciate it. 
 
And coming up, all eyes on the state of Georgia in this year's final battle for the Senate between the incumbent Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker. Why the race is so critical even with control of the Senate already decided. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:32:08]
 
ACOSTA: We are just three days away from the cycle in the Senate race in Georgia. Democrat incumbent, Raphael Warnock, facing off against Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, in Tuesday's runoff.
 
We see record turnout in early voting with more than 1.8 million Georgians casting ballots already.
 
CNN's Dianne Gallagher is in Atlanta for us. 
 
Dianne, what are Warnock and Walker doing on their final days of the campaign trial? I have to think this is a sprint to the finish. 
 
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It is the home stretch of this runoff election. It's maybe not as busy as you thought it would be for both candidates.
 
I will say the incumbent, Senator Raphael Warnock, holding several events today in Atlanta and in Augusta, Georgia, and also several tomorrow as well. But he has traditionally kept a much more aggressive schedule than his opponent, Republican Herschel Walker. 
 
Herschel Walker doesn't have any public events open to the press listed today, the Saturday before Election Day. He does have an event on his schedule tomorrow in Loganville, Georgia. 
 
But, look, the Walker campaign has typically had a more relaxed campaign schedule than the Warnock campaign has across this entire four-week runoff period. That is even during the early voting period that ended on Friday. You mentioned 1.85 million Georgians have already cast their ballots.
 
 They hit a single-day voting record on yesterday, Friday, with more than 350,000 votes. And that day, well, that beat Monday and tuesday, which also set records themselves. 
 
Jim, I should mention, though, look, while we are setting single-daily records, it does look like they are going to miss the early vote threshold that was set in the 2020 election. 
 
Of course, that was after a presidential election. There were two Senate elections then. But part of that is due to this compressed four-week schedule, which is five mandated days of early voting instead of three-weeks' worth. 
 
ACOSTA: Very good. A lot on the line, of course. 
 
Dianne Gallagher, thanks so much. We appreciate it. 
 
Joining me now to talk about this is Republican strategist, former RNC communications director, Doug Heye, and Democratic strategist and former Clinton White House aide, Keith Boykin.
 
Doug, let me start with you first. 
 
President Biden said Herschel Walker doesn't deserve to be in this race. Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, a Republican, was not holding back. He said he couldn't bring himself to vote for Herschel Walker. 
 
When I was down there in Atlanta a month ago, this is what Georgia Republicans were saying. 
 
What do you think the GOP should learn from this runoff, this Senate race?
 
DOUG HEYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: What we should learn from the entire elections from last month, Mitch McConnell was right. Candidate quality matters. 
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
And in campaigns and in football, time of possession is important. Herschel Walker knows that better than anybody. 
 
But he has been on defense. He hasn't been on offense. And every day of this runoff, he's been on defense. 
 
He struggled with any kind of a quality message. He's not getting good news out there. He says bizarre things. Bizarre is a kind way to put it. 
 
Warnock is in the driver's seat. It's why Mitch McConnell -- when we write the autopsy, the RNC is looking at what went wrong in 2022, quality of candidates is top of the list. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. And, Keith, let me turn to you. Van Jones has called this a decision
 
 between the pride of a community and the shame of a community. What do you see in this runoff between these two candidates? 
 
KEITH BOYKIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think he's right, Jim. I don't know how anyone in Georgia or anyone else, who honestly seriously thinks Herschel Walker, from Texas, is qualified to be United States Senator from Georgia. 
 
Never mind the fact that he hasn't lived in the state or voted in the state. He has no experience, no preparation, no knowledge to take on this job. And he is going against somebody like Raphael Warnock, an experienced legislator, who has worked in the community, who has voted in the community. And people can see the difference.
 
So at this point, it's not about persuasion. It's about turnout. Anything can happen in this election. We have seen previous elections in the past. 
 
It's just a question of which campaign can get out its voters to the polls through the early voting, which has ended, all the way until tuesday. 
 
ACOSTA: And, Doug, there was this moment when former President Barack Obama seized on some unusual remarks from Herschel Walker about werewolves. Let's watch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
HERSCHEL WALKER, (R), U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE FOR GEORGIA: I don't know if you know about vampires. I'll tell you something I found out. A werewolf can kill a vampire. Did you know that? I never knew that. So I don't want to be a vampire anymore. I want to be a werewolf.
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Walker has been talking about issues that are of great importance to the people of Georgia. Like whether it's better to be a vampire for a werewolf. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
OBAMA: This is a debate that I must confess I once had myself.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
OBAMA: When I was 7. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
OBAMA: Then I grew up. As far as I'm concerned, he can be anything he wants to be except for a United States Senator.
 
(CHEERING)  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Doug, your thoughts? Werewolf, vampire, which is worse? HEYE: Well, Senate is worse. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ACOSTA: Plenty of both. 
 
HEYE: This is what McConnell was talking about. And he was sort of forced to go along with Herschel Walker. He was clearly going to be the nominee in Georgia. Other candidates, it wasn't clear if Dr. Oz was going to win and so forth. This is what he was talking about. 
 
We're talking about werewolves, vampires and things like that. This is not normal stuff. 
 
This is the lesson they need to learn. The last five years and think about Donald Trump's policies. The last five years, Republicans have had sort of the "Addams Family" running in race after race, whether it's president, Senate, Congress. 
 
You look at Madison Cawthorn, for example in North Carolina. You need to turn away from these candidates, get serious legislators. And then Georgia will be red again.
 
ACOSTA: You might start winning some races and close contests. 
 
HEYE: Yes.
 
ACOSTA: And, Keith, let me ask you this. Because I think is, just on a total different subject, but a fascinating development. Democrats moving forward with President Biden's proposal of making South Carolina the first state to hold a primary. 
 
As somebody who has covered presidential races from back to 2004, we certainly would like, as campaign reporters, would like to start covering the races in a warm climate like South Carolina, if I can just be selfish from my fellow political reporters. 
 
What do you think? Is that a good idea? 
 
BOYKIN: Well, I have the similar bias that you do, Jim. I went to college at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and I covered the 1984 presidential campaign as a student reporter and worked -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ACOSTA: You're not that old. 
 
BOYKIN: So I don't want to go back to New Hampshire either or Iowa, for that matter.
 
And South Carolina, obviously, is just a much more of a representative state for the Democratic party. The majority of the voters in South Carolina are African-Americans and the Democratic Party. 
 
And the majority of people who are contributing to the Democratic Party these days in terms of being their most loyal supporters are African-Americans as well. 
 
President Biden won his first primary in the first South Carolina primary in 2020. So I think it's a return of the favor, if you will.
 
But also, it is an important statement about the diversity of the party. Because it's also putting Nevada and Michigan in the lineup, too. And I'm not sure if all of those states would approve this. Iowa and New Hampshire jealously guard their first-in-the-nation role.
 <br>[15:40:06]
 
But I think it's time. It's long pastime. Our country is much more diverse in Iowa, and much more diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire. It's time to have a primary schedule that aligns with the interest of the people who elect our leaders.
 
ACOSTA: Doug, very quickly, a subject on the minds of voters, Kevin McCarthy, will he get the votes to become speaker? 
 
HEYE: That's the million-dollar question. He is the most likely. But we don't know if that's a 51 percent, 49 percent or what that number is yet. His job is to go out and get the votes right now. And that's why the next months is going to be --  
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ACOSTA: Is there a Plan B? 
 
HEYE: No, there isn't a Plan B. That is his best option right now. There's no Plan B. 
 
ACOSTA: That actually helps him. 
 
HEYE: It does. 
 
ACOSTA: It might narrow things down. 
 
All right, Doug Heye, Keith Boykin, thanks to both of you very much. We appreciate it.

The trip got off to a rocky start because of a new racially charged royal scandal back at home. 
 
CNN's Max Foster has the details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: A royal visit to the United States overshadowed by accusations of racism back home. 
 
A black charity executive, Ngozi Fulani, told the BBC how she attended an event at Buckingham Palace earlier this week and was asked again and again where she was really from. 
 
NGOZI FULANI, FOUNDER, SISTAH SPACE: I'm really from here. Yes. But, OK, I can see this is going to be a bit of a challenge. She said, what's your nationality? And I said, Lady, I was born here. I am British. 
 
I was thinking that would be the end of it. No. No, where are you really from? And where are your people from? 
 
FOSTER: British media identified the palace official as 83-year-old Lady Susan Hussey, the late queen's lady in waiting for more than 60 years and godmother to the Prince of Wales.
 
Buckingham Palace responded quickly and unequivocally. "The individual concerned would like to express her profound apologies for the hurt caused and has stepped aside from her role with immediate effect."  
 
(CHEERING)
 
FOSTER: William and Kate touched down in Boston on Wednesday ahead of their three-day visit for the second Earth Shots prize awards, a prize they helped set up for advances in climate science. The fiasco threatens to overshadow any focus on environmentalism. 
 
Behind closed doors, the royals would be devastated for the issue of racism in the monarchy has reared up yet again. 
 
Speaking to Oprah Winfrey in 2021, the duchess of Sussex, Meghan, pointed to her own experiences of racism inside palace walls. 
 
MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: Concern and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he grows up.
 
PRINCE HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX: I had to do everything I could to protect my family. 
 
FOSTER: Incidentally, the duchess of Sussex and her husband, Prince Harry, released the trailer for their upcoming Netflix docuseries on Thursday. 
 
And the pair was shortly received a human rights award from the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation for their heroic stand against structural racism within the royal family, according to organizers. 
 
Like William and Kate's recent visit to the Caribbean, when they were dogged by questions about the monarchy's colonial past --
