AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. Merry Christmas and Happy holidays. Welcome to the special edition of CNN this morning. It is Sunday, December 25. Of course, you know we've all been waiting for this beautiful morning. I'm Amara Walker.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, Amara. And Merry Christmas to you as well. Thank you so much for spending part of your holiday morning with us.
 
Just ahead this hour, fighting racism from a one-horse open sleigh after getting hate mail for putting up a black Santa in his yard. One man fights back by embodying the true spirit of Christmas. His remarkable story still ahead.
 
WALKER: Plus, soaring inflation has forced all of us to rethink our spending habits. How dollar stores are quickly becoming the go-to destination for shoppers.
 
SANCHEZ: And we're going to introduce you to this year's CNN hero of the year with a heartwarming moment as she accepted her award.
 
WALKER: And that is all coming up. But first, let's get you caught up on this morning's news headlines with Whitney Wild.
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Boris and Amara. And good morning, and Merry Christmas to you. If you're celebrating at home, we begin with this brutal weather storm keeping its grip on most of the country. At least 22 deaths are blamed on the storm and more than a quarter of a million people are without electricity.
 
The weather is causing travel headaches across the country. More than 3,400 flights were canceled yesterday and another 1,200 have been canceled so far today. New York Governor Kathy Hochul is sending more help -- to help hard-hit Buffalo. Hochul says she will ask the federal government for a declaration of emergency.
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval has more. POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Here in Buffalo, New York, what is widely considered as ground zero of this massive winter storm driving around is not only treacherous, itis still prohibited, especially for nonessential reasons. And this is one of the reasons why. This is a scene that repeats itself. According to officials, not only here in Buffalo, but throughout the region, you have vehicles that have basically been abandoned.
 
And so what authorities are going to do through the evening and also into Christmas Day, they will continue working around the clock, making sure that anybody that needs rescuing gets the attention they need. The mayor of the city of Buffalo on Saturday afternoon estimating that there could be as many as 200 people still stranded in and around the city.
 
On Friday night, they rescued roughly 65 individuals. And sadly, on Saturday, the mayor confirming the death of an individual who was found unconscious on a sidewalk here in Buffalo. And he says he shared with CNN what is a grim prediction that when everything is said and done, that that death toll could potentially rise.
 
And that's what's feeling concerns and a call for people to wake up Christmas morning at home. Sheltering in place, since any potential relief insight may not come for quite some time. Polo Sandoval, CNN, Buffalo, New York.
 
WILD: Polo, thank you. More migrants arrived last night outside the residence of Vice President Kamala Harris's home in Washington, D.C. Initially, two buses pulled up outside the Naval Observatory, but several more arrived later in the evening. A local group was assisting getting the migrants to shelters.
 
It's not clear exactly who is responsible for sending the migrants to the Naval Observatory. Earlier this year, CNN reported that Texas Governor Greg Abbott had sent buses of migrants north, including to a location outside Harris's home.
 
That winter storm is still impacting parts of the country with snow and very cold wind chills. CNN Meteorologist Britley Ritz is tracking that weather from the Weather Center. Good morning to you, Britley, what do you see?
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Good morning. It is cold, just as you mentioned, but there's some hope. We're trying to warm it up. Many of us getting above the single digits this morning. St. Louis, a whopping 10 degrees. Same for us in Columbus and Lexington. Buffalo, 18 degrees, but it feels like three as the winds hold strong. That's what counts. The windshield, the feels like temperature, if you will.
 
We have wind gusts in Buffalo of 37 miles per hour. Hence why, we still have wind chill advisories in place all across the Northern Plains, Upper Midwest, back through the Ohio Valley, and wind chill warnings through the Alleghenies and West Virginia. We get south. It's cold here too, that same front rolled through. And we have hard freeze warnings from Houston to Jacksonville, where temperatures are expected to be in the upper 20s. This morning, and here they are, 26 degrees. In Mobile. it feels like 14, 19. In Atlanta, it feels like six.
 <br>[06:05:05]
 
Your Christmas afternoon, expect temperatures in the teens through the Ohio Valleys. And back on down into the south, Houston, Dallas only in the 40s. There is a warm up. We talked about some hope, and it comes into play Wednesday and Thursday across the entire lower 48.
 
The snow is still falling through Watertown, New York. You see it there occasional whiteout conditions as blizzard warnings are still in effect until later this afternoon. You'll see those heavy bands now rolling just south of Buffalo and north of Erie, where more snow is expected today, Whitney?
 
WILD: Frigid.
 
RITZ: Yes.
 
WILD: Britley, thank you.
 
Five people are in custody in connection with a deadly shooting at Minnesota's Mall of America. Investigators say they arrested three 17- year-olds and two 218-year-olds who will be charged with second degree murder. They say at least one-person shot and killed a man Friday night inside in Nordstrom after some sort of altercation. Investigators say they don't yet know why the shooting happened.
 
A fire on board a JetBlue flight forced more than 160 passengers to evacuate shortly after landing at New York's JFK Airport last night. One passenger describes how the captain jumped into action.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEAN WEED, PASSENGER: The captain came flying out of the cabin. He grabbed a fire extinguisher and was doing like an O.J. Simpson over the seats and passengers. The guy was amazing and put the fire out.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILD: In a statement to CNN, JetBlue said, the flight from Barbados was evacuated due to reports of a customer's malfunctioning electronic device or battery. Fire officials say passengers were evacuated using emergency slides and that five people had minor injuries. The FAA and the NTSB are now investigating this incident.
 
Meanwhile, in Arizona, a judge has rejected Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake's lawsuit attempting to overturn her election defeat. The judge said there just wasn't clear or convincing evidence of misconduct and affirmed the victory of Democratic Governor elect Katie Hobbs.
 
Lake lost to Hobbs by about 17,000 votes. The ruling marks a major defeat for Lake, who built her candidacy on her support for former PresidentTrump's, lies about fraud in the 2020 presidential election. And finally, hundreds of surfing Santas hit the waves in Cocoa Beach, Florida, on Saturday. They braved the water despite unseasonably cold temperatures on Christmas Eve. The Santas hold this event to raise money for two charities. They have it every year. One of these charities helps people with transportation costs when they're trying to go to these cancer treatments. And another helps preserve the history of surfing on the East Coast.
 
Probably not a lot of history of these cold temperatures, though.
 
I'll see you back here, 25 minutes past the hour. Now I'll send it back to Boris and Amara.
 
WALKER: Still ahead, an Arkansas man puts a black Santa in his front yard and then begins receiving racist hate mail for it. But he didn't let that dampen his holiday cheer. How he's still spreading the Christmas spirit in his own way.
 
SANCHEZ: Plus, a buck doesn't go as far as it used to, even at the Dollar Store. But that's not stopping some bargain-hungry shoppers from cashing in. We're going to explain.
 
WALKER: And from soaring inflation to the crypto collapse, we've got a look at the top 10 business stories of the year.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:11:25]
 
SANCHEZ: This next story is just incredible. It really speaks to the power of a father's love and the true spirit of Christmas. Listen to this. Chris Kennedy was sent racist hate mail just for putting up an inflatable black Santa in his front yard. But instead of giving in to the hate, that experience set Chris on a path to becoming a professional Santa for his entire town. He wants others to do the same.
 
Let's start at the beginning, though. And that letter in Chris's own words.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRIS KENNEDY, FEATURED IN "SANTA CAMP" ON HBO MAX: Please remove your negro Santa Claus yard decoration. You should not try to deceive children into believing that I am a Negro. I am a Caucasian, white man to you and have been for the past 600 years. You're being jealous of my race is no excuse for your dishonesty.
 
Besides that, you are making yourself a laughing stock of the neighborhood. Maybe you should move to a neighborhood with the rest of your racist kind. Yours truly, Santa Claus.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow.
 
KENNEDY: And it came with a picture, Santa Claus with the thumbs down.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My God.
 
KENNEDY: I brought this to do this here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALKER: So hard to listen to. That was a clip from the HBO Max Documentary, "Santa Camp" and we are thrilled to welcome Chris Kennedy onto the program with us now. Santa Chris, it's it's so nice to see you on this day. Thanks for joining us.
 
KENNEDY: Well, ho, ho, ho and Merry Christmas to you guys. Thanks for having me on.
 
WALKER: Merry Christmas, back at you. I mean, I just -- we're going to start sob, but let's going to have a very happy ending. Tell us more about, you know, what happened after you got that letter. I mean, your -- I love that you kept your dignity and that you stood up against these hateful words.
 
KENNEDY: Well, after I got that, you know, immediately the -- I initially recorded a Facebook video, it went viral. Then I went to the, you know, in the whole process. I went to the police station, went to the post office to, you know, do all the proper reporting. And then, you know, people were reaching out.
 
And one of my mentors was like, hey, would you mind taking pictures of Santa with my granddaughter? You know as a -- let's get back at them. And so it just kind of snowballed from there. They took pictures with her, with my daughter and, you know, just different friends and family. And then a few months later, I was reached out to by someone from Santa Camp asking if I would consider coming to learn about being a professional Santa Santa.
 
SANCHEZ: Santa Chris, I love also hearing that some of your neighbors, after you got that letter, also started putting up black Santas of their own in an active solidarity with you. We're showing clips now from the "Santa Camp" documentary. It follows the New England Santa Society as they tackle a lack of diversity in that industry.
 
We have another clip for you.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've never had the interaction with the Santa Claus in a classroom that was black before. I'd be glad if you could give me any hints.
 <br>[06:15:06]
 
I don't mean to offend you, Chris. Now that I think about that question. I apologize for that.
 
I apologize. I really don't need -- mean to ask you that.
 
KENNEDY: No, that's fine.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But interesting that you've been a Santa for a while, that's good.
 
KENNEDY: Being the only person of color here, it was definitely lonely and awkward, to say the least.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALKER: Santa Chris, it seems like they learned as much from you as you did from them.
 
KENNEDY: Yes, that's absolutely true. We were able to, you know -- "Santa Camp" is all about learning. I was able to learn different things from them, how to dye my beard and different ways to interact with kids. And they were able to just learn, you know, how much diversity actually does matter, how important it is for little black and brown kids to see themselves reflected in not only regular media, but as characters such as Santa.
 
WALKER: We've heard, you know, in previous years very controversial statements from, you know, media personalities and the like about, you know, what Santa's skin color should be. But the fact of the matter is, Santa is a fictional character. He is who we want him to be, especially in our hearts, right?
 
And I know that you've had such incredible action, reactions from the community. I'm curious to know what your daughter feels about you being Santa Chris. And also, I understand that there have been people from -- who've come from hours away just to meet you.
 
KENNEDY: Yes. So we kind of do this as a family. My daughter is my elf. My wife is Mrs. Claus. So as much as we can, we appear as a family unit because that's what we are.
 
And yes, I've had -- my first really big event was the Northern Lights festival here in North Little Rock. And we had a woman come from Mississippi. I know that she had her daughter come and pick her up, and they had driven well over 300 miles to come and visit.
 
WALKER: Wow.
 
KENNEDY: And, you know, it was -- I'm so glad the camera wasn't on me when she and I were talking because, you know, I teared up because she was telling me, you know, she was 80 years old -- 80 plus, and she had never seen a black Santa. And it was that important to her to come and visit me.
 
The amount of kids that I've had since becoming Santa that are so happy that Santa looks like them. One of my little kids, he was just like, Santa, you're brown like me, and was rubbing my hand and was just so happy to be there. And it's, you know, it's those things that people don't see, the little moments with kids where they're telling you and giving you different words of affirmation that you don't even know that you need as an adult to know that you're doing something right, that's having an impact on them.
 
SANCHEZ: That's awesome. Santa Chris, in another "Santa Camp" clip, you talk about a sadness that you feel that there aren't more black Santas out there. But you have to know that there may be people that come across you and what you're trying to accomplish, and it makes them angry for whatever reason. What would be your message to those folks?
 
KENNEDY: Hey, if you're angry at seeing a black Santa, then you're not for me, but I'm here for everyone else who enjoys the Christmas spirit, enjoys seeing Santa, and wants to see themselves reflected. I hold no ill will towards people who don't like me being Santa. As I said, I'm here for kids and families that want to see representation and who just want to have a good time in Christmas or with Christmas.
 
There's literally nothing wrong with seeing something, not liking it and moving on. That's what the person that wrote that letter should have done. If they didn't like it, they should have just moved on. And I wouldn't have been on this trajectory more than likely, I would have just stuck to doing this for my family and friends. But there's sadness in the fact that there's not more black Christmas performers, but there's hope because there are becoming more.
 
I've met a ton of Santa's that are amazing people and have been nothing but helpful. And I think that moving forward, that diversity is going to take hold in the Santa community because, you know, the white Santas don't actually care about more people getting into it. They want more people into it.
 <br>[06:20:10]
 
The more people that are here, the better it is. The more people that are professionally trained, the better that it is for our profession. And I just think that it's great. It does nothing but help families going forward having more diversity.
 
WALKER: Right. And make Christmas that much more magical for families of all different backgrounds. And, you know, this person that sent you that hateful message, he or she, ironically, just helped increase representation in the Santa world, right?
 
And before we let you go, I understand that you have your own spin on Santa's ho, ho, ho. Can we hear that before we go?
 
KENNEDY: Yes, absolutely. Bro ho, ho, Merry Christmas. Thank you all for watching today. But, yes, it's -- I definitely have my own spin and, you know, my Santa Claus that they were upset about. It started out at 6 foot. Now I have a 15 foot one in my front yard, so -- 
 
WALKER: Good for you. I love that.
 
SANCHEZ: That's awesome. I love it. Bro ho, ho, ho to you, Santa Chris. A very merry Christmas. We'll let you get to it. We know it's going to be a busy one. I hope you did get my letter, though. There's a very extensive list -- 
 
WALKER: Mine too. Mine too.
 
SANCHEZ: -- of gift requests. I look forward to opening those. Thanks so much, Santa Chris. WALKER: Thanks, Santa.
 
KENNEDY: Thank you. Merry Christmas.
 
WALKER: I want to know what your list is. Off camera?
 
SANCHEZ: Not for here. Not for here. Yes. How great is that, though? Somebody sends him a nasty note and he doesn't allow it to define him. He sort of takes the reins and defines himself. He becomes Santa. That's awesome.
 
WALKER: Yes, yes. Like I said, an increased representation. Now he's a professional Santa and really just creating such memorable moments for so many children in his area. All right.
 
SANCHEZ: Your morning news headlines are coming up after this short break. Stay with CNN This Morning.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:25:20]
 
SANCHEZ: Welcome back to this special Christmas edition of CNN This Morning. We're so happy that you were sharing your holiday with us.
 
WALKER: Yes. Thanks so much for waking up with us. Good morning to you, everyone. And Merry Christmas to you, Boris, and to all of you at home. Coming up this half hour, we saw prices rise at the pump, at the grocery store, and in the housing market. How that is forcing shoppers to change their spending habits and why it's led to a boom in business for some stores.
 
SANCHEZ: And you'll meet this year's CNN hero of the year, Nelly Cheboi. You'll hear how her mother's determination helped lead her to this moment and how she honored her mom when accepting the Hero of the Year award.
 
WALKER: It is a beautiful moment. But first, let's get you caught upon this morning's headlines with Whitney Wild.
 
WILD: Good morning, Boris and Amara. Good morning and Merry Christmas to you. If you're celebrating, a dangerous and deadly winter storm is keeping a grip on most of the country. At least 22 deaths are blamed on the storm and more than a quarter of a million people are without electricity.
 
The weather is causing severe travel headaches all across the country. More than 3,400 flights were canceled yesterday, another 1,200 have been canceled so far today. New York Governor Kathy Hochul is sending more help to hard-hit Buffalo. Hochul says she will ask the federal government for a declaration of emergency.
 
Migrants along the U.S.-Mexican border are braving these frigid temperatures. Some are sleeping outside in the bitter cold. But the city of El Paso, Texas, and its residents are reaching out to help.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal has the details.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It has been cold, it's been difficult, and it's been dangerous for a lot of these migrants, but they've had a lot of help. A lot of the community here in El Paso coming out wanting to make this discussion for a lot of these migrants.
 
You see them here lined up. That's because the people of El Paso made rice, beans, chicken, and they're lining up to get that food. So many people who are out here on the street doing everything they can to survive because many of them are sleeping outside on the sidewalk. And now what they're getting is a little bit of hope from the people of El Paso.
 
We've seen more volunteers, more locals than we've seen throughout the last couple of days, but also a lot of families, a lot of children that are still here and that are spending Christmas Day out on the street. You see the blankets? There are piles and piles of them. There are also piles of donations.
 
This is things that people from El Paso bring to these migrants so that they can have an easier time as they're sleeping through 20 degrees, 18 degrees. Those are the kinds of temperatures that we've seen over the last couple of nights. A lot of the migrants I've talked to telling me that it's been really difficult.
 
One of them saying, look, I try not to even think about the fact that it's Christmas because it is so difficult to be away from my family and to be here. But I've seen so much humanity as well. There's children here who are coloring. I saw someone bringing toys for the children, allowing them to pick any toy they wanted. They brought toys for Christmas specifically.
 
A lot of the locals telling me that they are moved, that they are touched, that they have seen what these migrants are going through and they want to help them. They want to do something so that their life is just a little bit easier on this holiday.
 
Camila Bernal, CNN, El Paso, Texas.
 
WILD: Camila, thank you. All around the world, Christmas celebrations are underway.
 
(MUSIC)
 
WILD: In Bethlehem, midnight mass was held at the Church of the Nativity, which was built in the fourth century. According to the Bible, that West Bank town is the birthplace of Jesus. There were other Christmas Eve celebrations earlier in the day, including parades and drumming.
 
Let's take you live now to St. Peter's Basilica. This is where Pope Francis just wrapped up the annual Christmas Day blessing. But it was during his Christmas Eve message where the pontiff made a special request during this time of giving. CNN's Dianne Gallagher has more. DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Pope Francis during Christmas Eve mass at the Vatican asked people to do something good this Christmas time. He said God is not impressed with just appearances, but wants concrete action. Don't let the Christmas time pass, the Pope said, without doing something good.
 
We know Francis is doing something good for the people of Ukraine this Christmas time. He is organizing thermal items of clothing to be delivered there. The Vatican has opened a donations page for anybody who wants to and tribute to that effort. It's at www.eppela, E-P-P-E- L-A com. That's open through January 6 for donations.
 <br>[06:30:00] 
 
Francis stayed seated during the mass on Saturday evening. We know he has an ongoing knee problem. One which caused him to cancel a trip to Africa this past summer. That trip is now back on despite the Pope's knee problem. He will be traveling to the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan at the end of January. Delia Gallagher, CNN, Rome. 
 
WILD: Delia, thank you. The Taliban is further restricting the rights of women in Afghanistan. The group has informed nongovernmental organizations that female employees are no longer allowed to come to work. Any organization that doesn't comply will lose its license to work in the country. Secretary of State Tony Blinken expressed his concern that the band could disrupt the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid and call the decision "devastating."
 
Meanwhile, the Taliban used water cannons to break up a group of women protesting the group's decision earlier this week to ban women from attending universities. 
 
Football legend Pele's family is gathered in his Sao Paulo hospital room where he will be spending Christmas. His son arrived at the Albert Einstein Jewish Hospital on Saturday, according to an Instagram post from his sister. He later posted the photo of him holding his father's hand, posted that to his own Instagram account. Pele has been hospitalized since November 29 for respiratory infection, and a reevaluation of his chemotherapy treatment for colon cancer which was identified in September 2021. Wishing the legend best of luck in his recovery. 
 
I'll see you back here at the top of the hour, but for now we'll send it back to Boris and Amara.
 
WALKER: Soaring inflation has forced all of us to think more about how we spend our money. And that has meant a big boom in business for one group of stores in particular. We're going to explain coming up. 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR (on camera): And 2022 may be remembered for rising costs. For others, it'll also be remembered as the year that crypto tanked. We've got to look at the top 10 business stories of the year. CNN THIS MORNING is back after a short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:35:00]
 
WALKER: U.S. dollar stores are reporting strong sales as cash-strapped shoppers look to cut grocery costs and prioritize food and fuel over non-essential items. CNN Business Reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn joining us now to talk about this. 
 
Nathaniel, good to see you. So, start off by telling us about dollar store profits and what's driving their strong sales.
 
NATHANIEL MEYERSOHN, CNN Right So America is really a nation of dollar stores. Dollar General Sales last quarter increased 6.8 percent. While Dollar Tree its rival sales were up 6.5 percent. So, really strong numbers last quarter from the dollar stores. And it's a continuation of trends we've seen really over the past decade. 
 
More recently, inflation is driving more shoppers to dollar stores. Wealthier customers are trading down to try to save on groceries and essentials while dollar -- while the dollar stores core lower-income shoppers are relying on them more as well. So, it's really the perfect environment for these stores.
 
WALKER: But what about these this these discount chains that we're talking about? I mean, they must be affected by inflation as well and the supply chain and transportation costs. No?
 
MEYERSOHN: They are getting hit by higher labor transportation supply chain costs. Their profits are getting squeezed. And that's actually what drove Dollar Tree one of the largest chains to raise its prices from $1.00 to $1.25 last year. It was trying to offset those higher costs with higher prices.
 
WALKER: But they're obviously still doing well, right? Dollar general plans to open more than 1000 new stores in 2023 after sales increased 11 percent in the third quarter, and net profit rose eight percent. So, tell us how popular and widespread dollar stores have become here in the U.S.
 
MEYERSOHN: Right. So, there are more than $35,000 stores in the U.S. which is higher than the number of locations for McDonald's and Starbucks combined. And it's been driven over the past decade since the great recession by income inequality and the shrinking middle class. These stores are also much smaller than a traditional Walmart or a Target, so they can open in areas where those big box stores can't. 
 
Dollar General for example, 75 percent of its stores are in rural towns that really targets the smaller areas where you're just not going to find a grocery store or even a pharmacy nearby.
 
WALKER: And it's also a great place to just find, you know, little toys for the kids that are cheap and are often broken anyway. So, why pay more when you get them at a dollar store? Look, there's fierce competition in this -- in the discount sector, right? And one chain that is struggling is Family Dollar. So, what's the story there? And how is it trying to win back customers on tight budgets as we're talking about? MEYERSOHN: Yes. So, it's interesting. So, Dollar Tree actually owns Family Dollar. It's hard -- it's hard to keep all three of them -- keep track of them. So, Family Dollars really in cities and more rural areas while Dollar Tree is in more suburban areas. And Family Dollar has really struggled over the past few years. Its stores are really messy. They're often understaffed. Sometimes the conditions are not that well-kept. And also, its prices have gone up over the past few years, so it's closed some stores. 
 
And it has a new strategy to win back shoppers. It's going to start lowering prices about five percent, which is not something that most companies are doing right now. Most are raising prices. They're also adding new merchandise into stores. And they're opening more kind of coolers and freezers in their stores to try to add beverages and products they're going to get shoppers to stores.
 
WALKER: Yes, and maybe new shoppers. Interesting. Nathaniel Meyersohn, thank you so much for joining us.
