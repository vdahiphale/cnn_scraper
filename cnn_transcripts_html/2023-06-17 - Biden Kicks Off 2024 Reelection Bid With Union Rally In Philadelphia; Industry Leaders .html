LAILA HARRAK, CNN HOST: Welcome to our viewers, watching here in the United States and around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. 
 
Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, Top African leaders push for peace. The group set to arrive in Russia soon after wrapping up talks in Kyiv. But are their proposals gaining any traction? 
 
Blinken heads to Beijing with relations between the US and China on a downward spiral. America's Secretary of State is looking to calm the waters with his visit to Beijing.
 
And brutal atrocities and potential war crimes being committed in Sudan. We'll have an exclusive CNN investigation. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN center, this is CNN NEWSROOM, with Laila HARRAK.
 
HARRAK: But, first we begin with breaking news out of Uganda where police say at least 25 people were killed and eight others injured when armed rebels attacked a school near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. And our Larry Madowo is following developments very closely and joins me now live. Larry what more can you tell us about the group that Uganda's government says is behind this terrorist attack? 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Laila, we are learning more about what happened at this Lhubiriha Secondary School. It's in Mpondwe, that's in western Uganda, at least (ph) two kilometers from the Democratic Republic of Congo. And the spokesperson for the military operations in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo telling CNN that about 20 to 25 rebels from the Allied Democractic Forces or ADF attacked the school Friday night, between 11 and midnight, and they essentially massacred these poor students. 
 
At least 26 were killed in this attack. Eight were wounded and are receiving treatment. Some of them in critical condition. We are also hearing from this military spokesperson that at least six students were abducted during this operation. And when they were done they set the school on fire. And, as we speak right now there's still supposed to be a fire that's burning at the school so it's possible that these numbers could increase. They suspect there could be some bodies. Some people were killed during that attack. The bodies could still be inside the school as it burns. They've not been able to put out that fire. It's a really horrific scene. 
 
Some pictures already circulating on Ugandan social media showing bodies lying in blood in the school. And one of the worst attacks that this country has seen. The ADF have attacked Uganda before, attacked the capital here in Kampala before. There were suicide attacks in 2021, and surely after that the Ugandan military and the Congolese military began joint operations in late 2021 to stamp out the ADF. 
 
President Yoweri Museveni has previously said that the ADF is nothing, that they will be defeated, that the Ugandan military has stamped out other armed groups. But the ADF started here in Uganda in 1995, 1996 and then crossed over into the eastern part of Democratic Republic of Congo. It is now said to be one of the most dangerous, one of the deadliest of the armed groups that operates in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of Congo. 
 
So, this now -- this latest attack shocking the nation and also showing just the fear that these armed groups pose not just in the eastern DRC but also in western Uganda, Laila.
 
HARRAK: Larry Madowo reporting there on breaking developments in Uganda. Thank you so much.
 
Russia's president says he now has nuclear weapons on stand by in Belarus. And that's where Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago. Speaking Friday, Mr. Putin boasted about the number of nukes Russia has with some choice words for NATO.
 
Vladimir Putin (translation): We have more of these weapons than NATO countries do. They know that and they keep telling us to start negotiations on reductions. Well, you know what? They can shove it. 
 
HARRAK: Putin says there is a serious danger of NATO being drawn further into the war by supplying military weaponry to Ukraine. And he says more nuclear weapons will be sent to Belarus throughout the summer as a warning to the West about supporting Ukraine. 
 
On the frontlines, Ukraine says its forces sometimes have to fight for every meter as they make slow headway in their offensive. 
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
Well, officials say Ukrainian troops continue their advance around Bakhmut without giving details. And they report pushing Russian troops back by up to one kilometer in the south. But, Ukrainian forces have to navigate a maze of defensive fortifications while being pummeled by Russian air strikes and artillery. Moscow still denies that Ukraine has made any progress. 
 
A group of African leaders, meanwhile, is expected in St. Petersburg in the coming hours for a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Their goal, to pitch their peace plan for Russia and Ukraine, a day after doing the same with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv. 
 
The African leaders are calling for a de-escalation of the conflict and negotiations. But, Mr. Zelenskyy said there is nothing to talk about with Moscow as long as Russian troops in Ukraine. 
 
For more now, where Nada Bashir is following developments for us from London. Nada, the group of African leaders is now on their way to meet with the Russian 
 
Leader. What message will they deliver after their visit to the Ukrainian president?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, from the perspective of the African leaders' part of this delegation, the message is clear. It is a call for de-escalation on both sides. This has been touted as a peace mission. It's the first of it's kind for this particular delegation of African leaders. 
 
We heard yesterday from South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa speaking alongside President Zelenskyy in Kyiv. He said that he believes that on the part of the African leaders and in the global community that this war needs to end sooner rather than later. But believes that it can only be brought to an end through diplomatic means, namely, through negotiation. 
 
But of course this isn't the first time we have seen global mediation efforts or calls for Russia and Ukraine to come to the negotiating table. We have seen efforts by the likes of Turkey and most recently, by China. And throughout this, President Zelenskyy has been pretty clear on where he stands when it comes to the potential for negotiated peace between Russian and Ukraine. And his line of course, remains that Russia needs to withdraw all of its troops across Ukraine's territory. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Today, as I said many times, making it very clear that to allow any negotiations with Russian now, while the occupier is on our land, is to freeze the war, to freeze everything. Pain, and suffering. 
 
BASHIR: Of course, this delegation of African leaders is set to meet with President Putin today. There were some skepticism on the part of President Zelenskyy yesterday during that press conference when it came to questions over potential roadmap for peace. He did highlight his calls, repeated calls, for the release of political prisoners. That is something he has asked the the African delegation to reiterate in its meeting with President Putin later today.
 
But of course, this is a region which has long held close ties with Moscow, dating back to the Cold War. And, there are real concerns not only around the peace situation between Russia and Ukraine, but of course, concerns for the African continent, not least when it comes to the question of food security which has been a concern across the world since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That was certainly a topic discussed yesterday with President Zelenskyy. 
 
Questions around the Black Sea, grain, and neshetive (ph) deal. Many countries in Africa, of course, dependent to varying degrees on grain and fertilizer exports from both Russia and Ukraine. So, that is expected to be another focus today on the agenda when it comes to that meeting with President Putin. Laila?
 
HARRAK: Nada Bashir, reporting. Thank you. 
 
The US Secretary of State took off from Washington a few hours ago to begin his long-delayed trip to China. Anthony Blinken is going there to try and ease rising tensions with Beijing and establish better lines of communication. He says greater dialogue can help both sides avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict. 
 
Well, it comes two weeks after their navies had a close call in the Taiwan Strait. The US said a Chinese war ship cut in front of an American destroyer forcing it to slow down to avoid a collision. Well, the US so hopes Blinken's trip to China will help stabilize the situation. But at the same time officials are keeping their expectations in check. CNN's Oren Liebermann reports now from the Pentagon. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A high stakes visit with low expectations. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken heads to China, trying to reopen crucial lines of communication with Beijing.
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Intense competition requires sustained diplomacy to ensure that competition does not veer into confrontation or conflict. And again, that is what the world expects of both United States and China.
 
LIEBERMANN: Blinken's trip was canceled once before after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon that flew over sensitive US sites in February. Since then, relations have declined. 
 <br>[02:10:01]
 
The serious of dangerous encounters between two of the most powerful militaries on Earth ratcheting up the tensions. 
 
In late May, a Chinese fighter jet sliced in front of a US reconnaissance air craft international airspace over the South China Sea, according to the US, forcing the larger, heavier US plane to fly through the wake turbulence of the Chinese jet. 
 
Days later, in the Taiwan Strait, a Chinese navy ship cut 150 yards in front of a US destroyer in what the US called an unsafe and unprofessional maneuver. China said the US was there for provocation. Earlier, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shared a hand shake with his Chinese counterpart even as Beijing rejected a formal meeting. Austin emphasized Friday that he is ready for dialogue. 
 
LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The door is open in the -- my phone is -- my phone line is open and so, they can pick up the phone and call at any time. 
 
LIEBERMANN: A senior White House official said dialogue is how mature, strong militaries interact. And the stakes are just too high to avoid these critical lines of communication. But, at the highest levels of the military, Austin hasn't met with his Chinese counterpart in a year. Blinken is now trying to thaw those frosty relations as Beijing maintains a deep distrust about Washington's intentions for the region and for China.
 
WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: The US needs to respect China's core concerns. Stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security, and development interests in the name of competition. 
 
LIEBERMANN: The State Department said it's not expecting a breakthrough from this visit, just a realistic approach to manage the competition of world powers in a responsible way. 
 
BLINKEN: If we want to make sure, as we do, that the competition that we have with China doesn't veer into conflict, the place you start is with communicating. 
 
LIEBERMANN: One month ago, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers that the US is working on a weapons drawdown package for Taiwan. That would be a quick way of shipping them additional weapons, the same way the US has used to ship much of its weapons to Ukraine. 
 
But it seems at least that is on hold. There's no update on how soon that might come that may be because the US doesn't want to put that out there and risk something so sensitive as Taiwan disrupting the attempt to reopen diplomatic channels and military channels with Beijing.

HARRAK: Still ahead, this hour, CNN investigates human rights abuses in Darfur. We'll explain why Russian mercenaries could be complicit in the atrocities. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:16:22]
 
HARRAK: The UN is warning that violence in Sudan's Darfur region is spiraling into a humanitarian calamity as fighting rages between the country's warring factions. An aid group says the crisis recently forced 6,000 people to flee West Darfur's capital into neighboring Chad. Hundreds of those people have been wounded, and some were in need of surgical care. 
 
Fighting has also been reported in Sudan's South Darfur state where activists says eight civilians were killed on Thursday and five villages were burned down. Sudanese rights organizations say atrocities are being committed in Darfur. And, CNN has uncovered that Russian mercenary group Wagner is complicit, continuing to support the RSF, Sudan's Rapid Support Forces paramilitary throughout the months of fighting despite calls by US and others for support to cease. 
 
In an exclusive CNN investigation, we uncovered the Russian supply lines prolonging the conflict between the RSF and Sudan's Armed Forces that that has now displaced around 2 million people since mid-April and pushed the country further into humanitarian crisis. 
 
The RSF denies links to Wagner and any involvement in in mass rape. As part of this investigation, CNN verified and corroborated incidents of rape perpetrated by the RSF including one which was captured on video. 
 
We feel it's important in the face of the RSF's repeated denials to broadcast part of that video. We must warn you, it is graphic and disturbing. 
 
CNN's chief international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir brings us this story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: The fighting on the streets of Sudan is relentless. Ceasefire after ceasefire has not held. Forces previously accused of genocide returning to a well worn playbook. 
 
Terrorize, expel, and ethnically cleanse. 
 
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are currently engaged in a fight for dominance with Sudan' army. But years before that rivalry spilled blood in Sudan's streets, they were implicated in atrocities in Darfur. Now, once gain, Darfur to the west of the country is stoked by the specter of genocide.
 
The damage brought by these forces is so extensive you can see it from satellite images. This is El-Geneina, West Darfur. Hundreds killed, whole districts razed to the ground. And it's not only El-Geneina that is burning. This is Andur. And this, Kudumi. 
 
On the ground, it looks like this. These scenes sadly familiar in Darfur. 20 years ago, the region descended into genocide. The same RSF leadership in place, as their men killed, occupied and raped. Now, once again, women's bodies are part of the field of war. 
 
This video is too disturbing to broadcast in full but it goes on to show a girl believed to be just 15 years old being raped. You see here a man in light colored fatigues matching those worn by the RSF. 
 <br>[02:20:01]
 
We have paused the video just before the camera pans to show another soldier wearing the same uniform forcing himself on to the prone girl. 
 
CNN verified and geolocated the area where this happened. We are not revealing the exact location in Khartoum to protect our sources and the young girl. This is not an isolated incident. We received and reviewed dozens of cases where women say they were raped by RSF soldiers. identifying them by their light colored fatigues and the insignias on their right shoulders. So, who is complicit in this pain? 
 
The RSF's key ally, the Russian mercenary group Wagner, has been sustaining their fight and providing the impetus to slaughter innocent people by supplying arms. We're going to show you how. 
 
This is an Ilyushin 76 cargo plane, operated by Wagner, sitting at a Libyan air base. A previous CNN investigation exposed how this Russian cargo plane was providing the RSF
 
with deadly arms from a Russian naval base in Latakia, Syria via Wagner-controlled bases in Libya.
 
This passing (ph) starts just days before the war begins in Sudan. Libya, Syria, and back and it picks up pace. What's interesting here is the new focus on the city where it goes next Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic. 
 
After our exposure of the Libya route into, a route directly form the Central African Republic into Darfur became crucial for the RSF. Eyewitnesses at key transit points and intelligence active in the region told CNN, arms and supplies from this Ilyushin transported overland using the truck captured here and others like it. First to a Wagner base in Birao and then into South Darfur. So, an RSF base in UM Dafuq.
 
Wagner putting their thumb on the scales here to secure access to Sudan's resources through Darfur creating chaos and terror, helping tip the balance of power in their war in 
 
Ukraine, whatever the cost. 
 
Nima Elbagir, CNN. Juba, South Sudan. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Well, US condemnation of the latest violence in Sudan has been swift with the State Department's African Affairs Bureau issuing this warning. 
 
"Rape, murder, targeted ethnic based killings, the destruction of whole villages, these are the horrors that the war in Sudan has brought back to Darfur. Credible sources place blame at the feet of RSF and allied militias. Attacks on civilians in Sudan by any party must end."
 
Coming up. A federal jury reaches a verdict for the gunman accused of killing almost a dozen people in the Tree of Life synagogue. Coming up, details, from a report in Pittsburgh. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:27:08]
 
HARRAK: In the federal criminal case against Donald Trump, even routine court filings are taking on an outsized significance. One such bit of legal business took place on Friday when Special Counsel Jack Smith filed for a protective order to prevent Trump and his attorneys from sharing the evidence they were about to receive. 
 
As we said this type of filing is completely normal and Trump and his legal team agreed to it. But with Trump's talkative track record, Friday's filing seemed anything but routine. The court order that Smith is seeking is quite strict and covers a variety of possible 
 
scenarios.
 
CNN's Paula Reid is in Washington with those details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The special counsel's office is asking the judge overseeing the Trump document case to sign off on a set of rules for protecting sensitive information in this case. 
 
Now according to this request, both sides, both prosecutors and defense attorneys have agreed to these rules, about how to handle the sensitive evidence that will soon be shared with defense attorneys. They are not talking about classified information here. We are talking about the other sensitive information that is part of this case. 
 
Now among the rules that prosecutors are seeking here have to do with the defendants, former president Trump and his aide, Walt Nauta. They are insisting that the two not be able to view any of the evidence that is shared with attorneys without their attorneys present. They also request they not be given copies of it or be able to take notes and then take those notes. The notes need to be protected and kept safe by the attorneys. 
 
Now, prosecutors say in this request that they worry that sharing this information with the public or others could compromise other ongoing investigations, witnesses or other people who haven't been charged. We know the special counsel is of course looking at the events in around January 6th and efforts to undermine the 2020 election. We also know that many of the witnesses in the Trump documents case are also interviewed in the January 6th investigation. 
 
Now, when it comes to classified information, they are not quite there yet because the Trump attorneys need clearances before they can handle any of those sensitive, secrets that are at the heart of this case. The former president is accused of taking over 30 documents. 
 
Now earlier this week the judge overseeing this case, Aileen Cannon -- she told the lawyers to begin that process to get their clearances. She wants an update next week. Now, the lawyers Todd Blanche and Chris Kise have said they are already in touch with the Justice Department to get that process started so that they can eventually be able to view classified evidence as well. 
 
Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) HARRAK: Well, it could be argued that the proposed protective order is for Trump's own good to discourage him from hurting his own defense. 
 <br>[02:30:04]
 
CNN anchor John Berman spoke with about this with CNN contributor John Dean who served as White House Counsel under President Nixon. Here's some of that conversation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN DEAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: This is standard procedure with Donald Trump know because we know he cannot keep it zipped and will chatter up and share information that should not be shared. 
 
So, this is as fairly standard protective order under the federal rules of criminal procedure, not unusual. But interesting John is the judge who issued the ruling, and that was the magistrate judge, Judge Reinhard, who is assigned with Judge Cannon but is far more seasoned in criminal trials. He in fact has a criminal trial background. He was in the Department of Justice, and probably knows Jack Smith. 
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: John, you know, you said the former president can't keep it zipped. What are the types of things that he could say or would be likely to say during a political speech that could get him in trouble in a courtroom? 
 
DEAN: Well, he has had a consistent habit of making admissions against interest. In fact, the defamation case by Jean Carrol against him was largely based on his own admissions both in a deposition, as well as outside of the deposition. He got a subsequent action filed against him because of his inability to keep a lip closed. So, you know who knows where he'll go. But he could -- he could give leads to others as to what the government was doing that is inevitable going to be shown to him as it relates to his case. So, these are the sort of thing that this protective order seeks to caution and protect.

HARRAK: In Pennsylvania, Robert Bowers has been convicted of the deadliest attack on Jewish people in the United States. 11 worshippers were killed and six others were wounded, when Bowers stormed into the Tree of Life synagogue in October 2018. 
 
The jury deliberated for about five hours over two days before returning guilty verdicts on 63 charges. The convictions mean that the trial now moves to the penalty phase. The jury must decide whether to sentence Robert Bowers to death or to life in prison without parole. CNN's Danny Freeman reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Silence in the courtroom Friday morning as Judge Robert Colville read the verdicts. 63 federal charges, guilty on all counts. 22 of those charges punishable by death. The jury agreed with federal prosecutors that the man who killed 11 jewish worshipers and injured six other people in October 2018, targeted them specifically because they were Jewish. 
 
JO RECHT, DOR HADASH PRESIDENT: I am feeling a sense of relief that after four and a half years the world has heard again about the horrible acts on October 27, 2018 and the shooter is being held responsible for those awful acts. 
 
FREEMAN: Throughout more than two grueling weeks of testimony, prosecutors showed how the defendant turned a sacred house of worship into a hunting ground. Body camera video and 911 calls revealed chaos and terror. Jurors heard 84-year-old, Bernice Simons 911 call as she held a prayer shawl to her husband's bullet wounds. 
 
"We're being attacked. I am scared to death." She cried out before being shot and killed while hiding in a pew.
 
The defense did not dispute their client killed the 11 worshippers, but the shooter's attorneys tried to argue that the attack was motivated by immigration-related conspiracy theories, not by a hatred of Jews. Prosecutors called that argument absurd. 
 
JEFF FINKLESTEIN, JEWISH FEDERATION OF GREATER PITTSBURGH: This was an anti-semetic incident, period, end of the statement. 
 
FREEMAN: Community leaders in pittsburgh say that Friday's result was a victory but the death penalty phase looms large. 
 
FINKLESTEIN: While we are pleased with the verdict, very pleased, we 
 
know that there is still more to come. This is only the first phase. 
 
STEVEN COHEN, NEW LIFE CONGREGATION: It's difficult to say the emotions we feel right now. One of relief obviously, that the jury returned a full verdict of guilty to all 63 counts. But there's also a degree of 
 
trepidation because this is just the first third of the trial, and in a sense it was the least complicated part. 
 
FREEMAN: Now, as we look ahead to the death penalty phase of this trial, one of things we'll be look for is exactly what kind of defense will be mounted. Remember, in this guilt phase, the prosecution called 60 witnesses to the stand, while the defense team called no one. But now, the gunman's attorneys will be fighting to spare his life.

Archeologists in Germany have found a rare 3,000-year-old sword. And officials say that it's in such good condition, it's still actually gleaming. It was found at a burial site and is thought to have been left in the grave as a gift. Researchers also believe the sword was a real weapon because of its center of gravity.

HARRAK: The US Justice Department says systemic problems in the Minneapolis Police Department made the murder of George Floyd possible. The damning report released on Friday comes more than three years after Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd's neck and back for more than nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and gasping for air. 
 
On Friday, the US Attorney General said that Floyd's murder has had, "an irrevocable impact on the Minneapolis community, on the country, and on the world." Merrick Garland announcing the report's findings, says George Floyd should still be alive today. He said the force often used dangerous techniques even for petty reasons. 
 
Floyd's murder at the hands of police in May of 2020 prompted global protests against police brutality. And CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is in Minneapolis with more details on the Justice Department's findings. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) 
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Minneapolis residents tell me the report revealed by the 
 
Department of Justice paints a picture. The picture is what they have been trying to tell anyone who would listen for nearly a decade. 
 
MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: We found that the Minneapolis Police Department routinely uses excessive force. 
 
BROADDUS: The Attorney-General and the Justice Department unleashing a scathing report, Friday, on Minneapolis police failures, detailing systemic problems leading up to the murder of George Floyd in 2020. 
 
GARLAND: The Minneapolis Police Department and the City of Minneapolis engaged in a pattern of practice of conduct that violates the 1st and 4th Amendments of the United States constitution. 
 
BROADDUS: Three years after Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police officer, the DOJ findings reveal multiple examples of racial discrimination, excessive and unlawful use of force, First Amendment violations and a lack of accountability for officers within the department. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, now pledging major improvements
 
BRIAN O'HARA (MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF): We will change the narrative around policing in this city.
 
BROADDUS: But, long time activists say the problems are deeply rooted and need more than transparency. 
 
NEKIMA LEVI STRONG: I'm unsure how far the DOJ will go in terms of pulling the curtain back on the horrific behaviors of Minneapolis police officers. As a matter of fact, the city has put out tens of millions of dollars in paying excessive force settlement agreements over the year, and this was before George Floyd was killed. 
 
BROADDUS: The findings based on hundreds of body cam videos and incident reports, as well as complaints, outlined the use of dangerous techniques and weapons from minor or even "no offenses" including unjustified deadly force, and the MPD used force to punish people who made officers angry or criticized the police. 
 
The mayor, admitting the DOJ report echoes complaints that the city has heard for years, and that there needs to be fundamental change.
 
JACOB FREY: Our success will be defined by the people of Minneapolis feeling safe. We are not going to stop. 
 
BROADDUS: The report said that Minneapolis police "patrolled neighborhoods differently based on their racial composition and discriminated based on race when searching, handcuffing, or using force against people during stops."
 
GARLAND: MPD stopped Black and Native American people nearly six times more often than White people. 
 
BROADDUS: Local activists are cautiously optimistic the report will not just inspire, but require police to do better. UNKNOWN: Minneapolis is only a microscope of a huger issue.
 
BROADDUS: And, progress will take time. What's next? A consent decree. That's a federal court order and we're told before it is fully implemented and rolled out, it could take months or even up to one year. Adrienne Broaddus, CNN, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
