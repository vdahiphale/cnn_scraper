KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: This morning, a prominent Muslim leader is in stable condition and recovering after being stabbed yesterday during an early morning prayer service at a mosque in Paterson, New Jersey. Authorities say this man, 32-year-old Serif Zorba, they say he allegedly stabbed the imam multiple times while more than 200 congregates were kneeling for the five a.m. prayers. Officials say Zorba then attempted to flee but several people - you can even see it on video -- they were able to restrain him, stop him, and hold him until police arrived. 
 
CNN's Omar Jimenez has the very latest for us. 
 
Omar, what are officials saying this morning? 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, at this point they're trying to investigate a whole bunch of things, including any potential motive. I mean this was something that happened during the first prayer service on Sunday at the Omar Mosque in Paterson, New Jersey. And we are in the holy month of Ramadan. You can see on your screen there, this is a man in a white hoodie in the third row of congregants. When they go down, he goes forward and does this act. Tries to then run away as congregants are all grabbing onto him trying to slow him down. They eventually do subdue him until police arrive. And that suspect was eventually arrested. That suspect is 32-year-old, as you mentioned, Serif Zorba, according to the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office. And so we're -- he has a court appearance expected later today. 
 
But as for the imam, he was taken to the hospital and is expected to be OK. 
 
But as I mentioned, this is in the holy month of Ramadan. Take a listen to how the mosque is now responding. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDUL HAMDAN, OMAR MOSQUE SPOKESPERSON: This is a holy time for Muslims. And actually, you know, other religions as well. We're celebrating Easter. We're celebrating Passover. But for Ramadan, it is the holiest month of the year. And typically there are more congregants than other times. It's a spiritual time for us and naturally something like this, you know, is bothersome and we naturally don't expect it to happen. It has not happened at our congregation before. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIMENEZ: Now, as for the suspect, prosecutors say he's facing charges of attempted murder and unlawful possession of a weapon. He's expected to appear in court later today. It's unclear if he has an attorney. 
 
But the mayor of Patterson says they do expect to increase security at not only this mosque but others especially through the remainder of Ramadan. 
 
BOLDUAN: And that's understandable. 
 
Omar, thank you.
 
John. 
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, this morning, Texas Governor Greg Abbott is promising to pardon a man who was convicted of murder just three days ago. Army Sergeant and rideshare driver Daniel Perry was convicted of killing Garrett Foster at a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020. 
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera joins us now from Dallas. 
 
You know, Ed, why is Governor Abbott moving to pardon this guy?
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is a stunning announcement that the governor is making, but in a statement that he released over the weekend, the governor says that he believes, you know, Texas has some of the strongest standard ground laws in the country, and that that cannot be notified by a jury or a, quote, progressive Democrat district attorney there in Austin, Texas.
 
But, what is also happening in this case is that the case of Daniel Perry has become a celebrity case in the right wing media. And there has been a great deal of pressure from the likes of Fox News host Tucker Carlson, putting pressure on the governor to pardon Daniel Perry. In fact, Tucker Carlson talked about this case Friday night during his show, and it was the next day, on Saturday, that the Texas governor made this vow, saying that he is, quote, working as swiftly as Texas law will allow to ensure the pardon of Daniel Perry. He also -- this -- you know, the process here in Texas is rather complicated, though, John. This case has to go before the board of pardons and paroles. They have to issue a recommendation before a Texas governor can issue a pardon. So, it has to still go through all of that. 
 
And what is really striking in this case, John, is that this case technically is not fully over. In fact, the punishment phase hasn't even started. Sentencing testimony is scheduled to begin Tuesday in Austin. So, this case isn't even over. And the district attorney in Austin says that it is, quote, deeply troubling that the governor of Texas is intervening in this case at this stage. BERMAN: Ed Lavandera, it truly is remarkable to see the speed with
 
 which Governor Abbott is moving here. Thank you so much. 
 
Sara.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Now a look at the legalities involved in this case. I'm joined by criminal defense attorney and CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. 
 
I'm not sure, as you just heard John mention there, I've ever seen something happen this quickly. The day after a conviction. We haven't gotten to the sentencing. And yet the governor is saying, hey, I am going to move to pardon this guy. How unusual is this? 
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes, Sara, it's very unusual. Good morning to you. 
 
The reality is, is that if the system is going to work, there has to be a process which everyone could respect, by into, and that works. 
 <br>[09:35:02]
 
And part of that process is allowing a jury to make a determination allowing that process to play out with respect to a conviction or acquittal, here a conviction, and then at least a sentencing. And then, of course, as a defense attorney, I'll tell you, there are a variety of options, right? One option, obviously, is the appeal to determine whether there were any legal or factual - any errors that were made which would warrant a determination. Was the evidence factually sufficient, legally sufficient? It goes through that process. And, you know, then what may be may be, right? We have these different layers.
 
But for a governor to intervene, and that's predicated upon right wing or left wing media, it's just ridiculous and it really -- it just throws a lot of things at a system which people have a distrust for already. You add this to the equation, it becomes highly problematic and highly troubling. 
 
SIDNER: So further breaking down sort of the judicial system and people's belief in it. 
 
I do want to talk about -- a little bit about the details of this case. The defense has said that their client acted in self-defense and that he claimed the man he killed pointed his gun at him. He was holding a gun with his -- within his right in Texas. 
 
JACKSON: Yes.
 
SIDNER: But the jury didn't buy it. And according to "The Austin Statesman's" newspaper, at the trial, the prosecutor brought up several social media post by the defendant, one of which was pretty stunning. It is before the shooting happened. And he posted, kill a few people -- that he might kill a few people on his way to work because they were, quote, rioting outside his apartment complex. In the end, eight days of trial, two days of deliberations. What does this tell you with this potential pardon? What kind of an impact might this pardon -- it send?
 
JACKSON: Yes, I think, Sara, the impact is huge. And here's why. At every trial there are issues in dispute. And certainly his defense lawyers try to argue the issue of stand your ground. We know Texas has stand your ground. It has since 2007. It followed Florida, which was in 2005. And in that stand your ground, you have no duty to retreat. 
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
JACKSON: You are justified in killing someone in the event you were in imminent fear for your life, your reaction was proportionate to the threat posed, you can't shoot someone for punching you, and you acted reasonably. Those are all issues in dispute. 
 
But to your point there was an eight day trial. There was two days of deliberation based upon those issues in dispute and a jury, unanimous I may conclude, right, made the decision that we're rejecting that. And so, how do we have a process where you pick the jurors as a prosecutor and a defendant, both by into picking a jury.
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
JACKSON: You get a system. You make your opening statement. You elicit testimony from the witnesses. You cross-examine them. And then a governor says, nothing to see here. I wasn't at the trial, but I do listen to, you know, either right wing or left wing, doesn't matter. It shouldn't be predicated upon the news and the news you listen to. It shouldn't be predicated upon politics. It needs to be predicated upon what happened in that courtroom and what did not happen. This jury's conclusion for it to be overturned, you know, or potentially, as the governor is saying, it just really -- it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of everyone, not only practitioners, who really look at the process to evaluate and determine what's right and what's wrong. 
 
SIDNER: Yes, the prosecutor is saying, very disappointed. There is a victim in this case who is dead, a family who is mourning, who are going to be frustrated about this. 
 
It won't happen right away, but the governor was very quick to make this announcement and did mention some political stuff when it comes to the DA. But this was a jury's decision. So, we will have to see what happens with the -- with the board. 
 
JACKSON: Absolutely.
 
SIDNER: Appreciate it, Joey Jackson. 
 
JACKSON: Always. Thanks, Sara.
 
SIDNER: Always good to see you.
 
John. BERMAN: New escalation in the tensions between China and the United
 
 States. Beijing accuses the U.S. Navy of illegally intruding into the South China Sea. 
 
And the Dalai Lama issues a rare public apology today after a disturbing video of him with a young boy triggered a backlash. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:43:23]
 
SIDNER: This is just in to CNN. Police say there are multiple casualties in Louisville, Kentucky, and they are responding to, quote, an active aggressor. You are looking at live pictures there. Officials, including the LMPD and ATF are telling everyone to stay away from the area of 300 block of East Main Street. Mayor Craig Greenberg also is urging the public to stay away from the area around Slugger Field. 
 
We will update you on that breaking news. You are looking at the scene now. Lots of police cars there. They're telling the public to keep away from that area in downtown Louisville. 
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: There's a really big police presence there. We're going to continue to update you on that.
 
Also watching this right now, China just wrapped its third day of military drills near Taiwan. For the first time, the Chinese navy appears to have simulated strikes by aircraft carrier based warplanes on Taiwan. The response from Taiwan? The government is strongly condemning the drills and demanding that China, quote, exercise reason and self-restraint. 
 
For its part, China is criticizing the United States after it sent a Navy destroyer through waters claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea. 
 
CNN's Selina Wang is live in Beijing with much more on this. 
 
First, Selina, walk us through what we saw with these military drills. 
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, Kate, China says these drills simulate precision attacks on key targets in Taiwan. And for the first time it appears China simulated strikes with war planes that took off from an aircraft carrier. 
 
Now, Beijing has not launched any missiles during these drills, but its military released this animation and it shows missiles fired from land, sea and air into Taiwan. 
 <br>[09:45:01]
 
And you can see from the video that two of them explode into flames. And Taiwan's ocean affairs council also released a video showing Taiwan's coast guard confronting a Chinese ship. Take a listen here to what the Taiwanese sailor says to the Chinese ship. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): You're now seriously damaging regional peace, stability and safety. Please turn around immediately and leave. If you keep proceeding forward, I will take eviction measures. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WANG: And, Kate, that video really highlights the very real risk of any accident or mistake around Taiwan. Beijing sees the democratically ruled island as part of its territory and claims that these drills are a warning to Taiwan separatist forces and is necessary to defend its national sovereignty. 
 
COLLINS: Selina, this is the first of this type of military drill, as you lay out very perfectly, but also not the first time we've seen China respond when -- regarding Taiwan. How does this compare to the drills that we saw when -- after Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan? 
 
WANG: Yes, so experts say that the military response this time has not quite reached the scale of last summer's reaction to Pelosi's visit. Back then, China had launched these massive military drills that surrounded the island and, for the first time back then, even fired missiles over Taiwan. 
 
So, part of the reason why we're seeing relatively more restraint is because the meeting between Tsai and McCarthy was held on American soil. That was done on purpose to avoid overly provoking Beijing. And experts also say that Beijing has been normalizing military activity around Taiwan. It already sends military jets and ships around Taiwan every day. The key context here is that the U.S. does not officially recognize Taiwan as a country, but unofficial ties have been growing and that infuriates Beijing. So this kind of military intimidation is likely here to stay.
 
Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Selina, thank you so much for the update.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: So, this morning, the Dalai Lama has apologized after a disturbing video surfaced of the 87-year-old spiritual leader kissing a young boy on the lips and then asking him to, quote, suck my tongue. The incident happened back in February during an event in northern India, but the video only recently went viral on social media. 
 
CNN's Vedika Sud is in New Delhi with the details here. 
 
What do we know about this video and what the Dalai Lama is now saying? 
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: Well, we do know there's outrage, immense outrage. There's anger. People across social media are absolutely shocked and disturbed at that video. 
 
Very quickly, John, that boy, that young boy, who was at a public event in February this year, all he asked for was a hug from the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual guru. And that's when the Dalai Lama called him on stage and not only asked him for a hug but a kiss on the cheek as well, and the boy obliged. 
 
Moments later, you have the Dalai Lama then ask him to give the Dalai Lama a kiss on the mouth. He drew the boy in, pulled in his chin and kissed him on his mouth. And then, seconds later, he went on to say, suck my tongue. 
 
Now, this is extremely disturbing. It's unsettling for even parents who watched this video across social media. And, moments later, we had - or rather hours later we had the Dalai Lama's office come out and issue a statement where they said that the Dalai Lama regretted the incident. 
 
Just an extract from that press release, and I'm going to read it out here, his holiness wishes to apologize to the boy and the family, as well as his many friends across the world for the hurt his words may have caused. Interesting the use of the word "hurt" and the use of the word "word." They're not talking about the actions of the Dalai Lama that may have hurt the people, hurt the boy, hurt the family, but the words used by the Dalai Lama.
 
Now, like I said, there's been extreme anger and outrage over this video. You've had the Dalai Lama come out and apologize. But like I said, for his words, and not for his actions, which have been questioned by activists as well across India, where they've questioned the Dalai Lama, who holds such a high post. A spiritual leader, religious leader, who's acknowledged across the world, and his actions, completely, completely disappointing is what many have to say.
 
John. 
 
BERMAN: All right, we many not have heard the last of this.
 
Vedika Sud, thank you so much for helping explain what was going on here.
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: After two days of miserable weather at Augusta National, the Masters has crowned a new winner. The details on that ahead.
 
Plus, next hour, the White House is set to unveil its new easter bunny mascot at its annual Easter Egg Roll. We're live on the South Lawn.

 <br>[09:53:36]
 
BERMAN: Spain's Jon Rahm is the winner of the 87th Masters, clinching his first green jacket and his second career major with his win at Augusta National.
 
CNN's Don Riddell is live there for us. 
 
Some wonderful golf yesterday afternoon, but also, because it's Augusta, some great collapses as well. 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, "WORLD SPORT": Yes, I mean, golf wouldn't be the same without all of the above, right? 
 
Yes, I mean, John Rahm was absolutely amazing. So calm. So composed. The second nine at Augusta is when everything is happening all around you, and he just breeze through it. And he looked as though a man that was destined to win the green jacket. He did it on Seve Ballesteros' birthday. Seve, one of the great Spanish golfers that inspired John Rahm to play. And he said it's something he's been dreaming about for as long as he can remember. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JON RAHM, 2023 MASTERS WINNER: I've wanted to win it ever since I thought about -- about golf and what being a champion would be. 
 
Just a wave of emotion of so many things has overtook me. I never thought I was going to cry by winning a golf tournament, but I got very close on that 18th hole. And a lot of it because of what he means to me and to Spanish golf. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: Yes, I think Brooks Koepka might have felt like crying after his round. He really did collapse, going three over on Sunday. 
 <br>[09:55:04]
 
It was good to see Brooks Koepka back, though. He's a four-time major champion. He's kind of been in the wilderness. He went off to the Liv Tour. But certainly for three rounds here, he showed that he can still play.
 
Another huge story from another Liv golfer, Phil Mickelson, three time Masters champion, seemingly shooting at a 65 out of absolutely nowhere. That's the lowest round ever scored here at the Masters by a golfer in his 50s. 
 
And the other major headline over the weekend, the five-time champion, Tiger Woods, playing in his 25th Masters tournament, forced to withdraw after a miserable round in tempestuous conditions on Saturday. Unfortunately, John, this has just got more people talking about how close Tiger Woods is to the end of his career. He says he wants to play if he's competitive. He hasn't been competitive now for some time. 
 
BERMAN: All right, Don Riddell, at Augusta, thank you so much for being with us. What a tournament it was.
 
And, Kate, I think Ted Lasso should meet the golf tour. I think it's OK to cry, whether you win or lose there. I don't see any problem with that.
 
BOLDUAN: I was not thinking you were going to go there. I was going to comment on how much pain Tiger Woods was clearly in.
 
BERMAN: He can cry too.
 
BOLDUAN: But I am here for any Ted Lasso reference. 
 
So, thank you, John Berman. 
 
All right, coming up for us, the Biden administration says everything is on the table to protect access to abortion pills after two federal judges issue contradicting rulings. How soon this could all end up before the Supreme Court. That is coming up. 
 
Plus, the U.S. is scrambling right now to do damage control after highly classified documents were leaked online. What they reveal about U.S. intelligence operations over forward -- going forward. That's next.
