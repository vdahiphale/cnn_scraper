THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[10:00:00]
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR:  And we'll be live in Tel Aviv and Tehran for you this hour.
 
First up though, emergency officials in Florida are assessing the damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. And what we are seeing now in the 
 
 daylight hours is major impacts from flooding. These are scenes of water rescues in Clearwater in Central Florida. They've been going on all morning 
 
 since before the break of day.
 
The overnight rain dumped more than 18 inches or 45 centimeters in the St. Petersburg area, and that is considered a one in 1000-year event.
 
Fierce winds ripped the top off this, the Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, home of baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, which was supposed to house 
 
 first responders.
 
A bit earlier, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis talked about what is facing those first responders as this day continues.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL):  We will better understand the extent of the damage as the day progresses. And you have people that are out there 
 
 assessing damage right now. First responders have been working all through the night to help people who were in distress. And what we can say is the 
 
 storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario. The storm did weaken before landfall and the storm surge, as initially 
 
 reported, has not been as significant overall as what was observed for Hurricane Helene.
 
Right now, it looks like Sarasota County had the most significant storm surge, likely somewhere between eight to 10 feet. And remember with Helene, 
 
 we had 15 to 20 feet up in Taylor County.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, tornadoes also have been a real problem for people. A deadly problem. Let's stay on this with CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. 
 
 And as I understand it, this is the most tornado warnings in a single day, just get his bang up to date on what we understand to have happened and 
 
 where this storm is now.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Becky, in the United States, we have individual National Weather Service offices placed around the country. 
 
 We've got Miami, we've got Tampa Bay. These areas in combined issued 126 tornado warnings throughout the course of the day yesterday when just in 
 
 advance of Milton making landfall.
 
Here is one such tornado. That record number of tornado warned storms is incredible. From a meteorologist perspective to spin up that many tornadoes 
 
 is really saying something about how powerful the interactions in the environment actually were. But another thing that's profound to me, at 
 
 least, as I analyze this data, is that usually these air weaker tornadoes that form in the rain bands that lead to the advance of incoming hurricane.
 
This is not a weak tornado. This is a tornado that caused damage, and it is far away from the center of the storm, which makes it more complicating for 
 
 people to decide whether or not they should have evacuated. If this is on the East Coast of Florida, think about all the attention and the focus on 
 
 the West Coast where the hurricane actually make landfall.
 
So, the most number of tornado warns -- warnings issued yesterday, and then you go back in time for the previous numbers, you can see that eclipsing 
 
 previous years, but these are all directly associated with other hurricanes that made landfall in the State of Florida as well. 2017, Hurricane Irma. I 
 
 was there. 2024, Hurricane Helene. That's 22 weeks ago. I was there. September 27, 2022 Hurricane Ian. I was there as well.
 
Tornadoes, storm surge, flooding threat, it is a multitude of threats that come from land fallen hurricanes. And of course, with the tornadoes, with 
 
 the wind, we knock out power because the trees that line central portions of the state are easily toppled. And of course, that causes the power 
 
 outages for so many customers.
 
Look at this. We're still experiencing, just in the past hour or so, tropical storm force winds, even though the center of Hurricane Milton 
 
 continues to move offshore. This is the Space Coast, that's Cape Canaveral, and that is where it's exited. But in its wake, it's left a significant 
 
 amount of rain, a deluge of rain. Anywhere you see that shading of pink, that kind of a slice right through the central interior of Florida, that is 
 
 basically the northern track of where the hurricane made landfall.
 
And St. Petersburg, just in a three-hour time frame, had three times their amount of monthly average rainfall during the month of October. And we 
 
 talked about how this was going to be a game of miles, right? And it's so important because the storm actually made landfall in Siesta Key, that is 
 
 south of Tampa Bay. That means that Tampa Bay was on the northern side of the storm. So, we got this what is called reverse storm surge. So, pushing 
 
 water out of Tampa Bay.
 
Remember, we had feared the worst-case scenario for Tampa Bay. If we were another 10, 12 miles to the north, we would have had a different wind surge 
 
 or wind event, and that would have pushed a surge into Tampa Bay. And that could have been a worst-case scenario. Of course, the storm did weaken 
 
 somewhat as well, but there were still significant storm surge values that were reported south of the eye wall.
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
Now, there are still storm surge concerns on the East Coast because remember, the hurricane made landfall here in the Gulf of Mexico, traverse 
 
 the state, and then exited across the Atlantic. So, still pushing water on the back side of the storm, for now, the other side of the states. We're 
 
 going to track this storm as it -- we say goodbye and good riddance to it, Becky. But wow, what a powerful storm as it now exits the State of Florida. 
 
 It is going to be days if not weeks before the damage can be cleared up.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, absolutely. And we're going to stick with this. Derek, thank you. Derek talking about Port St. Lucie there. We have learned at 
 
 least four deaths reported in that county from tornadoes. We want to bring in Shannon Martin, the mayor of Port St. Lucie. It's good to have you. And 
 
 I'm glad that you are safe. I hope your family is too.
 
You are south of Cape Canaveral. Many of our viewers will know where that is. Tell us about conditions there right now.
 
SHANNON MARTIN, PORT ST. LUCIE, FLORIDA MAYOR:  Good morning and thank you. Yes, my family is safe. This morning, conditions here, we have wind gusts 
 
 still happening, winds around 25 miles an hour. So, it's not so bad, unfortunately, outside of our city boundary in our county, there is a 
 
 mobile home park for seniors that experienced a lot of tragedy, a lot of destruction and four confirmed deaths.
 
Here in our city, we did have a lot of tornadic activity with at least, I believe, three tornadoes that came through the city and did cause 
 
 destruction to homes, roofs, cars. We've had -- we have had power lines down. We have some flooding in the west side of the city, and we are 
 
 working with our county partners to help them as much as we possibly can with everything that's going on there.
 
ANDERSON:  Shannon, just how exceptional has this been? And how do residents prepare for something like tornadoes? The warnings were there, of 
 
 course, but what's done in preparation?
 
MARTIN:  So, it's really difficult. We tell -- we always prepare for hurricane. We engage and communicate with our citizens very heavily about 
 
 sheltering in place, making sure that you have kits, emergency kits, making sure you have supplies, making sure you have enough water for your 
 
 families.
 
The tornadic activity that we have seen here, not only in our county, but across the region, even down into the Palm Beach County up to Indian River 
 
 County has been truly unprecedented. The governor has stated that there's been about 19 confirmed tornadoes, and those all happened within a very 
 
 short window of time. So, again it's very difficult because we don't -- it's not something we expect on a regular basis like you have out in 
 
 Oklahoma or the Texas area.
 
So, again, really unprecedented and we're going to be working with our county partners, working with our residents. doing damage assessments to 
 
 see what we need to do going forward.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes. Look, this is a state which expects storms at this time of the year, but two almost back-to-back enormous storms like Helene and 
 
 Milton. Have you ever experienced anything like this before? And what's been learned by authorities?
 
MARTIN:  So, we've never experienced -- in the recent years, where we did have two hurricanes back-to-back, Francis and Gene, back in 2004, but 
 
 nothing like this in recent times. What we've learned is we have to continue working together. We do partner extremely well with our county at 
 
 the Emergency Operations Center and our Emergency Operations Center here in Port St. Lucie. We are in lockstep with them at all times. We do briefings 
 
 together. All of us reporting on what's going on and how we need to keep our residents safe. Even our newscasters, local newscasters were shocked at 
 
 the amount of tornadic activity that we've seen in this region.
 
And so, going forward, we're just going to know and discuss going forward how to better prepare for it and what we can do to prepare for this type of 
 
 tornadic activity if we experience this in the future.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, the loss of life is so saddening. I know that you have very likely had very little sleep, if any, over the last 24, 36 hours. So, we 
 
 will let you go. Thank you very much indeed for joining us. Quite extraordinary times there on the East Coast of Florida. Thank you.
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
Well, a few minutes ago you saw some pictures of the Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. Here's another look. The roof of that stadium, which is of 
 
 course home to baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, ripped into shreds. That gives you just some idea of the ferocity of this storm when it first made 
 
 landfall.
 
CNN's Boris Sanchez has been reporting from outside of Tropicana Field. Last hour, he talked to me about the impact being felt in and around that 
 
 area.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Tropicana Field, the home of the Tampa Bay Rays. And as you can see, the roof was just shorn by the powerful winds 
 
 of Hurricane Milton. That's significant in part because of what this field represents. It was one of the bases of emergency operations in response to 
 
 the hurricane. So, you had emergency personnel stationed inside. You had them sheltering there. You also had significant resources allocated to the 
 
 area. Right now, those resources are being dispersed to the community.
 
Fortunately, I can report that in the immediate vicinity of the baseball stadium, there does not appear to be a significant amount of damage. 
 
 There's no flooding here. There's minimal tree limbs that are down. But that doesn't represent the whole picture for Pinellas County and 
 
 neighboring Hillsborough County and areas further south where this storm made landfall.
 
Here in Pinellas County, there are a number of areas that are -- at this point, are inaccessible. We try to make our way to one, but sheriff's 
 
 deputies were blocking off a bridge, saying that in part it was because of downed power lines. There is still standing water in some parts, and that 
 
 combination of power lines and water, never a good one.
 
We heard Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, talking about this, the fact that almost after every hurricane, major hurricane that Florida has faced, 
 
 there are always fatalities after the storm because folks go outside their homes, they start wandering around. They see that the storm has passed, 
 
 that the wind and the rain has passed, and they see sunshine, and they think they're safe, but there's a lot of danger lurking, not only with 
 
 downed power lines, but also teetering debris that could fall at any moment.
 
We've seen expansive flooding, expansive property damage as well. We know that in neighboring Hillsborough County, there are water rescues that are 
 
 underway right now. There was an assisted living facility there. This is a more sort of rural agricultural area. They were being evacuated, the senior 
 
 citizens there in two to three feet of standing water. So, obviously it's a delicate process to get folks out to safety and officials don't want that 
 
 complicated by folks coming out and trying to survey damage and getting themselves into danger. Becky.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  Boris Sanchez there reporting for you. Well, you're watching Connect the World. I'm Becky Anderson. Still ahead tonight, the Middle East 
 
 even further on edge, I'm afraid, as Israel could soon decide how to respond to what was this missile barrage from Iran last week. We are live 
 
 in Tel Aviv and in Tehran for you just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
ANDERSON:  The United Nations says that Israel fired at its peacekeepers in Lebanon. It says an Israeli tank opened fire at the headquarters of its 
 
 peacekeeping force in the southern city of Naquora. It had an observation deck resulting in injuries to two U.N. personnel who were hospitalized. And 
 
 it says Israel also fired at two other U.N. positions, including a bunker used by peacekeepers. About 10,000 peacekeepers are stationed in South 
 
 Lebanon.
 
Well, Israel could decide today how it will respond to last week's missile attack by Iran. The Israeli security cabinet meets just over two hours from 
 
 now. That attack was discussed in a half hour phone call yesterday between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the U.S. President Joe Biden. It was 
 
 the first time that they had spoken since August.
 
Now, the White House isn't giving any details out on that conversation, but says it was direct and, quote, "very productive." Well, the administration 
 
 has been hoping to limit Israel's response to Iran's attack amid fears of a wider regional war.
 
Well, CNN's Nic Robertson is in Israel for us, and Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran. And at this stage do we have any indication how the Israelis might 
 
 respond to Iran? Any indication of what will be discussed as in terms of options at this security meeting?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  It's not quite clear about that at all, Becky. We didn't get a sense from the White House from 
 
 their readout of the conversation with President Biden yesterday that Benjamin Netanyahu, who'd ruled off limits, any of the things that 
 
 President Biden doesn't want struck. President Biden doesn't want the nuclear facilities struck. He doesn't want any of the oil facilities in 
 
 Iran struck.
 
I think the United States would be far more happier, if you could put it that way, if the response was proportional to Iran. Iran targeted 
 
 intelligence headquarters and military sites, military airbases. I think the United States would see that as proportional if Israel struck back at 
 
 those targets. But of course, Israel wants deterrence. Feels that Iran's main proxy in the region, Hezbollah, is weakened, and that this is the 
 
 opportunity that it has to really strike the targets that it's long wanted to do. And one of those is the nuclear facilities.
 
How to do it? Because they would have to overfly or potentially have to overfly countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia, who are validly want to 
 
 stay out of this fight and don't want aircraft of any description, even though they had Iranian missiles flying over their territory just a week or 
 
 so ago, they don't want a -- they don't want that to be replicated by Iranian aircraft flying over.
 
I think we can take the fact that there's been a number of strikes around Syrian air bases recently as an indication that potentially Syrian air 
 
 defenses, if you will, monitoring has been degraded, and that would give potentially Israeli aircraft the opportunity to fly more safely through 
 
 Syrian airspace, that's a possibility here.
 
But, you know, what we've heard from the defense minister saying that these strikes would be not only a surprise but they would be precise. He said, 
 
 the Iranian wouldn't know or they wouldn't understand what had happened or how it had happened when these strikes come.
 
The vote today in the cabinet will be to authorize the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to make the final 
 
 decision about when to strike. And of course, that does fall into the political military domain. So, we can understand after that decision is 
 
 made this evening, in a few hours, then the strike could come at any moment. Again, we just don't have a sense of the targets, Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes. And we don't have a sense whether the U.S. has been successful in limiting the scope of any response, of course, to Iran. We 
 
 know what they have hoped to avoid, or they say that they have hoped to avoid. But at this stage, we have no detail.
 
Fred to you. We do know that the Iranian foreign minister is on a regional tour. I'm in the UAE. Has been doing a tour of this region, not least Saudi 
 
 Arabia and Doha. There have been reports that he is warning countries in this region not to get involved in any Israel/U.S. response to these Iran 
 
 ballistic missiles.
 
We also know that there have been reported threats that oil installations, again, this region are at threat should it be oil installations that the 
 
 Israelis go after. What's being said where you are?
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think there's really two tracks, Becky, that the Iranians are going down. Now, on 
 
 the one hand, it is that diplomacy that you're speaking about. And, of course, we have the Iranian president, who's on the verge of traveling to 
 
 Turkmenistan, where tomorrow he's going to meet with Vladimir Putin, among others.
 
But then, also, you do have Abbas Araghchi, the foreign minister of Iran, as you rightly stated, meeting with Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and 
 
 really trying to drum up support for Iran and against Israel. Those threats are things that certainly have been reported. The Iranians certainly don't 
 
 want any nations in the region to allow Israel to overfly their territory or allowed to fire missiles over their territory.
 
But at the same time, the Iranians right now are speaking a lot about regional cooperation in order to try and defuse this very difficult 
 
 situation in the Middle East. At the same time, of course, senior Iranian officials have said that if the Israelis target Iran's energy 
 
 infrastructure, and that of course includes the oil and gas installations, that Iran could respond in kind and target Israel's energy infrastructure.
 
So, right now, definitely very difficult situation here in this region, with the Iranians also issuing some serious threats. Here's what we're 
 
 learning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  After Iran's massive missile strike targeting military installations inside Israel's territory, Iran is now bracing for 
 
 what the Israelis say will be a strong response.
 
On Tehran's streets, some concern and a lot of defiance.
 
Everyone's mind is busy thinking of what might happen, this man says, and if Israel makes a move, we will certainly respond to it.
 
And this woman says, I am not concerned about war because I believe in my country and our leadership. I know if anything happens, nothing will 
 
 threaten the Iranian nation.
 
If there is a need to protect our soil and our land, like our fathers and brothers who participated in the eight-year war, we will go to war as well, 
 
 this man says. And you will see the result of the jihad that has been ordered.
 
If you want war, we are the masters of war, this poster in Revolution Square reads, both in Farsi and in Hebrew.
 
Iran's capital is also plastered with billboards pledging to stand by Hezbollah after the killing of the group's longtime leader, Hassan 
 
 Nasrallah.
 
PLEITGEN:  The Islamic Republic of Iran and its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are making very clear that despite the current struggles of the 
 
 Hezbollah organization they will continue to support Hezbollah against Israel.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Israel's government has vowed to hit Iran hard after last week's missile attack when the Revolutionary Guard used around 
 
 200 ballistic missiles, some hitting Tel Aviv and an air base inside the country, sparking fears of a wider conflict, possibly pitting the U.S. and 
 
 Iran directly against one another.
 
An Iranian member of parliament sending a warning to the U.S. The U.S. is aware of everything the Zionist regime does, he says. We would suggest 
 
 that, firstly, the U.S. stop the military help, stop the arms and the backing of the Zionist regime, and then, secondly, for the U.S. to force 
 
 Israel into a ceasefire.
 
But so far, the risk of escalation continues in a region already on edge.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
PLEITGEN (on camera):  Certainly, very much a region on edge here right now. And really, we were out and about in the streets here of Tehran once 
 
 again today, Becky, and we did hear a lot of people who said they're not necessarily as concerned about that possible Israeli strike, but really 
 
 about the whole situation escalating and, in the end, possibly pitting Iran and the U.S. directly against one another, Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, and it's been interesting, hasn't it? Because from the perspective where I am here in the Gulf, for years, Iran has posed a 
 
 significant threat when you talk to sources and leadership around this region, but for the past couple of years, there has been a rapprochement, 
 
 very specifically from Saudi Arabia mediated, of course, by the Chinese and, you know, better -- I won't say good, but better relations between, 
 
 for example, the UAE and Iran.
 
The calculus now, of course, as we see these very visible images of the Iranian foreign minister in Riyadh, for example, and then in Doha, the 
 
 calculus here is, you know, what does this part of the world do with regard to Tehran? Do you keep it closer in order to protect yourselves or will we 
 
 see a further distancing again?
 
And I think, certainly, from the perspective where we are here, you are seeing this region stay close to ensure that they don't -- you know, that 
 
 there are no missteps. What's the sense where you are?
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
PLEITGEN:  Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right about the fact that there has been a rapprochement over the past couple of years, and 
 
 I think that that is really something that's set in after the Trump administration left office. Because of course, the Trump administration had 
 
 very close relations with Saudi Arabia at that time.
 
You'll recall, there were also really big tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar as well with the Iranians siding with Qatar, and really, the Saudis 
 
 there, with the United States, really pushing for a more dominant role in the Middle East. And certainly, we have seen, in the past couple of years, 
 
 a big rapprochement between Saudi Arabia, especially and Iran sort of starting to set -- or to take place.
 
One of the things that really set that in motion was the administration of Ebrahim Raisi, less so Raisi himself, but more so his foreign minister, 
 
 Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who really started those talks with the Saudis and tried to get that relation jump started. A little bit also with the UAE 
 
 as well, really trying to drum up support for Iran and for better relations between Iran and some of its neighbors in the greater Middle Eastern 
 
 region.
 
I think right now, you're absolutely right, it is a pretty difficult situation for a lot of these countries. They have very good relations with 
 
 the United States. And if you look at the Gulf countries, of course, a lot of them are now in the Abraham Accords with Israel as well. And they 
 
 certainly don't appear to want to jeopardize that either.
 
At the same time, the Iranians right now, of course, in that really difficult standoff situation with the Israelis, with the United States, at 
 
 the same time, trying to drum up that support as well. I think for a lot of these Gulf nations, for a lot of the nations in the region who are really 
 
 essentially trying to stay out of getting involved in that conflict, it's very difficult for them. But it does appear as though, right now, at least 
 
 between Saudi and the Iranians, there is at least a little bit of daylight and some better relations on the horizon. Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, these are national security issues for these independent countries. They are sovereign states and they make their decisions 
 
 accordingly. But, you know, from the perspective of Riyadh, the perspective of Abu Dhabi, where we are here, you know, this sort of new architecture of 
 
 a new look forward looking Middle East should cascade through the region if they get it right, this economic integration, this de-escalation, but this 
 
 is a really, really tense time. It has to be said. It's good to have you there in Tehran.
 
We've seen the region is very much on edge as it waits for Israel's next move. And that our next guest says is part of its strategy. Kirsten 
 
 Fontenrose, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council and writes quote, "Israel's response to the missile barrage, that it will respond at a time 
 
 and place of its choosing, forces Iran to expend the manpower and resources to sustain a heightened defense posture, while Israel can continue its 
 
 campaigns against Hezbollah and Hamas."
 
It's an interesting perspective. Kirsten joins us now. It's good to have you. Really good to have you. Let's just talk about where we are with 
 
 regard Israel and Hezbollah as we wait to see what happens with regard Iran very specifically. What's your perspective at this point?
 
KIRSTEN FONTENROSE, PRESIDENT, RED SIX INTERNATIONAL AND SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL:  I do think I stand by what I wrote about Israel's 
 
 thinking, hey, if we can make Iran just sort of keep this defensive posture, we're in a good place, because they will focus on their defenses. 
 
 They'll focus on moving things underground. They'll focus on fortifying their radar systems. And we can focus on the fight with Hezbollah. We can 
 
 focus on targeting leadership. We can focus on pushing fighters back. We can focus what our next steps are on a single front without having to worry 
 
 about fighting on many fronts.
 
And they've taken a page out of Iran's own playbook by saying we'll respond at a time and place they're choosing. It's almost a word for word quote of 
 
 what Iran has said previously about responding to Israel. So, it lets them kind of be the master of the strategy here instead of, you know, being run 
 
 by the tyranny of the battlefield.
 
ANDERSON:  The Iranian foreign minister, meantime, making the rounds. We've been discussing that with our colleagues both in Tel Aviv and very 
 
 specifically in Tehran today. What do you make of the of the moves around the region by the Iranian foreign minister? They're very visible pictures 
 
 of him with, for example, the leader of Saudi Arabia. And what role these Gulf monarchies in this, today and going forward?
 
FONTENROSE:  The Iranian foreign minister has a funny way of playing diplomacy. It's kind of like a mafia don. He comes in with a handshake and 
 
 kind of a cheesy vest or the like. And he says to them, if you allow Israel to use your airspace for any sort of attack on Iran, we will retaliate by 
 
 attacking you. We will take it out on you.
 <br>[10:30:00]
 
He also threatened that if Iran's oil facilities are struck by Israel, and Iran is unable to export oil, remember that this exporting is sanctions 
 
 evasion, then Iran will make sure that Gulf nations are also unable to export oil. So, it's these veiled threats with a handshake and a smile that 
 
 are kind of Iran's way of doing foreign policy.
 
For Saudi Arabia, they are the front line. You're the UAE. You are the front line. You're any of the Gulf states. You are the easiest place for 
 
 Iran to land a missile, to land a drum quickly without the 13 hours of early warning that Israel gets when something is launched at them slow and 
 
 low.
 
So, the gulf has to be thinking about, all right, how do we play this? How do we make sure that this adversary is put in a box, which we would like to 
 
 see, but in a way that does not make us less safe? What do -- you think Iran has not considered is that by making this threat about strikes on 
 
 their oil facilities, they've actually increased the likelihood of an Israeli attack on their nuclear sites instead of their oil facilities.
 
So, I'm not sure if they really gamed that out, but they've certainly got the attention of the Gulf states who already think that the Houthi threats 
 
 to Red Sea shipping are enough of a problem for their oil exports. They don't need Iran lobbying more missiles at them like they did at Buqayq in 
 
 2019.
 
ANDERSON:  Are you surprised by the sort of openness and very visible sort of warm response to Iran's diplomatic moves around this region? I'm asking 
 
 you that almost as a sort of rhetorical question because, you know, I'm sitting here in region -- you and I have met here a number of times, I'm 
 
 sitting in region, I'm not surprised.
 
And I think it's important for our viewers around the world who may have expected, you know, despite a rapprochement between the Saudis and the 
 
 Iranians for things to be a lot less, sort of close looking. I'm just wondering what the calculus here is. I mean, Riyadh is a very strong ally 
 
 of the United States. What message is being sent sort of via Riyadh at this point?
 
FONTENROSE:  One message that is worrying if you're in Washington is simply that the Gulf states have watched Israel effectively brush off U.S. pleas 
 
 and policy ideas because we're in a lame duck presidency situation. This is not a flaw of a Biden administration or any administration, it's simply the 
 
 reality of the political environment in Washington right now, leading up to a U.S. election.
 
So, they're thinking, well, gosh, if Israel is blowing off the U.S. we can't count on the U.S. to perhaps contain what Israeli action might be. We 
 
 can't count on the U.S. taking action on our behalf because they're self- obsessed right now.
 
So, we've really got to worry about our own interests. And that means hedging. That means if you refuse to accept the foreign minister's visit, 
 
 you're sending a message, and that message looks aggressive, and that message looks one sided. So, of course, they're going to take this meeting.
 
We have really professional intelligence services in both the UAE and Saudi and other parts of the Gulf. So, you know, these visits are also a chance 
 
 for them to really get a sense of that person sitting in front of them. How serious are they? How significant are these threats? What do they really 
 
 mean? Who else is behind this policy that they're discussing? What are they really saying? So, it's a chance for them to also get a better picture of 
 
 what this adversary intends to do.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, fascinating to have you on. It's -- and it's always a pleasure discussing the region with you for the time being. Thank you very 
 
 much indeed for joining us.
 
Still to come you're watching Connect the World with me, Becky Anderson. Israel issues yet more evacuation orders in Northern Gaza. But some 
 
 civilians say they've been shot at even as they try to get away from the bombs and the bullets. We'll have the very latest as war in the enclave 
 
 rages on.

ANDERSON:  You're watching Connect the World with me, Becky Anderson. Well, a reminder of our top story this hour, Florida assessing the damage from 
 
 Hurricane Milton after it tore across the state before moving offshore.
 
It was the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year. The amount of rain that fell on the city of St. Petersburg, for example, more 
 
 than 18 inches, or 45 centimeters, considered a once in a millennium rainfall event.
 
Well, around 3 million Americans are without power. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency says, despite all of this, things could have 
 
 been a whole lot worse.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEANNE CRISWELL, FEMA ADMINISTRATOR:  I've had an opportunity, to talk with the governor today, as well as his team and then give the president an 
 
 update on what we're seeing. And I think what we know for sure is we avoided that worst-case scenario that we were planning for, but the fact 
 
 that they prepared for the worst really made sure that they were able to respond to the impacts that they have experienced. And the biggest ones 
 
 right now are the tornadoes that have been reported across the state. I think the last number I had was 38 confirmed tornadoes.
 
And the biggest storm surge, was certainly in the Sarasota area, but not as much as the catastrophic storm surge that they were predicting, but still a 
 
 significant amount. They're out right now doing assessments, the state is, and we've prepositioned resources to be able to come in and help the state 
 
 with whatever they need.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, Our Carlos Suarez is in Fort Myers for us now with more. And you and I have been speaking over the past, what, 48 hours or so. What 
 
 are the -- what's the latest that you are seeing and what are the challenges for residents there going forward?
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Becky. So, much of the damage that we have seen across parts of Fort Myers, Florida was really brought on by the 
 
 storm surge and these two tornadoes that we believe hit parts of Lee County. The folks out here -- the cleanup effort is well underway with 
 
 folks bringing out some, obviously, heavy equipment to start to try to remove some of this debris.
 
We're in a neighborhood about 50 minutes south of where we joined you yesterday, where we spent a good part of the storm. And I could tell you 
 
 that the damage here is some of the worst that we've seen. We're going to walk it real quick and I'll show you just one of the homes that was hit by 
 
 this tornado.
 
The owner of this place here is -- him and his family are in the process now of trying to remove all of -- portions of the back part of this house. 
 
 You can see the roof that was torn off at the entrance of the place here. These folks tell us that because of all of that plywood that you see there, 
 
 they really couldn't tell what was going on outside of their home, but they knew that something pretty powerful was taking place. And then at some 
 
 point it became quite clear to them that a tornado was hitting. And so, they sought shelter there. The good news is they are doing just fine.
 
Their neighbors on, just to the right here, are also dealing with their own damage. They're removing part of a white fence that was torn apart by this 
 
 tornado that we believe hit here yesterday afternoon. You can see they also had their plywood up. These folks here know exactly what could happen with 
 
 a very powerful storm.
 
And even though this hurricane hit to the north of us. Again, the big concern going into this was going to be the storm surge. And of course, 
 
 that materialized not to the extent of the forecast, because we were looking at anywhere between eight to 12 feet of flooding, but we ended up 
 
 seeing about three to four feet in Fort Myers.
 
I'll show you this one roof on this building right here. Well, you can see what I'm talking about here. These folks are already bringing out some of 
 
 this equipment out here to try to get some of this out of this neighborhood here. And then, the roof just on the other side of this apartment building, 
 
 you can see, was torn off.
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
Over on Fort Myers Beach, Becky, which was destroyed by Hurricane Ian two years ago, residents there are being allowed to return to their homes in 
 
 about an hour or so. And so, they're going to be able to take a look at the damage there, the storm surge, the flooding on that part of Lee County, was 
 
 about five feet. So, it was under that eight feet mark that we believe we were going to get. And then in Sanibel, which was also hit pretty hard by 
 
 Hurricane Ian and destroyed, really, they saw similar flooding. Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, you can never tell what is going to happen. Prepare for the worst. Thankfully, in a lot of places, it wasn't as bad as had been 
 
 expected. But still, people living through this is extremely frightening. Thank you.
 
Earlier in Clearwater, Florida, frantic calls to 911 from people trapped by chest high water are there, apartment complex. Dispatch crews used 
 
 motorized rafts to transport residents to dry land. Rescuers had to maneuver through waist deep water stemming from Hurricane Milton's storm 
 
 surge. Up to 18 people were reportedly trapped.
 
Well, do stay with CNN. More of the day's top stories after this short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON:  Desperate plea from the director of one of the last remaining hospitals in Northern Gaza, warning that a fresh Israeli order to evacuate 
 
 puts the lives of seriously injured children in danger. He says every patient in intensive care at the Kamal Adwan Hospital is in critical 
 
 condition and reliant on oxygen and that there is simply nowhere else in Gaza that could give them the treatment that is currently keeping them 
 
 alive. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more on the fallout from Israel's latest orders to evacuate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Civilians fleeing a war zone. Suddenly, sprayed with bullets. The Israeli military 
 
 ordered these people to leave Northern Gaza and move south, but the hail of bullets they faced now a testament to why so many are choosing not to 
 
 leave, or simply cannot.
 
Nine-year-old Dana is among those wounded in the attack. Her pink shirt smeared red with her own blood after she was shot in the neck. At the 
 
 hospital, her mother says an Israeli drone opened fire as they were fleeing south.
 
The quadcopter started shooting intensively, she says. Everyone was running. There were so many bullets. Even my children's backpacks were full 
 
 of bullets.
 
The Israeli military declined to comment. But the attack came as it ordered nearly all of Northern Gaza to evacuate, even as it says its renewed ground 
 
 offensive is focused on just one city, Jabalya.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
But many are trapped like 15-year-old Zamzam (ph). For anyone who hears my voice, help us, try to get us out, she pleads. She says her mother was 
 
 killed by Israeli forces. I watched her take her last breaths, and I couldn't do anything, she cries.
 
Calls for help are flooding into Gaza's ambulance service. But this medic explains his team will be shot at if he tries to mount a rescue. The tanks 
 
 are there. They will fire at the cars. Just get to the street and I will reach you quickly, he promises.
 
Inside Kamal Adwan Hospital, a dire situation risks getting worse. As 17 people wounded in an Israeli strike pour into the hospital's emergency 
 
 room, the hospital's director says he's been given 24 hours to empty the hospital.
 
The Israeli army is now demanding that we evacuate these patients and move them elsewhere. This will endanger their lives, and it is a catastrophe for 
 
 these children.
 
Human rights groups now warning that the military sweeping evacuation orders risk forcing more than 400,000 people out of Northern Gaza and into 
 
 a humanitarian zone that is already overcrowded and under resourced.
 
Where do we go, this woman asks. In Southern Gaza there are assassinations, and in Western Gaza they are firing shells at people. Where do we go?
 
Gaza City, others say they will not leave.
 
I will die and not go to the south. I have 20 family members. I have children. Where do they want me to go? He says he would rather die than be 
 
 displaced for a sixth time.
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, stay with CNN for more of the day's top stories. We are going to take a very short break. Back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON:  Right. So, we got about six or seven minutes left of this show, this hour, and I want to get you back to Florida. Earlier in Clearwater, 
 
 frantic calls to 911 from people trapped by chest high water at their apartment complex. Dispatched crews used motorized rafts to transport 
 
 residents to drier land. Rescuers had to maneuver through waist deep water stemming from Hurricane Milton's storm surge. Up to 18 people were 
 
 reportedly trapped.
 
I am going to get you, some further news after this short break.
 
OK. Let me get you to this instead. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is making a rapid tour of European capitals, appealing for more military 
 
 aid. In London earlier he met U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the new NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte. This hour he is in Paris meeting with 
 
 France's President Emmanuel Macron before heading for Rome later.
 
CNN Senior International Correspondent Melissa Bell following Mr. Zelenskyy for us. Joining us now. He -- it seems, certainly to many, that he is 
 
 constantly asking for more military support from his allies. What do his European stops suggest about what he wants next?
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this has been an ongoing battle, as you say, to keep the aid coming and to keep the 
 
 changes or in the help that's being provided by western allies, Becky, adapted to the threats that they're facing on the ground. The added 
 
 complication now for President Zelenskyy is, of course, the forthcoming American election, but also the recent announcement by Germany that it was 
 
 intending to half the military aid to Ukraine next year. Both of those questions put extra pressure, of course, on President Zelenskyy.
 
He was meant to be seeing President Biden, of course, on Saturday in Germany, as well as the German leaders there too, a meeting that was meant 
 
 to be held in Ramstein to speak specifically of Ukraine. The idea had been for him to present very detailed measures, he said, about how to bring the 
 
 war to an end. He believed much more about his victory plan that he's been presenting instead on this whistle stop tour through European capitals.
 
Essentially, Becky, asking, for more, weapons, faster deliveries, but also a greater ability to strike inside Russia against targets that might be 
 
 threatening Ukraine. That's what we'd heard from him before. The added pressure now is the threat that next year he simply won't be getting the 
 
 sort of levels of aid he got this year, Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Mr. Macron's position at this stage, is it clear going forward exactly where Macron stands when it comes to any sort of peace negotiation 
 
 here? I know that we're sort of beginning to hear reports that it's very unlikely that we'll get a peace summit. But given Macron's position in 
 
 leadership in Europe, does he represent, you know, any very specific position at the moment that we can sort see as a European stance when it 
 
 comes to these peace talks, when and if?
 
BELL:  Certainly. What we've been hearing from the Elysee these last few weeks, Becky, about the question of Ukraine and how they want to help 
 
 President Zelenskyy make progress towards this victory plan, the idea of forcing Russia to the negotiating table and coming up with some sort of 
 
 solution that would bring this war entering, of course, its third winter, to an end.
 
What the, Elysee sources tell us is that they've been looking to broaden the support that's been given to Ukraine, not just the usual allies, NATO 
 
 allies that have been so steadfast so far, in their support, but widening the circle of, friends of Kyiv and those willing to back Zelenskyy's 
 
 victory plan, to countries like India, that so far have been much more reluctant to forcefully back Ukraine in its position against Russia.
 
So, their aim is to enlarge, the position because they understand, of course, here as they do in other European capitals and in Washington, 
 
 Becky, that the peace plan that's being suggested, we don't have the full details of it, but the outlines of the peace plan, the victory plan being 
 
 suggested by Zelenskyy, will take a lot of movement on the part of a lot of European capitals to happen since what we understand is that it could 
 
 include the idea that part of Ukraine finds itself under the NATO umbrella, even as the war rages on elsewhere. Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, it's good to have you. Really good to get your perspective. Thank you very much indeed. Well, we've been toggling between stories these 
 
 past couple of hours. One of our top ones, of course, the aftermath of Hurricane Milton in Florida. I want to close it out this hour with just a 
 
 little more on that.
 
The Hillsborough County Sheriff is urging residents to be patient with rescue crews there as they conduct rescues and try to get help to those who 
 
 need it most. You are looking at a sinkhole, for example, in the area now. CNN's Isabel Rosales spoke with the sheriff on the ground a little earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  And I've got the sheriff right here. Sheriff, is it OK to talk with you?
 
SHERIFF CHAD CHRONISTER, HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, FLORIDA:  Yes.
 
ROSALES:  Chad Chronister of Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff, what can you tell us about what's happening with these rescue operations?
 
CHRONISTER:  Yes. We're -- we have three of the amphibious vehicles staged throughout the county and they're in full operation at assisted living 
 
 facility up on the north end. Here at the hotel, we have some elderly folks that struggle with some disabilities and able to get them to some dry land, 
 
 get them some medical attention.
 
These aren't people who didn't heed the warning. This is -- these are individuals in areas where we've never seen flooding. Never seen flooding. 
 
 And to go from no flooding to three feet of water up over your knees, I can imagine how frightening that was for everybody here.
 
ROSALES:  Yes. And specifically, the assisted living facility, another separate operation happening right now in the northern part of the county. 
 
 That's where the University of South Tampa, another place you would never imagine to see flooding like this. That's a more complex situation because 
 
 you people dealing with medical complications. What can you tell me about what's happening there?
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
CHRONISTER:  Yes, that's a -- it takes a little more of a triage. Certainly, have to handle a fragile situation with the utmost care and a 
 
 lot more care. We have almost 100 residents up there and that's certainly going to be a more prolonged rescue operation.
 
ROSALES:  Any message you want to give to folks out there that, you know, they're stuck, stuck and more blindsided, again, in these areas that 
 
 they've never seen conditions like this before?
 
CHRONISTER:  Just hang tight, shelter. I know you're uncomfortable. Almost 600,000 people in our county without power. We'll come to you as quick as 
 
 we can.
 
ROSALES:  And any idea how many of these calls you have right now?
 
CHRONISTER:  Right now, these are the two big facilities. We have another rehabilitative facility. We have a hotel here and then up on the north end. 
 
 But again, out east and up north, we've never experienced this type of flooding. So, I'm sure it was quite frightening for these folks who thought 
 
 they were safe. They were sheltered in place. And now, faced with having flooding and not knowing what was going to stop.
 
Again, you can see the relief. My heart is certainly full of content knowing that we're going to get them to dry ground and get them the medical 
 
 attention they need.
 
ROSALES:  Sheriff, thank you so much for your time. Back to you.
