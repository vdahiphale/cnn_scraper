MAX FOSTER, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us in the US, around the world and streaming on CNN Max. I'm Max Foster. Across the Middle East and around the world, there's an all-out diplomatic push right now to contain the fallout from Iran's unprecedented aerial assault on Israel over the weekend and to prevent any further escalation of the violence in that region. 
 
Soon after the bombardment ended on Sunday, members of the G7 held a virtual meeting and regional leaders began discussing with their global counterparts. In an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, the Secretary General urged restraint. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.S. SECRETARY GENERAL:  The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de- escalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Well, Israel says about 350 drones, missiles and rockets were fired from Iran, Iraq, Yemen and by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel intercepted most of them with help from the U.S., U.K. and France. However, the U.S. says it won't join any retaliatory strikes. 
 
Israel's war cabinet hasn't decided on a response. A source tells CNN the council's divided, but a call from the U.S. president convinced Israel's Prime Minister to delay retaliation at least for now. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me from Abu Dhabi. What do you understand the view to be then within the war cabinet about any sort of response? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Max, we understand that there is a split at this point. We do know that within the wider cabinet, there is definitely a right-wing element, a far-right element that has really kept this coalition together. And they are of the mind that there should be a hard and fast response to Iran. There is a feeling that Israel needs to re-establish a military
 
 deterrent when it comes to the attacks over the weekend. But we have heard also that the phone call that the U.S. President Joe Biden had with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did have some kind of an impact. The U.S. President was trying to urge constraint, as many across the world are at this point, but also pointing out that Israel should see what happened as a win because the vast majority, 99 percent of those drones and missiles were shot down and there was very limited damage from the attack itself. 
 
We have heard, though, that Israel's cabinet is determined that there will be some kind of a response. It's just what that response will be. We understand that this meeting went on for hours and that's very telling in itself, the fact that it went on for so long. But the military now has been asked to draw up further plans, further options, as clearly the options that were on the table were not sufficient for this war cabinet.
 
We heard from Israel's President as well, Herzog, who spoke to CNN on Sunday and said Israel is looking at this situation with a cool head. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT:  I think we're operating in a very focused way and a very responsible way and I'm sure there will be a decision accordingly that will make sure that we protect and defend the people of Israel and, of course, serve the idea of this coalition that has emanated all of a sudden in front of our eyes in opposing the aggressive acts and the operations of Iran in the region for so many years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS:  Well, we've heard from the Iranian side as they believe this matter is concluded. They say this was a retaliatory strike for a suspected Israeli strike at the beginning of the month from an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, which killed seven. And we've heard from Iran's President as well saying that if there is a response from Israel that is aggressive against the Iranian assets or people, then there will be a heavier response from Iran. 
 <br>[02:04:59]
 
So, this is the concern when it comes to tit-for-tat attacks between the two countries. The fact that this has been the first attack from Iranian soil against Israel has certainly increased the tensions. If there is a response and then another retaliatory response, that is an escalation. That is the concern that this will then spark a wider regional conflict, Max? 
 
FOSTER:  Could Israel be convinced by America, who's already managed to get a delay on a response? Could Israel be convinced that this is resolved, because if you hone it down to these two incidents, that's effectively what Iran's saying, isn't it, that it's concluded, it's responded to what happened in Syria? HANCOCKS:  As far as Iran's concerned, this is done. There was an
 
 attack in Syria on Iranian assets and they retaliated. If you look at precedent though, you look at what Israel has done in the past, it is very unlikely that there will be no response from Israel at this point. Whenever there has been an attack on Israel, they have responded and they have responded with significant force in the past. 
 
And remember, this is a country that is reeling and is in the midst of a war at this point. It did have a surprise attack on October 7th against its people, which it is now trying to create, it says, deterrence against Hamas and trying to destroy Hamas with devastating impacts we have seen in Gaza and on the Palestinian population. 
 
And then again, this very significant attack from Iran on Israeli territory, something the likes of which we have not seen before. So again, there is a definite call within Israel that that deterrent needs to be re-established, that Israel does need to respond in some kind of way. 
 
We just don't know the timing; we don't know the format. But I think that the general consensus is that it is highly unlikely that Israel will do nothing, Max? 
 
FOSTER:  Okay, Paula in Abu Dhabi, thank you so much. Retired Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defensive Democracies and a former spokesperson as well for the IDF. He knows the system there very well, indeed. He joins us from Tel Aviv. Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
Just take us through what that war cabinet will be weighing right now in terms of whether it responds and what type of response there will be.
 
JONATHAN CONRICUS, SENIOR FELLOW, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACISES:  Yes, good morning, Max, and thank you for having me. I think it's not a question of whether there will be a response. But the question rather is, or the different questions are, what type of response will we see? What will the strategic objective be? And who will Israel be able to get support from in order to execute a bigger plan? 
 
I think that when Iran attacked Israel from Iranian soil for the first time, that was a watershed moment in Middle Eastern history because for decades Iran has been working in the shadows and using proxies to attack Israel. And this time they did cross that Rubicon, and now they are in uncharted territory and so is Israel. 
 
But what I am happy to see is that -- what I'm happy to see is that Israel is taking its time, not rushing and responding immediately, but taking its time and thinking what the best first response to this Iranian aggression will be.
 
And absolutely important key will be having support and approval of the U.S., but also to get other local players like the Saudis, the Emirates, the Jordanians and others on board. For them, it's an opportunity to get to scale back Iranian aggression in the region. For Israel, it's absolutely imperative that Israel retaliates against Iran. 
 
FOSTER:  And in terms of that retaliation, that would be from Israeli soil on to Iranian soil. Is that your understanding? 
 
CONRICUS:  One would assume so. Israel has a pretty deep and diversified toolbox when it comes to military matters dealing with Iran. Iran has good defenses and a sizeable military, but I think that Israel has the ability via the air force and other standoff capabilities to inflict significant damage on Iranian military and perhaps economic infrastructure. 
 
And I think that, of course, since Iran attacked Israel from Iranian soil, I don't think that Israel will be again attacking a proxy or dealing with something that isn't Iran proper. But really what matters is what is the big plan here? What's the strategy? 
 <br>[02:09:55]
 
Because this is an opportunity for Israel to, as the reporter just spoke about, Israel is surrounded by Iranian proxies that have inflicted some of the most heaviest damage on Israeli society. Hamas is an Iranian proxy and so is Hezbollah. And what Israel urgently needs to do in order to enhance the safety of its civilians is to scale back those Iranian proxies. 
 
And what Israel hasn't done so far is to address the source of violence against it, and that's Iran. And so far, Israel has only been dealing with the proxies, and that hasn't been a very successful endeavor. So, there's really a fork in the road here for Israel in terms of its regional strategy. 
 
I think that we will see a significant Israeli response. I hope that the U.S. will support it, and I hope that other regional players will be behind it as well. 
 
FOSTER:  The U.S. has already said it won't support a response. It's pretty clear from other countries that supported the defense of Israel over the weekend, you know France and U.K., that they're very concerned about escalation as well. If Israel doesn't get the support from countries like that, in reacting back to Iran, do you think it will still go ahead? 
 
CONRICUS:  Yeah, you know, I listened very carefully to the interviews made by Kirby and by others. And I wouldn't say that that's a clear no. I'd say that, of course, the U.S. concerned with many other issues, with elections, with global things, and many other things, doesn't want a full-scale war. And I don't think that Israel wants either. 
 
But I think everybody understands that Israel has to retaliate. There's no way that Iran attacks Israel with 350 missiles and drones and it goes unchecked. That's not a scenario. So, what I've listened very carefully from the Americans is, well, if U.S. won't be part of it and we are not asking for the U.S. to be part of it, I think. But what Israel needs is behind the closed doors approval and I think this relies very much on the quality of communications between Jerusalem and Washington and presenting a coherent plan. 
 
I think that's possible. And I also think that it would serve U.S. interests in having a strong Israeli ally executing that kind of power against a very dangerous and reckless Iranian regime. 
 
FOSTER:  Jonathan Conricus in Tel Aviv, really appreciate your insight and time with us today. Thank you so much. 
 
CONRICUS:  Thank you. Just ahead, Iran's military chiefs say their military operation against Israel has ended, as Paula was saying. But they also have a warning for Israel. Details of what they're saying after a quick break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:15:00]
 
FOSTER:  Iran says its retaliation against Israel is now over. That's the message from Tehran, at least, it's making publicly. And according to a senior U.S. official, it's the same thing being communicated to the White House privately. But Iran's military chiefs are warning that Israel shouldn't attack again in the future on Iran. The chief of staff of Iran's armed forces has warned they won't sit on the sidelines if Israel makes any further moves. 
 
I'm joined now by Arash Azizi. He's the author of "The Shadow Commander: Soleimani, the U.S. and Iran's Global Ambitions" and "What Iranians Want, Women, Life, Freedom." Thank you so much for joining us today. 
 
In terms of what Iran was trying to achieve over the weekend, obviously, there weren't any casualties. But this felt like much more of a message, you know, a stand of position. How do you read what they were trying to achieve over the weekend? 
 
ARASH AZIZI, AUTHOR, "THE SHADOW COMMANDER: SOLEIMANI, THE U.S. AND IRAN'S GLOBAL AMBITIONS":  After the attack on April 1st, which was on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Iran, the Islamic Republic and the Iranian regime were under a lot of pressure to try to respond to it to show that they can do something. 
 
And, you know, of course, not just because of the attack on April 1st, but because of the Israel's attack over the past few months, they really felt like they had to do something. And at the same time, they wanted to not get Iran into a broader conflict and to not get into a broader war. So, it was a calibrated attack to not cause casualties, but also just show a response from the Iranian side. 
 
And which is why also they, most importantly, they very seemingly they've told the countries in the region and the United States beforehand, I mean, in terms of countries in the region, 72 hours beforehand to avoid an Israeli response. 
 
FOSTER:  We just heard from a former IDF spokesperson saying Israel is now in a position where it probably would feel it does need to make a direct attack back on Iran. What do you make of that and Iran's response to that? 
 
AZIZI:  It's a very dangerous moment. The reality is that since October 7, all of us, those who are worried about the possibility of a broader conflagration that could bring Iran and Israel in a direct war to each other and that will involve many parties around the region, we've been all worried about this moment. 
 
I mean, what Israel does now is very important. As I said, we could look at the fact that this attack was designed not to cause any casualties and the United States will try to, I think, impress upon Israel the importance of restraint, the importance of not causing a broader war. 
 
But look, part of the reality is that, of course, I think even if establishment figures in Iran and Israel vote and don't want a war, sometimes a war happens despite that. So, I think it's a very dangerous few hours and few days ahead of us. And I hope all can be done to avoid a broader war. 
 
FOSTER:  One compromise, presumably, within the Israeli cabinet would be to attack proxies, but that won't have the same impact as directly hitting Iran. And the justification for a direct hit on Iran was that these drones were targeted at Israel. 
 <br>[02:20:03]
 
AZIZI:  Well, but also if you're talking about, you know, the reality is that Iran does not have iron dome. So, any attack of Israel and Iran is likely to cause a lot of casualties. And look, the reality is this, the regime ruling over the Iranian people is no friend of theirs. And it's, you know, I blame it, as do many other Iranians, for getting us into adventurous sort of politics in the region and for threatening Israel and for getting us into a situation on the brink of war. 
 
So, it's not, you know, this regime would do anything like that. But it's also the fact that Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, might want an adventure of his own and in order to get out of the troubles that he has. So, it's very important, you know, if Israel is going to respond, you know, what kind of casualties it's going to have and what kind of responsible cause back from Iran will, you know, it can all get us into a place where it would be not in the interest of people of Israel, people of Iran, people of Palestine or anybody else in this region, for this war to spread. 
 
FOSTER:  How nervous are people in Iran right now that you're speaking to? 
 
AZIZI:  I mean, I think they were pretty nervous from the early hours. You know, they were in lineups at gas stations, in supermarkets. And, you know, people are not nervous just because of the war, but because of the economic effect that they will have. Iran already burned millions of dollars on these attacks in Israel and they're very worried about the continued fallout and economic fallout of a broader war. Iranians can't even afford a war. It's a terrible time. The Iranian
 
 economy has been battered for months. So, I think it's a very nerve- wracking moment. And Iranians remember a war, you know, the eight years' war with Iraq in the 1980s that really devastated Iranian society. So, it's one that they would really likely -- they would not like to repeat and they would like to avoid. 
 
FOSTER:  Arash Azizi, really appreciate you spending your time with us. Thank you so much.
 
AZIZI:  Thank you. 
 
FOSTER:  Still to come, we are getting more reactions from around the world to Iran's attack. Our special coverage continues in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
FOSTER:  Israel trying to get back to normal after being bombarded with a wave of missiles late on that ramped up tensions in the region. Schools have reopened and restrictions on large gatherings have been lifted. Israeli officials say they are determined to respond to the attacks, but are still figuring out the timing and the scope of any action. 
 
CNN analyst, Barack Ravid, says some ministers are pushing for immediate retaliation, while others are urging caution due to international pressure. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI WAR CABINET MINISTER (through translation):  In the face of the Iranian threat, we will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us. And most importantly, faced with the desire of our enemies to harm us, we will continue to unite and become stronger.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Well, the IDF says Iran launched about 350 missiles and drones at Israel, but most of them were shot down by the Israeli military and its partners, including the U.S. U.S. Central Command says its forces intercepted more than 80 drones and at least six ballistic missiles fired from Yemen and Iran. 
 
Leaders across the globe condemning Iran's attack. During a virtual G7 meeting on Sunday, the group expressed its, quote, "full solidarity and support to Israel," but also vowed to work together to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation. Foreign ministers from the G7 set to meet this week in Italy.
 
For more reaction from around the world. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout standing by in Hong Kong, but first to Barbie Nadeau. She's in Rome. Just take us through the reaction from the G7 and any action we may get from the foreign ministers. 
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN REPORTER:  Yeah, you know, I mean, Italy is holding the rotating presidency of the G7. So yesterday, Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, called this virtual meeting. And, you know, the very much predictable, I think, reaction, everybody is, you know, trying to exercise, telling people to exercise calm at this moment. 
 
You know, in the statement that came out of that G7 meeting yesterday, you know, really calling for a de-escalation, also continuing to try to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. That was part of that statement that came out of the meeting yesterday. 
 
On Thursday and on the 17th, I guess that's Wednesday, the G7 foreign ministers will meet in Capri off of Naples here in the south of Italy. And, you know, the prime minister here and the foreign minister here, Antonio Tajani, say that the priority of that meeting is going to be talking about de-escalation, talking about how to protect trade in the Red Sea, all of these sorts of things that are at risk here. 
 
And so, you know, the focus of that meeting is going to be really the attention of the world is going to be on that, how these leaders can work to try to temper even Israel's reaction and how to sort of calm things down now, Max.
 
FOSTER:  And Kristie, China often doesn't support action against Israel in situations like this or when it's on the Security Council against these sorts of conflicts. What's its position because it has a very important role here. 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, absolutely. We've been monitoring reaction from China and from across the region after Iran's strike on Israel. We also heard from Japan and South Korea. They strongly condemned these strikes. Indonesia and Malaysia urging restraint. And the line that we're hearing from China is an expression of deep concern while calling for a ceasefire and also calling out what it calls countries of influence. 
 
I want you to look at what China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said on Sunday, issuing the following statement, saying, quote, "The conflict must end now. China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region," unquote. 
 
Now, China wants to be a peace broker in the Middle East. It's a region where it gets a lot of growing amounts of oil and energy. And that is how it's weighing on the conflict so far. 
 <br>[02:29:58]
 
And I do want to quickly tell you what India and Pakistan have said as well. They have expressed concern.  We received this statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of India, saying it's calling for the immediate de-escalation , exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence and return to the path of diplomacy. 
 
And from Pakistan's government, we heard this: For months, Pakistan has underlined the necessity of international efforts to prevent expansion of hostilities in the region and for a ceasefire in Gaza.
 
Finally, the close U.S. ally Australia, has condemned Iran's attacks on Israel, saying that he continues to who support regional security including that of Israel. So that's a roundup of the reaction here in the Asia region back to you.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  What is China's relationship with Iran? How much leverage does it have there? 
 
STOUT:  China does have some leverage at least on paper, but it's difficult to -- for China to actually pull that lever because it is not that powerful in the region and it doesn't intend to use that power. 
 
When you look at the leverage, it as China has substantial investments with Iran, China is a main purchaser of Iranian oil. China has helped soften the blow from U.S. sanctions in Iran. But analysts point out that some Iranian relations are strained because of Chinas underinvestment in Iran and China tends to mind its own business. It does not want to overextend itself the way it believes the U.S. has. 
 
So this is why the belief is from the perspective of Beijing, the solution here is not for China to restrain Iran.
 
Back to you, Max. 
 
FOSTER:  Yeah, Kristie, Barbie, too, thank you both for joining me.
 
After the break, Donald Trumps historic criminal trial is set to begin today. We'll look at what to expect with the jury selection.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:35:07]
 
FOSTER:  Now, in our other top story. Just three months before the Republican Party is set to choose him as their presidential nominee, Donald Trump is going on trial today in New York. Jury selection will begin just hours from now. 
 
Trump will be there and it'll be an unprecedented scene. Never before in American history has a current or former president face a criminal trial. 
 
Trump is charged with 34 felony counts. He's accused of falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels, the former president is pleading not guilty. 
 
In a Truth Social post, he said: I'll be fighting for myself, but much more importantly, ill be fighting for our country, joining me now from Los Angeles civil rights attorney and legal affairs commentator, Areva Martin. It must be fascinating, if nothing else for you this day because we haven't seen it before.
 
AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR:  Absolutely unprecedented to see a former president who is running for president again, to have to face criminal charges and not in a federal court house or a court room tomorrow. He will be in a state court in Manhattan, a city that he wants loved claim to be closely aligned with. And now is claiming that he can't get a fair trial, that he does not believe that he can get a fair trial from jurors in New York, which is his home state. So we are in uncharted waters for sure 
 
FOSTER:  What do you understand the two sides to the case being? The prosecution and the defense? 
 
MARTIN:  The prosecution case is pretty straightforward. They are alleging that Donald Trump made payments to Stormy Daniels to prevent her from coming out or going public with a story that they had had a sexual relationship about ten years prior to the first presidential election that he was a part of, and that he made those payments to his lawyer once he was elected president in 2016 and he covered them up, he falsified business records allegedly stating that the payments were legal fees a rather than hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. 
 
Now, Donald Trump is -- his defense has been primarily that he did make the payments to his then lawyer, Michael Cohen, but they were payments for legal fees and not payments to try to quiet a story involving Stormy Daniels. He's also been claiming that this is a part of a concerted effort by Joe Biden and Democrats to persecute him that they weaponize the justice system the legal system to prevent him from winning a second term as president. 
 
FOSTER:  What would the prosecution need, some hard paperwork proving the direct link between Trump and Stormy Daniels?
 
MARTIN:  Absolutely. And we should expect that they will have a back paperwork. They will have documents. They will have not only documentary evidence, but they're going to have testimony from Stormy Daniels herself. We should expect her to be a key witness for the prosecution as well as Michael Cohen. 
 
Also want Donald Trumps close advisers, Hope Hicks, allegedly was on phone calls with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump as they were hatching this whole plan. She's expected to testify as well. His one of his former financial managers, Allen Weisselberg, is also expected to testify. 
 
So we have to remember that Michael Cohen has already been accused four very similar crimes related to this hush money payment. And he was actually convicted and served time. We should expect Donald Trumps team to go after Michael Cohen and to try to challenge and question his credibility. But I think what's most important about what's going to happen in that state court today in Manhattan is that for the very first time, someone who's running for president, someone who has been president is going to have to face 12 jurors and try to explain to them why he should not be found guilty of a crime. 
 
His credibility, his ability, I think to convince those voters, particularly those independent voters, that he should be reelected is on the line. So this trial is much bigger than just criminal charges. It really probably holds the fate of his political campaign as well FOSTER:  If he is found guilty, he could still run though, couldn't
 
 he? And perhaps not lose much support because a lot of his supporters would argue this is all a setup, anyway. 
 
MARTIN:  Well, I think you're right and wrong on a couple of points, definitely under our Constitution, you can still run and you can be elected president even as a convicted fellow, nothing in the constitution prevents that. But all the polls indicate that if he is convicted of any crime and this is the first criminal trial that's going to take place, that he is going to lose substantial voters. 
 
And we have to remember it's not just Republican voters. It's those key independent voters who are going to make a big difference in those key swing states. 
 <br>[02:40:04]
 
So as much as we hear Donald Trump suggests that this is persecution and all the bluster about how this is going to help him. It's pretty clear that this it would be quite damaging if he is convicted.
 
FOSTER:  He's got a bit of a history, hasn't he using these cases as part of his campaign effort to make that argument about persecution. How much time will he be allowed by the judge in court? 
 
MARTIN:  Well, one thing we should note is that because this is a criminal trial, he has to be present every day. And this judge has said the court will be open four days a week, and like we've seen in the past, we should expect him to be on the courtroom steps holding essentially, you go to campaign rallies because he won't be able to be out on the campaign trail during the time of the trial. 
 
The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. I think contrary to all of the comments and the rhetoric we heard from Donald Trump, this is going to be incredibly damning to him as a candidate. We have never, ever seen a former president and particularly someone running for president, have to face criminal charges. Let's talk about the embarrassing testimony that's likely to come out as well about his sexual encounters with Stormy Daniels. We know that's her testimony, and then there's Karen McDougal someone else who claims she had a sexual affair with Donald Trump. 
 
So it's against that backdrop, that voters are going to be asked, is this someone you want to return to the White House that has been subjected to criminal trial?
 
FOSTER:  The question. 
 
Areva Martin, thank you so much. 
 
MARTIN:  Thanks. 
 
FOSTER:  Do watch CNN's special coverage of that as well as it unfolds. Thank you for joining us. I'm Max Foster. 
 
For our international and Max viewers, "WORLD SPORT" is up next. For our viewers in the U.S. and Canada, I'll be back in a moment with more CNN NEWSROOM after this short break.

FOSTER:  Welcome back to our viewers in North America, I'm Max Foster in London.
 
A senior U.S. administration official says Iran message the U.S. privately while the attack on Israel was underway on Saturday to say, quoting, the U.S. official that they were finished after this, the barrage of more than 350 projectiles from Tehran had the potential to cause great destruction.
 
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
 
FOSTER:  But the vast majority of those strikes were intercepted by Israel -- Israel and its partners and the U.S. As assessed that there was no significant damage within Israel itself. The IDF says only a few actually made it into Israel now Israel is promising to exact a price from Iran for the attack. 
 
As Israel's war cabinet weighs its responses, its allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden, are urging restraint. Meanwhile, the U.S. and other leaders of G7 countries are condemning Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel, quote, in the strongest terms.
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  President Joe Biden on Sunday spoke with G7 leaders following Iran's attacks against Israel to coordinate, quote, a united diplomatic response -- keyword there being diplomatic -- as they sought non-military actions, known enjoyed statement following those discussions. 
 
The G7 leaders said the following, quote: With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. This must be avoided. We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation. 
 
Of course, that has been the primary focus for the White House, containing the risk of a wider regional conflict. And U.S. officials said that Sunday, there were constructive talks to this end, but in a phone call on Saturday night, President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive action against Iran, and said cautioning Israel to think carefully and strategically about its next steps toward Iran. 
 
Now, the U.S. has also assessed there wasn't any age or damage to infrastructure within Israel, and that Israel should take this as a win. They were able to take down missiles and defend themselves against Iran. But, of course, the big question is whether the Israeli prime minister
 
 will heed the advice of President Biden. And the two have had public rifts over the handling of the war in Gaza. 
 
And so. it's unclear what these really prime minister will decide moving forward, but the White House making clear over the weekend, that they do not want to see any further escalation in the region.

FOSTER:  As Ukraine struggles to fend off the Russian aerial attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Iran's attack on Israel proves that model defense systems saved lives. Nearly all of the hundreds of Iranian drones and missiles fired towards Israel were intercepted and destroyed. 
 
Mr. Zelenskyy says that's all he wants for his own country.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The whole world sees much the whole world sees what real defense is. It sees that it is feasible and the whole world saw that Israel was not alone in this defense. The threat in the sky was also been eliminated by its allies. And when Ukraine tells its allies that unity provides the best defense, they are all well aware of its effectiveness. They are aware of it and insure it.

FOSTER:  Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia launched 130 Iranian-made drones against Ukraine this week alone, most were intercepted. But he says it was harder to destroy the more than 80 Russian missiles and 700 guided bombs fired this week, including the missile that flattened this neighborhood in Kherson. 
 
Now, in Washington, congressional leaders are discussing U.S. funding for Israel after Iran's attack. President Biden held the call on Sunday with top leaders in the Senate and the House. 
 
CNN's Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER:  Well, Congress is divided right now over how to provide aid to Israel, and specifically whether to also attach aid for Ukraine. This was a question that Speaker Mike Johnson was already wrestling with, but that question has taken on renewed urgency and significance in the wake of Iran attacking Israel. 
 
Now, Speaker Mike Johnson did say that he plants to put some type of Israel aid bill on the House floor this upcoming week. 
 <br>[02:50:05] But he said those details are still being finalized. 
 
Let's take a listen 
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We're going to try again this week and the details of that package are being put together right now. We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues. 
 
ZANONA:  And part of the reason for the indecision here is because Johnson is facing competing pressures over how to proceed. In one corner, there are bipartisan calls including from GOP leader Mitch McConnell, including from some of Johnson its own Republican committee chairman in the House to just put a Senate passed foreign aid package on the House floor. That package includes aid for Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. And if the house were to pass it, it could go immediately to president Joe Biden's desk for signature. 
 
But in the other corner, Johnson is facing calls from his conservative hardliners to keep Israel and Ukraine separate. And one of those hardliners includes Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of those people who has threatened Johnson's job and his speakership if he moves ahead with any aid to Ukraine. 
 
So Johnson has some very big decisions to make in the coming days. He did participate in a phone call on Sunday with the other top four congressional leaders with President Biden to discuss the ongoing situation in the Middle East. But at this moment, very uncertain how Congress is going to act and what Johnson does has not only big implications for his speakership, but also for our allies abroad.

FOSTER:  To our top story, the start of Donald Trump's historic criminal trial in New York, only hours away now. Jury selection set to get underway soon. This will be the first time a former U.S. president will go on trial for criminal charges. Trumps accused of falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Law enforcement officials say they will deploy a sophisticated and multi-layered security plan greater than that of Trumps previous high-profile cases in Manhattan.
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  But we all remember the security presence that was dedicated to former President Donald Trump during his civil fraud hearings and also during some previous appearances here in criminal court. I think of that as really the precursor to will begin to see here in Lower Manhattan starting on Monday when his trial gets underway. This is a months-long planning situation that will involve many agencies. I'll give you sort of a preview of we could expect. For starters, the NYPD will be mainly in charge of securing the area around the courthouse using some of these barricades to create what are called like these frozen zones to secure the area around the facility itself especially as the former president arrives. And then certainly as he leaves, any potential Trump supporters or protesters, the NYPD will be really getting that presence to this park across the street, essentially creating a safety zone or at least a bubble here between members of the general public, and what's going on inside. 
 
The Secret Service, their main responsibility will be protecting the former president. They will also be the ones to determine what motorcade route they take here from Trump tower. That's about six miles away, a law enforcement official telling my colleague Mark Morales that they will likely -- that route will vary from day-to-day. 
 
Then finally, court officers, there responsibilities will be behind these walls. There'll be mainly in charge of the former president's movements, even dedicating a specific elevator. There will be the one to actually take Donald Trump up to -- up to the court house where the proceedings are going to take place. 
 
Look some good news here. These agencies, they're all used to doing this working hand in hand before. What will certainly set this situation apart is that now it's not just a former president facing trial, it's a former president that is currently running for president.

American golfer Scottie Scheffler has captured his second career green jacket, joining an elite group of players to win the Masters multiple times and further cementing his status as the top player in the world right now. 
 
CNN's Don Riddell has more from Augusta, Georgia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Scottie Scheffler is winning at life right now, seemingly everything he touches turns to gold.
 
A four-stroke victory at Augusta on Sunday gives the American world number one his second Masters title in the space of just three years. It's this third tournament victory and four attempts. And now we can return home to spend time with his wife, Meredith ahead of the imminent birth of their first child.
 
SCOTTI SCHEFFLER, PRO-GOLFER:  My priorities will change here very soon. You know, my son or daughter will now be the main priority, along with my wife. So, golf will now be, you know, fourth in line but I still love competing. I don't plan on taking my off the ball anytime soon. That's for sure.
 
RIDDELL:  Scheffler held his nerve in a tense final round at Augusta consolidating, his overnight lead by shooting a four under pass score.
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
He quickly recovered from a couple of drops, shocks on the front nine, making a total of seven birdies throughout his round and as a clutch of challenges steadily faded away, he coasted home to a majestic win.
 
Scheffler is now unquestionably the man to beat in men's golf. But a major new star announced his arrival. This time last year, Sweden's Ludvig Aberg was an amateur player. And in his very first major tournament, he played superbly, finishing second on seven under par.
 
And although Tiger Woods finished in 60th place, he's looking on the bright side. The five-time Masters champion made history by making a 24th consecutive cut at the Masters. And it was only the third good time that he played four rounds of golf since that devastating car crash three years ago. 
 
The next major tournament will be the PGA championship in a month's time, by which time Scheffler will be a father and his rivals will be hoping that with a baby in his arms, he will finally take his eye off the ball.
 
Back to you.
