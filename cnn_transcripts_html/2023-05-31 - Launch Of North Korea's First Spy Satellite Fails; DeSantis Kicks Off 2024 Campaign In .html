PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: And a very warm welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. Ahead right here on CNN NEWSROOM.
 
With a major hurdle clear the U.S. debt limit is now set for a vote on the House floor in the coming hours. But some Republicans say the speaker's job is on the line, depending on how it goes.
 
Air-raid siren sound in Japan and South Korea after North Korea tried but failed to launch this space spy satellite into space. Plus.

GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): It's time we impose our will on Washington, D.C. And you can't do any of this if you know when.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Ron DeSantis kicks off his 2024 presidential campaign in Iowa with some not-so-subtle digs. That is one time ally, former President Donald Trump.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Paul Newton.
 
NEWTON: So, a deal to avoid defaulting on 1tens of trillions of dollars of debt is moving forward but the U.S. government is by no means out of the woods. Now in the coming hours, U.S. House members will vote on a bill to raise the debt ceiling as well as other measures tacked on to the spending limit.
 
Well, some lawmakers seem confident they'll get the votes to send the bill to the Senate. The House Speaker will be busy trying to wrangle the last-minute support from Republicans who don't like this deal. Some Democrats are also angry about White House concessions. CNN's Melanie Zanona explains it all from Washington. MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, the house cleared a key procedural hurdle that will get them one step closer to passing the bipartisan debt deal. The House Rules Committee on Tuesday approved a rule for the bill despite opposition from two hardline conservatives on the panel. So, essentially, this will clear the way for a floor vote. But they still need to pass the actual underlying bill and there has been opposition from both the far left and the far right.
 
So, party leaders have been working furiously behind the scenes to try to sell this deal, to try to whip this deal. House Democrats will huddle on Wednesday morning with their party leadership and White House officials and Republicans huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday evening where we're told that Speaker Kevin McCarthy made a forceful sales pitch for this deal. He touted a number of victories in the bill.
 
And some conservatives did get up and express their concerns with what they view as a watered-down bill that gave away too many concessions to the Democrats. But despite the conservative opposition, Kevin McCarthy is expressing confidence they'll be able to get this over the finish line. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): -- confident we will pass the bill. I've talked to many about whether they are for or against the bill. I'm not sure what in the bill people are concerned about. 
 
The everybody has an opportunity to read it. Everybody has an opportunity for their own opinion.
 
This vote will be tomorrow.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZANONA: And of course, once it passes the House, it still needs to go over to the Senate.  Republican leaders there also expressing confidence that they'll have enough votes with Democrats to put this over the finish line. But one other potential landmine that Speaker Kevin McCarthy has to look out for is maintaining his speakership because there have been a several number of conservative hardliners who have threatened to force a vote on ousting him, as Speaker.
 
Congressman Matt Gaetz said that if a majority of Republicans end up opposing the deal on the House floor, that he does believe there will be an effort to remove him as speaker. But as of right now, Kevin McCarthy says he's going to have the votes and he's going to keep this job. 
 
Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.
 
NEWTON: With me now from New York is Rana Foroohar. She is an editor and columnist at the Financial Times. She's also CNN's global economic analyst. Good to see you, Rona. And have you weigh in on what is -- what has been really a complicated set of negotiations and numbers. And I want to get to the numbers. We've talked so much about the politics. But is this -- do you see it transformative in any way? Is it really changing how and where the U.S. government spends its money?
 
RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Well, so, look, it changes things directionally, a little bit. Let's make that clear. I mean, we have seen a lot of fiscal spending in this administration. I think a lot of it has been necessary. I'm a big fan of some of the big infrastructure programs, chips, the IRA but debt is an issue. You know, even some Democrats are beginning to say that U.S. debt and deficit issues, you know, are a concern.
 <br>[02:05:09]
 
And clearly, getting to a debt ceiling every few years where we're finger biting and, you know, speaking to each other as we have been over the last few weeks about whether or not the U.S. govern, that's something we don't want to get to again. So, I think creating a compromise where you can say, look, we're going to save $1.5 trillion that -- in the next decade. That's not nothing, you know.
 
That -- and I think that's something that the House Leader McCarthy has said to his constituents that, look, you know, if you want to turn up your nose to this fine, but it - 1.5 trillion is a pretty big number and it says, yes, we are concerned about the debt, even as we were rolling out some big fiscal stimulus programs at the same time.
 
NEWTON: And in terms of that, the Congressional Budget Office came out and said that indeed, it is 1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. But there are also some unsettling numbers in there, especially when it has to do with certain specific programs and in terms of how that could change even how entitlements could change over the next few years. And also, of course, Rona, there's the issue that defense will remain untouched.
 
FOROOHAR: Right. Well, you know, that's something that I think both sides were pretty keen on, because let's face it, Paula. We're in a multipolar world, we're in a very uncertain world with U.S.-China relations, potential conflict over Taiwan. I think the defense spending leaving that untouched was probably not a hard place to get to, in a lot of ways. At least for all, but the most conservative members of the Republican caucus.
 
I would say that this is a good deal in the sense that it's not going to please everybody, you know, we've really come out in the middle, both sides have to give some things up. It's quite interesting that the Republicans pushed strongly for work requirements as part of welfare. Understandable or reasonable issue that Republicans have fought for for a long time. But what's fascinating is when you actually tally up some of the estimates, it may end up giving out more entitlement benefits, because of some of the compromises that were made.
 
Even though, you know, you've got new work requirements for older people, you don't have them for veterans and other groups. So, you know, all of these things are estimates. But to me, the fact that there is bipartisanship again, in this deal. I mean, bipartisanship. When was the last time we used that word in a sentence about anything that was being done in Washington? That's something to be thankful for.
 
NEWTON: Yes. You know, it's interesting, because not many people have brought that up. Many people are just talking about how difficult it is to get this deal through. I mean, since both flanks of each party don't like it, it must mean that look, the compromise has been hanging, right? 
 
FOROOHAR: Right. That's absolutely right. I mean, you know, I find it kind of weirdly heartening that all right, it's a -- it's a handful of Republicans that are still complaining, it's a handful of Democrats, but really a lot of people in the -- are pretty happy, that is a good place to be.
 
NEWTON: And before I let you go, I want to talk to you about one of the provisions because I know how closely you are to CEOs and you speak to them often. There's this issue about perhaps fast-tracking environmental assessments. Now, a lot of people are worry of that. They're wondering if any of these environmental assessment's impacts will perhaps be fast tracked too quickly.
 
But can that work both ways? And does that give the businesses the flexibility that they've been asking for, for government for so many years?
 
FOROOHAR: A hundred percent. You know, on the one hand, you might see this as a very conservative demand. On the other hand, it plays again to this new world that we're in where a lot of Democrats - I mean, certainly this White House want to build in more redundancy and resiliency into energy systems. They want to be able to mine rare- earth minerals in the U.S. and amongst allies.
 
They want to be able to, you know, create more supply chains that are closer to home, some of them and commodities, energy resources that, you know, do need permitting. Right now, for example, if you're trying to mined rare-earth minerals in the U.S. if you started from a standstill today, with current regulations, you'd be looking at five, six years to get something up off the ground.
 
At a time when there's a new world taking shape, China and Russia are, you know, bringing many countries into their own orbit. I think that this is something that has a new bipartisan feel to I would say.
 
NEWTON: OK. Rona Foroohar for us. Thanks so much. Really appreciate you weighing in as we continue to see how this deal ends. Appreciate it.
 
FOROOHAR: Great to speak to you.
 
NEWTON: So, after weeks of hype, preparation and international concern, North Korea said its attempt to launch its first military spy satellite has failed. State media reports the missile carrying the satellite function during the second stage of launch and then crashed into the sea. Now, South Korea says, this, you see it there, is a piece of it. Pyongyang says its national space agency will investigate the failure urgently and attempt another launch soon.
 <br>[02:10:14]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: The launch early Wednesday morning jolted South Korea's air- raid sirens blasted in the capital Seoul.
 
And you hear it there. The situation was similar in Japan where authorities issued emergency alerts for the southern island of Okinawa and urged residents to take shelter.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: For more on all of this, we're joined by Paula Hancocks who is live for us in Seoul. And Paula, you lived through that as well. It must have been a terrifying morning. What are officials saying about how and why this alert was sent? And what did it feel like just hearing that ring throughout the city?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Paula, here in Seoul we have heard the air-raid siren before when it has been preplanned and part of a nationwide drill. So certainly, in recent memory, it has not happened off the cuff in the early hours as it did around 6:30 a.m. this morning. So, there has been a fair bit of confusion here in Seoul. Now, we know there was the air-raid siren. 10 minutes later, there was a presidential text alert that went out telling people in Seoul to evacuate.
 
And then 20 minutes later, there was another alert that went out saying that it was all in error. So certainly, there are many questions being asked as to what exactly happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I thought it was an urgent situation. And soon it turned out to be false. So, I was very confused. Such an important issue must be delivered cautiously. But this time, it wasn't.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): At the moment, the Korean government seems to have a backward system on issues as warnings and disasters. So, it needs to be improved. But it seems it's not going well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: So, there are concerns of an erosion in trust in the Emergency Alert System. Certainly, for a country that's still technically at war with its northern neighbor. But to go back to the actual launch itself. This was expected. North Korea had said that it was going to try and put a military satellite into space sometime between May 31st and June 11th. They went for May 31st. But we know now that it was a failure. A rare admission of failure from Pyongyang itself. And it was a very quick admission of failure, saying that there was an error in the engine in its second stage, but they have said that they will try again as soon as possible. Paula?
 
NEWTON: Yes. As you said interesting that they immediately said that this did fail. Now, South Korea apparently has some of the debris on -- in its -- in its possession now. What more do they hope to learn about the North's mission? And crucially, its capabilities at this point?
 
HANCOCKS: Well, from those images, what they appear to have, they say at this point, it's presumed debris from this rocket. It seems to be fairly intact. Now, it's -- not for me to say what they could gain, what kind of knowledge they could gain from that. But certainly, they will be looking at it very closely to be able to try and ascertain exactly how far along this process the North Koreans are.
 
It's a process that Kim Jong-un the leader has consistently said he wants to have come to fruition. He wants to be able to have a military satellite in orbit. He has said that it is necessary because of the hostile activities of the U.S. It's unnecessary because of the U.S.- South Korean military drills. And so, they need to have this satellite in order to monitor and to track. It has been widely condemned.
 
The U.S., South Korea and Japan have all condemned it because even though Pyongyang considers this to be its right to have this satellite in space, the technology it is using to get it there is banned by the United Nations Security Council resolutions. And that's something that the U.S., South Korea and Japan have all consistently said both before the launch and today, now it has gone ahead.
 
So, whether or not it was a failure or a success, the technology has been banned. Paula?
 
NEWTON: And clearly North Korea's belligerence on that point has not changed. Paul Hancocks for us in Seoul. Really appreciate the update.
 
Joining me now from Canberra, Australia is Malcolm Davis. He is a senior analyst in defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. And good to see you on what was, you know, really some terrifying moments there in both South Korea and Japan. I want to take a look at the launch, though. First, what could the aim have been? And since it failed, there's still, as Paul was saying, right, a learning opportunity for North Korea even though it failed.
 
MALCOLM DAVIS, SENIOR ANALYST IN DEFENSE STRATEGY AND CAPABILITY, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Well, look, essentially, this is the first time that North Korea has essentially tried to launch one of these satellites in the -- and it's failed. The Chollima-1 rocket system that they use ever only had a malfunctioning second stage engine which didn't ignite properly.
 <br>[02:15:05]
 
And so, the launch went haywire and the rocket went into the ocean with the satellite. So, it did cause concern in South Korea and Japan because you simply don't know what the North Koreans are planning on doing. It could have easily been a ballistic missile test. And the concern would have been not so much that the North Koreans would have had a nuclear warhead, poured nuclear warhead on that missile.
 
But the debris from that missile could have actually landed in South Korea or Japan. So, I think that was why the alerts occurred.
 
NEWTON: Yes, absolutely. The real and present danger is to be certainly seen in those cities. They certainly understand what -- what's at stake here. What does it tell us, though, in terms of the progress or lack thereof that North Korea is making in its efforts specifically in space?
 
DAVIS: Look, it's interesting because on the one hand, a space launch vehicle utilizes the same technologies as a military ballistic missile that can carry a nuclear warhead. And the North Koreans have been testing ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads for some time now, including long-range ICBMs and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. All of which basically, are the same sorts of missiles or same sorts of rockets that basically would put a satellite into space.
 
The only difference is the launch trajectory for a satellite is different from a warhead. So, it does raise questions about either those tests for those ballistic missiles somehow not leading us to the correct perception of just how effective North Korea's ballistic missiles are. Or somehow, they're trying to do something different with their space launch capabilities from ballistic missiles.
 
So, it does raise some interesting questions about where North Korea's military capabilities are in terms of its long range, missile capabilities. Are they as effective as everyone is thinking they are? If they're not, then that does kind of change the dynamics in terms of how we perceive North Korea as a threat.
 
NEWTON: Understood. Now, they say they're going to try again if that does succeed, in terms of, you know, South Korea, Japan, the allies. What kind of a game changer would it be if they actually succeed?
 
DAVIS: Well, like if they put one satellite up, that's neither here nor there. Because the nature of the ontology of that satellite, how it orbits the Earth and how the Earth rotates underneath but would mean that it would only be over the Korean Peninsula area, once every few hours. What they would need to do, to have an effective space surveillance capability would -- to be -- would be to have a significant number of satellites in orbit, that could ensure what's known as a regular revisit capability over a particular area of interest.
 
So, we're probably talking 10 or 20 satellites they would need to put up in order to have continuous surveillance over the Korean peninsula and the surrounding oceans. They're a long way away from there.
 
NEWTON: Right. DAVIS: They can't even get one satellite up. So, I think that once they might try again with this -- the Chollima launch vehicle and put another satellite up. They have a long way to go before they are -- have a credible space base ISR capability in the orbit.
 
NEWTON: Well, that is really interesting perspective. And yet, before I let you go, you know, it was clear, many millions, in fact, were rattled by this. Do you think that it is incumbent on these countries to really at least sharpen their protocols for alerts? Because when I look at this, I think everyone thinks it's a false alarm. There is going to come a day, perhaps maybe not where it is not a false alarm. People need to heed those warnings.
 
DAVIS: Exactly. And I think as I said, the concern must have been that we simply don't know what was being launched out of North Korea. As I said, it's probably -- I don't think anyone was seriously expecting North Korea to launch an active nuclear warhead against Japan or South Korea. But you never could tell. And there could be one day in a crisis where we do have to worry about that sort of scenario.
 
And it's good to have a civil defense capability so that people can get undercover if there's a short-term threat coming their way. But I think in this particular instance, it was more about protecting people against falling debris than about the potential for an imminent nuclear attack.
 
NEWTON: Yes. Which is still threatening enough, right? In terms of understanding what the danger is. Malcolm Davis, thanks so much for parsing out with us. Appreciate it.
 
DAVIS: Thank you.
 
NEWTON: Officials in Davenport, Iowa have delayed demolishing what's left of an apartment building for fear there may still be people inside. I mean, think of that. Rescue workers managed to save a ninth person from the rubble late Monday, nearly two days after much of this century old building suddenly collapsed. Now on Tuesday, emergency workers searched for other survivors but found no signs of human activity.
 
The city's mayor says five people are still unaccounted for. Now officials are weighing when to actually demolish the damaged building before it poses a danger to anyone else.

Former U.S. First Lady Rosalynn Carter has been diagnosed with dementia. Now the development comes as her husband, former President Jimmy Carter was receiving hospice care at their home in Georgia. During her time in the White House, and in the years that followed, Mrs. Carter was a fierce advocate for mental health issues. Despite her diagnosis, her family says the 95-year-old lives happily at home with her husband. And we wish them both well.
 
Now, relations between the U.S. and China take another hits after a Chinese fighter jet and an American spy plane tangle over the South China Sea. The incident captured on video. You'll want to see it. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: Tensions between the U.S. and China are rising again after a Chinese fighter jet intercepted an American spy plane over the South China Sea. The U.S. military says China carried out an unnecessarily aggressive maneuver during the incident.
 
 Our Kristie Lu Stout is live for us in Hong Kong. You know, the -- this video is incredible. It was bold. It was a dangerous maneuver. Walk us through what happened and how Beijing is responding.
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Now the U.S. is accusing China of this risky encounter over the South China Sea and Beijing is pushing back. On Tuesday, the U.S. military said that this Chinese fighter jet carried out "an unnecessarily aggressive maneuver near U.S. military plane over the South China Sea in international waters. Now this incident took place last week on May the 26th.
 <br>[02:25:09]
 
And video of the encounter has been released. Let's bring it up for you. Now this video was filmed from the cockpit of a USRC-135 plane, a reconnaissance plane. It shows, you could see there, the Chinese J-16 against that clear blue sky moving from right to left and then it makes its move. It cuts in front of the US plane's nose and cockpit and the U.S. plane visibly shakes. That is a result of the wake turbulence that was caused by that maneuver.
 
Now, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said that the plane was conducting safe and routine operations at the time while adding this. Let's bring up the statement for you. "The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate safely and responsibly wherever international law allows. And the U.S. Indo-Pacific Joint Force will continue to fly in international airspace with due regard for the safety of all vessels and aircraft under international law.
 
Now, the spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington responded to the U.S. military statement saying this. "China urges us to stop such dangerous publications and stop deflecting blame on China." We're also waiting the daily Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing due to kick off in about half an hour from now for additional comment. Now, the encounter on May the 26th follows with the U.S. is called a recent trend of increasingly risky behavior by Chinese military aircraft.
 
It wasn't that long ago in December, a Chinese military plane came within three meters. That's 10 feet of U.S. military plane and forced that U.S. plane to take evasive maneuvers. Now this latest encounter, you're seeing it again on your screen, this comes as tensions continue to simmer between these two superpowers. The U.S. and China over a slew of issues including Taiwan, access to technology and of course, territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Paula?
 
NEWTON: And still not a consistent verified mode of communication between those two -- the defenses of those two countries. Kristie Lou -- STOUT: Especially at the highest level. You got it.
 
NEWTON: Exactly. And they continue to try and establish that. Kristie Lu stout for us. Thanks for the update from Hong Kong. Appreciate it.
 
STOUT: You got it.
 
NEWTON: Still ahead for us. Russia threatens to retaliate against Ukraine for drone strikes on Moscow but Kyiv denies direct involvement.
 <br>[02:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: Russia says a drone may have caused a fire at an oil refinery at Krasnodar region south of Ukraine. No casualties are reported, and the fire is apparently out now. And there are also several reports of a major strike on Russia's Belgorod region, and it comes the day after drones hit three residential buildings in Moscow causing minor damage. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls it a terrorist attack by Ukraine targeting civilians, Kyiv meantime is denying any direct responsibility.
 
We're going to go live now to London and CNN Claire Sebastian, it has to be noted that Vladimir Putin calls it a terrorist attack. That's exactly what Ukraine says Russia is doing too many towns and cities in Ukraine. You know, Russians now right, Clare are seeing this conflict as a real and present danger to them. Had there been more incidents reported inside Russia?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Paula, I mean, obviously, Moscow, to one side that was extremely unusual. The first time we've seen residential buildings and Moscow a hit. But we're seeing an increasing regularity of these kinds of incidents in the border regions. Just overnight, as you say, that in the Krasnodar region, which borders the Black Sea down in Russia's Southwestern area. There was an oil refinery where there was a fire according to the governor of that region, which has now been extinguished, possibly from a drone, they said that.
 
So, that is one thing we've seen an oil refinery in that region hit before clearly fuel is essential to Russia's ability to prosecute this war. War of logistics as the NATO Secretary General has called it. And up in the north, what the governor of Belgorod, that region that has really become the epicenter of these cross-border incidents. The governor calling it a massive strike, he said, it seems to have hit a residential area. Eight apartment buildings apparently damaged, four private houses, there's a school, two administer buildings, four people injured he said, including two hospitalized.
 
So, that seems to have been a pretty major incident there. It's ever happened about three in the morning in that region. So, this is something where, you know, the Ukrainians don't directly claim responsibility. But we know that Belgorod for example, was a key staging ground for Russian troops, when they launched the invasion has continued to be. And clearly Ukraine views, these border regions as a threat to presidential adviser saying on Tuesday, that any peace settlement with Russia should involve a demilitarized zone in those regions, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes, definitely some type of a buffer zone given the activity that's going on along that border. You know, as you've just mentioned, Ukraine is pretty coy about whether or not has anything to do with these attacks. But clearly cheers them on. and yet, it does seem clear that it's a level of escalation that not all the allies are comfortable with.
 
SEBASTIAN: It's a very delicate balance, Paula. As you know, when you see these donations of Western weapons, it often comes with a required assurance from Ukraine that they will not be used to attack Russian territory. This is a line that Ukraine's Western allies have been unwilling to cross to avoid the conflict escalating beyond Ukraine. Now, obviously, Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for those drone attacks on Moscow on Tuesday, nor are there any suggestion that Western weapons will use. But we still had the White House Press Secretary saying we do not support any attacks inside Russia, period. Although, I will say the U.K. Foreign Secretary had a slightly more nuanced approach. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAMES CLEVERLY, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: Ukraine does have the legitimate right to defend itself. It has the legitimate right to do so within its own borders, of course. But it does also have the right to project force beyond its borders to undermine Russia's ability to project force into Ukraine itself.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:35:04]
 
SEBASTIAN: So, clearly what happened on Tuesday was problematic for Russia, it's hard to explain to your citizens that this is a special military operation when they can see Joe (PH) drones shut down outside their windows in leafy Moscow suburbs. But also questions for Ukraine given that even though those drones were apparently shut down, it happened in residential areas in Moscow, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes, having lived in that neighborhood for almost four years, Clare, I can tell you the expectation is that it is secure and that those kinds of things out will be shot down. So, really interesting developments there. Clare Sebastian for us, thanks so much. Still to come, NATO is sending more peacekeeping forces to Kosovo after clashes with Serbian protesters.

NEWTON: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is telling conservative voters it's time we imposed our will in Washington. Now he's in Iowa on his first campaign tour as a presidential candidate and while he didn't call out Donald Trump by name. DeSantis says he'll accomplish more Republican goals than the former president did during his single term. CNN's. Jeff Zeleny gives us the latest.
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN NATIONAL CHIEF AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: A week after formally announcing his Republican presidential bid, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in Iowa making his first campaign appearance Tuesday night just outside Des Moines. The first of a three-state tour of early voting states going on to New Hampshire in South Carolina. But meeting with Republican voters he made the case that he is the Republican for this moment. He did not make a reference by name at least to former President Donald Trump. But there were thinly veiled messages in his speech.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Though, the point of all that is when we say that we will do something, it is not fluff. We follow through and we produce results. And so, as President, I pledge to be an energetic executive that will take these important issues head on and deliver results.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENY: So, even though, there were no direct references to former President Donald Trump, clearly, he is the one candidate who hangs over this race looms large in this field. But at this point, Governor DeSantis is doing something he has rarely done. He's holding press conferences, which he did Tuesday night here in Iowa. He's also meeting voters individually one on one trying to make the case that he is from a new generation, and he says he has the energy for this job. So, clearly some subtle distinctions there, there are more to come. Jeff Zeleny, CNN Clive Iowa.
 
NEWTON: More than 18,000 people in Nova Scotia have fled their homes, thus 13 wildfires spread through that Canadian province. Eight of those fires started on Monday as the region experiences record breaking heat. Now, more than a dozen schools will continue to be close Wednesday. The fires have destroyed or damaged hundreds of buildings and caused huge plumes of smoke to smother the area. Officials hope the weather will be on their side to help with the containment effort. And smoke from those wildfires in Nova Scotia is now impacting parts of the Northeast U.S. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the latest.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: So, this satellite picture from earlier today, when the sun was still up, you can see the haze on the picture here. The white down the south this is all just cloud cover, that's not smoke. But all of this up here that's a little bit grey and tint, that is the smoke that is coming from those Nova Scotia wildfires, from Halifax all the way down to the southern tip. And then, the smoke being blown back into the Northeast, especially Long Island, New York City even in the Philadelphia. And for tomorrow, we push this even farther inland across parts of New Jersey into Pennsylvania.
 
The areas that you see here in orange will be the thickest smoke, you may even be able to smell that smoke. So far this year, in Canada, 6.4 million acres of wildland have burned. On a normal year, if there is such a thing, an average year, about 12 times less than that should have burned by now. Now granted, most of the smoke that we're seeing in the Northeast is from Nova Scotia. And Nova Scotia is only a small percentage, maybe one or 2 percent of those total acres burned. But the high pressure that's centered right there will push that smoke right into the Northeast and that will be our forecast for the next few days. It will eventually get pushed out, but there will be hazy skies, there will be sunsets that are red, sunrises, same story.
 
And there will be dots on our map that are orange, which means unhealthy for sensitive groups, and you may need to stay inside. Keep your local forecast handy where this smoke is going to go, where it's going to blow maybe down into a valley could even get more concentrated. There will be some rain though, not a lot yet until Sunday. But there is rain in the forecast here in Nova Scotia. Probably, a half inch calling for somewhere in the ballpark of about 10 millimeters which doesn't seem like very much. But if you just get those forests that aren't burning, a little damp, all of a sudden, the fire spread is much slower.

A 911 operator also testified about receiving a frantic call from 84- year-old Bernice Simon. She and her 86-year-old husband Sylvan were both killed. An 11-year-old Mississippi boy, who called 911 only to have the police officer shoot him in the chest is speaking now about his frightening ordeal. Aderrien Murry was hospitalized earlier this month with multiple serious gunshot injuries. The officer who shot him was responding to a domestic disturbance called the boy's home. CNN's Nick Valencia travelled to Mississippi to speak with him.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): As he laid in his mother's arms bleeding out from a gunshot wound, 11-year-old Aderrien Murry was so convinced he was going to die. He began to pray to God and sing gospel songs.
 
ADERRIEN MURRY, 11-YEAR-OLD SHOT BY POLICE: Hurting me like, I'm going to die. Tell my whole family, to my teacher, I say -- I say I'm sorry for what I did. 
 
VALENCIA (voiceover): On May 20th, Aderrien's mom told him to call 911 for help, after the father of one of her other children showed up at their Mississippi home at four in the morning. Nakala Murry said when the Indianola Police responded, she opened the door to an officer who already had his gun drawn. 
 
MURRY: He said, everybody come out with your hands up. I -- then I came on the -- inside the living room. And then I remember, I heard the big bang. And I just remember holding my chest.
 
VALENCIA (voiceover): Indianola Police say the officer was Sergeant Greg Capers. Murry says he shot Aderrien once in the chest, seriously injuring the boy. CNN has made repeated attempts to get comment from Capers, but he has not responded. Aderrien's mother says he developed a collapsed lung and suffered fractured ribs and a lacerated liver due to the gunshot wound. He spent days in the ICU at the University of Mississippi Medical Centre in Jackson needing a ventilator to breathe.
 
MURRY: It came, right here.
 
VALENCIA (voiceover): More than a week since the shooting, he is remarkably in good spirits. But says, sometimes when he's alone with his thoughts for too long, he has nightmares. 
 
MURRY: Sometimes, I can see myself laying inside the coffin. Some of my thoughts and I my only was -- as sometimes I think, people are watching me. But my main thought is me.
 
NAKALA MURRY, ADERRIEN'S MOTHER: I'm so overfilled with joy to hear my child, they -- I don't have time to be angry. I trust in the law that they will make the right decision. You know, my main concern is my son right now.
 
VALENCIA (voiceover): The Murry family and their attorney Carlos Moore have filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Indianola. Its police chief and several officers including Capers. They're seeking $5 million in damages. CARLOS MOORE, MURRY FAMILY ATTORNEY: That anyone who's ever been a victim of excessive force deserves to be compensated is Aderrien Murry. He trusts the police; he called the police to come to the aid of his mother and he turned around and got shot by the cop he called to rescue them.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If that officer was here sitting right here across from you. What would you want to tell him Aderrien?
 
MURRY: Why did you do it? How could I lose my life, how could you? I want you terminated for what you did to me.

VALENCIA (on camera): Sergeant Greg Capers remains on paid administrative leave. Meanwhile, there was body cam footage of this incident and that's in the possession of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. They tell me that they're not going to release this footage until their investigation is complete. Incidentally, earlier the Indianola Board of Aldermen convened a special meeting to talk about the body cam footage, that was in Executive Session. 
 
No action was taken but the mayor does tell me that he does not support the firing of Sergeant Greg Capers because right now, he says, he simply doesn't have all the facts which include watching the body cam footage for the first time. Aderrien, the 11-year-old who was shot in the chest by police. He's been very clear; he wants Capers fired. This shooting has forever changed his life. Prior to the shooting, he wanted to be a police officer, but now tells me he's too scared to be a police officer. He's too scared of them. Instead, now, he wants to be a doctor because he credits them in part for helping save his life. Nick Valencia, CNN, Indianola, Mississippi.
