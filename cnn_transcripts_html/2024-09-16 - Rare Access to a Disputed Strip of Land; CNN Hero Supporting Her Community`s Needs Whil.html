COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Happy Monday. I`m Coy Wire. Welcome to CNN 10, bringing you some of the top stories of the day in 10 
 
 minutes. I hope you had an outstanding weekend. We`ve got lots to get to, so let`s get started.
 
First, in the Middle East, where CNN got a rare and limited look at a disputed strip of land that links Gaza and Egypt, the Philadelphi Corridor. 
 
 Israeli defense forces currently control the 14-kilometer strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt. And it`s been a major sticking 
 
 point in ceasefire talks.
 
Negotiators have been working to reach a deal to end the 11-month-long Israel-Hamas war, which started following the October 7 attacks in Israel 
 
 by Hamas last year. Officials say negotiations are about 90% complete, but who ends up controlling what areas and the exchange of Palestinian 
 
 prisoners of Israeli hostages are disputes that are holding up an agreement. And it`s not clear when in-person negotiations will resume 
 
 between both parties.
 
Aid for Gaza would be a big part of that deal once it is reached. Hundreds of aid trucks a day would be allowed into the enclave, including fuel, 
 
 equipment to clear rubble, and supplies for displaced Gazans who would all be part of the first phase of the agreement. 
 
CNN`s Chief Global Affairs Correspondent, Matthew Chance, was on the ground there while CNN reported from Gaza under Israeli Defense Forces escort at 
 
 all times. CNN retained full editorial control over this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we`re being taken by the Israeli military into the Gaza Strip, and they`ve loaded us 
 
 all, as you can see, into this metal sided truck. We`re going into the south bit of the Gaza Strip, which the Israeli military say they have under 
 
 full operational control, but it`s not entirely secure. They brought us to this place called the Philadelphi Corridor. It`s emerged as a sticking 
 
 point in the negotiations to get a ceasefire and to get the hostages released.
 
As you can see, it`s right up against the Egyptian border. And it`s important, because the Israelis say this is an area which has been used 
 
 over the years as a way of smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip. Some of the smuggling has taken place over land, through, presumably, holes in the 
 
 fence and through other border crossings. But a lot of it has been taking place right under our feet.
 
OK. Well, this is one of those tunnels. It`s right on the border with Egypt. And you can see it is absolutely huge, wide enough to drive a car 
 
 right, right the way through it. The Israeli military say that this tunnel, because it`s so close to the Egyptian frontier, has been used by Hamas and 
 
 other militants to store weapons in and to fire rockets from.
 
You see here the -- the back of the wall, it`s completely collapsed down. Apparently it was closed for some time now. We`re driving now through the 
 
 neighborhood of Tal as Sultan. Every one of the buildings here has been totally destroyed. You know, this was obviously a residential area with 
 
 many people living in it. And the Israeli military say those people have moved, for the most part, to safe zones, humanitarian areas not far from 
 
 here, but look what they have left behind. Look what has happened to Gaza.
 
Thank you. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari is the Chief Spokesperson for the Israeli military. How can you justify causing so much, you know, damage, 
 
 devastation, destruction in -- in -- in pursuit of your objectives?
 
REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON: The only reason is because Hamas has built his military capabilities in that way that there is no 
 
 other possibility. There is -- there is a town underneath Rafah. If you don`t demolish it, then Hamas will go back and have a stronghold, a 
 
 military stronghold. He is using the population, embedding in the population. He is creating this destruction and also the death of the 
 
 population.
 
CHANCE: Well, this has been a very tightly controlled bit of access into Gaza with the Israeli military. There`s such a lot we haven`t been able to 
 
 see, but it`s incredible. They`ve showed us what they have. It`s definitely a -- a narrow view. But it is also the only view right now that we can get 
 
 first hand.

WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. What important metal is the state of Arizona known for producing? 
 
Gold, silver, copper or aluminum? 
 
And copper is your answer here. Arizona has been the nation`s leading producer of copper since the early 1900s. Sometimes it`s the little things 
 
 that can make the biggest difference. And today`s CNN hero is changing lives by helping provide basic needs for her community.
 
Her experience as a foster parent and adoptive mother inspired her to fill in the gaps and provide resources for Native American youth and their 
 
 families, while also keeping them connected to their cultural and historical roots.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELISIA MANUEL, CNN HERO:  I`ve always wanted to be a mom. My husband, he`s wanted to be a dad. I put it in prayer and God said, I`m going to bless you 
 
 a different way.
 
We became licensed foster parents over 11 years ago. When I tell people I was abundantly blessed within six months, I became a mom to four children 
 
 that were all under the age of two years old. When the case manager said, you have 48 hours and we need this car seat back, I`m like, what?
 
So that`s where I kind of knew where the gap was and we needed to make a change and needed to figure out resources. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So what`s the deal here? 
 
MANUEL:  So today, you can just come and get whatever you want.
 
I started out just providing basic resources, clothes and shoes and diapers. I would tell my family, like, don`t throw away your stuff. There`s 
 
 people that need it. Let`s wash it and clean it. 
 
This is my mad chaos is what I call it. This is our space to put all of our goodies. 
 
Usually we get a request for like clothing or diapers. And if we have the stuff, we`ll give it to you. There`s such a huge need. 
 
Arizona has over 10,000 children in foster care. Reports show that about 10% of that population is Native American. Those numbers don`t reflect the 
 
 massive amount that we have.
 
There`s thousands of Native children that are in care and could be connected to culture. And I thought we really should be doing more.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When I was like four years old and I got moved out of my house, most of my connections that I might have had to my past were kind 
 
 of severed. When I was adopted to my mom`s house, she made the extra step to make sure that I was connected back to my roots. 
 
It`s a surreal experience. It`s just like that feeling like deja vu at like a powwow. There`s a lot of kids that are kind of in my similar situation. I 
 
 don`t know if they`re like foster or adopted, but I know they`re struggling to find themselves.
 
It helps them. That inspires me to find out as much as I can about who I am as a person, what I can do for my community.

WIRE:  All right, we will get through today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 swiftly. Maybe. That Maryland corn maze has designs Taylor Swift fans know 
 
 all too well.
 
A 300-foot guitar, 1989 heart hands, something from their wildest dreams and it`s huge. Ready for it. Eight acres and barely a blank space in sight.
 
Amazing. The gift store has a swifty section of the whole experience comes complete with Taylor Swift songs on the playlist, a phone game and Taylor 
 
 Swift themed drinks and snacks. If any swifty had a cruel summer, this place would probably help them shake it off as we head into the fall.
 
Our shout out today is going to West Lauderdale Middle School in Meridian, Mississippi. Fun fact, we all know Mississippi is super fun to spell, but 
 
 also did you know that it is the second longest river in North America, just short of the Missouri river, which is the longest.
 
Make it a great Monday, everyone. Thanks for joining us right here on CNN 10. We will see you tomorrow.
