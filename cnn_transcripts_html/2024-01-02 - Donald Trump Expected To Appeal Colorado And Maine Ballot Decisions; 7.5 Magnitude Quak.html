ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church.
 
Just ahead, the court filing expected today by team Trump and what it could mean for his 2024 campaign with the Iowa caucuses now just two weeks away. 
 
In Israel, the Supreme Court delivers an unprecedented ruling that could have major implications for the war in Gaza. 
 
Plus, need to get away from it all? Well, we'll take you off the beaten path with CNN's list of where to travel in 2024.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, This is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Good have you with us. Well, Donald Trump could be just hours away from formally challenging decisions to ban him from primary ballots in two states, Colorado and Maine. A source says an appeal from his legal team is expected on Tuesday. Anti-Trump challenges succeeded at using the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban to remove Trump from ballots, though those decisions have been paused pending potential appeals. 
 
But challenges in several other states were rejected. And now Oregon's Supreme Court will decide whether to ban the former U.S. president from the ballot there over his alleged role in the January 6th insurrection. 
 
Colorado's Secretary of State spoke about the case.

JENA GRISWOLD, COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's important to note that we are only here because Donald Trump incited the insurrection. He has created the situation for himself. There is clear language in the Constitution in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment for this exact situation. I believe he is a threat to democracy, the right to vote in the future stability of this nation.

CHURCH: Tuesday's expected appeals are coming at the start of a busy month for Trump which includes closing arguments in the New York civil fraud trial and the start of the presidential primary season. 
 
The first test of this year's presidential election comes in less than two weeks, the Iowa caucuses. Trump has maintained a consistent lead in the polls there despite his legal troubles, but rivals Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are hoping for a strong showing. 
 
CNN's Kristen Holmes reports from Washington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is officially that final sprint to Iowa, we're looking at two weeks and the candidates are going to all be on the ground, or at least most of them trying to scoop up every last minute voter that they can, talk to any kind of Iowan who might be on the fence. And really going into it. 
 
When you look at the poll numbers, you still see that Donald Trump according to these polls, has a very substantial lead. He is the front runner and their goal is to keep that margin really high between him and whoever the second place person is.
 
Now, the polls show that that would be Ron DeSantis right now. And after that Nikki Haley. Now, think about Ron DeSantis is that Iowa is critical to the Florida governor. He has made this essentially his make or break moment, put all of his cards or all of his eggs in the Iowa basket and he's really focused on that. 
 
However, we have seen some substantial rise in the polls from Nikki Haley, but still looks as though that would be the order. 
 
Now, whatever happens in Iowa is really going to set the tone for the rest of the primary and caucus season. 
 
Right now, Donald Trump is leading in most states, but there is a part where there are several Republican operatives who believe that if Donald Trump is slowdown in Iowa, if that margin is not as big as those polls show, it's possible that someone else could take the lead. We could see someone else surge.
 
But right now, it's just still very early, and the big focus still remains on Iowa on the Hawkeye State. 
 
Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington.

CHURCH: Joining me now from Los Angeles is Ron Brownstein, CNN's senior political analyst and senior editor at The Atlantic. Happy New Year. Great to have you with us.
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Happy 2024, what a year. 
 
CHURCH: Indeed, indeed.
 
So, Donald Trump looks set to formally challenge efforts to ban him from primary ballots in Colorado and Maine. How likely is it that his legal team will win their expected appeals today? And what's been the political fallout from all of this?
 <br>[02:05:11]
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes, well, you know, the Colorado State Supreme Court, the Missouri, the Maine Secretary of State, I think both of them make strong arguments that Donald Trump's behavior not only on January 6 itself, but in the entire period after the 2020 election fits within the definition of what the post-Civil War U.S. Congress had in mind when they drafted the 14th Amendment and the ban on insurrection is serving in high office. 
 
Having said that, having watched this court for decades, and particularly the way it's ruled on issues relating to the political system, it is Rosemary, hard to imagine that a court dominated by six Republican appointed Supreme Court justices would throw off from the ballot, bar from the ballot, the front runner for the GOP nomination. 
 
The real question for me, I think, is whether you know, John Roberts, the chief justice in the U.S. has had a concern over the years about this court being seen as overtly partisan, as a player in the increasingly polarized struggle between the parties. 
 
And to me, the question is if in fact they decide to put Trump on the ballot, overturn the state decisions, does that make them more likely at the same time to also deny his claim of absolute immunity and say that voters if he is going to be on the ballot deserve to know whether a jury of his peers have found him guilty of the serious crimes of which he has been accused.
 
CHURCH: And Ron, this effort to ban Trump from primary ballots. So, by using the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban appears to have backfired instead emboldening the former president, just as he benefited from his legal woes. So, what exactly have his critics achieved by mounting this effort to remove him from primary ballots?
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, it's certainly -- you know, every effort to hold Trump accountable for his behavior after 2020 has strengthened him in the context of a Republican primary. But I think it's a very open question, whether in fact, it is strengthening him for the general election. 
 
First of all, these judgments do remind voters about what he did after the 2020 election, which the recollection of which can grow hazy. 
 
And I think that also, as I said, I mean, the question will be, does this influence the Supreme Court's decision making? 
 
I mean, John Roberts and his concerns about way -- the way the court is seen, it is certainly ruled on big questions like Shelby County in 2013. And the decisions on redistricting is ruled in ways that benefit the Republican Party. 
 
But nonetheless, he has been reluctant to be seen as totally kind of in that camp and has often tried to balance the books and their decisions. And if all of -- if the outcome of all of these state actions is to create more space for the Supreme Court, what I think most legal scholars would say, reached the correct and more important decision that a president is not uniformly immune from prosecution, they will certainly have an impact in that regard as well.
 
CHURCH: And Ron, all of this comes as Trump enjoys a massive lead over his rivals in the GOP race for the White House, meaning he's heavily favored to win the first big test, the Iowa caucuses just two weeks away. 
 
So, who will likely come second in Iowa? And does it even matter at this juncture, given how far ahead he is?
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes, look, I mean, it is a real uphill climb for anyone to beat him. As you know, as analysts have pointed out, no one has ever had the kind of lead that Trump now has in national polling, and then gone on to lose the primary. 
 
You know, Ron DeSantis is probably in the strongest position to come in second in Iowa, as Kristen noted. I mean, he has put all his chips on Iowa. He's visited all counties, he's focused on according evangelicals and mobilizing support in that community, which is very powerful in Iowa.
 
But he, like many other social conservative candidates who did well in Iowa is polling poorly in New Hampshire. And I think it is likely that Nikki Haley is going to do better in New Hampshire than DeSantis thus in Iowa, even if Trump is still likely to win both.
 
And I think the most probable outcome is that after Iowa and New Hampshire on January, the night of January 23rd, Hayley will have eclipsed DeSantis as the most like -- as most plausible alternative to Trump and then she will have a month to make her case in her home state of South Carolina, which historically has been the pivotal contest in a Republican primary.
 
Trump remains a heavy favorite there and if he wins there, he will probably effectively end the race at that point. 
 <br>[02:10:03] But if she does well enough in New Hampshire, she will at least have a chance to go into South Carolina and see if she can slow down Donald Trump over those next four weeks.
 
CHURCH: All right, our thanks to Ron Brownstein and again, Happy New Year. Appreciate it. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Happy New Year to you.
 
CHURCH: Well, now to Busan, South Korea where the leader of the main opposition party has been stabbed in the neck with a knife we are told. Lee Jae-myung is hospitalized but conscious.
 
A warning, we are about to show images of the attack that you may find disturbing.
 
A Democratic Party spokesperson says Lee sustained a laceration wound of about a centimeter with suspected damage to his jugular vein. He is reportedly being brought to a Seoul hospital for surgery. 
 
Police have yet to release any information about whether the attack was politically motivated. We're hearing the suspect is in his 60s. 
 
We're now to Japan where rescuers are racing to reach survivors trapped under the rubble after a major earthquake hit the country's west coast on New Year's Day. 
 
Authorities in Ishikawa Prefecture say the death toll has now risen to 30. The region was the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake, which hit near the Noto Peninsula Monday afternoon.
 
Japan's Prime Minister says access to the northern part of Noto Peninsula is extremely difficult because the main road into the area is destroyed. The U.S. Geological Survey has recorded more than 35 aftershocks, and warns they could continue for days or even months. 
 
Public broadcaster NHK reports more than 100 homes and shops have burned down after a large fire broke out in the city of Wajima. Tens of thousands of people are still without power while thousands are sheltering in evacuation centers. Authorities are urging residents to follow official orders.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOSHIMASA HAYASHI, JAPANESE CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY (through translator): I humbly ask that all citizens be cautious of the risk of further earthquakes up to Shindo 7 and requested everyone living in the area where powerful tremors took place, pay close attention to the local authorities evacuation orders, as well as information on the television, radio and online.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Let's bring in journalist Manisha Tank who joins us live from Singapore. So, Manisha, what is the latest on the aftermath of Monday's deadly earthquake? MANISHA TANK, JOURNALIST: Well, gradually, Rosemary, local authorities and rescue teams are beginning to get to all the incidents that have been reported. 
 
You mentioned that the quake happened in the afternoon. But then you had overnight a number of reports coming in and as morning came to Japan, to that part of Japan, we began to see the extent of the damage. 
 
Now the race against time that you mentioned is very much where those collapsed buildings are concerned. In fact, this was mentioned after the disaster emergency meeting that the prime minister was party to in the morning in Japan. And we're now getting into late afternoon, early evening. 
 
Prime Minister Kishida saying that rescue efforts are a battle against time, especially the victims of collapsed buildings, they have to be saved as soon as possible. 
 
But one of the problems is that roads that have been destroyed are hampering efforts by rescue services to actually get to the affected areas. So, that's something that they're hoping to rectify, they're having to get and use any means possible really to get to those who need to be rescued. 
 
Japan's Fire Department has also said that has been responding to all of these reports of those people trapped. 
 
But you mentioned that there are many (AUDIO GAP) than 30,000 people who are sheltering at the moment. And that's partly because obviously, some of the buildings will have been compromised, you will be -- there'll be worried about their structural integrity as aftershocks continued. 
 
The U.S. Geological Survey say that those aftershocks may go on for days, weeks, even months, but they have reported -- they've recorded 35 in the last 24 hours around the epicenter, so that's something else to worry about. 
 
Rosemary, you mentioned that there have been power outages, more than 45,000 homes reported without power. This is a cold time of year. It's an area of the world that is in the northern hemisphere. In fact, a little bit further north in places like Nagano Prefecture, people from this region travel for the snow, for skiing opportunities further north in Hokkaido. 
 
So, you can imagine temperatures are ranging pretty low if you are concerned about your buildings and their structural integrity or concerned about the cold. It is a difficult time to be without power and there are no indications yet as to when all of that power will come back. 
 <br>[02:15:07]
 
So, still a lot of work to be done. And a short questions, lessons that might need to be learned from those buildings that did collapse and why they did. Japan of course is not unfamiliar with earthquakes and often the engineering around many buildings is designed as such, so there will be lots of investigation I'm sure and questions to be asked in the wake of this.
 
But in the meantime, we hope that that death toll does not continue to rise. But the warning will be from local authorities that as they send in rescue teams, we must be prepared, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: All right, Manisha Tank joining us live from Singapore, many thanks.
 
And still to come, an unprecedented ruling from Israel's Supreme Court that could have major implications for the war in Gaza. 
 
Plus, Russia's Vladimir Putin is bound to intensify attacks on Ukraine this year. And already, Kyiv is being bombarded by waves of missiles. We will bring you the latest on the war, that's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: A ruling by Israel Supreme Court on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul could have major implications for the war in Gaza. The court has struck down an amendment to the so called reasonableness law which strip the judiciary have its power to declare government decisions unreasonable. 
 <br>[02:20:16]
 
The reform sparked months of nationwide protests and the court's decision could threaten the unity of Israel's war cabinet, which includes two prominent critics of the plan. 
 
Meanwhile, the Israeli military says it will start pulling thousands of troops from Gaza this week in preparation for a new phase of the conflict. 
 
A senior U.S. official says the move shows signs of Israel's gradual shift to a lower intensity military campaign. There's also news for people who were evacuated from their homes near the Israel Gaza border.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): In accordance with the recommendations given by the IDF and the defense establishment, we will soon be able to return communities home in areas within a range of four to seven kilometers north of the Gaza Strip.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: More now on the Israeli Supreme Court decision and the implications for the war against Hamas from Elliott Gotkine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: The Supreme Court's eight to seven ruling to strike down the one part of the government's judicial overhaul that it managed to get passed was unprecedented. The Supreme Court has never previously struck down a basic law or an amendment to a basic law. These are the closest things that Israel has to a constitution. So that was unprecedented. 
 
It's also a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who made this judicial overhaul almost like a flagship policy of his, withstanding months and months of protests, sometimes tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets, protesting against his judicial overhaul plans, because they said it would do irreparable damage to Israel's democratic character. 
 
Indeed, in justifying its ruling, the Supreme Court said that it did say because of the severe and unprecedented blow to the core characteristic of Israel as a democratic state. 
 
And of course, the other major implication is that this ruling threatens to reopen these very deep and severe divisions that the government's judicial overhaul plans sowed throughout Israeli society.
 
Now, those divisions seem like a lifetime away now that Israel is fighting this war with Hamas after the militant groups terrorist attacks of October the seventh, but there are concerns that it could reopen these divisions, and that it may be even has the potential to split the government of national unity that was formed as a result of this war. 
 
We have heard from the Justice Minister Yariv Levin assailing the court for the timing of its ruling, even though it wasn't in the courts gift to decide on when it had to make this ruling. 
 
We've heard from National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, one of the most right wing members of the governing coalition saying that this decision by the Supreme Court was illegal. But we've got Benny Gantz, who's now a member of the war cabinet, saying that this verdict must be respected. And Israel must remember, internalize the kind of divisions that it saw in the run up to October the seventh and remember that Israelis are brothers, and that they have a shared destiny. 
 
Elliott Gotkine, CNN, Tel Aviv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: Ukraine says waves of Russian ballistic missiles are headed towards Kyiv. Right now, an air raid alert is active across the city and other parts of the country. And the mayor is urging people to take shelter after several people were reportedly injured from the attacks. 
 
And this comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to intensify strikes on Ukraine in the New Year. 
 
Clare Sebastian joins me now from London. So, Clare, with President Putin vowing to increase strikes on Ukrainian military targets and elsewhere, what will this mean for the war torn nation, given additional support from the U.S. has stalled right now?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Rosemary, that is the key point. I think Russia is trying to send a very clear message both in actions and we see it with this what appears to be ongoing missile attack happening as we speak one of a number that have taken place over the last few days, and in words, with President Putin's comments on Monday that it is willing and able to exploit the gaps in Ukraine's arsenal specifically, in this case, its air defenses and also to exploit the hesitation really, that we've seen from the U.S., which is Ukraine's biggest backer, that is what we're seeing at the moment. 
 
I think, look, in words, Putin spelled it out really clearly in that meeting that he held on Monday, the first of two that he held with Russian servicemen who had taken part in what he still calls the special military operation, take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:25:07]
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): For our part, we're going to intensify the strikes. Of course, no crime against civilians will rest unpunished. That's for certain.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: And if you were in any doubt that Russia is laser focused on Ukraine's Western allies, and in particular the U.S., Putin said in that same meeting, he said the West is not helping our enemy. They are our enemy. And he went on to detail, essentially production numbers of artillery shells, he talked about how many Ukraine are firing versus how many the U.S. can produce in a month.
 
And he said, look, the exhaustion of those supplies will come about quickly. And right now, it's coming about. So, Russia is watching and waiting. 
 
And meanwhile, Ukraine's frustration is growing. President Zelenskyy gave an interview to The Economist which was published on Monday where he said that he sees absolutely no sign that Russia is looking to move towards any kind of peace. I want to read you a quote from that interview. He said, Putin feels weakness, like an animal. Because he is an animal. He said, he senses blood, he senses his strength and he will eat you for dinner with all your E.U., NATO, freedom and democracy.
 
A warning from President Zelenskyy as he has warned many times before that President Putin and Russia will not stop at Ukraine unless Ukraine gets more help from the west.
 
And President Putin meanwhile, also not in the mood for backing down, made it very clear in his New Year's address, he said, we will never back down. So, this is the stage we are at the moment, Ukraine laser focus now on two things. One, defending their cities and two, trying to hit the threat before it hits them. Essentially focusing on hitting weapons supplies, things like warships in the Black Sea and Crimea President Zelenskyy said in that interview would be a key focus going forward.
 
CHURCH: All right, our thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London. 
 
Time for a short break. When we come back, U.S. President Joe Biden prepares for the final campaign of his career. But a host of domestic and international challenges could stand in his way. 
 
Plus, in the New Years, several state and federal laws have officially gone into effect. We will take a look at some of them. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:31:05]
 
CHURCH: Welcome back everyone. U.S. President Joe Biden has some busy months ahead of him in addition to the war in Gaza. He is hoping to get more aid approved for Ukraine and address the immigration crisis of the U.S. southern border. More now from CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz.
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden returns to Washington on Tuesday with a full plate of domestic and foreign policy issues in a year where he is also trying to convince American voters to give him a second term in the White House. Now, the Israel- Hamas conflict dominated so much of the president's attention in the closing months of 2023, and 2024 will be no different.
 
White House officials are closely watching the coming weeks to see whether Israel actually transitions to a lower intensity phase of fighting. That is something that the U.S. has encouraged Israel to do in recent weeks. And a senior U.S. official said that they believe that they were starting to see the beginning of that strategy, that tactic, when Israel on Monday, announced that they would be withdrawing some of their troops from Gaza as Israel is preparing for a prolonged fight, heading into 2024.
 
Now, Secretary of state Antony Blinken will be traveling to Israel later in the week as he is expected to start talking about that next phase in fighting with officials on the ground there. But there's also a host of domestic issues that Biden needs to tackle once he is back in Washington. That includes the border crisis as there has been a recent surge in migrants on the southern border, really adding additional stresses to an already strained system. Congressional negotiators have yet to settle on a deal regarding border policy changes, even as President Biden has said that he is willing to make some concessions.
 
There is also big questions about whether the White House will be able to push through additional aid for Ukraine, as that debate is currently locked in the fight over those potential border policy changes. The White House, of course, has warned of what inaction could mean for Ukraine on the battlefield. And then, there is two major government funding fights looming. In just the next five weeks, there are two deadlines that Congress will need to reach to try to pass additional funding to prevent a government shutdown. Of course, all of this is playing out against the backdrop of the 2024 election. President Biden really has not been doing his day-to-day campaigning, but that is expected to change in the early months of 2024. He is also expected to ramp up his attacks on Former President Donald Trump, as his campaign believes that he will eventually become the Republican nominee. Of course, President Biden has been trailing Trump in some recent polling, and the president has much more work to do in trying to keep his coalition together, even as there have been some strains among some groups that have supported him.
 
So, the president coming back to Washington, tackling a huge plate of issues, as he is heading closer to that 2024 election in November.
 
Arlette Saenz, CNN, Washington.
 
CHURCH: Gender-affirming care bans and minimum wage increases are just a couple of the new laws that went into effect on the first day of 2024. CNN's Rafael Romo has details.
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We have been tracking some of the most controversial laws that went into effect with the arrival of the New Year, especially as the country gets more polarized on issues like abortion. There are several near, total bans in Republican-led states that took effect in 2023. And now, many blue states have passed laws protecting abortion rights, including two that took effect January 1st.
 
When it comes to abortion, the State of Washington's is not getting a law with a goal of making the procedure more accessible with changes to insurance coverage. Any health insurance plan issued or renewed starting January 1st will be prohibited from requiring cost sharing for abortions, which generally includes out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and co-pays. 
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
Meanwhile, a shield law took effect in California on Monday that would protect local health care providers from out-of-state litigation if they provide abortion services to patients in states with restrictive abortion laws. The protection also extends to those who provide gender-affirming care to out-of-state patients. Another new law getting a lot of attention is California's ban on carrying concealed firearms in sensitive places. This is despite a federal judge's prior ruling that the law is, "repugnant to the Second Amendment".
 
Under the new law, people with permits would not be allowed to carry concealed firearms in places like schools, parks, and hospitals, among others. A federal appeals court will allow the law to go into effect for now, while the court case continues. There is also a new law in California that is generating a lot of controversy, and this is because this new law requires toy retailers to have gender-neutral toy aisles.
 
The law that went into effect on Monday stems from a bill that passed the California legislature in 2021, that requires toy retailers with physical locations in the state and at least 500 employees to maintain a gender-neutral section or area to be labeled at the discretion of the retailer. According to the law, stores that fail to comply will face a $250 penalty for the first violation, and up to $500 for subsequent infractions.
 
Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.
 
CHURCH: Police and the FBI are investigating a deadly car crash in New York that killed at least two people and injured five others. It happened early Monday outside a concert venue. The collision was so powerful, it launched both vehicles through pedestrians crossing the street. It took firefighters nearly an hour to put out the flames from the resulting fire. A bomb squad and arson task force were also called to the scene after at least a dozen gas canisters were found near one of the vehicles.
 
A Chinese foreign exchange student has been found safe in the frigid Utah Mountains, after police say he became a victim of cyber kidnapping. Neither the student nor his parents in China apparently met the kidnappers, they just dealt with them over the phone. 17-year- old Kai Zhuang was found by police while trying to camp after the so- called kidnappers apparently told him to isolate himself. Police say the boy's parents transferred at least $80,000 into Chinese bank accounts after getting continuous threats. They also warned cyber kidnapping is a growing trend, often targeting foreign exchange students.
 
If traveling is one of your new year's resolutions, CNN has put together a list of the best places to visit in 2024. That is just ahead, we will take a look.

CHURCH: The names of dozens of victims and associates of Jeffrey Epstein could be released as soon as today. The New York-based financier was indicted in 2019 on federal charges of running a sex trafficking ring. He died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. It is important to note that inclusion on the list does not mean that person has committed any crime. Epstein's longtime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted on sex trafficking charges in 2021.
 
Well, in the hours ahead, Spanish football star Jennifer Hermoso is scheduled to testify against the former Spanish Football Federation Chief Luis Rubiales over the unwanted kiss he gave her last August after Spain won the Women's World Cup. Hermoso is expected to speak during a closed-door sexual assault hearing that's part of the investigation. FIFA has banned Rubiales from all football-related activities for three years, a ruling he has vowed to appeal.
 
He has described the case as mutual. Hermoso denied that, saying she did not consent and was not respected. She said in November that she has received threats over her stance.
 
The Queen of Denmark has announced a surprise abdication after 52 years on the throne. Her son will take over as king about two weeks from now. Max Foster has more, including how the new king's wife will become the world's first Australian-born queen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A new year, a new era for Denmark and for one of the world's oldest monarchies. Queen Margrethe II will end her reign of more than half a century, a shocking decision delivered in a live address to the Danish people on New Year's Eve.
 
MARGRETHE II, QUEEN OF DENMARK (through translator): I have decided that now is the right time. On the 14th of January, 2024, 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father, I will step down as Queen of Denmark.
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Denmark's ruler became Europe's longest reigning monarch after the death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2022. Queen Margrethe put the decision down to her fragile health. Recent surgeries on her back have limited her royal duties.
 
MARGRETHE II (through translator): The time takes its toll and the number of ailments increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past.
 
FOSTER (voice-over): That sense of duty won the hearts of the Danish people and drew comparisons to Queen Elizabeth, to whom Margrethe looked to for some inspiration. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was quick to praise the only monarch that many Danes will ever have known. 
 
"On behalf of the entire population, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to her majesty, the queen, for her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the kingdom," Frederiksen wrote in a statement.
 
Like other constitutional monarchies, the Danish sovereign stays above politics, but feathers can be ruffled. In 2022, the Queen removed the titles of prince and princess from the children of her second son, Prince Joachim. It was an effort to reduce the royal establishment and allow her grandkids more privacy.
 
But, Prince Joachim went a public with his four children's hurt feelings and Queen Margrethe later apologized, but did not change her decision.
 <br>[02:45:00]
 
MARGRETHE II: There is no more pressure on the young people of today than there was when I was a child.
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Margrethe's decision to abdicate faces the weight of the crown upon her eldest son's head, Prince Frederik, a man equally faithful to the crown, but with a slightly more reserved public persona. Frederik will rule alongside his Australian-born wife, Princess Mary. The royal couple met at a bar in Sydney during the 2000 Olympics. Mary Donaldson, a marketing executive from Tasmania, swept into a fairytale. MARGRETHE II: I really like her very much indeed and I hope that she knows that and feels that.

CHURCH: CNN's list of the best places to travel in the New Year is out now. From beautiful islands that breathtaking national parks, it includes destinations that are still largely undiscovered or frequently overlooked. That includes the Indonesian island of Sumba, and you can enjoy its beaches, remote villages, and untouched forest just an hour's flight from Bali. Or take a trip to Macedonia in Greece, and get away from the crowds in Athens. It is known for famous archaeological sites and history-rich towns.
 
Also on the list is Panama, where you can visit a UNESCO world heritage site, or more than a dozen national parks. Panama City is also the only world capital with a tropical rain forest within its city limits.
 
Joining me now is CNN Digital Producer, Lilit Marcus. Great to have you with us.
 
LILIT MARCUS, CNN DIGITAL PRODUCER: Thanks for having me.
 
So, every year, you and the rest of the CNN Travel team release a list of places to go around the world. This year's list has 24 destination to match 2024. Give us a couple of your top picks from that list. Where would you suggest we should be going?
 
MARCUS: I mean, it is so hard to decide. I can tell you a couple that I am really personally interested. So, one of the picks is Greenland. They are opening two big new airports there this year, so it will be easier than ever for people to visit. I personally love Merida in Mexico. I went there a couple of years go on vacation and thought it was gorgeous. The food is really amazing. And I'm also keen to visit the Abrolhos Islands, off of Western Australia.
 
CHURCH: Those are some great picks and gorgeous, gorgeous images there. So, of course, the big question. How do you and your team select these destinations each year out of all the possibilities from around the world? What is the process?
 
MARCUS: I know. It is really hard. I mean I always want to go everywhere every year, so it takes about two months for the CNN Travel team to put your list together from the first suggestions to publishing it on January 1st every year. So I would say, we try to think of big anniversaries and important things that are going to be happening during the year. So for example, Tainan in Taiwan always a cool place to visit, has amazing food, but it is turning 400 years old in 2024. So there's going to be some cool programming around it. CHURCH: So, what tends to be the most represented region of the world
 
 in your list? Does there tend to be a favorite in any part of the world, or not?
 
MARCUS: You know, it is really tough. We have -- CNN Travel has team members in four cities across three continents. So we're all a little bit biased about the part of the world we live in. And then, we're lucky to have all of CNN at our disposal. So we can ask our colleagues who are more familiar with other parts of the world, "Hey, what are we missing? What do you guys think we should be including this year?" So we really try to do have a representative group and that way, any CNN reader can find a place that's close to them that they're interested in visiting.
 
CHURCH: And how many of these destinations do you or your team members try to visit in the course of the year, given you are all spread across the world, aren't you?
 
MARCUS: We really are. Some of these are actually destinations that some of us have been to in the past and really love. Some of them are places that we are keen to play visit, and some of them are ones that CNN contributors from the world tell us about. So, I personally am hoping to visit Sumba in Indonesia this year. That is my personal vacation getaway.
 
 CHURCH: What sort of feedback do you get from people reading these articles? Do people actually say to you, "Hey, you know, I visited some of the options that you laid out last year, it was great. Thank you so much." What is the feedback you get?
 
MARCUS: I would say, as a Travel Editor, my inbox is divided into two categories. One is destinations saying, please, please write about us. We want people to come. And the other half is please don't write about us, we don't want people to come. So, you can never make everybody happy. But most destinations are just excited that they have a chance to share what they have with the world.
 
CHURCH: Lilit Marcus, thank you so very much. And I think a lot of us are very jealous about your job.

CHURCH: Thank you for joining us.
 
MARCUS: Thank you so much for having me.

CHURCH: And still to come, drug makers are abiding by President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which includes capping the price of insulin at $35. Details, just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: More Americans with diabetes will get a break on their insulin costs in 2024 with another leading drug maker now capping costs to help lower the price. CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: The first of the year marks a major change in the way that people who depend on insulin will pay for it. Now, Sanofi becomes the third major U.S. manufacturer of insulin to offer a $35 per month price cap, at least on what people are paying out of pocket for their medications. Now, this may be kind of complicated for people to access, they may have to go to the drug maker's websites and download a coupon, but at least this now becomes available across the board from these three major manufacturers.
 
Now, more than 8 million people in the United States depend on insulin to live. And according to the American Diabetes Association, a quarter of those people have, at one point, needed to ration their medicine in order to pay for it. And that can have really severe health consequences. 
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
TIRRELL: Another thing going into effect starting January 1st is decreases in the list prices of insulin of more than 70 percent. Now, the list price is the actual price of medicine before insurance kicks in, or any rebates or discounts are paid back into the system. Now, the reason that is actually happening is because of a Biden Administration 2021 law, the American Rescue Plan Act. Essentially, that changed the way drug makers have to pay rebates back to Medicaid for drugs on which they have raised the price a lot over the years.
 
Insulin's have been going up for decades. If you look at this graph we have here, this one actually comes from a congressional investigation into drug prices and you can see how much those list prices have increased. Now because of this change which goes into effect January 1st, companies that have raised the price of medicines a lot overtime could actually end up paying Medicaid for drugs. So, losing money on those medicines.
 
So by reducing the list prices by 70 percent or more, these companies are actually avoiding having to pay these rebates back to Medicaid. Some analysts put this at hundreds of millions of dollars a year in savings these companies will have because they are reducing the list prices of their drugs. And so, while across the board, it is hoped that insulin prices are coming down for everyone, there is a lot going on beyond the surface here.

CHURCH: 2024 is already proving to be incredibly lucky for one person in Michigan, a single ticket sold in that U.S. state has matched all six numbers of the Powerball jackpot with an estimated $842 million. It is the fifth largest Powerball ever one and the tenth largest lottery jackpot recorded in the U.S., according to Powerball. The winner will have the option to take home a lump sum payment of around $425 million before taxes. Not too shabby.
 
Thank you so much for watching. I'm Rosemary Church. I'll be right back with more news after a short break. Do stick around.
