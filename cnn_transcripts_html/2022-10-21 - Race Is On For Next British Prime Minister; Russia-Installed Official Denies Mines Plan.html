BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: The race is on for the next leader of the U.K. Could Boris Johnson return as prime minister? 
 
Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is due to be sentenced today for his contempt of Congress. We'll be live in Washington.

 country.

ANDERSON: Legendary footballer Andriy Shevchenko on his grief at seeing the destruction caused by the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to help others. 
 
I'm Becky Anderson. Hello, and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD live from Abu Dhabi where the time is 6:00 in the evening. 
 
We begin this hour with a high-stakes scramble for Britain's top job. The race to replace Liz Truss as prime minister is on, and the three main 
 
 contenders include former finance minister Rishi Sunak and his ex-boss Boris Johnson. Sources say Johnson who stepped down a few months ago under 
 
 a crush of scandals may indeed try to get his old job back. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace says he, quote, "leans towards Johnson." He says he 
 
 might run himself. 
 
Well, this all comes after Truss abruptly announced on Thursday that she is resigning after only six weeks in power. She says she will stay on until 
 
 Conservative MPs pick her successor, which will be no later than next Friday. 
 
Well, whoever winds up in Downing Street this time next week will be the U.K.'s fifth prime minister in six years. 
 
Let's get you to Downing Street now and bring in CNN's Bianca Nobilo. 
 
It's like a revolving door behind you there at Number 10. The U.K. will have five prime ministers in just six years. As you reflect on what is 
 
 happening in the U.K., is it clear at this point exactly what has gone wrong? 
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I have been doing that so frequently at the moment, Becky. I don't think I have a certain answer. But it is 
 
 remarkable. Just to think that Boris Johnson was actually prime minister in the building behind me last month because at the beginning of September he 
 
 was still in there. And the fact that people are discussing a possible return before the month is over is just incredible. 
 
In terms of what is behind this, something I've noticed with how politics in the U.K. has shifted over the last decade, and it really has. I speak to 
 
 MPs, and I know for my own experience, that the place in some ways is unrecognizable in parliament in terms of behavior and civility at times, 
 
 standards for public life politicians. But also how the public regards MPs. 
 
Now something that's happened since Brexit is the amplification of fringe voices in U.K. politics. So generally like the Conservative Party, for 
 
 example, could be a broad church. You could have people on the right, you could have people on the left. But generally you'd find yourself in a 
 
 moderate center place because that's where the center of gravity was. But with Brexit, with Boris Johnson, and the decision to expel MPs from the 
 
 party if they didn't tow the government line on fairly extreme matters like a no-deal Brexit has led to less and less MPs in that center ground. 
 
And that's increased the factionalism, so you have MPs on the right of the party and you have less on the left and in the center, which is driving a 
 
 very divisive politics. So I think that's one of the reasons behind this is the fact that moderation is no longer winning the day. And that means that 
 
 these leaders have to appeal to the grassroots and more fringe elements, which generally increases the temperature of political debate and makes it 
 
 more volatile. 
 
I also think the culture wars have quite a bit impact as well, Becky. But it's too early I think to tell exactly what's got us to this place but we 
 
 have now symptoms which demonstrate that something is fundamentally awry in the British political system, with the Conservative Party at least. 
 
ANDERSON: I will ask you very briefly, what's the possibility that Boris Johnson could return as PM? 
 
NOBILO: Seems to be growing as the day goes on. As we started, there were a lot more backers for Rishi Sunak. I believe at the moment, I'm trying to 
 
 keep count, but it's around 57, 58 MPs that are declared for him. And Boris Johnson is now creeping up there. 
 <br>[10:05:01]
 
He's got over 30 I think, over 35 MPs declared him. Penny Mordaunt running behind both of them, not quite breaking the 20s. You hear lots of people 
 
 now today saying bring back Boris. In the WhatsApp group some constituent MPs are telling me, are saying well, Boris didn't really get a chance, and 
 
 everybody makes mistakes. 
 
But other MPs saying to me, have we gone through a period of collective amnesia here? Let's not forget the circumstances in which Johnson was 
 
 ousted from office. 148 of his own MPs voting against him in a confidence vote, public letters from his own cabinet minister saying he's not fit for 
 
 office, and an investigation against him in parliament which is still ongoing, and theoretically if he did become prime minister again could make 
 
 him suspended or make him lose his seat. 
 
So there's a lot of arguments against him even though I think some MPs are attracted by his ability to win elections and an idea of a triumphant 
 
 return. 
 
ANDERSON: Bianca, the story continues. It will be continued on this show in the days to come. For now thank you very much indeed for joining us. 
 
Outside Number 10, the home of whoever will be the new British prime minister were former British Conservative MP, who by the way had a file for 
 
 the Middle East for a long period of time, and so is a good friend of this show, Alistair Burt, has been tweeting -- paraphrasing him now -- that the 
 
 Conservative Party needs to sort itself out. He joins me now live from Bedford in England. 
 
And it is good to have you on the show. I mean, just describe for me what this party is going through at present. I talk about your party, that being 
 
 the Conservative Party. And what impact is it having on Britain? 
 
ALISTAIR BURT, FORMER BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP: Becky, you and I have met in a variety of places where democracy isn't particularly stable. And we've 
 
 always marveled at the fact that we are able to rely on certain things on our own countries, where the principle of stable government is followed. 
 
 And of course at the moment that's just not the case in the U.K. It's astonishing. And the speed of collapse of stresses this government was a 
 
 great surprise. 
 
Literally all the events since the pressure on Boris Johnson and the issue surrounding him grew to remove him from office, over him to leave office. 
 
 And Bianca is right in tracing it back I think to the polarization of Brexit which has damaged the Conservative Party. And unless it get itself 
 
 out of the factions that are currently damaging it and making it very difficult for anyone to bring everybody together. Unless it can do that it 
 
 will lose any credibility of governments whatsoever. 
 
ANDERSON: Alistair, is the man to do that job Boris Johnson? 
 
BURT: Well, I don't think so and I think that would be very difficult. People are forgetting that some 60 officeholders physically resigned from 
 
 his government to say they could not work with him. Explain to me how that would work in a new situation again. The work that's going on at the 
 
 moment, the investigation that's going on into whether or not he misled the House. This is very serious stuff that the House is considering. 
 
And it found against Boris Johnson that would be very difficult. I think also in politics it's very hard to look backwards and go backwards. And he 
 
 had an opportunity as prime minister. And certain things, the Ukraine issue, as Ben Wallace, his good friend, has been explaining I think very 
 
 much stands to its credit. But difficult to see how with all the background and bearing in mind it was his leaving office that triggered what we have 
 
 seen just this week with Liz Truss losing office. 
 
It all stems from the failure of the Johnson premiership to see him as the answer to put forward to the British people is genuinely difficult for me 
 
 to see. But colleagues will make up their own minds in the next few days. I think there are other strong candidates who could do the job. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes. You are talking about colleagues of yours in the Conservative Party because of course it's not the British public who gets 
 
 an opportunity to choose who is the next British prime minister. It's the leader of whichever party has a majority in government. And that at 
 
 president is the Conservative Party. 
 
Whoever comes in next, he-she will be the second prime minister in a row that the wider country hasn't voted on. There will be people watching this 
 
 show who say, well, that's not very democratic, is it? The U.K. is one of the world's greatest democracies, with the mother of all parliaments. What 
 
 is happening to that British democracy now? And what chance the British public gets the opportunity to vote on who will lead their country out of 
 
 this crisis? 
 <br>[10:10:09]
 
BURT: Well, we are a constitutional democracy. We are a parliamentary democracy. And that means we don't have a presidential system. So when 
 
 people voted in 2019 in the general election, they voted for their local candidates who then chose the leader of their party, Boris Johnson, to be 
 
 the prime minister. Now that still holds. And I can well understand, we can all understand looking at this from the outside, how the public are pretty 
 
 outraged by what's happened. 
 
But constitutionally, they don't have a say at this stage. There have been members of other parties who have become prime minister without elections. 
 
 What we do know for certain in Britain is an election is coming. There will be no change to that. We have a patent of five-year parliaments that won't 
 
 be changed. And an election could be called at any time before that. So the public will get their choice. 
 
So angry and annoyed, though, they may be, there is no constitutional reason why they should vote at the moment. But people are human. They will 
 
 remember all this. And the Conservative Party is going to have to work incredibly hard to persuade people to forget what has happened in order to 
 
 vote for them in 12, 18 months' time. And the Conservative Party, I'm sure, is pretty aware of that. 
 
So how they handle this next few days, and how they handle the responsibilities of government after that, we'll have a profound effect on 
 
 how people vote. But whether the public will forget what they've been through this summer, I really don't know. I think it's very difficult. And 
 
 I also don't think that the fissures in the Conservative Party that Bianca was talking about, I don't think they are easily fixed. 
 
And it's not a question of how many people are backing each of the three major candidates. It's, are any of them prepared to work with each other in 
 
 order to do the job, and put the country first? Because if they can't put the country first, they won't be in office. 
 
ANDERSON: Alistair Burt, it's always a pleasure having you on. Your analysis and insights extremely important. I do want to just bring up the 
 
 patent at present against the dollar because whatever happens over the next few days, the next week or so, will also have a profound effect on the 
 
 assets, British assets including this. The British pound. 
 
This present, FTSE pretty stable. Upper third of 1 percent. And the pound just off, but only just. These markets and investments in these markets 
 
 because that's, you know, how these markets move, of course, really waiting to find out what happens next. But let's remember, markets hate a sense of 
 
 insecurity. They really look for some stability out of the British economy at this point. And that means some leadership. Right. 
 
A Kremlin installed official in the occupied Kherson region is responding to an alarming claim from the Ukrainian government. Russian state media 
 
 reporting the official denies Russian forces are planting mines on a dam, a hydroelectric power plant in the Dnieper River. This comes after an adviser 
 
 to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia intends to blow up that dam and flood the region in order to slow Ukraine's counteroffensive. 
 
The Russian commander in Ukraine has told state media that the situation in the region is, quote, "very difficult." 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson. He's in Kyiv. 
 
That Zelenskyy adviser says Russia is plotting a manmade catastrophe. Those are alarming words. What do we know at this point? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, and Becky, it was only a few days ago that the Russian officials in that illegally annexed 
 
 area of Kherson was saying that Ukraine was going to blow up that dam. They are talking about the dam that the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. They 
 
 would be potentially downstream and upstream effects. But at the thrust and center of what Ukrainian officials are saying, they say that they have seen 
 
 Russian forces going to the sluice gates and minding the sluice gates. 
 
They say that Russia's part two military trucks with tents on them that the Ukrainians believe are full of explosives on top of the dams and that 
 
 they're getting ready to blow up. So what are the downstream effects or the downstream effects are that it could wash away or heavily damage houses and 
 
 homes near the rivers, towns and villages close to the river in the Kherson region? That would be a big setback for the Ukrainians. 
 
The potential, as well, would make them harder for them to cross the river. Once they take Kherson of which they expect to do and to be able to chase 
 
 the Russian forces. But it's perhaps the upstream effects that are the most worrying. Ukrainian officials are saying, look, the Dnieper River gets to 
 
 that hydroelectric plant after it's been at the nuclear power plant further up the river. 
 <br>[10:15:05]
 
Blow that dam, they say, and you would reduce the water in the river, 18 million cubic tons of it. You reduce the water in the dam. The level goes 
 
 down. And the nuclear power plant loses the supply of water it needs to keep cool. So these are very big and serious concerns. Upstream and 
 
 downstream, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: Absolutely. Meantime exhumations finished as I understand it at a mass grave in Lyman. What are officials telling you? 
 
ROBERTSON: Yes, they are saying, look, they've been through the bodies. It's been a long and slow process. It's been difficult. They didn't want to 
 
 come to conclusions early. They are still looking at the evidence that they found. But they found that there were a number of children killed there. 
 
 Dozens upon dozens of women and many men. Some people they said appear to have died through, you know, as a result of shrapnel from explosions. 
 
But there are the people there they say who appear to have been tortured, who appear to have been, you know, physically restrained before they have 
 
 been killed. So the evidence there points, indicates, for the potential for war crimes. So this is again what Ukraine has been doing systematically in 
 
 Lyman as they did in Bucha to the north of Kyiv is catalog all the evidence that they say amounts towards war crimes. 
 
ANDERSON: Nick Roberson in Kyiv. Nic, thank you. 
 
At times of crisis, a nation often turns to its icons for hope and inspiration. And for one of Ukraine's most famous football legend this time 
 
 is no different. Since Russia invaded Andriy Shevchenko's homeland in February, he's visited four times and is being torn apart emotionally by 
 
 the destruction he has seen. We spoke earlier this week about the work that he's been doing there to help lift spirits and help his country recover, in 
 
 particular rebuilding a football pitch in Irpin. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHEVCHENKO: I remember, you know, being a very, very nice physical small city close to Kyiv. It's probably only 15 kilometers from Kyiv. And I used 
 
 to go down a lot when I was a kid playing different games. And I remember that stadium in Bucha, you know, being it's all very close. I used to spend 
 
 the summer time there, in summer camp with my friends playing football. And I remember that stadium was very nice, small stadium, where we go with the 
 
 mayor of the city for the town, and we would come to the stadium. 
 
It was the hole from the bomb of this stadium, absolutely destroyed some dressing room. And I saw is a few kids in the middle of this pitch been 
 
 playing football. I immediately spoke to Milan Fondazione and we did some very nice project. And most of the money been coming from selling the t-
 
 shirts, the Milan Ukraine special shirt for this, for Ukraine, and with my number and it's exactly the same shorts when I won in Champions League in 
 
 2002, 2003 season with (INAUDIBLE). All the money were recovered from some of the shorts, we're going to use to rebuild the stadium in Irpin. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: And you can watch that full interview with Shevchenko next hour. We discuss his state of mind as the first missiles fell in Ukraine. His 
 
 childhood on the streets of Kyiv and the role of football in Ukraine's national identity. That is coming up next hour here on CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
Well, five weeks of widespread protests in Iran, with women there leading the movement. Well, they are also describing the horrors of the Iranian 
 
 regime's merciless crackdown. 
 
Well, she was a megastar, one of the most famous singers in Iran until she was silenced by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. CNN's conversation with 
 
 Googoosh about her life and the protests is after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:21:48]
 
ANDERSON: For five weeks now, five weeks, Iranian citizens have risked it all in turbulent protests against a repressive regime. 
 
The in custody death last month of a 22-year-old woman ignited this current swell of civil rights activism and it's Iranian women who've been on the 
 
 frontlines, leading and inspiring this movement. Not to say that the men haven't supported them but it has been woman on the frontlines. With each 
 
 passing day, the circulating images and firsthand account of police brutality are simply astonishing. 
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh just talked with one woman who described some of the horrors of the regime's crackdown. Jomana joins us now live. 
 
What have you been told, Jomana? 
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, five weeks into these protests, and it does seem that the Iranian regime is struggling to contain 
 
 these protests, that some are now describing as a national uprising that is calling for regime change. The state is using everything it has used in the 
 
 past to crush dissent. It's that old tried and tested playbook on crushing these protests. 
 
And it does not seem to be working right now, Becky. It seems to be fueling the anger of the people on the streets and really increasing their 
 
 determination to continue going out and to continue calling for the end of this repressive regime. And, you know, throughout this whole, you know, 
 
 past five weeks, you and I have discussed this a lot, everything about these protests seems to be different. And the female element is something 
 
 that really stands out in these protests. 
 
Women have been at the forefront of this battle for change. But they have also paid a heavy price for their defiance, Becky. Many have been killed, 
 
 imprisoned, and every day women are facing unimaginable brutality. We have to warn viewers that some of the images in our report are graphic. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): Every day for the past five weeks, a little bit of video trickles out of Iran, giving us a small window into the repressive 
 
 republic, a snapshot of the bravery of protesters and the ruthlessness of regime forces. 
 
The government's internet restrictions have made it hard for us to speak to those on the frontlines of this battle for change. But we got a rare 
 
 opportunity to speak briefly with a 28-year-old protester. We're not identifying her for her safety. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When I went to protest location, I was really scared and I was like, what am I doing here? Here's a war zone. And I was so 
 
 scared. I realized that if we want to make a change, I should start with myself. 
 
KARADSHEH: That defiance was met with shield brutality. Women who've been beaten up with batons and shot at. This protester's body riddled with 
 
 shotgun pellets according to rights group Hengaw. Many have been dragged by their uncovered hair. 
 <br>[10:25:03]
 
And according to human rights groups and Amnesty International, some sexually assaulted in plain sight by the very forces claiming to be the 
 
 enforcers of morality. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Individuals and basset forces attack people and beat them and to scare people. I saw a lady who was coming back from class and 
 
 the basset forces hit her, with a baton in her sensitive place and she couldn't walk. 
 
KARADSHEH: She recounts in terrifying detail what she and others have witnessed firsthand. Security forces roaming the streets on motorbikes 
 
 attacking people, opening fire on peaceful protesters and chasing them into buildings. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When we were attacked, we ran into a store and the salesman closed and locked the door. So the forces couldn't see inside. My 
 
 heart was pounding and I was shaking. My friend said, do you want to go home, I said no, like home. I didn't come to run away. Nothing has happened 
 
 to me yet and I was able to escape. But it is possible at any moment. We are now in the worst time of our life. We do everything we can despite all 
 
 this stress, even if it costs our lives. 
 
KARADSHEH: Too many lives already lost in a battle they say for women, life, liberty, but that's not stopping a fearless generation rising up to 
 
 reclaim freedoms they've never known. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH: And Becky, the world has been in awe of the bravery of Iranian women and what's really extraordinary is not the fact that they're just out 
 
 there on the frontlines of these protests, almost every day, we are getting images that capture these moments of defiance, individual acts of defiance 
 
 by women who decide to not wear their head scarves when walking out on the streets or in the metro station or at restaurants. Standing up to the 
 
 morality enforcers in Iran and saying enough to being controlled. 
 
And we are seeing this almost every day right now. And people will tell you that they don't think Iran will ever be the same again, no matter what 
 
 happens with these protests. People say they will not allow it to go back to what it was before now that that barrier of fear has been broken, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: Jomana Karadsheh on the story for you. Jomana, thank you for that. 
 
Mahsa Amini was among the millions of fans around the world of Iran's most famous, singer Googoosh, known as the voice of Iran. Listen to Amini. 
 
Well, this widely shared video of the 22-year-old who sparked the protests -- whose arrests sparked the protests in Iran shows her singing along to a 
 
 Googoosh song. Well, she is a cultural icon in Iran. As a young woman she gained fame as an actor and singer. After the 1979 revolution she was 
 
 banned from singing and effectively silenced for decades. Well, now she is in her 70s, living and performing outside Iran. 
 
My colleague, Christiane Amanpour, spoke to her from exile in Los Angeles. Here's part one of that interview about her remarkable life. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOOGOOSH, IRANIAN SINGER (through translator): I was very successful in all fields before the revolution. I was a teenager and I was a young singer and 
 
 as such I managed to introduce another style of a singer, and I became known as a pop singer. And before me there weren't pop singers as such. Not 
 
 the way I performed. Because not only I sang but I acted at the same time. I also danced while I was singing. 
 
That's why that style of performance as mine, especially among the young generation of the time. And of course my hair as well. 
 <br>[10:30:04]
 
I cut my hair very short. So I was a trendsetter. And the young people loved it. And everyone, especially women. The women followed suit and they 
 
 all went for Googoosh haircut. 
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, Googoosh, it seems like an age away, like a century away, when you look at what's 
 
 happening in Iran right now. When you look at how, you know, hair has to be covered with a mandatory hijab. How women are not allowed to sing and dance 
 
 and perform in public. Before I ask you to comment on what's happening, what was it like for you when all of that changed overnight in 1979, and 
 
 you were silenced by the regime? You could not perform in the Islamic Republic? 
 
GOOGOOSH (through translator): It was very painful. It was painful not just for me but it was painful for all female singers in Iran. They all suffered 
 
 the same fate as me. They were banned from singing. When I returned to Iran, the revolution had just started. It was in its early days. And I was 
 
 told, in fact I was asked, to sign a pledge at Evin Prison not to perform anymore. And since then I was forced to forget I was Googoosh. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That's just part one of Christiane's interview. You can find more of that online. 
 
Still to come on CONNECT THE WORLD, the sentencing of one Donald Trump's closest allies happening today. We'll tell you what a judge had to say 
 
 about Steve Bannon's criminal conviction. That is after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
Today is a day of reckoning for one of Donald Trump's staunchest allies. And it is also a watershed moment for the congressional panel investigating 
 
 the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. A judge is sentencing Steve Bannon for two counts of contempt of Congress, as it's known. 
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
Now Bannon was convicted in July for refusing to talk to the January 6th congressional committee. The judge could issue a sentence at any minute. He 
 
 has already said Bannon will get at least a month in prison. 
 
CNN political correspondent Sara Murray is at the U.S. District Court in Washington for the sentencing. 
 
This isn't the end of course. Bannon has appealed all of this. Correct? 
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, he is planning to appeal his conviction. It isn't the end, but what we don't know is when the 
 
 judge does hand down a sentence, and of course we're still waiting to see what that will look like, is whether the judge is going to say, you know, 
 
 you need to serve this punishment now or whether the judge will say, I'm willing to put your sentence on hold while this appeal plays out. 
 
You know, the government has asked that Bannon get six months behind bars and pay a $200,000 fine. Bannon has been arguing that he should just get 
 
 probation, but as you said the judge weighed in and said look, you know, there's a one month minimum for your conviction so we're going to see how 
 
 he squares all of that. They're on a brief recess right now so we would expect the sentencing to come pretty soon. 
 
ANDERSON: Sara, does any of this help the January 6th Committee out at this point? There are of course others who have refused to testify. What sort of 
 
 precedent might this set? 
 
MURRAY: Well, I mean, I do think that they are trying to use Steve Bannon to send a signal that you can't just snub the committee. You can't get a 
 
 subpoena from the committee for documents and testimony and say, I'm not going to give you anything, I'm not going to bother to show up, I'm going 
 
 to do nothing to respond to this. I mean, I think to them this is also an important signal to send as they are preparing this subpoena for former 
 
 President Trump. 
 
You know, depending on the sentence Bannon gets today, it could be a signal to the former president to remind him, you know, you have to at least 
 
 engage with the committee. You have to engage in some negotiations. You have to try in some way to comply with parts of the subpoena or be sort of 
 
 making their case in court as to why you should never to do. Bannon didn't do any of that. He just didn't show up. 
 
ANDERSON: Thank you. And as we get that sentence of course, you will hear it here first on CNN. 
 
Well, the race is on for Britain's next prime minister. And it will be a very short race. The Conservative Party intends to have a new leader to 
 
 succeed the outgoing prime minister Liz Truss by the end of next week. Liz Truss resigned on Thursday amid the fallout from what was a disastrous 
 
 budget plan sent financial markets reeling. Well, several prominent party members are being floated as the next PM including the man who Liz Truss 
 
 replaced, former prime minister Boris Johnson. 
 
There are three on the screen there. Rishi Sunak was Boris Johnson's chancellor, finance  minister to all intents and purposes. Penny Mordaunt 
 
 who is speaker of the house for the Conservative Party at present. She has just said, I am being told, that she is running. And then there's Boris 
 
 Johnson. Now each of these needs to get 100 members to back them so that they can actually be polled for party leader, and therefore prime minister. 
 
So as you'd expect British tabloids have been making a meal out of Liz Truss' troubled tenure as prime minister. One of the biggest media gimmicks 
 
 went to the "Daily Star" newspaper. It asked its readers if a fresh vegetable would last longer than the premiere. Lettuce. See what Anna 
 
 Stewart reveals. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): "Utter Chaos," "Broken." As Liz Truss' days as prime minister became numbered, one British 
 
 tabloid posed a question that captured a nation. Could she last longer than this lettuce? 
 
You may be wondering how it all began. Well, let us explain. 
 
An "Economist" article compared the total days Truss had been in control to roughly the shelf life of a lettuce, which inspired this gem from "The 
 
 Daily Star." Who would perish first? Day or night, the campaign continued. And despite some tough talk from Truss --
