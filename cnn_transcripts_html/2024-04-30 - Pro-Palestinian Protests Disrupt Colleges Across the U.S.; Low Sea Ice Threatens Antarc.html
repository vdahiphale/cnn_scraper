COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to CNN 10. I`m Coy Wire, here with the news for you this Tuesday, April 30th. Already the last day of 
 
 April this year is flying by.
 
We start today with the latest on a story that`s been growing and evolving over the past several weeks, pro-Palestinian protests disrupting college 
 
 and university campuses across the United States. At several schools, students have set up encampments to occupy main parts of campus. Some 
 
 colleges and universities have called in the police to help disperse the crowds, which has led to some students facing disciplinary action, as well 
 
 as dozens of arrests of students and faculty.
 
So what do these protesters want, exactly? As we discussed last week, many colleges and universities have endowments, which are basically big sums of 
 
 money that they acquire largely through donations. The schools invest these endowments, and these student protesters want their schools to divest or 
 
 take money away from Israeli companies, from companies that work with Israel, or create weapons for Israel.
 
The protesters say these companies are helping Israel in its war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to the health 
 
 ministry there. Israel says it`s fighting this war to take out Hamas, a terrorist organization that runs the Gaza Strip, after Hamas killed more 
 
 than 1,200 people on October 7th. 
 
CNN`s Rafael Romo has more about how colleges and universities are dealing with these protests as the academic year comes to a close.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At university campuses across the nation, heated protests and some violent clashes between police and 
 
 pro-Palestinian protesters.
 
MARTIN BERG, EMORY UNIVERSITY ARRESTED STUDENT: What I saw was unprovoked and severe brutality exacted by police.
 
ROMO: On some campuses, as fast as the protests popped up, universities called police to shut them down by removing demonstrators, a move that has 
 
 been harshly criticized, and not only by those protesting.
 
NOELLE MCAFEE, PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF THE PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT, EMORY UNIVERSITY: The real problem here is that the administration called the 
 
 Atlanta police.
 
ROMO: The University of Southern California has canceled its main commencement ceremony, citing new safety measures in place. Dozens were 
 
 arrested Thursday at Emory University in Atlanta, including Martin Berg. The third-year law student who`s expected to graduate in three weeks says 
 
 their protest was peaceful until the police showed up.
 
BERG: Nothing was disrupted, and anyone saying that, you know, campus was disrupted, doesn`t understand what a campus is. A campus is a place for 
 
 open expression and exchange of ideas, and that`s exactly what folks were doing out there.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are gathered here and we stand firmly.
 
ROMO: But some Jewish students say that the last few months since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, and Israel began its assault on Hamas in 
 
 Gaza, they have been subjected to a hostile environment.
 
ALYSSA ACHIRON, VICE-PRESIDENT, EMORY UNIVERSITY JEWISH LAW STUDENT ASSOCIATION: I believe everyone has a right to protest. The problem is when 
 
 it becomes threatening.
 
ROMO: Others, like this first-year law school student, say tensions within the student body have made it very difficult not only to learn, but to 
 
 attend school altogether.
 
AVITAL KESSLER-GODIN, FIRST YEAR LAW STUDENT, EMORY UNIVERSITY: We`re told that we don`t belong on campus because we don`t identify with their 
 
 movement. To me, that says that they don`t want to have a dialogue.
 
ROMO: As schools get ready for graduation, they`re under intense pressure to bring the situation under control, and many students say that`s also 
 
 what they want.
 
SUEDA POLAT, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT NEGOTIATOR: It is in our best interest to reach an agreement before commencement because we want students 
 
 and families to be able to celebrate this milestone together on this campus.
 
ROMO: The volatile situation has also become a political issue, with leaders such as Texas Governor Greg Abbott blasting protesters. Students 
 
 joining in hate-filled anti-Semitic protests at any public college or university in Texas should be expelled, he said on X.
 
KESSLER-GODIN: I truly do think that dialogue is the only way we as a society are going to be able to come together to truly create lasting 
 
 peace.
 
ROMO: But in an environment where the rhetoric is so loud, the few voices calling for peace are getting drowned out.

WIRE: Next up, we head to Antarctica, home to a fascinating creature, the emperor penguin. Did you know that they can grow to an average of almost 
 
 four feet tall? They`re the tallest of all penguin species, but scientists are worried melting sea ice might lead to 99% of the emperor penguin 
 
 population dying out by the end of this century. But all hope is not lost. CNN`s Lynda Kinkade explains how these waddling warriors are adapting to 
 
 their ever-changing environment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Waddling and gliding through the Antarctic, some of these penguins have seen better days. The world`s 
 
 largest penguin species, emperor penguins, are severely threatened by climate change. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey say tens of 
 
 thousands of emperor penguin chicks may have died as the species battled to survive record low sea ice in 2023.
 
PETER FRETWELL, BRITISH ANTARCTIC SURVEY: We know that they breed on sea ice. We know that sea ice is one of the first things affected as 
 
 temperatures warm, ocean temperature, air temperatures, and we`re starting to see these losses in Antarctica now. Our models are quite dire.
 
KINKADE: Dire because these penguins also lay their eggs and raise their chicks on sea ice. But with the ice melting away, the chicks may fall into 
 
 the sea before they get their waterproof feathers, leaving them to freeze to death or drown. Despite the recent losses, 2023 wasn`t as bad as 2022 
 
 for the emperor penguins.
 
Scientists say it`s because some colonies adapted to the worsening conditions by moving south to find better ice or to more stable ice shelves 
 
 or icebergs.
 
FRETWELL: It was reassuring that it wasn`t quite as bad as we feared with the worst ever sea ice, but it was still bad.
 
KINKADE: While this is a good sign, Fretwell says work still needs to be done to save the emperor penguin, and we should do it before it`s too late.

WIRE: Pop quiz hot shot. Entomology is the study of what? 
 
Dinosaurs, birds, insects, or trees?
 
If you said insects, you are exactly right. There are about a million different species, so there is plenty of work to be done. 
 
We recently told you about cicadapocalypse. It`s the phenomenon that hasn`t happened in more than 200 years in the U.S. It occurs when two different 
 
 groups of cicadas emerge at around the same time, filling parts of the East and Midwest with a constant buzzing sound. 
 
Let`s go to CNN`s Whitney Wild to see what all the buzz is about in Illinois, where the cicadas are set to surface.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If you live in several Midwest or Southern states this spring, neighbors you likely didn`t know 
 
 were there will make their presence known by the billions.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Millions of these bugs are about to burst from the ground together for the first time in over 221 years.
 
WILD: Two broods of cyclical cicadas will emerge. Brood 19 and Brood 13 have been living underground for 13 and 17 years each, well before Abby 
 
 Warren and Persia Arcillus (ph) were born. 
 
(On camera): Are you excited for cicadas?
 
ABBY WARREN, VISITOR, PEGGY NOTEBAERT MUSEUM: Yes. 
 
WILD: How come you`re excited, Abby? 
 
WARREN: Because I love how they`re really loud and they go ear, ear.
 
WILD (voice-over): The two broods haven`t crawled above ground at the same time since 1803. Back then, Thomas Jefferson was president and Illinois 
 
 wasn`t a state yet. Fast forward to 2024 and teenage cicadas are set to crawl in every corner of the Prairie State.
 
Major metro areas like Nashville, Atlanta and St. Louis will also see their share of what`s been dubbed cicada-geddon. When groups of males get 
 
 together, their mating call will be impossible to ignore. The volume of the buzz can rival a dump truck.
 
ALLEN LAWRENCE, ASSOCIATE CURATOR OF ENTOMOLOGY, PEGGY NOTEBAERT NATURE MUSEUM: We could see up to a million cicadas per acre emerging in some 
 
 spots.
 
WILD: Allen Lawrence studies insects at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in Chicago and can`t wait for this year`s Super Bowl of Super Bugs.
 
LAWRENCE: This means a chance to just be fully immersed in just a really unique entomological phenomenon. This really only happens in the U.S. 
 
WILD: Here, swarms have pestered the press and politicians alike.
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: Watch out for the cicadas. I just got one.

WIRE: For today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, I`d like you to meet an 11- year-old who loves dogs and cats so much that she wants everyone to have one. Malia Martinez is using her impressive sewing skills to make dozens of 
 
 bandanas for shelter animals every week. How cool is that?
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MALIA MARTINEZ: I thought if we may be like got them like a bandana, they would look cute and be like, oh, this one`s cute. Like maybe I can adopt 
 
 this one and they would get a home.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: She sells her bandanas too with all the proceeds going to charity. Her goal is to help as many animals as possible. Well done, Malia.
