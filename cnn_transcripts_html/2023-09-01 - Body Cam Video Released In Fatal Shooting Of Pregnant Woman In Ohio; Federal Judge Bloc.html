ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN HOST: Investigators in Ohio have just released body camera video of a violent incident in a grocery store parking lot last week. 
 
It shows the moment an officer fatally shot a pregnant woman who is accused of shoplifting. She and her unborn child later died at the hospital. 
 
CNN's Miguel Marquez has been following this story and joins us now. 
 
Miguel, we have to warn our viewers, this video is graphic. What are you learning?
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's graphic and it's also just tragedy in the absolute extreme. 
 
This is a 21-year-old mother of two children, a third on the way, due in November. Sadly, neither the mother nor that unborn child survived this incident. 
 
This happened on August 24th in Blendon Township in Ohio, just northeast of Columbus in Ohio. 
 
Police were already on the scene there to help out a shopper whose keys had gotten stuck in the car when a supermarket employee came out and told the police that Miss Young had shoplifted something. 
 
One of the officers goes to her car, to the driver's side, tells her about 10 times that I counted, "Get out of the car, get out of the car. You've been -- somebody said you shoplifted. Get out of the car." And she refuses. 
 
The other officers goes out in front of the car. He bangs on the car and says, "Get the 'F' out of the car." And seconds later, a single shot is fired. 
 
Here's how it played out.

UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Get out of the car. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Out of the car. 
 
TA'KIYA YOUNG, WHO WAS SHOT BY POLICE: Why? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: They said you stole something. Get out of the car. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Get out. 
 
YOUNG: No. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Get out. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Get out of the car. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Get out of the car. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Get out of the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) car. 
 
(GUNFIRE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Dispatch, shots fired.

MARQUEZ: Now use of force policy for Blendon Township says that police officers should take reasonable steps to get out of the way of an approaching vehicle. 
 
Specifically, it reads, "An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle or of deadly force or another vehicle is directed at the officer or others." 
 
A lawyer for Miss Young, her family, they viewed this video shortly before it was released to the public. They say that it shows a criminal act and the family demands a swift indictment of this officer for the killings of Ta'Kiya and her unborn daughter. 
 
The chief of police of Blendon Township says that all of this is under investigation by Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation. 
 
One officer has been returned to duty at this point, but that investigation, they say, before any charges are brought could take weeks, if not months -- Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: Such a tragic story. 
 
Miguel Marquez, thanks for that report. 
 
Brianna? 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: The battle between big tech and parents is raging in Arkansas. Today, a new law meant to protect kids from online predators was set to go into effect in that state, but a federal judge blocked it, saying it likely violates First Amendment rights. 
 
It would have been the first law of its kind in the country anywhere requiring kids to verify their age and get parental consent before joining social media. 
 
I want to bring in an expert to discuss this. Joining us live, he have Dr. Jeff Gardere, a clinical psychologist at Touro University. 
 
Doctor, thanks for being with us. 
 
The judge argues that this law does not actually address the harms that social media presents to kids. What do you say to that? 
 
DR. JEFF GARDERE, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST, TOURO UNIVERSITY: Well, in many ways, what this judge is saying is that now there is protected speech, of course, under the First Amendment. 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
And so if you are requiring parents to verify that they are adult or that they are signing off on their kids actually being able to get on social media.
 
That neither the child nor some of these adults who have the proper I.D. would have access to some of the information on social media, which is, again, protected under free speech. So this is really kind of a mixed ruling. 
 
I think the bottom line is that we know that big tech as well as parents should be working together.
 
So this is certainly a victory for big tech. This was something brought by a lobbying group called Net Choice, who represents Meta, Google and TikTok. 
 
So I think there are going to be a lot of parents out there who are saying we understand that we may not have access to information because we don't have the proper I.D.
 
But we're much more concerned as to what social media may be doing to our children, and we want more of a say with what our children are seeing and engaging in on the Internet. 
 
KEILAR: Let's talk about that. What would you say are the biggest threats to kids online? 
 
GARDERE: Well, I look at the report put out by Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, Dr. Murthy, who says we don't fully know what the dangers are, but we have so many children on the Internet, so many minors. 
 
There is sexual exploitation going on. There's provocative information on the Internet.
 
And the fact that kids are spending the majority of their time on social media, they may not understand the nature of what it is that they are engaged in, number one. 
 
Number two, it takes time away from face-to-face interactions, exercise and so on.
 
And then you are looking at developing brains and dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that fires every time there's something pleasurable going on.
 
Perhaps having some issues with kids being stuck on the Internet, being somewhat addicted to the things they are seeing on social media. 
 
So there are some real dangers out there. We really just need to specify exactly what they are. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. The bullying tool, that kind of -- the peer pressure that we've all known and it's inescapable and omnipresent with social media. 
 
OK. Parents are looking for solutions here. And obviously, you know, in Arkansas, it's up in the air if this is going to be one. What solutions can parents turn to in this digital age? 
 
GARDERE: Well, again, Dr. Vivek Murthy talks about a couple of things. He says that parents and caregivers need to make plans in their household establishing tech-free zones, for example.
 
Making sure that they foster in-person relationships, teaching kids about responsible online behavior.
 
And researchers need to prioritize what the harm of social media can be as well as some of the benefits, because there are some benefits, especially for children who need support around their sexuality, identity, or perhaps emotional issues that they are having.
 
But, also, he states that the digital industries, these social media companies themselves need to be working hand in hand with parents to make it safer. 
 
We know that they have established some parental controls, have put some timelines as to how long someone should be on social media, but much, much more, Brianna, needs to be done with this particular situation. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. That is very obvious. 
 
Dr. Jeff Gardere, always great to have you and talk about this. Thank you. 
 
GARDERE: Thank you. 
 
KEILAR: Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: Such an important conversation. 
 
Still to come on CNN NEWS CENTRAL, one of the few pediatric heart transplant cardiologists in the state of Louisiana is now leaving over the state's anti-LGBTQ bills. His story is next. 
 <br>[14:39:08]
 
Plus, the force is strong with this one. So strong, that Taylor Swift has broken pre-sale records at AMC Theaters. It's even forced another film to change its release date to avoid clashing with hers. What a cruel summer for them. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: Now to some other headlines that we're watching this hour. 
 
Dust storms hitting parts of Arizona earlier today after severe thunderstorms rolled through the area. This is video here showing the waves of dust blanketing plains and the tarmac at the Phoenix airport. 
 
Thunderstorms also knocked out power for more than 30,000 customers. Just amazing pictures here of what they were dealing with. 
 
Also in New Jersey, transit engineers just voted unanimously to authorize a strike while a work stoppage is months away. The vote now puts added pressure on the two sides to negotiate a new contract. 
 
Engineers have been working under their current deal since 2019 as their union has been pushing New Jersey transit for higher wages. 
 
And Taylor Swift breaking records on stage and on the big screen after announcing her Aris concert movie. AMC Theaters says she shattered records for pre-sale revenue, $26 million of tickets sold Thursday alone. 
 
AMC now says it will add show times for the film which is set to premiere next month. And the record demand is forcing another blockbuster film to move up its premiere date. 
 
The head of the production company behind "The Exorcist Believer" posted on social media, got to love it, "Look what you made me do." That's a Taylor Swift song. 
 <br>[14:45:06]
 
"The Exorcist" moves to 10/26. Hash tag, Taylorwins. 
 
Doesn't she always, Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: Taylor beats 'The Exorcist." What a headline.
 
Since 2021, lawmakers in more than 20 states have introduced or passed bills similar to the so-called "Don't Say Gay" law in Florida. That's according to Education Week. 
 
The controversial proposals and laws aim to prevent teachers from talking about certain topics like sexual orientation or gender identity. 
 
Louisiana has its own version of that bill. And now a prominent doctor says it's the reason that he's taking his family and leaving Louisiana. 
 
CNN medical correspondent, Meg Tirrell, reports from New Orleans. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TOM KLEINMAHON, HUSBAND OF PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST: Yes, I mean, this is what we called it, our wall of love. 
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When Jake and Tom Kleinmahon moved back to New Orleans, the city where they met and fell in love, they planned to raise their two kids and retire here. 
 
T. KLEINMAHON: We built this house honestly to live here forever. 
 
TIRRELL: A pediatric cardiologist, Jake, returned to be medical director of the pediatric heart transplant program at Ochsner Health. The only program like it in Louisiana. 
 
TIRRELL (on camera): What do you love about being here? 
 
DR. JAKE KLEINMAHON, PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST: I feel like I really make a difference here. And before I came, any complex patients were having to be sent out of state for heart transplants. And I felt like the kids of Louisiana deserve to stay in Louisiana. 
 
TIRRELL (voice-over): But now Jake and his family are leaving the state after a set of bills passed the legislature this summer that they say make them feel unwelcome. 
 
J. KLEINMAHON: The part that really solidified it for us was when we were watching the Senate Education Committee hear the -- about the don't say gay bill. 
 
STATE REP. DODIE HORTON (R-LA): H.B.466 prohibits teacher-led discussions on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12. 
 
J. KLEINMAHON: To think that if our kids went to public school and they were made fun of because they had two dads, a teacher would not have been able to step in and make a learning experience about different types of families. 
 
TIRRELL: H.B.466 and another bill, which sought to require permission from parents for school employees to use certain names or pronouns for students, were vetoed by Louisiana's governor in June. 
 
And a third bill banning gender-affirming medical care for most minors overcame the governor's veto and is expected to take effect in January. 
 
J. KLEINMAHON: I'm really sad to leave. But I feel like I don't really have a choice. But the way that the political landscape in Louisiana is going, it's pretty clear that these laws are going to pass eventually. 
 
TIRRELL (on camera): Jake's departure doesn't just mean there's one fewer specialist like him here in New Orleans. He says it leaves just two heart transplant cardiologists for kids for the whole state of Louisiana. 
 
J. KLEINMAHON: There is going to be a hole that's left when I leave. 
 
TIRRELL How much is that weighing on you? 
 
J. KLEINMAHON: By far, the hardest part of this decision was thinking about my patients. 
 
TIRRELL (voice-over): The Kleinmahons will move to Long Island, New York, where Jake will start a heart transplant program, and the whole family will start a new life. 
 
J. KLEINMAHON: We teach our children about kindness, about celebrating differences. 
 
And we hope that they recognize this as us doing something so that they can live in an area where they can be free, they can be kind, they can celebrate our differences, our different type of family. 
 
TIRRELL: Meg Tirrell, CNN, New Orleans.

KEILAR: And when we come back, there's a lot of love in tennis, but one married couple competing at the U.S. Open at the same time, took it to the next level. Their courtship story is next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:53:30]
 
KEILAR: A literal giant of American tennis playing his final match at the U.S. Open. After announcing last week that he would retire following the tournament, 6'10" John Isner's storied career came to an end after losing, fittingly, an epic final match. 
 
Host of CNN's "WORLD SPORT," Don Riddell is joining us now.
 
Don, Isner was the best American men's tennis player for years, and the New York crowd definitely showed him some love last night. 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, "WORLD SPORT": Absolutely, Brianna. We've got all the feels and emotions for you here.
 
This U.S. Open, as you say, has marked the end of the road for Isner, a player who has been impossible to miss over the last two decades. 
 
As you said, 6'10" tall. He dominated the game with a booming serve, winning 16 titles in 13 years on the ATP tour. Retirement isn't easy for any professional athlete, and he just did
 
 not want this to be over. 
 
The 38-year-old played Michael Mmoh in the second round on Thursday. They battled through five sets and almost four hours. In the end, it came down to a tiebreak. Isner lost it. 
 
And afterwards, with the media, he could barely find the words to describe the moment. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN ISNER, PRO TENNIS PLAYER: Tennis is -- it's been a -- you know, a huge part of my life. So it's tough to say good-bye. It's not easy. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[14:55:04]
 
RIDDELL: Something a bit more upbeat now. How cute is this? A true love story at the U.S. Open. This latest match went into three sets, forcing her to potentially miss the start of her husband, Gael Monfils' match against Andrey Rublev. 
 
And during a break in play, she asked the umpire if his match had started. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELINA SVITOLINA, PRO TENNIS PLAYER: Can you tell me if my husband is playing? On the grandstand? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: Well, after winning the match, Svitolina told the crowd she was just looking for a little extra boost. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SVITOLINA: I was just trying to get some little motivation, you know? From him. I know he is playing out there, and just changed my head a little bit because I was not playing my best. I had to, you know, to bring different energy, and so, just was thinking about him a little bit. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: Sadly, the love story didn't quite have a happy ending. Monfils lost his match in four sets. Although, he revealed that he had also asked the umpire for an update about Elina's match. How adorable are they? 
 
Back to you guys. 
 
KEILAR: Maybe the tennis story didn't end well, but that love story seems like it is going strong and ending well there, Don. RIDDELL: Absolutely. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
KEILAR: Thank you for that. 
 
Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: What an amazing couple. 
 
The unemployment rate just went up, but is it enough for the Federal Reserve to pump the brakes on its rate hikes? We'll have more on that next.
