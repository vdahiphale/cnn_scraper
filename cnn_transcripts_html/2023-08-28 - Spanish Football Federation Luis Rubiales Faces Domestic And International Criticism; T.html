LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello, I'm Lynda Kinkade in Atlanta and this is One World. Welcome to the show. At this hour, the Spanish 
 
 Football Federation is meeting to discuss its president, Luis Rubiales. FIFA has slapped him with a three-month suspension for kissing star player 
 
 Jennifer Hermoso during the World Cup medal ceremony, an act she says she didn't consent to. Now, Spanish prosecutors have opened an investigation 
 
 into Rubiales, waiting to see what comes of that meeting. But for now, they seem to be backing their president and accusing Hermoso of lying. 
 
The world champion women's football team want him fired. They're refusing to play until Rubiales is gone. Most of the coaching staff have resigned. 
 
 And there are some reports citing other inappropriate behavior by the Federation president during the World Cup final. Atika Schubert is covering 
 
 this story from Valencia, Spain and filed this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ATIKA SCHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's been a dramatic weekend off the pitch here in Spain with accusations and counter accusations about that 
 
 controversial kiss that took place after the Women's World Cup. Euphoric celebrations for a historic Women's World Cup quickly turned into a moment 
 
 of reckoning. When Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Federation, planted a forceful kiss on player Jennifer Hermoso during the 
 
 medal ceremony in Sydney. A kiss she later said she had not consented to. 
 
Facing domestic and international criticism, Rubiales was pressured to resign, but he defiantly refused. He doubled down, saying the kiss was 
 
 consensual to the applause of men in the room. 
 
LUIS RUBIALES, PRESIDENT, SPANISH FOOTBALL FEDERATION (through translator): You think I have to resign? Well, I'm going to tell you something. I will 
 
 not resign.
 
SCHUBERT (voice-over): Hermoso issued her own lengthy response which said the kiss was not consensual at all. "I felt vulnerable and a victim of an 
 
 impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part, she wrote. Since then, FIFA, the world's governing football body, 
 
 provisionally suspended Rubiales for 90 days and the Spanish government has submitted a complaint to its sports tribunal, a step towards suspending 
 
 him. What was first a national embarrassment now threatens international repercussions but could well become a turning point for women athletes in 
 
 Spain. 
 
TANIA VERGE MESTRE, MINISTER OF EQUALITY AND FEMINISM, CATALONIA REGIONAL GOVERNMENT: Clearly, his attitude has been a demonstration of what female 
 
 players have to endure in professional sports, but not only, also in their daily lives. We have all been subject to these different forms of 
 
 harassment in our workplace, these forced kisses, the grabbing, the touching, the demeaning. So, this is why women from all fields are sending 
 
 their support. 
 
SCHUBERT (voice-over): Hermoso and her teammates said they will not play for the national team until Rubiales is removed in a statement signed by 
 
 nearly 50 athletes. Spanish football clubs unfurled their support in games over the weekend. We are with you, banners red. We are all Jenny. Spain's 
 
 women players are proving that they are winning hearts and minds both on and off the pitch. 
 
We are now waiting to hear what will happen to Luis Rubiales after an emergency meeting of Spain's Royal Football Federation. In the meantime, 
 
 the family of Rubiales has rallied around him. His mother, according to Spanish media, has gone into a church and is now on a hunger strike until 
 
 justice is served to her son, she said. Atika Schubert for CNN in Valencia, Spain. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Well, for more on the investigation, we're joined by CNS Spaniel reporter Pau Mosquera. Good to have you with us. So, it seems increasingly 
 
 difficult to see how this president can retain his position, giving the widespread cause for him to stand down. Talk to us about the investigation 
 
 from the prosecutor's office. What are they looking into, and what sort of reaction are we seeing from his cause for him to stand down? 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
Talk to us about the investigation from the prosecutor's office. What are they looking into and what sort of reaction are we seeing from his family? 
 
PAU MOSQUERA, CNN EN ESPANOL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lynda, the Spanish national court, the prosecutor has confirmed this morning that they have 
 
 opened a preliminary investigation, asked to see if what happened at the final of the Women's World Cup was sexual aggression or not. In that sense, 
 
 in a statement published this morning, the prosecutor confirmed that they will contact Jennifer Hermoso in order to let her know her rights as a 
 
 victim of an alleged crime of sexual assault and to know if she wants to file a suit against Luis Rubiales or not. 
 
So, as we see, the pressure is growing and growing against the Spanish football Chief Luis Rubiales, and his family seems to have had enough of 
 
 it. The Rubiales' cousin Vanessa Reif confirmed this morning that her mother had locked herself inside of a church in the town of Motril, south 
 
 of Spain, as to show some support to her son.
 
Nevertheless, the pressure seems that will continue to grow at least socially because as an example in a matter of hours at 8 P.M. local time, 
 
 the organizers of the International Women's Day March will be calling people to demonstrate here downtown Madrid in order to show some support to 
 
 the female national football team and also to protest against Rubiales. Lynda. 
 
KINKADE: All right, Pau Mosquera, good to have you on the story for us. Thanks very much. Well, migrants are making the perilous sea journey to 
 
 Italy in record numbers. The Red Cross says more than 4200 people arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend and it's calling for 
 
 more international efforts to counter what it calls migration chaos. 
 
The Italian military has started transferring the migrants to the mainland. One hundred and thirteen thousand migrants have arrived in Italy so far 
 
 this year. That's double the numbers compared to last year. 
 
The government plans to meet this week to come up with an emergency plan to combat the rise. CNN's Barbie Nadeau was following the story from Rome and 
 
 joins us now. So, a record number of migrants are arriving in Italy this weekend -- more than 4000 people. Just explain why we're seeing this uptake 
 
 right now and how are authorities handling this surge.
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, you know, so many of these boats that are reaching Lampedusa -- are coming from Tunisia. That's because the 
 
 Tunisian Coast Guard is not stopping them. But there's also another problem. A lot of the NGO rescue ships aren't out at sea. We took a closer 
 
 look at exactly what's going on. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADEAU (voice-over): It's the height of the Mediterranean summer and this tiny island is overwhelmed with the arrival of thousands of migrants and 
 
 refugees. More than 4000 people arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa in hundreds of small boats over the weekend. Among them pregnant women, 
 
 babies and unaccompanied minors. 
 
It's the highest number of arrivals in a weekend this island has ever seen. More than 113,000 people have arrived in Italy by boat this year. That's 
 
 more than the total number that arrived in all of 2022. There may be more migrant and refugee boats at sea, but there are fewer NGOs to rescue them. 
 
At the moment, the Italian government has sequestered three NGO ships for allegedly breaking a law set by Italy's right-wing government under Prime 
 
 Minister Giorgia Meloni that mandates how many rescues a charity ship can carry out. Each of the sequestered ships will be docked for 20 days and 
 
 fined up to 10,000 Euro. 
 
Fifty-six organizations have signed a petition against the government, accusing them of obstructing civilian search and rescue and warning that it 
 
 will lead to more deaths. But the Italian government says without the rest of Europe helping, they cannot manage the influx. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): Italy can't be left alone facing this extraordinary phenomenon. Italy is the gateway to Europe. Europe must 
 
 intervene with us. 
 
NADEAU (voice-over): Meloni will lead crisis talks this week after the government reconvenes on the agenda, ways to help people migrate legally 
 
 and ways to deport them faster. In the meantime, the boats keep coming and coming and coming. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADEAU (on-camera): And you know, Lynda, when you look at those numbers, those figures, that, you know, extraordinary year for migration. And what's 
 
 really important here is Georgia Meloni won on a promise to stop the boats, and she has been very unsuccessful at doing that, so far. Linda. 
 
KINKADE: All right, Barbie Nadeau, we will continue to follow that story. Thanks so much. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
Well, we want to turn to Ukraine now where President Zelenskyy isn't ruling out the possibility of wartime elections next year. During an interview 
 
 with the Ukrainian media, the President said voting could take place if Parliament is ready and if Western allies provide financial support. The 
 
 country's Deputy Defense Minister says Ukrainian forces are liberating more areas along the southern frontline, including another village in the 
 
 Zaporizhzhia region. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell joins me now live from Zaporizhzhia. Good to have you with us, Melissa. So, elections could happen next year in a country that is 
 
 currently under martial law. Is that feasible? And how much assistance would the country need to make that happen? 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, essentially, President Zelenskyy's reply to what had been Senator Lindsey Graham's point last week on a visit 
 
 to Kyiv, that elections should be held in wartime if he wants to show to himself to be a leader worthy of a democracy, what he said was, sure, we 
 
 can do it, but it's going to have to be at someone else's cost. 
 
Essentially, President Zelenskyy's point is that of course the martial law that we are now seeing renewed every 90 days here in Ukraine prevents 
 
 political activity, but that the parliamentary elections due this year, the presidential elections due next year, can go ahead as long as allies help 
 
 foot the bill for that. What he was trying to show was that despite all the major difficulties that will have to be tackled. 
 
And you're talking about, Lynda, not just the Ukrainian men and women currently fighting. You're talking about the many millions who fled. 
 
 Organizing all that will be substantially difficult, a huge logistical task, but it can be done, he said. He was also saying in that same 
 
 interview, by the way, that what he's going to be seeking with Washington is a bilateral agreement similar to the one with Israel that will allow 
 
 that agreement to take care of things like military aid, security agreements in the long term beyond, for instance, things that Ukraine is 
 
 seeking already like NATO membership. 
 
Meanwhile, as you say, that counteroffensive cows on just to the south of here. There have been significant, if not substantial gains that have been 
 
 made these last few days around the town of a village, rather. It was several hundred strong before the war of Robotyne. Ukrainian authorities 
 
 confirmed this morning that it had been recaptured, but the going is extremely slow. 
 
What we're hearing is that Ukrainian forces are beginning to make it towards those very heavy -- heavily fortified Russian defenses have made it 
 
 in parts to the first line of defense. It is the second and third they'll have to tackle as they try and make it beyond there. Their aim is the 
 
 logistical hub of Tokmak. They have several more villages to get through before they get there and get their artillery within reach of that. That 
 
 will be a significant gain if they can get there.
 
But again, every single inch of ground that is taken is a substantial gain. What you're talking about is not just the heavy minefields, but what we've 
 
 been hearing from the soldiers carrying it out, extremely difficult open terrain where everyone is visible, every single movement is watched. 
 
There is substantial air fire from the Russian side, making any advance towards what is a system of incredibly entrenched positions, trenches that 
 
 have been dug out and built over such a long time. Russians had the time they needed to prepare these defenses. They are bombing them regularly. The 
 
 going is extremely slow. But Ukrainian forces say they will carry on as they seek to make it to Tokmak, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: All right, Melissa Bell for us following all those developments from Zaporizhzhia Ukraine, we appreciate it. Thank you. The death of 
 
 Yevgeny Prigozhin reconfirms that Russia is a country that does not have justice. Those words from Moldova's leader, whose country borders Ukraine 
 
 and has also experienced serious tension with Moscow. President Sandu spoke with our Christiane Amanpour on Sunday, which was Moldova's 32nd 
 
 Independence Day. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN ANCHOR: Do you believe that the West is doing enough? Do you think it really gets it? I mean, do you think it's yet done 
 
 enough for Ukraine? And is it doing enough for you? 
 
MAIA SANDU, PRESIDENT OF MOLDOVA: We're grateful to all the countries and to all the international organizations which support Ukraine. We believe 
 
 that Ukraine needs to get more support. Ukraine is fighting the right cause. Ukraine is fighting for its independence, but also for democracy. 
 
 And everybody should understand that if Ukraine is not helped, then Russia will not stop in Ukraine or Moldova. So, this is also about the security, 
 
 first of all, the security of the continent, and also about the international rules-based system. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: And you can see more of that interview on Amanpour Next Hour. That is 1 p.m. Eastern, live from Ukraine in the southern port city of Odessa. 
 
 Christiane anchors from Ukraine all week. So be sure to tune in for her special reporting and coverage.
 
And Russia has officially confirmed the death of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. 
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
Investigators claim genetic tests prove that he was one of the 10 people on board that plane that crashed just outside the Russian capital last week. 
 
 The crash site has since been covered with sand with a small makeshift memorial in the center. The crash came two months after the Wagner chief 
 
 and his mercenaries staged a short-lived mutiny in Russia. 
 
An incident at a school in India is sparking shock and outrage. Video has emerged showing a teacher telling students to slap a seven-year-old 
 
 classmate who's Muslim. CNN's Vedika Sud has the story. But we must warn you, you may find it disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: Police in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh are investigating a deeply disturbing video that shows a teacher asking at 
 
 least three students to slap a fellow classmate who was Muslim. The incident, which took place on Thursday, according to CNN affiliate CNN News 
 
 18, has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread outrage and condemnation. 
 
In the 39-second video which CNN has viewed, shows classmates take turns to slap the boy on the face, forehead, and his waist. The teacher, who can be 
 
 seen in the frame, asks for the students to slap the boy harder for allegedly forgetting his time stable. The boy can be seen crying through 
 
 the video. According to a statement released by the police, the teacher made some objectionable comments in class. She said, quote, mothers of 
 
 Mohammedan students don't pay attention to their child's studies, which impacts their performance.
 
On Friday, the police issued a statement saying that a case has been opened against the teacher and that legal action will be taken. However, the 
 
 teacher, Tripti Tyagi, speaking to CNN News 18 on Friday said the video that has been circulated online was edited. She claims to have been under 
 
 pressure from the students' parents to be strict with him. She said she is disabled and unable to get up. She instructed the other students to 
 
 discipline him. Tyagi has issued an apology. Speaking to CNN, the father of the student denied the teacher's claims and said his son has been moved to 
 
 another school but feels restless and scared. 
 
Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has blamed the Modi government for inciting religious violence in the country. In a post on ex-formerly known as 
 
 Twitter, Gandhi said, quote, "Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like school into a 
 
 marketplace of hatred. There is nothing worse than this that a teacher can do for the country. This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP, which has 
 
 set every corner of India on fire."
 
The state of Uttar Pradesh is governed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu Nationalist Party, Janta Party. Its controversial Chief 
 
 Minister, Yogi Adityanath, has often been criticized for his anti-Muslim rhetoric. CNN has reached out to Uttar Pradesh police officials for more 
 
 details. Vedika Sud, CNN, New Delhi.

KINKADE: Still to come on One World, major decisions are being made to name two of Donald Trump's criminal cases. Ahead, what those decisions will mean 
 
 for the U.S. president. We'll have a live report when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:20:57]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back, I'm Linda Kinkade. Good to have you with us. It is an important day in both election subversion cases against Donald Trump. A 
 
 judge in Washington, D.C. has just set March 4th, 2024 as the date when the former U.S. President will go to trial on charges alleging that he tried to 
 
 overturn the 2020 election. That's one day before the Super Tuesday primary. 
 
And here in Atlanta, the judge has decided Trump and his 18 co-defendants will be arraigned next week. One of those alleged co-conspirators, former 
 
 White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows took to the stands earlier today in an attempt to get his charge moved to a federal court. 
 
CNN's Jessica Schneider joins us now live in Washington. Good to have you with us Jessica. So, Trump is meant to be arraigned next Wednesday. Explain 
 
 what that means and what's the latest on Mark Meadows' case today in court trying to get his charge moved to the federal court. 
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so first of all that arraignment date like you said, Lynda, will be September 6th next week. All 
 
 19 defendants are scheduled to appear in court for their arraignments. Now, these appearances will start beginning at 9:30 in the morning. That's 
 
 actually when Donald Trump is scheduled. They'll go at 15-minute increments throughout the morning, so, all 19 defendants can get their arraignments 
 
 in. 
 
Notably, though, some of these defendants, including the former president, they might be able to waive their appearance, meaning they don't need to 
 
 appear. That's actually up to the judge. Or they could potentially appear, you know, via video video conferencing, like Zoom, that's all to be 
 
 determined in the next few days. But yes, that Fulton County case is moving forward here. 
 
At the same time, we've got a hearing going on in federal court that started at 10 o'clock this morning, so just about two and a half hours ago, 
 
 and it's all revolving around Mark Meadows and whether he can actually move his case from the state level to the federal level and potentially get his 
 
 charges dismissed, although that's not a sure thing. 
 
So, as this hearing is going on, we're getting the minute by minute updates from our team actually inside the federal courthouse because of course 
 
 federal court has no cameras in the court and we're seeing that Mark Meadows in this hearing, he's actually on the stand. He's testifying about 
 
 his role as chief of staff and talking about why his role encompassed a lot of the things that this indictment alleges. He says that it was his role as 
 
 chief of staff to be in touch with state level officials and to be involved in the wake of the 2020 election. 
 
So, this is all playing out, this is adding a lot of insight to his role as chief of staff. Lynda, he talked about just how difficult this role was. He 
 
 said he was basically consumed by the job, you know, 24 hours a day. So, we're going to see how the judge, the federal judge, actually responds to 
 
 these, this hearing, this testimony to see if there's any willingness to move this case to federal court, where Mark Meadows at least believes he'll 
 
 have a better chance of getting this case dismissed. 
 
KINKADE: Wow, a lot of moving parts. Jessica Schneider, good to have you on the story for us. Thank you. 
 
SCHNEIDER: Thanks. Well, the U.S. is marking a pivotal moment in its civil rights history today. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Sixty years ago today, more than 250,000 Americans marched to Washington calling for equality. On that day, Martin Luther King Jr. made 
 
 his galvanizing "I Have A Dream" speech. The march was pivotal in helping push new laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed race 
 
 discrimination. On Saturday, thousands rallied in the Lincoln Memorial, U.S.-- Jr. and the organizers of this historic march at the White House 
 
 this afternoon. 
 
And while the march on Washington shows us how far the U.S. has come, the weekend shows us how far America still has to go. Police in Jacksonville, 
 
 Florida say a man went to a Dollar General store and gunned down three African Americans. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
One was in her car, another an employee, and the third a customer. The sheriff says as officers approached, the gunman turned the gun on himself. 
 
 Well, now authorities have launched a federal hate crimes investigation. CNN's Isabel Rosales has the details from Jacksonville. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SABRINA RAZER, VICTIM'S FAMILY MEMBER: I thought racism was behind us, but evidently it's not. You was a coward. You went in and shot these innocent 
 
 people for nothing that you didn't even know. 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Family members of victims reacting to the racially motivated mass shooting in Jacksonville Saturday 
 
 that took the lives of three black people. 
 
UNKNOWN: Angela Michelle Carr, 52 years old. Anolt Joseph, or AJ Lagare, Jr., 19 years old, and Gerald Deshawn Gallion, 29 years old. 
 
ROSALES: Sunday, authorities revealed new details about the events leading up to the shooting. Investigators say before the gunman opened fire at a 
 
 Dollar General store, he showed up in the parking lot of a historically black university nearby and was turned away by security for refusing to 
 
 identify himself. 
 
A. ZACHARY FAISON, JR., PRESIDENT AND CEO, EDWARD WATERS UNIVERSITY: So, our campus security officer did confront the perpetrator, and the 
 
 perpetrator immediately got in his vehicle and started to drive away. 
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Minutes later, the gunman arrived at the Dollar General. Deputies released this edited surveillance video showing the 
 
 shooter opening fire on the first victim in her car in the parking lot. The edited clip then shows the gunman entering the store where he shot the 
 
 second and third victims. Shortly after investigators say the gunman texted his dad. 
 
T.K. WATERS, JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA SHERIFF: The suspect texts his father and says, "Use a screwdriver to get into my room." The father enters the 
 
 room and finds a last will and testament of the suspect along with a suicide note on his laptop. 
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Eleven minutes after the shooting started, officers entered the store and heard a gunshot, presumably when the gunman shot and 
 
 killed himself, according to deputies. Investigators are now combing through his writings. 
 
WATERS: The manifesto is quite frankly the diary of a madman. He was just completely irrational. But was he rational in his thoughts? He knew what he 
 
 was doing. 
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Authorities say the shooter, who lived with his parents in Orange Park, had no criminal arrest history. He legally 
 
 purchased and owned the two guns used in the mass shooting. The Justice Department is now taking part in the investigation, calling it a hate crime 
 
 and an act of racially motivated violent extremism. 
 
UNKNOWN: Father, today we pray for healing. Healing for the families. Healing for generational curses. 
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Sunday, friends, family and community members gathered at a vigil for the victims. 
 
UNKNOWN: We just thought it would be appropriate to bring AJ a little something. 
 
UNKNOWN: Gerald was a fun, loving young man. He was very active in my granddaughter's life. 
 
SABRINA RAZER, VICTIM'S FAMILY MEMBER: She loved her daddy and her daddy loved her. He didn't miss a beat in her life. 
 
ROSALES (voice-over): One state lawmaker says she's having a hard time processing the senselessness of it. 
 
TRACIE DAVIS, FLORIDA STATE SENATE: That was someone planning and executed three people. So, from years ago to listening to people say, you know, as a 
 
 black people we've come a long way. After what happened yesterday, I questioned that and say, have we really? 
 
ROSALES (on-camera): Now, I spoke with the president of Edward Waters University, that historically black school, who feels strongly that his 
 
 institution was targeted by that shooter. However, we heard from the Jacksonville sheriff this morning that there is no indication that they 
 
 have found that the shooter intended to attack that school. We also learned this morning from Governor Ron DeSantis that he plans to award a million 
 
 dollars to the school to bolster security. Lynda. 
 
KINKADE: All right, Isabel Rosales, thanks so much for that report. Still to come, the vote counting is done, but the controversy over Zimbabwe's 
 
 presidential election is only just beginning. What international observers are saying about the ballot, when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:32:57]
 
KINKADE: Hello and welcome back to One World. I'm Lynda Kinkade. The United Nations Secretary-General is joining the chorus of people raising concerns 
 
 about Zimbabwe's presidential election. In a statement released by his spokesperson, Antonio Guterres cited reports of election observers being 
 
 arrested as well as voter intimidation and violence. It was announced over the weekend that incumbent Emmerson Mngagagwa won a second term in last 
 
 week's vote, but his main challenger, Nelson Chamisa called the result a gigantic fraud. The president says concerns about the vote are misguided. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EMMERSON MNGAGAGWA, ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT: I'm sure that very few people in this country will say that the elections were marked by any violence 
 
 because there was no violence at all. And I think this is what we should, as Zimbabweans, cherish and continue to maintain. This is now -- shows how 
 
 mature our democracy is. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: CNN's David McKenzie has been tracking this story for us and joins us live. David, Emmerson Mngagagwa has declared victory. This is despite 
 
 widespread claims of voter intimidation, of fraud. What is the opposition saying? 
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think many would dispute what the president is saying there, that many in the country 
 
 would not buy into the claims of fraud or at least of issues within the election, the run-up to the election, the election itself and into the 
 
 counting. That has been really the main theme of multiple independent observers, including the European Union and the regional body, that this 
 
 has had severe issues and potentially problems with result itself. We'll have to see what the final assumption is by those independent groups are 
 
 when they have done the assessment of this election. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
But for its part, the opposition is planning on disputing these elections. I'm sure they will take it to the courts. I don't believe they feel they'll 
 
 get an independent hearing at courts. One of the main things they are saying is that they believe that the results from individual polling 
 
 stations and from constituencies don't necessarily add up to what they tabulated with their election agents, as well as outside observers. 
 
You've also had at least up to 40 people arrested for what the government says is illegal actions at polling stations. Those are observers mostly 
 
 coming from charity and NGO groups. So, it's yet another election in Zimbabwe that has been questioned by independent observers. Here's the 
 
 leader of the opposition party, the main opposition party. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NELSON CHAMISA, CITIZENS COALITION FOR CHANGE LEADER: It is clear that we are rejecting the election as a sham, the result. The process itself we 
 
 disregarded and it's in line with what the Sadiq observers have said. We reject this sham result and flawed process based on the disputed figures.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: Now, interestingly, Mngagagwa has on some level reached out to the opposition saying he might be willing to work with them. I think, 
 
 depending on how the dispute goes in the courts, there could be a scenario that he welcomes opposition members to try and ease the pressure on the 
 
 government when it comes to sanctions and easing the debt burden because there are many parts of the world that aren't really willing to do business 
 
 with the Zimbabwean government. And so, maybe that could lead to some kind of breakthrough. But at this stage, there is this dispute that we're going 
 
 to have to follow very closely. Lynda? 
 
KINKADE: All right, David McKenzie for us in Johannesburg, thanks so much. And we are going to stay on this story right now. It's time now for the 
 
 exchange. And joining me now is award-winning Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chin'ono. And last time we spoke to him, he was talking about how 
 
 critical he was of the election even before the results were announced. Good to have you with us. 
 
HOPEWELL CHIN'ONO, ZIMBABWEAN JOURNALIST/FILMMAKER: Thank you.
 
KINKADE: So, the list of problems with this election is long. The big question, of course, is what, if anything, will really be done about it?
 
CHIN'ONO: Unfortunately, very little will be done about it if we look back at the history of elections in Zimbabwe for the past 23 years. Elections 
 
 come and they take place, there are disputes, you go to court and the court rules in favor of the ruling party. In 2018, the same gentleman, President 
 
 Emmerson Mngagagwa and the main opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa, again faced each other in an election. And there was a dispute. 
 
Nelson Chamisa went to court, and the court ruled in favor of Emmerson Mngagagwa. The courts in Zimbabwe are not known for their impartiality. 
 
 They have always been ruling in favor of the ruling party in regards to issues that are political -- in regards to issues that involve elections. 
 
 So, everybody knows that going to court is a futile exercise. The opposition has got seven days to make up its mind, whether it will go to 
 
 court or not or take the fight to a political arena. At the moment, they haven't pronounced, they just disputed the elections. 
 
KINKADE: So, basically if the opposition goes to the constitutional court and challenges this then the opposition leader is clearly just going before 
 
 judges appointed by the ruling party, right? 
 
CHIN'ONO: Indeed, most of the judges were appointed by the current president. Some of them were not appointed by him, were appointed by Robert 
 
 Mugabe when he was the justice minister which oversees the courts in Zimbabwe. So, he's very familiar with all of them. Recently, he gave all of 
 
 them $400,000 U.S. dollar checks and said it's for them to buy houses. A lot of Zimbabweans have been questioning why these judges are being given 
 
 so much money at a time when the country has got its economy on its knees. 
 
Right now, Zimbabwe's hospitals do not have medication. Zimbabwe's hospitals do not have basic machinery. Like, the whole country doesn't have 
 
 a working radiotherapy cancer treatment machine. And yet, these judges were paid handsomely. So, everybody supposes that when these cases come to 
 
 court, the judges will rule in favor of the president. 
 
KINKADE: Wow. Well, I want to get some more perspective from you on exactly how Zimbabweans are just dealing with so many challenges right now. You 
 
 mentioned a few of them in terms of healthcare, access to food, but also soaring inflation at 100 percent, unemployment very high, economic 
 
 mismanagement is a huge issue. 
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
Just explain how a fraud election could set back the country further. A disputed election is going to be -- it's a terrible nightmare for ordinary 
 
 Zimbabwe. Ninety-five percent of our potential job workforce is out of work. Zimbabwe has got the highest inflation in the world. Right now, we 
 
 all do not have clean drinking water in our homes. We have to drill boreholes on our properties. But those who do not have the resources to do 
 
 so are suffering. 
 
Schools do not have books. Roads are port-holed. And foreign direct investment is not coming because of the corrupt rule that has been taking 
 
 place in Zimbabwe for years. There's so much plundering of the country's natural resources. Recently, a news channel broadcast, four-part 
 
 documentary series, showing how gold has been smuggled out of the country. One hundred and fifty million U.S. dollars-worth of gold is smuggled out of 
 
 the country every month. That is enough to run all of Zimbabwe's central hospitals for three years.
 
So, the dire economic situation will simply get worse. Zimbabwe's currency has already started to run after the election result. So. everybody's 
 
 worried about what this means for themselves and their families going into the future. 
 
KINKADE: And you spoke a while briefly about historically having fraud elections throughout the country. How does this one compare to elections 
 
 gone by? 
 
CHIN'ONO: This has been a scam. It's one of the worst elections that Zimbabwe has ever had in post-colonial history since 1980. I mean, you've 
 
 had in the past, citizens, especially on the countryside of Zimbabwe, being intimidated. But this time, it was done in front of international 
 
 television cameras. They had desks that were set next to the polling stations where they were taking down the names and I.D. numbers of the 
 
 rural folk that were going to the polling stations to vote. 
 
And they were told that if you vote for anyone else, except the ruling party and the president, we will know because we've taken down your 
 
 documents, we've taken down your name and we've taken down your ID numbers and we will deal with you after the election. And you know, that's a very 
 
 ominous kind of statement in Zimbabwe because dealing with you can be anything from violence to being killed. 
 
In 2008, over 300 Zimbabweans were killed. Some were injured badly through the violence that was pushed by ZANU-PF when Robert Mugabe lost the 
 
 election by 73 percent to Morgan Tsvangirai who was then the opposition leader. 
 
KINKADE: Hopewell Chin'ono, we really appreciate your perspective on all of this. Thank you so much for joining us. And thank you for watching One 
 
 World. I'm Lynda Kinkade. We are awaiting news from Spain, the National Sports Tribunal, due to give an update on that unwelcome kiss at the 
 
 Women's World Cup. We will bring you that when it happens. Right now, Marketplace Africa is up next. And at the top of the hour, Amanpour from 
 
 Ukraine.
