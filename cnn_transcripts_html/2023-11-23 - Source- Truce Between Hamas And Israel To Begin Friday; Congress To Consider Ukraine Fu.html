MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  Back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 
FOSTER:  Good morning, and thank you for getting up early for us if, indeed, you have. Kasie is off today. I'm Max Foster in London.
 
Right now, we are awaiting word on when the hostage deal between Hamas and Israel might go into effect. The original plan was for the truce and hostage release to happen today but that hit a snag. An Israeli official said they didn't expect any hostages to be released from Gaza before tomorrow.
 
Then, just a few hours ago, officials in Qatar, which mediated the negotiations, said the timing for the truce could be announced at any moment. It's unclear what's causing that delay.
 
The White House National Security Council is downplaying its seriousness though. A spokesman said everything is on track. "The deal was agreed and remains agreed. The parties are working out final logistical details. Our primary objective is to ensure that (the hostages) are brought home safely." That's what we heard there from the National Security Council. 
 <br>[05:35:13]
 
Let's bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann in Tel Aviv. Obviously, we've had this delay -- it's for logistical reasons -- but we still haven't heard officially when the actual truce will come into effect. So what do you make of that?
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Crucially, the delay here that seems to be for about 24 hours -- perhaps a little more, perhaps a little less -- does not look like it endangers the deal itself. Every expectation is that the deal moves forward. It's purely a question of timing. 
 
And the expectation from Israel's National Security Council is that this could begin as soon as tomorrow. Now, whether that means there's a pause in fighting at midnight that allows the hostages to be released, or at 10 in the morning, or noon, or sometime after that -- that remains to be seen. We're waiting for an announcement from Qatar on when the pause begins and effectively, the deal begins taking shape and we see hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons.
 
The delay was over what were called final logistical details. As we understand it, that's the locations and the routes which the prisoners will take out of Gaza. And because this has to be worked out in very fine detail the agreement was made between Israel, Qatar, and Egypt to simply delay the implementation of the agreement so those details could be hammered out and so that nothing is being rushed at the last second.
 
Of course, Max, that makes it very difficult on the families who are waiting to find out if their names are on the list and if they're coming out. But this is the process. In fact, the IDF even cautioned yesterday that it wasn't finalized and to wait to see when there is an official announcement. So we're waiting for that here.
 
FOSTER:  Yeah. I've spoken to family members. It's absolutely excruciating for them, isn't it, just waiting for the list and then obviously having to see other hostages probably released ahead of theirs. 
 
But in terms of the lucky families, if I can call them that -- the ones who have hostages being released -- how would it look? How would it work technically when it actually does happen?
 
LIEBERMANN:  So, Hamas will transfer the hostages to the Red Cross at different locations, we believe. The Red Cross will then move them to the borders of Gaza. Now, whether that's through the Rafah border crossing, which would take them through Egypt into Israel, or straight into Israel through one of the other border crossings -- that remains to be seen.
 
From the Red Cross, it will go -- the hostages, that is, will go to the IDF. The IDF will then bring them to the hospitals where there -- where they'll be examined. And either immediately upon release and entry into Israel, they'll meet their families. For the younger hostages or for the hostages above the age of 12, their families will be waiting for them at the hospitals -- a moment they have waited for nearly even weeks at this point. That's the expectation on how this plays out on the ground.
 
FOSTER:  OK, Oren. Thank you so much for that -- the latest on the ground there.
 
To discuss the bigger picture here, Jodi Rudoren, editor-in-chief of The Forward joins us. Thank you so much for joining us.
 
First of all, your reaction to Qatar's announcement. We've had this delay. It's so painful, isn't it, for the families to see that? We still don't know who is on the list for people to be released and we still don't actually have a time for when they will be released.
 
What do you make of all of this -- its handling and the reality that they are dealing with massive logistical issues?
 
JODI RUDOREN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE FORWARD, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. I mean, like everything else in this horrible, horrible situation and horrible war it is complicated to -- there are many moving parts. There's the release of the hostages, the release of the Palestinian prisoners, the pause in the actual fighting, the protections against Hamas kind of regrouping under the pause. And, of course, the influx -- the bringing in of aid into Gaza during the pause. So there are a lot of things to be worked out. 
 
There are multiple parters -- parties. Israel does not directly negotiate with Hamas nor does the United States. So it is complicated and there are many logistical things that could disrupt it. So we're hoping, I think, all that -- this pause -- this one-day pause that seems to be happening isn't a breakdown in the -- in the deal or the negotiations, and there's no indication now that it is. So hopefully, it's just a matter of time.
 
FOSTER:  Let me just play you this. CNN's Becky Anderson spoke with the lead Qatari negotiator in that deal. It was a big exclusive. They told us that their work is quote "not done." 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHAMMED AL-KHULAIFI, QATARI MINISTER OF STATE:  What we hope, at least, is that this agreement will invite the parties to think more about the current situations and come up with better agreements or a bigger agreement. Our, of course, main objective here is really to seek a permanent ceasefire and stopping the bloodshed of the people, and improving the lives of the Palestinian people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  What do you think of that idea then that this pause could be the beginning of actual -- an actual ceasefire?
 <br>[05:40:05]
 
RUDOREN:  Well, I think the structure of the deal as we understand it, with the idea that there's an agreement for 50 hostages over four days, and then the potential for an additional day in exchange for every 10 hostages, which would come with the release of more Palestinian prisoners -- I mean, that does leave this open-ended idea for -- that could march toward a longer-term ceasefire.
 
I mean, it's interesting to hear the emir and to hear that -- you know, think about -- when you think about well, there needs to be a larger deal, what are you talking about? 
 
There's the larger ceasefire for this round of warfare and then there's, of course, the larger resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The eradication of Hamas, which is Israel's goal, is -- that's a very significant goal and imagined milestone. And, of course, there's the liberation, the sovereignty, the freedom of the Palestinian people. Neither of those things are going to be accomplished by this deal but
 
 if there is a path, that would obviously be much more promising than just a pause. 
 
FOSTER:  You really said it there putting how complex this is and the history going into it as well. 
 
I don't that your paper, The Forward, provides coverage largely for a largely Jewish-American audience. I'm curious, what are you hearing from your readers about their feelings about the deal and America's involvement, really, in all these negotiations?
 
RUDOREN:  I mean, I think that Jewish-Americans and really, I think all Americans are quite relieved and hopeful about the idea that 50 children and women -- innocent civilians -- would be released after nearly seven days (sic) in horrific captivity, and that there would be a pause in what has felt to be just horrific violence in Gaza. So I think everybody is relieved at the idea of a pause.
 
But there are differing opinions in our communities but I think everywhere that -- is the pause itself a goal? The release of hostages feels objectively good but what -- if you pause before the goals are accomplished, what about -- are -- is Israel more or less secure than it was on October 7? I think people are still reeling from the kind of the paradigm-shattering act that happened on October 7 and pausing is a relief. 
 
But there's a deep concern about well, what is the status of Hamas and therefore, of Israel's security? And what is the status of the Palestinian people's hopes for freedom and having a state of their own? Until those very big, complicated, underlying issues -- unless there's progress or resolution of them, I think people don't feel comfortable with the situation. 
 
FOSTER:  All right, Jodi Ruderon of The Forward. I really appreciate your thoughts today. 
 
Now, coming up for us, how this major deal between Israel and Hamas will play out on Capitol Hill, and the big funding battle that's awaiting lawmakers when they return from Thanksgiving.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[05:47:21]
 
FOSTER:  Today is Thanksgiving -- probably not news to you. But the White House says President Biden will celebrate with family in Nantucket, Massachusetts. They'll eat turkey and call military members to thank them for their service. 
 
And while lawmakers get the day off to celebrate as well, they're set for a busy couple of weeks just ahead. A vote on Ukraine funding at the top of their agenda upon their return to D.C. -- when they get there -- at which point the fate of Mr. Biden's $61 billion aid request for Kyiv seems pretty uncertain at this point.
 
Let's bring in Samantha-Jo Roth, congressional reporter for The Washington Examiner. Thank you so much for joining us.
 
This money is absolutely vital to Ukraine but there are big hurdles for Biden and Congress.
 
SAMANTHA-JO ROTH, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Yeah, absolutely. Basically, what we're hearing from our sources is lawmakers -- they want to be able to pass a package that includes aid for Israel as well as Ukraine. 
 
And here is why it is so tricky. Republicans really want to insert immigration into all of this. So there was a working group last week that came out with some specific framework that would include -- basically, that Biden would need to include -- continue to build former President Trump's wall as well as changing some of the asylum laws.
 
So that makes this all very tricky.
 
And then on top of all of this you have House Republicans who really do not want to fund Ukraine. They want to do this separately. So you have Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who wants to advance this two-pronged solution with Ukraine and Israel, and then you also have the House of Representatives and the new speaker there that just recently passed aid to Israel separately. 
 
And we have seen how complicated it is. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had such a hard time wrangling his conference. And there isn't any imminent funding deadline as we've seen in recent weeks. As we saw before the break, lawmakers were able to fund the government just a couple of weeks into January.
 
So basically, the goal right now is lawmakers really want to be able to do this before the end of the year. The big question is are they actually going to be able to do this?
 
FOSTER:  You mentioned the Middle East there just wanting to get the U.S. perspective really on this hostage deal. Because I know there were Democrats calling for a ceasefire. Biden's going to deliver them, by all accounts, a truce. 
 <br>[05:50:00]
 
Is that going to ease tensions within the Democrats?
 
ROTH:  I think it could temporarily ease those tensions. 
 
When you look at the picture overall it's really only one-sixth of those lawmakers who are Democrats who are calling for a ceasefire and the majority of those members are in the Progressive Caucus. So when you look at the numbers overall it isn't a big number. Specifically, when you look at the Senate, it is really only two members of the Senate out of 100 senators -- out of all the Democrats. 
 
But I do think that those calls are not going to end with this deal. You're going to continue to hear it from those progressive lawmakers who believe that this should -- you know, there should be a ceasefire. But at the end of the day, this certainly is something that a lot of
 
 lawmakers are happy about. They want to see more of these hostages released. They want to see some kind of end in the fighting. The big question is for how long will these tensions be eased.
 
FOSTER:  Yeah, absolutely, so many questions. 
 
Samantha-Jo Roth of The Washington Examiner. I really appreciate you getting up early for us today. 
 
Coming up on "CNN THIS MORNING" we're learning more about that deadly explosion at the U.S.-Canada border. A live report just ahead. 
 
An ex-Obama official arrested after a video showed him tormenting an Islamic New York food vendor. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[05:55:49]
 
FOSTER:  In just a few hours, massive balloons will be floating down New York City's avenues for the -- you guessed it -- 97th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The event will kick off at 8:30 Eastern. It will run until noon. 
 
There will also be seven new balloons, including Kung Fu Panda's Po, joining the fleet that already includes SpongeBob, Ronald Reagan -- Ronald Reagan? That would be a story, wouldn't it? Ronald McDonald.
 
Officials say there are no major security concerns or threats so far for the parade, which is good news. 
 
Another quick look at the weather for all of those planning to go out in the cold. It's looking pretty frigid, isn't it, Allison?
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Indeed, it is -- yes. So we're keeping an eye on the forecast. Again, we've got some cold air out there, which means if you've got some moisture moving in, it's going to be in the form of snow. 
 
So you can see we've got the snow. It's going to start today across portions of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho and then gradually dive south. So eventually, by later on today you'll start to see some of that snow into Nevada as well as Utah, Wyoming. And then mostly, once we get into the overnight and into tomorrow, then you start to see it spread into New Mexico and portions of Colorado.
 
The eastern half of the country a little less complicated. Now, we do have some light rain showers expected right there along the Gulf Coast, so Shreveport and Houston may see a few sprinkles out there today. But overall, still not that bad.
 
New York -- this is the one that people want to know about because of the Macy's Parade. Now, I will say there are going to be a few gusty winds maybe up around that 10-15 mile-per-hour range, but overall, not too bad and nothing that should complicate it so much that they would have to cancel the event.
 
Temperatures will be in the 40s but that's nowhere near as bad as it's been in some days -- in some years. The key thing here is that we're going to have the sunshine out. That's going to be nice to just be able to see that. 
 
Now, back to the West again. We've talked about the snow. You've to a lot of areas here that are under winter weather -- winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories as that system continues to make its way off to the east. And you can see that here -- that gradual spread from west to east and down -- dipping down into the south. It could even end up seeing some snow showers across the Panhandle of Oklahoma, northern Texas, and then also areas of western Kansas.
 
Overall, when you're talking about the low elevations, most of these areas may pick up about one to three inches. That includes the city of Denver. Once you start going up in those higher elevations, now you're talking four to six inches. And the highest peaks likely to pick up well over a foot of snow over the next 48 hours. 
 
We've got the cold air in place along the west, but that cold air is going to begin to spread farther east in the coming days. But then the west, by the end of the week, finally starts to see those temperatures rebound. 
 
One example of that is going to be Denver. Again, keep in mind folks, yesterday, Denver topped out in the 60s. Today the high won't even make it to 40. And then by the time we get to Friday, you're just talking mid-20s. And snow showers will also be occurring on Friday. So if you have some Black Friday plans -- maybe you want to go out and shop -- keep in mind that some of those roadways may be a little bit slick on Friday.
 
A little bit more snow expected on Saturday morning but then we finally get the sunshine back, and that's when you'll start to see those temperatures begin to rebound, at least by the middle to the end of the week. 
 
Now, for the next few days -- again, we've got the snow out here but that system is going to gradually spread off to the east as we head into Saturday -- Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So you're going to start to see some more rain showers in the central U.S. More of that rain developing along the Gulf Coast again.
 
Some of these areas, however, not going to complain. They need it. We've got some pretty severe drought conditions, especially across portions of Louisiana and Mississippi. So they could certainly use a lot of that rain in these areas. And it's not expected to be very heavy. Most of this -- you're looking at about an inch or so total.
 
We'll also start to see by the end of the weekend more of those rain showers pushing back into the northeast. Again, you can see that cold just beginning to spread. Even some of that frigid air really starting to deep-dive into portions of the Upper Midwest as we get into the early portion of the week. And then it continues to spread before we'll finally start to see things rebound at least a little bit for some other areas.
 
So, New York, for today, not too bad, topping out at 52. A little bit of a dip Friday and Saturday but then we do come right back again on Sunday and Monday despite the fact of having a few of those rain showers that we did mention coming into the forecast on Sunday. And then, once again, another dip, Max, once we get towards the middle portion of the upcoming week.
 <br>[06:00:02]
 
FOSTER:  OK, Allison. Thank you so much for that look ahead to Macy's and around the U.S.
 
Now, Kentucky has declared a state of emergency. It is urging residents of Livingston to evacuate their homes after a train derailment nearby. The CSX Railway Company says at least 16 cars jumped the tracks on Wednesday afternoon. Two cars contained molten sulfur, which spilled and is burning. The fear is that could lead to the release of sulfur dioxide.
 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the chemical can cause irritation and breathing difficulties. The railway has sent air monitoring equipment to that area.
 
The other thing we are watching today -- all eyes on Qatar because the deal -- or the truce between Israel and Hamas was delayed. It was meant to happen today. It is currently happening tomorrow. We're waiting for confirmation from Qatar. So you'll have more on that in the coming hour.
 
Thank you for joining me here. I'm Max Foster. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving. "CNN THIS MORNING" starts right now.</pre>
