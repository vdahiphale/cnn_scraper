ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM.
 
The Chinese government is stamping out dissent. But the unprecedented protests may still be having an impact on COVID policy. We are live with the latest.
 
Plus, another race scandal threatens to overshadow the British Royals much anticipated trip to the U.S.  The latest from Boston where the Prince and Princess of Wales are visiting. And the U.S. victory over Iran at the World Cup wasn't just a win for the men's team. It also means a huge payday for the U.S. women's soccer team. We'll have that.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Thanks for being with us. Well, protests against strict COVID measures and cities across China appear to be having an impact on the government. Beijing is easing some lockdowns and testing requirements in what the top COVID official calls a new stage and mission in controlling the pandemic.
 
The man who recorded this video is yelling unsealed as workers remove orange barricades from the streets of Hangzhou. The city has now lifted lockdown in several areas and called an end to district-wide mass testing. And some people who have been in close contact with COVID patients will now be allowed to isolate at home instead of in government quarantine facilities. There are reports of similar moves in Shanghai. Reuters obtained video from that city showing people pushing and shoving police in HAZMAT suits.
 
Although it's not clear when their footage was recorded. CNN has been able to verify at least 20 protests and 15 different cities across China since the weekend. So, let's bring in CNN's Anna Coren. She is tracking developments from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Anna. So, China is easing some COVID restrictions in response to these protests across the country. What is the latest on this? And what additional changes might be planned do you think?
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, the government is not eliminating its zero COVID strategy which it has abided by now for almost three years. And this is the frustration that people have been showing now for the past week, hence, those, you know, mass protests across the country. But it would seem that because of those demonstrations because of that angst and that dissent that has got through, you know, the government senses that the government has realized it needs to refine its policies, perhaps ease some of those measures.
 
So that is what we are currently seeing as you say, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Beijing, Shanghai. These are cities that our reporting measures being ease. Obviously bringing immense joy to the people who have been living with lockdowns, with residential buildings barricaded, with strict quarantine measures put in place. You know, people are generally fed up obviously and that is what we have been seeing. But there was a very positive sign yesterday from the vice premier, Rosemary.
 
She's in charge of the pandemic containment. And she said that the approach needs to be human centered. She was reported in the Xinhua newspaper, it's a government mouthpiece. Her name is Sun Chunlan. And she said, let me read it to you. With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variants, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China's pandemic containment faces new stage and mission.
 
This was off the back of her meeting with the National Health Commission which also said that the government needed to rectify its COVID policies. So, it does feel like the tide is changing in China. But as we have seen before, Rosemary, you know, they ease certain measures and then weeks, months later they bring them back. Case numbers at the moment across the country are hovering around 35,000.
 <br>[02:05:00]
 
You know, that number not so long ago was unthinkable considering, you know, authorities would shut down cities filled with millions of people for 100 or so cases. But it would seem, Rosemary, that the government realizes for the protests to stop or for the protests to perhaps dissipate that they need to make some concessions. And it would seem that they are doing so by easing restrictions in some of these major cities.
 
CHURCH: All right. Anna Coren joining us live from Hong Kong. Many thanks.
 
Ukraine is stepping up security at its embassies worldwide for a letter bomb exploded Wednesday at its embassy in Madrid. Spanish officials say a Ukrainian employee was slightly injured. The letter was addressed to Ukraine's ambassador to Spain. A separate letter bomb was also delivered to a company that reportedly made some of the weapons Spain has sent to Ukraine. That device was safely deactivated.
 
A Spanish official says the second envelope apparently came from Ukraine and investigators believe that may be the case with the first one as well. She says both letters have the same return address.
 
Well, meanwhile on the frontlines, Russia claims its forces have captured another town in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The Russian defense ministry says the newly sees town is south of Bakhmut where some of the heaviest fighting has raged for months. Moscow has focused considerable effort on encircling the city. The Ukrainian government denies claims Bakhmut is surrounded and has not confirmed the loss of any territory as Russia ramped up its offensive in recent days.
 
Meanwhile, Ukraine is calling on NATO to supply the country with everything needed to defeat Russia's invasion as fast as possible. The Ukrainian foreign minister delivered the message in person Wednesday on the second day of talks between NATO foreign ministers in Bucharest. NATO secretary general gave this update on the fighting.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: Ukraine has made significant gains but we must not underestimate Russia. Russian missiles and drones continue to strike Ukrainian cities, civilians and critical infrastructure. This is causing enormous human suffering as winter sets in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: For more on this, CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Salma. So, Ukraine is clearly frustrated by what it perceives as a delay in getting required weapons to their fighters. How is that message being received by NATO foreign ministers?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think they would respond and say they're doing absolutely everything they can to get those much-needed weapons to those frontlines as quickly as possible. If you remember, at the beginning of this NATO Summit, Ukraine's foreign minister, who's been attending these last two days, arrived with a message. He said last time I saw my counterparts, I said, we need help. Now I have some words for you -- three words for you. Faster, faster, faster.
 
And that was one of the major issues discussed over the course of these two days. There's two parts to this really. There's the supply issue, how quickly can manufacturers produce weapons and equipment needed on those frontlines. And then there's the matter of stock, right? So, if NATO gives weapons, gives equipment to Ukraine, how do they backfill that? Along those lines, one of the discussions that was had was potentially NATO investing in some Soviet era factories.
 
Because one of the issues on those frontlines is the ammunition that is running out is Soviet era ammunition. And so, these NATO partners have had the challenge of trying to figure out how to backfill those supplies. That's one of the issues. But the Ukrainian foreign minister really arrived with a wish list, if you will, Rosemary. Transformers, generators, air defense systems, ammunition, weapons for the frontlines and much of that is being met. The United States has promised over $50 million of aid to try to fix Ukraine's infrastructure, particularly its power grid that has been severely damaged in sustained attacks by Russia over the last few weeks and months. That's meant millions of Ukrainians have been without power. So, that's a bit of good news, a bit of relief there for those on the ground trying to make sure people are getting power and running water. You also heard that air defense systems more air defense systems are being considered.
 
The United States is looking at possibly the patriot system. That's a direct request, again, from Ukraine. So, a great deal of movement that you're seeing here at NATO partners really dealing with a two-front war, if you will, Rosemary. You have the battlefield where they need ammunition, they need wintry supplies, they need long-range artillery and then of course you have the civilian part of this conflict Russia targeting the infrastructure of the country.
 <br>[02:10:11]
 
That means non-lethal aid that is needed to fix these power grids and also get Ukrainians through a very tough winter ahead. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Salma Abdelaziz joining us live from London. Many things.
 
The U.S. says it's focused on providing more air defense systems to Ukraine, in addition to similar pledges from NATO allies. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to our Christiane Amanpour about those efforts. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Is it true that NATO is running out of ammunition for instance, artillery that Ukrainians are using?
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: Christiane, from day one, in fact, even before day one, before the Russian aggression started, but we saw it coming. We've been working with the Ukrainians to get them what they need to defend themselves and to push back the Russian aggression. And every step along the way, in consultation with them, in consultation with allies and partners. We've adjusted as the nature of the aggression has shifted to make sure that they were getting into their hands as quickly as possible, exactly what they needed to deal with Putin's war.
 
And that process continues. We're now very focused on-air defense systems. And not just us, many other countries. And we're working to make sure that the Ukrainians get those systems as quickly as possible, but also as effectively as possible. Making sure that they're trained on them, making sure that they have the ability to maintain them. And all of that has to come together and it is. We have a very deliberate process established by the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in Ramstein, Germany, that meets regularly to make sure that the Ukrainians are getting what they need when they need it. AMANPOUR: So, let me ask you then about the somewhat confusion from the Pentagon and from you all at NATO regarding American patriots. As you say they definitely need anti-air defense systems. And clearly, you must think that they need more as Putin ratchets up his missile attack and his missile wars against cities. So, will the United States give patriot systems? And if not, why not?
 
BLINKEN: So, I'm not going to speak to specific systems, the Pentagon is focused on that. What we've been working to do is to make sure that at any given time, they have the most effective systems possible to deal with the threat that they're facing. We just recently, for example, provided them with a very effective system called NASAMS that they're using very effectively. Before that, of course, we had the HIMARS which they use to great effect, both in in southern and eastern Ukraine.
 
So, virtually every single day, Cristiane, the Pentagon is looking at this, listening to the Ukrainians, consulting with allies and partners and if we don't have something, trying to find it elsewhere, that's part of this entire coordination process.

CHURCH: The imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, has been partly cut off from his correspondence with his wife. According to her Instagram post, Yulia Navalny says it's vile that prison guards have been withholding her letters to the jailed Kremlin critic, but she says she's still able to write to him through his lawyers. Navalny has been sentenced to more than 11 years in prison on charges he called politically motivated. He earlier survived a poisoning which she also blamed on the Kremlin.
 
Well, meanwhile, an American citizen also behind bars in Russia has been unable to contact his family for a week. That is according to the brother of Paul Whelan, who's serving a 16-year sentence for alleged espionage. The family was told Paul was moved to a prison hospital on November 18th. But his brother is not buying that partly because Whelan didn't mention any hospital and the phone calls they had after that day.
 
Whelan's brother also says it's unusual for Paul not to call his family for that long, especially around Thanksgiving. The State Department says the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is pressing for updates on Whelan.
 
Well, Russian LGBT activists say they have become a smokescreen for Moscow's failures in Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): This is the information noise that we're becoming victims of. We're being used as scapegoats to distract attention and redirect the hatred of the electorate that supports Putin and the war.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: Later in the show, you will hear how a crackdown on LGBT rights is reportedly being used to bury bad news from Ukraine.
 
And still to come, Argentina went from a very rough start in the World Cup to a resounding victory. How the deciding match played out and who they face next. 
 <br>[02:15:01]
 
Then why the Men's World Cup is bringing new opportunities to women. We will talk about that with our sports analyst.
 
And politics on the pitch. How protests against the Iranian government could impact the country's players as they return from Qatar.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Screams of excitement and relief from Argentina fans all over the world. The world number three defeated Poland two-nil win in Group C and storming into the knockout phase of the World Cup. An amazing comeback after their disastrous start to the tournament. Patrick Snell has the highlights and a look at Thursday's critical matches.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: I'm Patrick Snell. We start with a highly dramatic Wednesday night in Group C at the World Cup as Lionel Messi's Argentina knew there was little margin for error in the high stakes showdown with Poland led by their own superstar talisman Robert Lewandowsk at 35. Messi has revealed this is most likely as World Cup the last chance to win the one remaining title he covers more than any other.
 
Messi though is human after all missing a penalty from 12 yards out is spot kick brilliantly saved by Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny. Right at the start the second half of (INAUDIBLE) ahead through Alexis Mac Allister who plays for English Premier League Brighton very well taken goal indeed. And then Argentina making the game safe when the Manchester City youngster Julian Alvarez finishes superbly for two- nail the final score line stunning strike.
 
Argentina emerging as group winners to reach the last 16 but what are Poland? Well, that would depend on the outcome of Mexico-Saudi Arabia. The group's other game to advance L3, needing goals and when Luis Chavez scored a stunning free kick to put them two-nil up. The Mexicans had hoping at that point with Argentina also two up. Mexico needing one more goal to advance to the last 16. Instead, though, they concede Saudi Arabia who could have advanced with a win netting throughout the Saudi.
 
Mexico win two-one but failed to read the knockout stages for the first time since 1978. Huge disappointment then for (INAUDIBLE) and their fans who go out on goal difference having finished level on points with Poland. It was that close. The polls progressing to the last 16 for the first time since Mexico 86 they play France on Sunday, Argentina face Australia on Saturday. 
 
Now to group de drama as Tunisia take the lead against world champions and are already qualified France just shy of the (INAUDIBLE) and at that point, Tunisians were actually through to the last 16. The skipper Wahbi Khazri taking his goal really well against the French who knew they had already advanced of course but Tunisia nonetheless holding on for a very famous one-nil victory. So, Tunisia is scoring in the 58th minute of that game but in the 60th minute of the Australia, Denmark game is the Aussies who get the goal they craved they needed this one to advance.
 <br>[02:20:10]
 
What a moment for Matthew lackey who finishes off a superb move. Scores are priceless goal for his country. Massive disappointment for the Danes who knew they needed to win to progress. Share elation though for the Socceroos who remember qualify for the World Cup by the playoffs and a penalty shootouts. Congrats to Australia famous win for the Tunisians of which they should be very proud indeed.
 
But it is Australia's victory that ensures they progress to the last 16 for the first time since Germany 2006. Four more games on top for first day with giants Germany and Belgium and must-win clashes. Watch this space. We're following it all the way right back to you.
 
CHURCH: Thanks for that. Well, the U.S. women's national team won the last two World Cups, but they're actually making more money from the U.S. Men's Team reaching the knockout stages in Qatar. That's because of the equal pay agreement forged earlier this year, which requires the women's and men's teams to split off World Cup earnings. The American men will get at least 13 million for reaching the knockout. So, half of that will now go to the women.
 
Their own World Cup championships only netted six million, two million in 2015 and four million in 2019. The equal pay deal also means the U.S. men's team will get half of the women's prize money in the future.
 
Well, today's Germany versus Costa Rica match will feature a first for the Men's World Cup which is an all women team of referees. The head ref will be France's Stephanie Frappart who was the first woman to officiate a UEFA men's champions league match two years ago. She will be joined by assistants from Brazil and Mexico. Frappart previously told CNN she doesn't think about breaking barriers or making history and he's just focused on doing her job.
 
CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan joins me now from Washington, D.C. She is also a sports columnist for USA Today. Always great to have you with us.
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Great to be with you too, Rosemary. Thank you.
 
CHURCH: So, at a time when women have been fighting to get recognized in the world of football, the all-women refereeing team is making history at the Men's World Cup. How significant is this?
 
BRENNAN: I think it's very significant and a little surprising, because I wouldn't have necessarily picked FIFA, you know, the good old boys network to end all good old boys networks to be the ones to break through in this manner at this time. You know, a crucial final group match and Germany and Costa Rica and it's going to happen. And not one woman not two, but three. I think it's great. I think it's also a very smart move because to grow the game, you want more women to play it around the world.
 
It's a real message that women can have various roles in soccer, not just as players. Of course, the Women's World Cup is a perfect example of the success of a women's soccer, women's football around the world. But also, you could, you know, you can coach, you can referee you, you can have a long career in the sport. And that's just a really smart move business wise to grow your game and to continue to encourage not only men but women, boys and girls to be able to play this sport.
 
And I remember a generation or so ago when Sepp Blatter then the president of FIFA said that the future of football is feminine. And it's taken a long time and there's a lot of misogyny, a lot of sexism to cut through for sure. But a day like this with this refereeing team, I think Rosemary, it does show us that change is possible. And that there are opportunities for women now that we would have never thought possible even say 10 or so years ago.
 
CHURCH: So, let's get back to the picture and the World Cup in Qatar. How is Team USA likely to go on Saturday do you think up against the Netherlands?
 
BRENNAN: it's going to be a tough one. They need to score goals, they need to finish. We saw the success when they do score a goal as they -- as they did the other day to be able to move on into the round of 16, the group of 16 and continue to play in the knockout stage. So, we know that they need to be able to do that. The question is it's obviously on everyone's mind in the United States is Christian Pulisic. He of course Captain America.
 
Pulisic scored that incredible goal to lead the U.S. into the round of 16. And then immediately was injured and it was like something right out of a movie. This great hero who then has to leave the game and tried to play and then obviously had the half, he had to go in and didn't come back out for the second half.
 <br>[02:25:07]
 
So, the question is, can he play? U.S. Soccer is saying it's day to day. That makes sense. He's 24. He wants to play. He's a young guy. We know he wants to do that. He's got a hip contusion, or a pelvic contusion. Either way, it sounds like it would really hurt if you're running and playing soccer. But my guess is he will be out there on the field. And the U.S. needs him desperately to be at pretty close to 100 percent to be able to create those offensive chances that we have seen him now doing two of the three matches for the U.S. I think they have a chance to beat the Netherlands.
 
CHURCH: Yes. Sounds like he will find a way to be there. And which teams do you think will win in the hours ahead, starting with Croatia versus Belgium and of course, Canada, up against Morocco? BRENNAN: Morocco is having a great tournament and, you know, in Canada is already out. So, one would think that that will probably, you know, hold true to form. Morocco is playing very, very well. And you know, Croatia is also playing well. So, I'll go with the, you know, Croatia against Belgium and then of course, the Moroccans. Just a guess, you know, what do we all know? This has been a tournament of upsets and surprises for sure.
 
CHURCH: It most definitely has. Christine Brennan, always a pleasure to chat with you. Many thanks.
 
BRENNAN: Thank you, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: And once again, the 2018 runner up Croatia will take on world number two Belgium in a match. The Belgians must win to avoid an early exit. And we'll see Spain go up against Japan who triumphed over Germany in their opener. And Germany must be Costa Rica in order to have even a chance of moving on in the tournament.
 
We are watching for new protests in Iran as the country's World Cup players return from Qatar.
 
Some people, especially in Iran's Kurdish regions actually celebrated the team's loss to the U.S. on Tuesday. And spectators in Qatar showed their support for Iranian protesters who are facing a brutal crackdown by the government.
 
CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from London. Good morning to, Nada. So, Iran's World Cup team arrived home just a short time ago amid concerns players in their families might face possible repercussions for their actions in Qatar. What are you learning about this?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Absolutely, Rosemary. There is concern over how the team will be received. We did see info shared by state aligned to see news agency late last night, the team arriving back into Iran to huge welcome crowds gathering at the airport cheering for the team upon their return. That is of course in contrast to those videos you just showed of some people across the country celebrating the team's loss against the United States.
 
We saw many taking to the streets in Tehran, particularly also in the northwestern Kurdish cities, honking their car horns, cheering, singing some dancing in the street in celebration of that loss. Because of course, this has been tied somewhat to the political climate in Iran to the ongoing protest movement. The team perhaps seen as a public facing representation of the regime and its institutions. But of course, the team itself has also faced pressure from the Iranian regime as we've learned from a source working closely on the security of the games.
 
The team members as well as their family members and loved ones back at home in Iran faced threats from the Iranian regime against any signs of protest or dissent shown during the games, because of course, we did see the players and their first opening match against England, declining to sing the national anthem, that changed their second and third match where they did sing the national anthem. This, reportedly according to the source after meetings with officials and representatives from Iran security apparatus, essentially warning them not to misbehave, not to refuse to sing the national anthem and not to take part in any action that could be seen as a sign of solidarity with protesters at home in Iran.
 
And we have seen other athletes who have competed overseas facing pressure from the regime in the past. The question now is how these players will be treated by the regime, by the security forces and also, of course, how they'll be received by the Iranian people. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Nada Bashir joining us live from London. Many thanks.
 
The Biden White House is pulling out all the stops for Thursday's state dinner with the president and first lady of France. But before that happens, the two leaders have a great deal of tough issues they'll try to work through. Those details just ahead.
 
And as the Prince and Princess of Wales start day two of their trip in the United States, a controversy back home threatens to overshadow the visit. We'll explain.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  France's president and first lady will be fated Thursday evening at the first official state dinner of the Biden administration. Day one of Macron's visit aimed at Wednesday night with a private dinner with the Bidens at a Washington restaurant. President Macron and President Biden get down to brass (ph) tax on Thursday with the host of sensitive issues, including Ukraine, China, and bilateral trade on the agenda. CNN's Melissa Bell has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  It was the first state visit of the Trump presidency. An attempted bromance in desperate search of common ground. A visit anchored by the traditional pomp and pageantry that will also mark the first state visit of the Biden administration.
 
PHILIPPE ETIENNE, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO U.S.:  This time, I would say the context is not the same because we have the war in Ukraine, the Russian invasion, and many, many crises, still more than in 2018.
 
BELL (voiceover):  Among them, the climate and energy crises. Areas for cooperation in theory given the two presidents more natural chemistry and their shared commitment to modality lateral-ism.
 
But the sailing since Biden's election hasn't been as smooth as Europeans would imagine.
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm honored today to be joined by two of America's closest allies, Australia and the United Kingdom. BELL (voiceover):  With, France blindsided by the AUKUS agreement, the French ambassador to Washington recalled the G20 (INAUDIBLE) autumn not quite an opportunity for a hug, nor an apology. But at least, an explanation.
 
BIDEN:  What happened was to use an English phrase, what we did was clumsy. It was not done with a lot of grace.
 
ETIENNE:  We have learned on the European side that even if you have in U.S., an administration which is more multilateral in its approach, you have issues on the table.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt you.
 
BELL (voiceover):  But behind the proximity and unity that the war in Ukraine have brought, Europe's feathers have once again been ruffled, this time by the Inflation Reduction Act. And behind the scenes of this visit, President Macron will be demanding more help for Europe on energy.
 
EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT:  This is a story of a great cooperation between our two countries.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
BELL (voiceover):  The oak tree meant to symbolize the longevity of the transatlantic friendship that he brought last time has since died. This time Elize (ph) says President Macron will be bringing a gift that symbolizes France, and this time to, a determination for Europe to be heard. Melissa bell, CNN, Paris.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  And CNN will cover all aspects of Mr. Macron's state visit, a live report from Paris is coming up next hour. And we will be speaking to one of the principals at the German Marshall Fund about Mr. Macron's elevated role as European statesman now that Germany's Angela Merkel, and Britain's Boris Johnson are both gone.
 
A racism allegation in the U.K. is clouding the first overseas trip to the United States of the new prince and princess of Wales since the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The focus of the visit was meant to be on the Earthshot Prize, an environmental honor Prince William founded and will present on Friday. CNN's royal correspondent Max Foster reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT:  A pretty wet welcome for the prince and princess of Wales here in Boston for a three-day visit culminating in the Earthshot Prize giving, which is about finding solutions or the climate crisis and financing those solutions with some big prize money as well described as Prince William's Super Bowl moment, really.
 
In the meantime, they are getting to know the city, they were here at city hall. It lit up green to start the celebrations. They went to a Boston Celtics game as well. We'll see them out and about in the city, trying to get to know it as much as possible. The emphasis really on climate and some of the other interest the couples have and what to express, really, while they're here.
 
But a lot of the conversation has been overshadowed by this race rile back in London. A guest at Buckingham Palace grilled about her heritage, she kept on repeating that she from the U.K, but the senior royals asking where from Africa they were from, where their people are from. It was a very awkward interchange, and that senior royal aide has had to step down. An investigation is underway. We are waiting to hear the results of that investigation. Max Foster, CNN, Boston.

CHURCH:  Moscow says it is stepping up its ideological battle against the West, and that means a growing crackdown on LGBTQ rights in Russia. We'll explain.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Well, Russia is one step away from formally expanding its ban on what the government calls LGBT Propaganda. The upper house of parliament passed the controversial bill on Wednesday. Now, it just needs President Vladimir Putin's signature. As Fred Pleitgen reports, the Kremlin is framing the move as part of a larger battle with the West.
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER): For years, being gay has been extremely tough in Russia, now it's about to get even harder. After Russian parliament passed what it calls the LGBT Propaganda Law, claiming in part it's a defense against U.S. influence.
 
VYACHESLAV VOLODIN, RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKER:  We cannot put it any other way, the United States of America has become the global center of this sodomy. Let them live there, do not touch us.
 
PLEITGEN (voiceover):  Anti-gay tirades are often embedded into coverage of what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine on state TV, making the war out to be part of a larger battle of Russia against the West at its alleged moral decay.
 
Yaroslav Rasputin, a gay rights activist in Moscow says he feels singles out.
 
YAROSLAV RASPUTIN, RUSSIAN LGBTQ ACTIVIST (through translator):  This is the information noise that we are becoming victims of. We are being used as scapegoats to distract attention and redirect hatred at the electorate that supports Putin and the war.
 
PLEITGEN (voiceover):  Russian President Vladimir Putin often portrays himself as the savior of traditional family values even equating Western LGBTQ freedoms to devil worshipping. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT:  Such a total denial of the human being, a rejection of faith and traditional values. Suppression of freedom begins to look like a perverted religion, outright satanism.
 
PLEITGEN (voiceover):  The new law bans praise of what the government considers nontraditional sexual relationships or otherwise suggesting those relationships are "normal." But LGBTQ activist, Renat Davletgildeev, who has fled the country says the law will essentially make it illegal to openly gay in Russia.
 
RENAT DAVLETGILDEEV, LGBTQ ACTIVIST AND JOURNALIST:  The only text that I can now show publicly, according to the law in Russia, my social network on the street, in a newspaper or in a movie is gays are outlawed, gays are bad and lesbians should be in jail.
