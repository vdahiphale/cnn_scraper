FREEMAN:  It is just after 5:00 a.m. here on the East Coast. Here is a live look at beautiful New York City. 
 
And good morning, everyone. I'm Danny Freeman in for Kasie Hunt. It's so wonderful to have you with us on this holiday week. 
 
Let's start here with three and a half weeks to go until Inauguration Day, President-elect Donald Trump remains fixated on expanding America's territory at the expense of Western hemisphere neighbors. 
 
In a Christmas Day post announcing Kevin Cabrera as his new pick for the U.S. ambassador to Panama, Donald Trump once again claimed Panama is, quote, ripping us off on the Panama Canal. 
 
And in recent days, Trump has amped up tensions with Panama by demanding control of the canal be turned back over to the United States, a proposal Panama's president has called non-negotiable. 
 
But President-elect Trump seems undeterred, taking aim at not only Panama, but also Canada and Greenland in his Christmas Day message. In this post, he once again called Canada's prime minister, governor and imagined if, quote, Canada was to become our 51st state. 
 
And once again he eyed Greenland, saying the Danish controlled territory is, quote, needed by the United States for national security purposes. 
 
Greenland's prime minister this week came out against Trump's statement, saying we're not for sale. Denmark's prime minister called the idea absurd when it was first raised during the Trump administration five years ago. Trump then canceled a planned trip to Denmark in response.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Denmark, I look forward to going, but I thought that the prime minister's statement that it was absurd, that was -- it was an absurd idea was nasty. I thought it was an inappropriate statement. All she had to do is say, no, we wouldn't be interested. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN:  What's old is new again. 
 
Joining me now to talk about all this is Shelby Talcott, politics reporter at "Semafor".
 
Good morning, Shelby. Thank you for being here on this holiday week. 
 
So let's start right here on, I guess, Greenland. Five years ago. You heard right there, Trump said all Denmark had to say was that they weren't interested. And yet here we are once again talking about how Greenland is needed. 
 
Shelby, what's going on here? 
 
SHELBY TALCOTT, POLITICS REPORTER, SEMAFOR:  Yeah. Good morning. 
 
And this is the ultimate question, right? Is Donald Trump serious? Is this a negotiating tactic? His transition team hasn't exactly clarified his comments as they often do. They -- they will typically say with things like this, this is what Donald Trump said, take it as you will. 
 
Now back in 2016, he, of course, did not buy Greenland and he was irritated by the response when he first suggested it. Now, this time around, combined with Panama and Canada comments, it does seem like this is a negotiating tactic in Donald Trump's push to sort of reshape trade, U.S. policy and trade under his new administration. 
 
So I think that the goal here is to sort of pressure some of these areas to concede to his demands once he does take office. 
 
FREEMAN:  Along those lines, I want you to take a listen to what Trump's former chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said about this whole Panama discussion earlier this week. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICK MULVANEY, TRUMP'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF:  This is a negotiation. By the way, one of the reasons Trump is so good at negotiating is that its a its a credible threat. If he says, you know, look, we are going to have problems with Panama if they don't lower the rates. You know, I don't envision American troops going in to retake the canal. But you got to think that someone is out there scratching their head going, is Donald Trump crazy enough to do something like that? And it's that viable threat that sort of gives him negotiating leverage that not a lot of other folks could ever come up with. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN:  We're talking about other countries. We're talking about Mick Mulvaney. I'm telling you, it's back in the first term. It's like nothing has changed. 
 
So, he said, though like you said, that this is just a negotiating tactic. 
 <br>[05:05:04]
 
But I guess to what end? I understand it may be a negotiating tactic, but what is the end goal here? 
 
TALCOTT:  Yeah, of course. The end goal with Panama is, you know, Donald Trump has argued that they -- their fees are too high on American ships traveling through the waterway. So his end goal in that situation would be they lower the fees.
 
Of course, with Canada, his comments, right, joking about the governor of Canada and that should it become -- it should become another state is a threat with -- he wants to levy taxes on Canada. He wants them to close their borders. 
 
So there are sort of strategic goals here that Donald Trump is, is trying to get to. But at the same time, he risks alienating these places, right? Because these areas could say, we're not doing this again. We're frustrated that Donald Trump is sort of toying with us and making fun of us. 
 
So there is a risk that he crosses that line even before he steps into office and ends up frustrating these countries and areas to the point where it becomes more difficult to make deals with them. 
 
FREEMAN:  Shelby, I just want to get your take on this. "The Wall Street Journal" opinion board, they weighed in on this, Panama discussion saying, quote, forgive us if we missed it, but we don't recall Donald Trump campaigning to invade Panama and retake its famous canal. 
 
But there was the president, but there was the president elect on the weekend, threatening our Central American ally with punishment if it doesn't meet his demands. The board goes on to say, it's hard to know how seriously to take Mr. Trump's broadsides, but threatening a takeover that would require an invasion may cause more trouble than he imagines. 
 
Just quickly on that note, Shelby, just "The Wall Street" journalists, at least have a point. Is this what voters voted for? 
 
TALCOTT:  Yeah, absolutely. They -- they 100 percent have a point, right? As I just said, Donald Trump runs the risk of going overboard with this and ending up frustrating some of his these key allies. 
 
Now, at the same time, I do think that since 2016, we have known who Donald Trump is, right? Part of the reason why people voted for him is because they like this sort of bullying style that he has brought to U.S. politics. So while I think some people will be surprised that he has taken this tactic, it's similar to how he operated in 2016. 
 
So for people who are paying attention, I don't think its going to come as a surprise. 
 
FREEMAN:  Yeah, I think that's very well said. And again, we're back. What's old is new again. 
 
Shelby Talcott, thank you so much for your time and for joining us early this morning. 
 
All right. And coming up straight ahead on CNN THIS MORNING, terrifying scenes in the skies, a plane crash in Kazakhstan kills dozens. We'll have the latest on the investigation. 
 
Plus, the pope's message of hope in a jubilee tradition. First, Pope Francis opens a holy door from inside a roman prison. 
 
And this, how Democrats are picking up the pieces after election setbacks. Less than a month out from a major shift in Washington.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:12:43]

FREEMAN:  CNN's Nada Bashir has more to tell us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Azerbaijan airlines flight was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, to Grozny in the Russian region of Chechnya, but it was forced to make an emergency landing around two miles from the Kazakh city of Aktau. 
 
Now, video circulating from eyewitnesses and those nearby the crash site shows that the plane was circling the airfield somewhat erratically before the crash, then bursting into flames as it hit the ground. 
 
Now, emergency response teams were quickly at the scene and remarkably, there were a number of survivors, including at least two children, according to authorities, with videos showing some of those injured emerging from the wreckage. But this is a moment of huge tragedy for those that that did not survive. According to authorities, there were 67 people on board the flight, including five crew members. Preliminary reports according to Russian aviation authorities suggest that the pilot was forced to attempt an emergency landing following a bird strike. However, investigations are still ongoing. 
 
Nada Bashir, CNN, in London.

FREEMAN:  Happening soon, Pope Francis will deliver the angelus prayer and blessing from his window in Saint Peter's Square in Rome. 
 
Earlier today, the 88-year-old pontiff opened the holy door in Rome's main prison, the first time a holy door has been opened inside of a prison. He also called for peace in Ukraine, in the Middle East. In his Christmas message on Wednesday. 
 <br>[05:15:00]
 
As CNN's Christopher Lamb reports, these events are all kicking off the 2025 jubilee year of hope. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT:  Pope Francis, emphasizing that the Christmas message is one of peace and reconciliation, calling on countries to lay down their arms and for enemies to be reconciled. 
 
Francis is making specific reference to the war in Ukraine and in Gaza. This is what he had to say. 
 
POPE FRANCIS, CATHOLIC CHURCH:  May there be the boldness needed to open the door to negotiation and to gestures of dialogue and encounter in order to achieve a just and lasting peace. May the sound of arms be silenced in the Middle East. 
 
LAMB:  The pope's remarks in Ukraine, coming after Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Christmas Day. The pope has repeatedly called for a negotiated peace settlement to end Russia's war against Ukraine. He's also been outspoken recently on what's been going on in Gaza, calling recent air strikes cruelty and also being in regular contact with the Catholic community in Gaza. 
 
Now, Pope Francis, making his remarks after launching the Catholic Church's jubilee year, an ancient tradition that focuses on forgiveness and pilgrimage and which began on Christmas Eve when Pope Francis opened the doors of the holy door of Saint Peter's Basilica, normally cemented shut. The door meant to represent God's mercy, the pope said. 
 
And that Francis is hoping that the message of the jubilee can be one of hope and one that can impact not just in Rome, but globally. Francis is 88 years old. He's got a packed schedule of events during the jubilee, but nevertheless, despite the difficulties the pope has when it comes to his physical mobility, Francis is determined to carry out the celebrations of the jubilee and hoping that the message that the jubilee represents will resonate across the globe.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:21:48]
 
FREEMAN:  And it's 21 minutes just past the hour. 
 
Here's your "Morning Roundup". 
 
New overnight, three people shot at the Phoenix Airport. Police say it started as a family dispute at a restaurant outside the security perimeter. Then the argument spilled into the parking garage where one person was stabbed. One female juvenile was detained. 
 
Plus, a convicted murderer is back in custody after escaping a Mississippi prison back on Christmas Eve. He was captured on Christmas. Thirty-three-year-old Drew Johnson is serving a life sentence in connection to a murder and several other attacks since he's been locked up.
 
And the bald eagle is now the United States national bird. About time. President Biden signed legislation making it official on Christmas Eve. Hard to believe the eagle just got official recognition, since it's, of course, featured on the United States seal and even his post alongside presidents including, who can forget this, then candidate Donald Trump during an interview with "Time Magazine" in 2015.

TRUMP:  I love Time Magazine, what you will do for a cover. This bird is seriously dangerous but beautiful.

FREEMAN:  Can't get enough of that. The all new CNN film "LUTHER: NEVER TOO MUCH" premieres new years day at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, right here on CNN. 
 
Still coming up after the break. It wasn't all touchdowns and field goals yesterday. I don't even remember the Ravens win. But I do remember Beyonce becoming the main event during her Christmas performance at the NFL halftime show. Can't wait to talk about that.
