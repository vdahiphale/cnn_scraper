THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[09:00:37] 
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Major protests happening right now in France. And a final decision on French President Macron's pension reform plan is expected tomorrow. We're live in Paris with the latest.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking overnight, an appeals court rules an abortion pill will remain available, but adds new restrictions on who can get them and how.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: It is being described as a one in 1,000-year event. Catastrophic flash flooding drenching parts of Florida. Some areas recording an estimated 20 plus inches of rain. It's closed an international airport. The Broward County mayor says it's the most severe flooding he's ever seen. 
 
We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. 
 
BOLDUAN: Happening right now in France, what you see right here, protesters setting fire to dumpsters in the city of Rennes (ph). And we want to show you what's also been happening in Paris. Demonstrators storming the headquarters of Louis Vuitton. 
 
It's all leading up to one critical moment, a final decision on whether or not French President Macron's pension plan can go through. We expect that ruling tomorrow. And ahead of that today, some 600,000 people are expected to take to the streets as we're already seeing several schools in Paris have canceled classes over concerns of violence. 
 
So, why are people so upset? The simple answer is, the French president is raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. And while the reforms are already controversial, it's the manner in which Macron has gone about it that really has people up in arms. The government, which did not have a majority to approve the change, used what's being described as a constitutional loophole to sidestep a full parliamentary vote to push it through.
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen standing by in the streets of Paris. He's on the phone with us just now
 
Fred, what are you seeing - what are you seeing there? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hello,
 
 Kate.
 
Well, it's a huge crowd that's gathered here. In fact, I'm walking right now with the protesters. The march has been going on I think about an hour now since it started. There have already been some confrontations that have gone on with the police. In fact, the crowd has walked past the constitutional council of the country. And as you guys were saying in the lead-in, that constitutional council, of course, will determine tomorrow whether or not this reform bill put forward by Emmanuel Macron, the president, whether or not all of it or parts of it are actually in line with the constitution of this country. And so the protesters tried to break through. The cops stopped them. There was a bit of a standoff. Those are the kinds of things that we've been seeing here. But we can really see that the police have a massive presence on the street. They obviously believe that there could be violence happening. Right now, from what I'm seeing here, a very peaceful march by and large, both marching through the streets, obviously not happy about this supposed reform bill. 
 
And really, you know, one of the things that we have to point out to our viewers is , yes, this is about to reform bill, yes, this is about raising the pension age, but for many French people, this is also about the way Emmanuel Macron has gone about doing this because he used executive power, he essentially bypassed the votes in parliament and many people here feel that's just not right. I mean I'm looking around here at the crowds. I can see a lot of folks who are, you know, seem pretty close to retirement age, but also a lot of young people who are coming out and who are protesting against this reform here because of the way that Emmanuel Macron sought (ph) to do this. 
 
And it's become a real problem for him. His poll numbers are very bad. And many people are already saying that he could be a so-called a lame duck president here in France, despite the fact that he still has four years left in his second term, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: All right, Fred Pleitgen, in the middle of it all, quite literally and figuratively Thank you so much, Fred. 
 
I mean you see already this morning, John, I mean, they are taking to the streets yet again. Let's see what that constitutional council decides.
 
BERMAN: And it tends to get worse as the day goes on and it gets closer to nighttime. So, we'll have to watch that very closely, Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Absolutely.
 
BERMAN: So, this morning, a flash flood emergency in south Florida. Officials are calling it a one in 1,000-years or greater rain event. Homes surrounded by water. This was the scene just moments ago in Broward County. A man in a kayak. He appears to be checking on neighbors there. In Fort Lauderdale, and active emergency declaration is in effect. 
 <br>[09:05:00] Car after car submerged after rain totals, usually seeing during a high end hurricane fell in just a matter of hours. The mayor calls this the most severe flooding he's ever seen. Look at that, just in the downtown. A helicopter camera crew captured this stranded driver as he had to swim to safety. 
 
As of now, the airport remains closed, flooded. Rain total estimates are topping 20 inches. That would be more rain in one day than the area has seen combined since November. 1st.
 
CNN's Carlos Suarez is in the middle of it all right now.
 
Carlos, just tell us what's happening around you. 
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, good morning.
 
So, we are in a neighborhood just north of Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport where the folks out here are not doing what law enforcement wants them to do, which is to stay off the roads. 
 
Dom (ph), if you can show them exactly what I'm talking about here. This is what they're trying to avoid. At this hour they're telling folks that live in this part of Broward County that they really shouldn't be doing exactly this because of all of the flooding that we've seen in the last 24 hours. This one neighborhood just north of the airport is where we've seen some of the more serious flooding. And what officials out here are trying to avoid is drivers getting stuck in their cars because as you go further up the road out here and you head out east, you can see exactly what we're talking about. A lot of the times these drivers will get to an intersection, they'll realize that their cars are probably not going to make it, and then they decided to go ahead and turn around. And, in some cases, they're going against traffic, which is exactly what law enforcement doesn't want them to do because now we're talking about other people's safety. 
 
Now, over at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport, the airport there is still closed at this hour. It may reopen around noon, but we're told that is going to depend on just how much of the water is able -- the flooding there is able to recede because right now the runways there are covered in water, as well as some of the taxiways. At this hour, according to Flight Aware, we're looking at well over 300 canceled flights out of FLL. That, again, is expected to go up if they do not reopen anytime soon. 
 
We caught up with a few passengers who are stuck there right now, and here's what they told us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EBONY DORSEY, TRYING TO TRAVEL TO CLEVELAND: We're trying to get back home, and they're telling us that the airport is closed. And so, at this point, we don't know what to do. 
 
MARK BARBER, STRANDED BY FLOODING: Everywhere was flooded out. Every which way they go down 84. So, I thought I could swing through the airport, but I'm stuck here. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUAREZ: Two final notes out here. Broward County schools has canceled classes for today because of all of this flooding. And we're expected to get more rain later today.
 
Guys.
 
BERMAN: All right, Carlos, thank you very much. Please stay safe. Stay dry, even though I think it's too late for that.
 
All right, with me now to understand sort of the historical reference point here, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. 
 
We're calling it a one in 1,000-years -- or officials are -- rain event. I do understand Florida saw a day like this back in 1980, which feels like 1,000 years ago. But this has to do with the probability it could happen in any given day. 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, that means that a one in 1,000 likelihood of this happening at any time during the given - any given year. So that's basically 0.1 percent probability. Think of it as an analogy. Well, let's say you're a lottery ticket owner, right? Do you win the lottery? Yes, it could happen. Very rare. Would it happen again tomorrow? Even more rare, right? 
 
So, to put this all into context, 20 to 25 inches of rain in less than a 24 hour period, that is like a high end hurricane slamming into southwestern Florida. Not uncommon or not unforeseen, but certainly something that could be majorly impactful.
 
And you can see the bullseye there right over the heavily populated Fort Lauderdale area. There's the airport and that is under that 10 to 20 inch range. But I just want you to see the radar and how much it lit up overnight. It trained over the same locations and that is why we are seeing some of this incredible, historic flooding that's taking place.
 
Now, the 24-hour rainfall record, as John mentioned, is just in the Key West area with flash flood warnings still in effect. Flood watches extend all the way down to Miami Dade County as well. 
 
John.
 
BERMAN: You know, Derek, I've been in Florida. I was there last fall when they had tons of rainfall. And sometimes the issue is, does the water have somewhere to go? Can this water drain out? 
 
VAN DAM: A very good question. So, the National Weather Service has a slogan, turn around, don't drown, right? Well, six inches of water on pavement can literally take your vehicle and start to stall it. Twelve inches of water can actually start to raise an entire vehicle. But 24 inches of moving water can wipe away an entire SUV.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: Yes. So, don't go on the road right now. Just wait until the safe.
 
VAN DAM: That's correct.
 
BERMAN: Derek Van Dam, terrific demonstration. Thanks so much.
 
Sara. 
 
SIDNER: New this morning, the Biden administration has vowed to continue to fight after an appeals court ruled to effectively keep a medication abortion drug on the market. 
 <br>[09:10:05]
 
That's because a new overnight ruling from the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals only partially puts on hold a Texas judge's order to suspend FDA approval of Mifepristone. But it also halted FDA rule changes that would have expanded access to the drug.
 
Joining us now to discuss this latest ruling, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers. 
 
Thank you so much for being here. 
 
It's a little confusing sometimes when you see the court's decisions. A recent survey found I think over half of all abortions in this country are done using pills, including Mifepristone. There are two that are used. 
 
What does the appeals court ruling mean for a patient, for example? 
 
JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, we're basically rolling things back to 2015. So, they stayed the portion of the ruling that overturned the 2000 approval of Mifepristone, but not the changes that happened in 2016 making it easier to use. So, we're back to 2015. So, it can be used, but only up to seven weeks, not 10 weeks. You have to go to the doctor, not another health care provider. You have to go three times and it cannot be mailed. So, a lot of the things that they've done to make it more accessible are now off the table, assuming, of course, the DOJ doesn't appeal and get the rest of the order stayed.
 
SIDNER: I want to ask you what the significance is of not allowing it to be purchased over the mail. Is hat because you have to go to your doctor, so you couldn't do that on your own anyway.
 
RODGERS: Yes, it makes it less accessible, right? You have to go into the doctor. You have to see a doctor three times under these regulations that were in place before 2016 or -- and are now at least theoretically in place again.
 
SIDNER: Yes, and everybody knows going to see the doctor can take some time just getting in there. 
 
Let's talk about health departments. Some of them, in some states, are stockpiling Misoprostol. It is the one of two drugs that are used together to cause an abortion. If the Texas approves -- or if the court approves the Texas ruling, what does that mean? Can doctors still prescribe it because the FDA says it's safe, or does that mean it's done? 
 
RODGERS: Well, nobody knows because we also have this ruling out of Washington state where Judge Rice (ph) said that in the 17 states that had filed this lawsuit, that it must be kept available. So, you have a real conflict now, which is why folks think it's going up to the Supreme Court sooner rather than later. You literally have, you know, all over the map in the country different things that are supposed to be happening that are in conflict. So, we're going to have to see an appellate court weigh in. 
 
SIDNER: You talk about this probably likelihood is it will end up at the Supreme Court. You have these two opposing decisions from two different judges in two different states. This was sort of a state's rights ruling that the Supreme Court did when they got rid of the Roe versus Wade decision. The original decision. 
 
I want to ask you, are we going to be just seeing this happen over and over and over again since that Roe versus Wade decision by the new Supreme Court?
 
RODGERS: Yes, it's hard to say. I mean it's hard to square what the court said in Dobbs about states' rights with which with what is happening now, right, a judge saying nationwide it's unavailable. The states cannot decide for themselves. So, yes, there's a lot of chaos. We're going to have to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in. 
 
I will say that this Fifth Circuit opinion, like the opinion below in Texas, is indefensible legally. There are problems with standing. There are other problems. So, I hope the Supreme Court does the right thing with it.
 
SIDNER: OK. That could happen at any point in time. 
 
Jennifer Rodgers, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
RODGERS: Thanks, Sara.
 
SIDNER: All right, Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: More coming up in the CNN NEWS CENTRAL, including who is behind the Pentagon leak. President Biden just said that his administration is getting close to answering that question. And there are also new details on that person coming from his friend. What that friend is now saying is next.
 
Plus, a shift in focus in the January 6th investigations. Special Counsel Jack Smith reportedly is now looking into whether Donald Trump or his allies used false claims about the election to raise money.
 
And new, economic data also just in, with officials warning the real fallout from the banking crisis could be a mild recession. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:18:20]
 
SIDNER: On our radar this morning, we're minutes away from the start of jury selection in Dominion's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox. The trial is still moving ahead, even though the judge plans to appoint a special master to investigate whether the network lied to him. He also slapped sanctions on Fox for withholding evidence. Opening statements are expected today. 
 
We're also - sorry, Monday. 
 
We're also watching the Tennessee state capitol where lawmaker Justin Pearson is set to be sworn back in any moment now. You see the excitement their. Memphis officials unanimously voted to send him back to the state house of representatives, even though Republican lawmakers expelled him for protesting on the house floor against gun violence. Another ousted lawmaker, Justin Jones, was also reinstated this week.
 
And actor Jamie Foxx is recovering after a health scare. His daughter, Corinne, shared the news on Instagram, praising quick action and great care for her dad. She said he suffered a medical complication but has not disclosed what that was.
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Moments ago in Dublin, President Biden suggested that the government is close to identifying the person behind the leak of those classified Pentagon documents. 
 
Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUESTION: Mr. President, could you give an update on that leak investigation, the leaked documents from DOD?
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I can't right now. There is a full-blown investigation going on, as you know, with the intelligence community and the Justice Department. And they're getting close. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: They're getting close, the president says.
 
CNN has also learned that the Pentagon is now limiting access to top military secrets after these leaks. 
 <br>[09:20:02]
 
And "The Washington Post" is reporting an interview with a friend of this man. A man that the friend says worked at a military base and eventually shared these classified military secrets with what became a friend group in an online chat room. 
 
CNN's Natasha Bertrand is that the Pentagon. She has much more on this for us.
 
Natasha, the conversation being reported by "The Washington Post" with this friend is wild, but what more are you learning here and also what the Pentagon is doing in light of all of this. 
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Kate. So what we're learning from this "Washington Post" story, they spoke to a member of this original group chat, this server called -- that was on Discord, which is a popular social media gaming platform, who said that this original leaker was a -- an enthusiastic, young, charismatic gun lover who essentially was posting these classified documents under the pseudonym OG (ph), and he was trying essentially to impress the young members of this group chat. The ages of them range from teenagers to young men. 
 
And they all kind of joined this group chat as part of really a community during the pandemic. They wanted to have someone to look up to essentially, and this person who began leaking these documents became kind of like a father figure to some of them, according to this member who spoke to "The Washington Post." And he began posting these classified documents because he believed that there was -- that the U.S. government was essentially a sinister force that was hiding important information from, you know, the public rite large. And so he was trying to convey to them certain important aspects of what he said he was seeing on a daily basis, highly sensitive, classified information that he was originally actually transcribing by hand and putting into the group chats before he started to then take photos of these documents and post them on to the server. 
 
Now, one of these members actually gave an interview -- a video interview to "The Washington Post" with his face blurred. Here's a little bit more of what he told the newspaper. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was -- he was a young, charismatic man who loved nature, God, who loved shooting guns and in racing cars. 
 
He did see himself as the leader of this group and he -- ultimately he was the leader of this group. And he wanted us all to be sort of super soldiers to some degree, informed, fit, with God, well armed, stuff like that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERTRAND: So, the identity of this alleged leaker is still not known. That member there told "The Washington Post" that he believes that he worked on a military base. But, look, the Pentagon now taking a lot of steps to restrict the flow of these highly classified documents so that a leak like this can't happen again. 
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: And according to President Biden just this morning, just now, they think they're getting close to identifying who this person is.
 
Great to see you, Natasha. Thank you.
 
John. 
 
BERMAN: So, new this morning, federal investigators looking into the January 6th insurrection are digging into former President Trump's campaign finances. "The Washington Post" reports that Special Counsel Jack Smith is investigating whether Trump and his team scammed donors by lying about the election, raising more than $200 million along the way. 
 
CNN's senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz following this for us.
 
Katelyn, what does this all mean? Where is Jack Smith headed with this? 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, John, it appears that the special counsel's office is asking the question, was there a rip-off and was it criminal after the 2020 election when Donald Trump brought in hundreds of millions of dollars into his coffers as he was pledging to his supporters that he was going to overturn the election? Obviously, that was not the case. There was not fraud there as he was professing to all of the people in all of his fundraising emails. 
 
But, what is going on here in this special counsel investigation is we've known for a while there's a really significant financial digging that they're doing. They're looking at all of that fundraising that was being done whether or not there were false representations made to the donors by Republicans, by Trump, by anyone who was sending out those emails, whether they knew what they were asking for was some sort of false pretense. 
 
And then we also know that there's a tracing of money that is going on. What happened to all of the money that came into Trump's PACs? How was it being spent? The new "Post" reporting is highlighting that there are subpoenas in recent weeks going to a whole host of people around Donald Trump and his campaign. Advisers, campaign aides, political consultants. And, really, is - it's a question of whether or not these advisers had doubts about what they were telling as they were pushing this fundraising campaign.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: Yes, what they knew and what they thought. Meanwhile the special counsel casting a very wide net.
 
Katelyn Polantz, terrific reporting. Thank you so much.
 
Sara. 
 
SIDNER: All right, just ahead, is the tide turning on inflation? You still are paying a lot at the grocery store, but, actually, prices are beginning to ease. A new key report is out this morning. What it could mean for more potential rate hikes.
 <br>[09:25:03]
 
And we're just moments away from the opening bell on Wall Street. Let's take a look at where U.S. futures are right now. The Dow up 0.18 percent.
