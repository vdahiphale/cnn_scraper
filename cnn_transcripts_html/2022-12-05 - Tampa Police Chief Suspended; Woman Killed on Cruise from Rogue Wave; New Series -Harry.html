DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING on this Monday morning. 
 
Here's what's coming up. 
 
A police chief pulls a do you know who I am card, and now she has been placed on leave. 
 
All-out chaos after a male lawmaker hits one of his female colleagues. The back story straight ahead. 
 
And the Baseball Hall of Fame just got a new member as other legends are denied. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: But first this morning, the Tampa police chief has been suspended. She's now under investigation. This is after body camera footage revealed that she flashed her badge and asked for special treatment during a traffic stop. This was in November. 
 
Watch.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good evening. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How you doing? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good. I'm Deputy Jacoby (ph) with the sheriff's office. I stopped you because you were driving with tag - or an unregistered vehicle with no tag on it in the roadway. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we were - we went to the club. It was closed. So, we went over and picked up some -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is your camera on? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm the police chief in Tampa. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, how you doing? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm doing good. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm hoping that you'll just let us go tonight. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, OK. Yes, so you -- I have to say, I - you look familiar. So -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I'm sure I do. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. So, all right, folks, well, have a good night. You're staying over here in East Lake Willis (ph)? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we -
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We live in East Lake Willis. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, OK. All right. Well, it's nice to meet you. So, I'm Deputy Jacoby. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Same here, my friend. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, so -
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Take care of yourself. Sorry to bother you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, take care. All right. No worries. No worries. Like I say, we have a lot of problem with the golf carting around here. You know, everybody comes out -
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, we don't normally come out but -
 <br>[06:35:01]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We never come out. We never, never.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The club was closed so we went up to the Greek place to get some food. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Gotcha. OK. All right. All right, then, well, take care. And it was nice meeting you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, all right.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right.

LEMON: Oh.
 
HARLOW: Let's go to CNN's Leyla Santiago in Miami. 
 
So, I wonder if she's responding this morning.
 
LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, she absolutely is. You know, that exchange was less than two minutes long in which she says, I'm hoping you can let this go. That's exactly what happened. 
 
But I want to point to the very first thing that you hear her say when she asks, is your camera on, and the deputy says yes, because that's key to her response. Let's go straight to the statement that she gave, which we can read together in which she says, in hindsight I realize how my handling of this matter could be viewed as inappropriate, but that was certainly not my intent. I knew my conversation was on video and my motive was not to put the deputy in an uncomfortable position. 
 
She has since apologized for what she called poor judgment in having that golf cart out there. And she's also said that she has called the sheriff's office to offer to pay for any potential fines associated with that, Poppy. 
 
HARLOW: So then, I mean, she's off duty, right, suspended, being investigated. 
 
SANTIAGO: Correct.
 
HARLOW: What comes next in the investigation? Is it a real question of if she's going to have to step down? 
 
SANTIAGO: Well, she is now on administrative leave pending an investigation. So, we'll have to wait and see what the results of that investigation are. But the mayor, let's - let's - let's see what the mayor is saying, read that statement with you, saying, we hold everyone accountable no matter their position, and this behavior was unacceptable. Chief O'Connor will go through the due process and face appropriate discipline. 
 
Now, the assistant chief is now acting chief. So, much of this, Poppy, is a wait and see. Let's see where this investigation takes them. 
 
HARLOW: OK. Leyla Santiago, reporting from Miami, thank you. 
 
An all-out brawl between lawmakers. Where this happened? We'll tell you next. And what sparked the chaos? 
 
LEMON: My goodness. 
 
Plus, a rogue wave slamming into a cruise ship, leaving one dead and others injured. What we're now learning. That's straight ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:41:31]
 
HARLOW: Wait until you see this. This morning, just wild video shows the moment tensions boiled over. This is in Senegal's parliament. And there's an all-out brawl. 
 
(VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: This brawl on the floor of their parliament came after a male lawmaker from the opposition party walked over and slapped one of his female colleagues from the ruling party during a budget presentation. The fight was apparently started when one lawmaker criticized the idea of the country's president seeking a third term in office. But that is not what we should be seeing, to say the least, Don. 
 
LEMON: Yes, right on. Right on, Poppy.
 
Well, this morning, an American woman is dead, four people are injured after an enormous wave crashed into their cruise ship. Officials say it's called a rogue wave because it's greater than twice the size of the surrounding waves. 
 
CNN's meteorologist Chad Myers joins us now to break all of this down. 
 
Chad, wow, a -- can you predict things like this or no? 
 
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Not really, Don. Not at all.
 
LEMON: That's why they call it rogue, right?
 
MYERS: That's why it's called a rogue wave. 
 
Think about this. Think about two people doing cannonballs into a pool on the opposite sides of the pool. Well, the wave in the middle is higher than the waves that they made independently. That's kind of what's happening here where we have this two-times factor where waves can crash into each other. Waves can also follow along the same paths, but then add themselves together. Smaller waves coming in and then all of a sudden you get a big wave when they all get aligned. 
 
This could - also could happen when you have wind coming in this direction and the waves get bigger. Think about what happens in a hurricane. Now, hurricanes don't have usually rogue waves, but they can. And especially if another wave comes this direction and adds to that big wave. And that's exactly what happened here. The cannonball -- I think the - the - the talking about that with one side and the other side and all of a sudden the splash is bigger in the middle, that's exactly how rogue waves happen. 
 
Now, there can be currents involved. There can be other wind directions. There can be two separate storms sending waves in opposite directions. So, a lot can go on here, Don.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Yikes.
 
LEMON: Being in the ocean can be very unpredictable.
 
Thank you very much, Chad Myers. 
 
MYERS: Yes.
 
LEMON: Appreciate that. 
 
We have this just in o CNN. A soccer star leaving the World Cup after his family home is broken into. We're live in Qatar.
 
HARLOW: Also, the new Harry and Meghan docuseries is set to release. What will it reveal about their relationship with Prince William and Kate? That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:48:01]
 
HARLOW: OK, the royals, a lot of attention being paid to the release of a trailer for the much anticipated Netflix docuseries "Harry and Meghan," which promises a more intimate look into the lives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRINCE HARRY: I had to do everything I could to protect my family. 
 
MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: When the stakes were this high, doesn't it make more sense to hear our story from us? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: And now you will. 
 
Joining us to talk about this, CNN anchors Max Foster and Bianna Nobilo. Max is also, of course, CNN's royal correspondent. Good morning to you both.
 
Max, what do you think? I mean they're much more free, complete completely free to tell their story now, right, given they don't have the royal responsibilities. How eye-opening is this? 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know nothing about it. That is literally all we have.
 
HARLOW: That's it?
 
FOSTER: No one's seen it. I don't think anyone in the royal family has seen it.
 
LEMON: Thank you. We'll see you later.
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: That's the story (ph). Yes.
 
LEMON: Coming up next -- 
 
HARLOW: Never mind. 
 
FOSTER: But isn't that the point, you know, everyone's nervous, I think. You know, not everyone, but people are nervous who, you know, have a stake in the royal family about what might be in it. And they're, obviously, going right back to, you know, before their relationship came out in public, they're talking about why they left the royal family and also I think the thing that might worry some people on this side of the pond is -- is they speak to historians who will discuss the state of the British commonwealth today and the royal family's relationship with the press. So, what more damage could it potentially do to the monarchy, I think that's the big question. 
 
LEMON: I can't believe how quickly, Max - I mean we were -- you and I co-anchored their wedding and it just seems like just yesterday. 
 
HARLOW: Oh, yes.
 
LEMON: And here we are, just a couple of years later, and now we have this.
 
I want to play this. This is from the 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey and then get you guys to discuss it. Watch this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: So, we have, in tandem, the conversation of, he won't be given security. He's not going to be given a title. 
 <br>[06:50:05]
 
And also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born. 
 
OPRAH WINFREY: There is a conversation -- hold - hold up. Stop right now.
 
MEGHAN: There's several conversations. There were several conversations about it. 
 
WINFREY: There's a conversation with you -- 
 
MEGHAN: With Harry. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: And so they're - they're talking about her son, Archie, and those were the conversations. 
 
But, listen, there was a whole lot of claims of racism and admittedly by some royal watchers, as you are, there was some credence to it. Do you think we're going to learn more and their story is going to be proven out in this series? 
 
FOSTER: Well, we have quite a good sense, don't we, of how they feel about their time under, you know, in the royal family and in that institution. And it's going to flesh that out. It's the true story. They are real stories. So, I think we probably will, won't we? 
 
NOBILO: We will. And I would imagine, given that they're involving journalists, we understand, as well as historians in this documentary, that the media coverage will be dissected. 
 
Don, as you mentioned, you know, there's been so much discussion about whether or not Harry and Meghan were hounded out of the country because of the racists or derogatory coverage in some of the newspapers. Now, a lot of journalists would deny that. I think "The Press Gazette" did a survey of British journalists and about 50 percent said that they detected racist undertones or, you know, more obvious remarks towards the duchess of Sussex in - in the press. 
 
So, it will be interesting to see how big of a part that plays in the documentary. But - but in - ingeitavibly (ph) there was so much support for them, too. Like, Don, you were at the wedding. Max, you were at the wedding. I was there on dress watch, which was a bit of a weird choice for me given I'm a bit of a tomboy. I like cage fighting. But, you know, there was so much support, an outpouring of love as well. So, like, there's, obviously, different shades of reality to - to this, and discussion. And there was absolutely support and love for the couple, but obviously extremely difficult and damaging elements too. 
 
HARLOW: What about at the queen's funeral, you were there covering, Don, and you, Max, and you, Bianca, that this moment -- I think we have some images to show, that they -- many people thought this might be a moment of reconciliation, especially for Prince William, Kate, and Harry and Meghan. What do you think? 
 
FOSTER: Well, you know, there was speculation that the Netflix documentary had been watered down as a result of this sort of coming together. Same for Harry's book, which is due out in January, but I think now the impression we're getting is that nothing's been watered down at all. 
 
And this moment, you know, this was a big moment visually. But behind the scenes they weren't speaking much and they haven't spoken much since. And I do get the sense that this time, as opposed to the Oprah interview, Prince Williams, now as prince of Wales, will be answering back to some of the accusations. 
 
LEMON: Yes. Do you remember - I mean, Max, that was breaking news. Like, we -- 
 
HARLOW: When they were together? 
 
LEMON: Yes. We took it live. We're like, wait a minute, here they are, they're coming out, because we hadn't seen them together.
 
FOSTER: Yes.
 
LEMON: And they thought that this was, you know, an olive branch or some sort of cooling. But we'll see if they talk about them in this documentary, in this series. 
 
Thank you both. Good to see you. 
 
FOSTER: Thanks for having us. 
 
LEMON: Thank you.
 
HARLOW: Thanks, guys.
 
LEMON: So, as RSV cases surge across the nation, children's painkillers are in high demand. 
 
HARLOW: We'll talk about that. 
 
Also, same-sex marriage once again before the Supreme Court today. This time the case involves a website designer and a question of free speech. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
[06:57:58}
 
HARLOW: This morning, excitement as the World -- at the World Cup as rising star Kylian Mbappe leads France to the quarter finals with a decisive victory over Poland. Mbappe now has nine World Cup goals all together, which is as many as soccer great Lionel Messi and more than media darling Cristiano Ronaldo. 
 
Our Don Riddell joins us love from Doha, Qatar, with more.
 
Certainly a star.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST: Oh, absolutely. A huge star. And, of course, this is not his first rodeo. Remember when he was just a kid he played in the last World Cup, scored four goals on that occasion, and led France all the way to the title. And this time he's got five goals in four games and he's playing like a leader out there. 
 
The French team has been beset with injuries. A lot of their top stars didn't make it to this World Cup. But with Mbappe out there at the age of 23, he's making it look like child's play.
 
I personally hope that their run soon ends. They're playing my team, England, at the weekend. And, of course, I'm not going to be cheering for (INAUDIBLE). No doubt about that.
 
LEMON: You know, I want to ask you something, Don, one Don to another. Just moments ago, we just learned England's Raheem Sterling left the World Cup. What happened? 
 
RIDDELL: Yes, this is really worrying. So, Raheem Sterling is one of England's top stars. He's one of the biggest stars in the Premier League. And, yes, he missed the weekend's win against Senegal because he had to return home because his family were victims of an armed home invasion. His family and young kids were at home when this happened. The manager, Gareth Southgate, said he spent a lot of time talking to Raheem to - to kind of help him out, but in the end he - he said he just wanted to go home because he's shaken and concerned about the well-being of his kids. 
 
There is talk that maybe he can return to the tournament, maybe play or be a part of the next game. But at this point he's out of here. He's back to England. 
 
The good news is, the team managed to win without him, but, you know, the team, obviously, really concerned about him and his family. 
 
LEMON: All right. Don Riddell, thank you very much. Appreciate that.
