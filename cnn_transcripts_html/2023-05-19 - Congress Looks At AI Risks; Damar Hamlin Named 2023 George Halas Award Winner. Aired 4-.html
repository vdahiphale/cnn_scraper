COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, my friends. We made it to the end of the week. It`s Friday, and Friday`s rock, and so do all of you. Remember, 
 
 what`s within influences, what happens without. So let`s get our minds right and finish this week strong. 
 
We start on Capitol Hill, where congressional leaders are deeply concerned with the risks of artificial intelligence, or AI. Now, with some 
 
 background, we`ve all heard how the impact of AI can change our daily lives, where it can even impact how we work within many industries, 
 
 impacting jobs across the globe. 
 
The tech company OpenAI has been at the center of all of this, especially after the wild success of ChatGPT, the company`s Chatbot tool, where it can 
 
 learn to mimic the grammar and structure of our writing and speech. 
 
This tool has now led to other tech companies building their own programs and apps to create arts, pictures, images, as well as impersonating other 
 
 people`s voices. Major tech leaders have been questioned about the risks of AI, including Twitter CEO Elon Musk. And statements like this from a CNBC 
 
 interview are raising a few eyebrows.

ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA, SPACEX AND TWITTER: There`s a strong probability that it will make life much better and that we`ll have an age of abundance 
 
 and there`s some chance that it goes wrong and destroys humanity. Hopefully, that chance is small, but it`s not zero. And so I think we want 
 
 to take whatever actions we can think of to minimize the probability that AI goes wrong.

WIRE: Now, earlier this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He faced serious questions about how his 
 
 program and other major tech intelligence apps can pose a threat to humanity and possibly put us all out of work. Altman, however, did urge 
 
 lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence, describing the technology`s current boom as potential printing press moment, as he described it, but 
 
 it`s a moment that he says requires safeguards. 
 
Also in his remarks, the OpenAI CEO says the potential for AI to be used to manipulate voters and target disinformation are among his areas of greatest 
 
 concern, especially because there`s going to be a presidential election next year. And he says these models are getting better. CNN`s Nick Watt has 
 
 more for us from the hearing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM ALTMAN, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, OPEN AI: My worst fears are that we cause significant, we, the field, the technology, the industry cause significant 
 
 harm to the world. 
 
NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Today`s Senate hearing is a crucial step in humanity`s effort to prevent that harm and to rein in the handful 
 
 of players controlling this tech. 
 
ALTMAN: So I think there needs to be incredible scrutiny on us and our competitors. 
 
WATT: His company created ChatGPT. You know, it can write a term paper or a song, captured imaginations and headlines. 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Could artificial intelligence soon put us all out of work?
 
WATT: AI has potentially world changing benefits equitable education, helping eradicate disease, transportation. AI can be life enhancing or 
 
 maybe an existential threat to humanity. 
 
GARY MARCUS, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NEURAL SCINCE, NYU: These new systems are going to be destabilizing. They can and will create persuasive 
 
 lies at a scale humanity has never seen before. Democracy itself is threatened.
 
WATT: As are jobs.
 
ALTMAN: GPT4 will, I think entirely, automate away some jobs, and it will create new ones that we believe will be much better. 
 
WATT: There are risks, like automated weapons we can imagine. 
 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: Could AI create a situation where a drone can select the target itself? 
 
ALTMAN: I think we shouldn`t allow that. 
 
GRAHAM: Well, can it be done? 
 
ALTMAN: Sure. 
 
WATT: And there are risks we can, for now, barely even comprehend.
 
ALTMAN: As these systems do become more capable, and I`m not sure how far away that is, but maybe not super far. I think it`s important that we also 
 
 spend time talking about how we`re going to confront those challenges. 
 
WATT: So, what do we do? 
 
SEN. JOHN NEELY KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA: Talk in plain English and tell me what, if any, rules we ought to implement. 
 
MARCUS: Number one, a safety review like we use with the FDA prior to widespread deployment. 
 
WATT: Suggestions today to licensed developers and/or the most powerful AI systems. 
 
ALTMAN: I think a model that can persuade, manipulate, influence person`s behavior or person`s belief. That would be a good threshold. I think a 
 
 model that could help create novel biological agents would be a great threshold. 
 
WATT: There was support in this room for a brand-new government agency to oversee AI. But -- 
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D) CONNECTICUT: For every success story in government regulation, you can think of five failures. 
 
WATT: And this technology is moving very, very fast. Google, Microsoft and others pouring in billions of dollars. Government can be glacial. 
 
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN, (D) ILLINOIS: When you look at the record of Congress and dealing with innovation, technology and rapid change, we`re not 
 
 designed for that. 
 
SEN. PETER WELCH, (D) VERMONT: I`ve come to the conclusion that it`s impossible for Congress to keep up with the speed of technology. 
 
WATT: There is, of course, an election in the U.S. just about 18 months away, and an avalanche of misinformation no doubt on its way. So there`s 
 
 not much time to deal with at least some of the issues at play here. 
 
Another big question, should the U.S. just create its own agency and then hope that the rest of the world will follow? Or should people be 
 
 concentrating on creating a global initiative, a global body to oversee AI? 
 
Now, listen, three minutes on Capitol Hill or three minutes on television is not nearly enough to deal with this massive topic. That committee of the 
 
 Senate will be meeting many more times. Many brains around the world working on this problem, and experts tell me that we, you, me, all of us, 
 
 we need to also educate ourselves about AI so we know what`s coming down the pike and how it might impact us. Nick Watt, CNN Los Angeles.

WIRE: Ten second trivia. 
 
In 1889, the U.S. Government opened two million acres for settlement in a region that became what state? 
 
California, Texas, Oklahoma, or Wyoming? 
 
Those who entered before the official start time were dubbed sooners, which is why Oklahoma is named the Sooner state. 
 
Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 is Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin, adding another incredible chapter to his recovery as he was honored with 
 
 the George Hollis award by the pro-football writers of America on Monday. 
 
Given each year to the NFL player, coach, or staff member that overcame adversity to succeed, Hamlin was cleared to resume football activities last 
 
 month after suffering cardiac arrest on the playing field in January. 
 
Now Danny Kellington, the Bills Assistant Athletic Trainer who helped save Hamlin`s life, gave a powerful commencement speech at his alma mater, 
 
 Oklahoma State over the weekend, telling graduates that preparation is one of life`s keys to success. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANNY KELLINGTON, BUFFALO BILLS ASSISTANT ATHLETIC TRAINER: Thankfully, we restored Damar`s heartbeat. We were ready. It`s a bit odd to be the person 
 
 reporters are talking about when they say, Danny Kellington is a hero. It`s very humbly. I`ve said repeatedly that I am not a hero. But I will tell you 
 
 what I was that day. I was ready. When unexpected doors open or life changes course, trust that your experiences have led you there, and you 
 
 will be ready. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Wise words, Mr. Kellington. You don`t have to get ready if you stay ready. There`s no such thing as luck when it comes to true success, right? 
 
 Most often, true success is discipline and preparation meeting a moment.
 
Special shout out is going to Beverly Middle School in Beverly, Massachusetts, rise up. Thanks to all of you who`ve learned, laughed and 
 
 spread love this week. Here`s a look at some of the most memorable moments we`ve shared. Remember, you are more powerful than you know. I`m Coy Wire. 
 
 This is CNN 10. It`s been a blessing to spend this week with you.
