And former Vice President Mike Pence telling CNN the January 6 Committee has no right to his testimony. A member of that committee joins us to respond.
 
Plus, the bankruptcy that has thrown the entire crypto market into a tailspin. The 30-year-old former executive, drawing comparisons to Bernie Madoff with big name celebrities dragged into the financial meltdown. (MUSIC)
 
KEILAR:  Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Brianna Keilar. Jake Tapper is on assignment. 
 
We begin with the end of an era in Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing today she is stepping down as leader of the Democratic caucus after serving for 20 years in that role. Pelosi was the first woman to lead a political party in either chamber of Congress, the first woman to serve as speaker of the House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PELOSI:  Never what I have thought that someday I would go from homemaker to House speaker. When I came to the Congress in 1987, there were 12 Democratic women. Now there are over 90 and we want more. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  Pelosi will serve out her to your congressional term. The two other top house Democrats, following her lead, saying they also step aside, paving the way for a new generation of leaders. Also today, less than 24 hours after CNN projected Republicans will take control of the House, GOP members wasted no time. 
 
This morning, Congressman Jim Jordan and James Comer left, or held a press conference illustrating their plans to investigate President Biden and his family over what they say are potential ties to foreign governments, which they see could be a threat to national security. 
 
Let's start with CNN's Manu Raju, who's on Capitol Hill with reaction to Pelosi's historic announcement and the future of Democratic leadership in the House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After two decades at the top of her party in Congress, ushering through massive legislation -- 
 
PELOSI:  The bill is passed. 
 
RAJU:  -- winning the majority twice, becoming the first woman to lead the House, and now losing the majority for the second time as speaker -- 
 
PELOSI:  The House will be in order. 
 
RAJU:  Nancy Pelosi announced she would step aside. 
 
PELOSI:  I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress. For me, the hours come for a new generation to lead the Democratic Caucus that I so deeply respect. 
 
RAJU:  At 82, the Democrat has represented San Francisco in the House for 35 years, saying, she would continue serving and Congress whose makeup has markedly changed.
 
PELOSI:  When I came to the Congress in 1987, there were 12 Democratic women. Now there are over 90. And we want more. 
 
RAJU:  The news prompting an immediate shake up. Pelosi's current number two, Steny Hoyer, announcing that at the age of 83, he would not run for leadership. 
 
Current number three, 82-year-old, Jim Clyburn, signaling he also will let a new team ascend, paving the way for Hakeem Jeffries, a 52-year- old Brooklyn Democrat, as a likely next Democratic leader. 
 
REP. JOYCE BEATTY (D-OH):  I'm very comfortable saying I will believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries. 
 
RAJU:  Jeffries' top two deputies could be 59-year-old, Catherine Clark, and 43 year old, Pete Aguilar, all expected to run in the November 30th leadership election. It's a generational change some have long sought. 
 
REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA):  He's a historic speaker who's accomplished an incredible amount. But I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter. 
 
RAJU:  The daughter of a Baltimore mayor who rose the ranks in her state party, first became speaker in 2007, leading the opposition against George W. Bush over the Iraq war. Three years later, shepherding through the Affordable Care Act under Barack Obama. 
 
After her party was swept into the minority, becoming speaker again in 2019, where she battled Donald Trump, making him the only president impeached twice, including after January 6th, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol and targeted the speaker. 
 <br>[16:05:12]
 
Can you imagine a caucus not run by Nancy Pelosi? 
 
REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY):  Well, I hope that we don't have to see that. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAJU (on camera):  Democrats are also recognizing the new political reality in Washington with the House majority coming in led by Republicans in January. Two key committee chairman earlier today, Jim Jordan, James Comer, outlining their plans to investigate President Biden as long -- with both his family and their overseas business dealings, focusing in on his son, Hunter Biden, as well, as they said they've interviewed whistleblowers who did Hunter Biden's laptop. 
 
The White House has pushed back and called these debunked conspiracy theories. And also though, Brianna, the next order of business for Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, is to get the votes to become House speaker. Two members of the hard-right Freedom Caucus told me tonight that McCarthy does not have the votes to become speaker -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  Adding to the drama. 
 
Manu Raju, thank you so much. 
 
As House Democrats prepare to new leaders, House Republicans are preparing for new power. This morning, GOP members of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees made clear their plans to investigate President Biden and his family foreign business dealings. 
 
I want to bring in CNN's Sara Murray and CNN's Jeremy Diamond on this. 
 
So, Sara, most of us have heard Republicans calling for these investigations. Manu was just talking about this. The president's son, Hunter, over the past few years. Today's press conference suggested actually a more widespread investigation. 
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. I think we've heard a lot about Hunter Biden, and I think what Comer as well as Jordan want to drive home today is that they are really trying to tie this back to President Biden. They want to delve into the finances surrounding Hunter Biden, but also other members of the Biden family because they believe there could be, you know, problematic activity there. 
 
Part of their issue is, they've asked for a lot of information, as you can imagine, from the Treasury Department, from other, you know, individuals and agencies. When they were it more in the minority, they cannot get a lot of that. So they fired off this new round of letters today that sort of gives you a roadmap to the kind of things they're seeking. So, you know, they fired off a letter to treasury, asking for these bank reports that they believe could show some kind of suspicious activity, even though these kinds of reports are inconclusive and are relatively common. 
 
They fired off a letter to, you know, someone who owned a gallery where Hunter Biden's paintings are being sold, seeking information about who was buying Hunter Biden's paintings. 
 
So I think we are going to see a wide-ranging investigations and this is just the beginning of it, Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  And, Jeremy, how is the White House preparing for this? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Brianna, these preparations have been going on for months. My sources described to me as among the earliest and most comprehensive by any administration ahead of a midterm election. They began in the spring with the hiring of key lawyers and communications officials, who will handle the response to these Republican oversight efforts. 
 
And they continued over the summer with a small team of lawyers, communications specialist, as well as legislative affairs officials, combing over these hundreds of letters from Republicans going over TV interviews for some of these top Republican lawmakers, to map out where these Republican investigations are headed, and how the White House will respond. 
 
Another thing that they've been doing is working directly with the agencies across the administration, who are expected to be targets of some of these investigations. One of those meetings happened more than four months ago, with top White House officials, top DHS officials, sitting down together in the Roosevelt room at the White House to prepare for this oversight and for the possibility that Republicans might try and impeach the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 
 
Now, they've already hired some officials to handle this oversight, but I'm told over the next two months, you can expect that team to be beefed up with additional lawyers to be hired in the coming months. 
 
KEILAR:  All right. We'll be looking for that. 
 
Jeremy and Sara, thank you so much. 
 
Let's discuss what comes next with new House leadership for the Democratic Caucus with our panel here. 
 
And when I think about it, sort of back in my day, when I was young, I mean, Nancy Pelosi was still in charge of the Democrats. You know, back when we were young, congressional correspondents, you were young Hill staffers, she was still there. I mean, it's hard to overstate what a momentous day this is. 
 
But also, talk about it this new potential lineup of Democratic leaders we are going to see. 
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Sure, so yes, I was there also, looking at those pictures of her when she first became speaker back in 2007. I remember covering the Hill and the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which was this a huge accomplishment for her. Even then President George W. Bush was willing to nod to her and talk about, you know, what a big moment it was that she had the speakers gavel. 
 
But it's clear that there was a lot of pressure, you, know Democrats were ready to move on to this next generation and when you tick through the ages of the people involved, including 43-year-old Pete Aguilar, who I think average age is much closer to the people at this table than perhaps the current leadership. I think it's indicative of that. 
 
I think the challenge is going to be, I mean, there's a reason she was in charge for as long as she was. She was really, really get to what she does and she's a very serious, she's a heavyweight in every sense. Legislatively, politically, the way that she's build relationships with the different factions of her caucus, and that's going to be the challenge for Hakeem Jeffries to live up to that. 
 
KEILAR:  What do you guys see these next couple years, as far as Democrats and Republicans, Brendan, looking like? 
 
BRENDAN BUCK, FORMER TOP AIDE, HOUSE SPEAKERS PAUL RYAN AND JOHN BOEHNER:  Conflict. That's what we saw last time Republicans were in charge with the Democratic president. And I think we can only have more of that in-store. 
 
There's not much of a legislative agenda for Republicans. They're going to have maybe a four-seat majority. They can't do a whole lot and there's no real of overlap.
 
So what's going to happen is a lot of infighting, excuse me, a lot of fighting with the administration. The report you just showed, they have a balance they need to walk between feeding the base, who a lot of Republicans back home want to get to the bottom of Hunter Biden. I don't know why and I'm sure if you live in the fever swamp of the far- right, that is important to you. 
 
But most people don't care about that, so they need to also have some pretty serious oversight. I think there are some issues where there have been overlooked, whether it's the border, or the withdrawal from Afghanistan, really important things that are worthy of getting into, the Democrats, frankly, overlooked when they were in charge. 
 
But I think most of the headlines that are going to come next year are going hard after Biden, so they can weaken him going into 2024. 
 
KEILAR:  Because let's look at some of the investigations of what they're likely going to look at here. Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, Hunter Biden, of course, which he mentioned and questioned the value in. The Afghanistan withdrawal, COVID, and the Justice Department investigation of Trump. 
 
You've been on the other side of investigations. You've been on the administration side of this, Stephanie. I wonder how you think the Biden administration will tackle this. 
 
STEPHANIE CUTTER, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I've been on both sides of it actually. I think the administration, there's a lot of people who have gotten through these wars inside that White House, who know how to prepare for this. And I just want to address one thing that Brendan said. You know, they are going to try to weaken Biden with these investigations. What's going to end up happening is they are going to strengthen him, and because they are going to overreach, they will be talking about things that people just frankly don't care about. 
 
You know, the list that you just ran through, if you look deeper in there, the investigation into the Department of Justice, you know, last night, it was about investigating how DOJ handled the insurrectionists after they were arrested. Is that what the American people want to talk about just after we have this election? Where democracy was lifted up, where the red wave was barely a trickle because people were rejecting this craziness? 
 
So, I think people there is going to be a lot of infighting. I think it's going to be a lot of investigations. I would be shocked if something real is uncovered here, particularly on President Biden and his family. HUNT:  You know, it's interesting the last time we were dealing with a
 
 lot of this on the Republican side was in the context of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi. Quite frankly, McCarthy's first bid for speaker was derailed because he was willing to admit in public, or did admit in public, that the Benghazi investigation was political. 
 
A couple things have changed. One, nobody seems afraid to say this is about politics anymore, right? Our culture has changed. So, that seems to be perfectly fine. 
 
But second of all, Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton and there are a lot of people -- I mean, you've seen Hunter Biden criticized on Fox for his struggles with addiction. There are a lot of Americans out there who identify with having a struggle like that in their own family. It's just a completely different ball game and so, I think if Republicans are going to approach it the way they did then, they may be in for a rude surprise. 
 
KEILAR:  I wonder, Laura, to if Republicans may be having their investigation planned, assuming they would go into the majority, should've looked at the election and maybe thought about if they need to change their approach. And it seems like perhaps they have not. 
 
LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I think that the way that Republicans appeared to be, and Brendan made -- with the way they appear to be reading the election results is that they want to distance themselves, some of them, for former president Trump. They blame him for those losses, as opposed to necessarily what those candidates that he supported were running on, which candidates like Kari Lake and others were running on full on election denialism and then they lost their races. 
 
The ones that were running statewide, now, a lot of election deniers were reelected to the House. And some were elected to gubernatorial, so the governor's mansion. But again, they appear to only be saying their responses, maybe it's time for us to distance ourselves from the former president. Not necessarily change what exactly they're running on. 
 
And the other thing I would just note is that "The Wall Street Journal" and other news outlets have looked heavily into the Hunter Biden, Joe Biden potential for the president to have known about the ventures and the business dealings and "The Wall Street Journal" last year found that the president, after looking overall the corporate records, did not have any involvement in that. 
 
So, I think that again, whether or not House Republicans, it seems as though they're admitting that it's very politically motivated. Jim Jordan said that exactly what Casey is saying, as well as Comer, who's looking to take control of the oversight committee. 
 <br>[16:15:04]
 
CUTTER:  And I just want to, you know, you asked, shouldn't they have adjusted after the election results? They didn't learn anything from this election results. They're still pursuing this crazy oversight path. 
 
I think the reason for that is because Kevin McCarthy, you know, the purported leader, is concerned about winning his caucus election to be speaker, and not really thinking about the long term and how this affects the party and, and their long term prospects. That's what they are going to be caught up with for several weeks now, which is a really dangerous place to be. 
 
That's the big difference between Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi. She would never let this happen. 
 
KEILAR:  And I want to look ahead to 2024, because Jake asked former Vice President Mike Pence about his future political ambition during the CNN town hall last night, and this is what he said. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE PENCE (R), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT:  I think that we will have better choices than my old running mate. I think that America longs to go back to the policies that were working for American people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  Better choices. OK, just say it, just say it, Mike Pence, are you one of those choices? 
 
I mean, what do you think, Brendan? 
 
BUCK:  Well, this is a difficult balancing act, because he likes to talk about the great achievements of the Trump-Pence administration. But, of course, if you're going to run against Donald Trump, you have to make the case of why he was bad. And I just don't know how you're able to do that. 
 
I don't know who Mike Pence -- look, I would love Mike Pence challenges Donald Trump, I think Donald Trump would be a terrible candidate for us, a nominee for us, but I just don't know how excites anyone, I don't know how he can successfully wage a campaign against the person whose administration he was a part of. So, God bless him, I hope he does it, but that's a tough road. 
 
HUNT:  It's a really tricky line to walk for Pence partly because he was all in until January 6th, right until the end. And so that had alienated a lot of people, you know, to the extent there's a never Trump wing in the party, for people who don't like Trump, that's alienating, the people who are successful in the never Trump or semi Trump Republican Party are people who have sort of tolerated him, pushed back when required, but mostly tried to talk about other things, and the Trump base, there is some openness, and maybe they would vote for Brian Kemp, but they think Mike Pence is a traitor, and so it is a tough place. 
 
KEILAR:  For the right kind of person, could it be an opportunity or no? What do you think? 
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  I think that -- look, the Republican like Mike Pence, he on one hand, I thought that the answers to Jake were awkward when Jake was trying to ask him, aren't you angry? Aren't you still angry? Your family was put in danger, and he really didn't have a full- throated answer on that, and it is much more on forgiveness and much more about clearly that he's trying to maybe potentially be able to win the Trump base. And right now, I think that those base of voters are still with the Trump supporters or someone more in the mold of Ron DeSantis. 
 
BUCK:  If it's Mike Pence or Ron DeSantis, someone has to go at Donald Trump and he wasn't willing to do it last night.
 
KEILAR:  Yeah, it is very tough and we see what happens when that happens.
 
Thank you all. Really appreciate the conversation. 
 
Mike Pence also told CNN why he will not appear before the January 6th committee and I'll be asking a committee member for a response about the panel's likely final days.
 
Plus, a deadly shootout today off the coast of Puerto Rico involving suspected drug smugglers and U.S. border agents. The tragic end to this one, head. 
 
System overload and now a major move by Ticketmaster canceling sales for Taylor Swift's new tour. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:22:22]
 
KEILAR:  In our world lead, the Ukrainian investigators have joined the probe into the deadly missile strike inside of Poland on Tuesday, a source telling CNN. This is as we are learning Russian forces are carrying out artillery strikes across Ukraine today. 
 
As Sam Kiley reports, constant strikes from Russia is a brutal reality, even Ukrainians in liberated areas cannot escape from.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Olga is proud of her garden, proud of her home and proud to have lived through eight months of Russian occupation. Now free, her focus is on the future although the present is still dangerous. 
 
OLGA GRITSUNIAK, LOCAL RESIDENT (through translator):  Look at this, how we fortified our basement with the old man, because of how they shoot from there over the river. There's some shrapnel pieces from our yard. 
 
Do you see how sharp they are? 
 
KILEY:  The day before yesterday? 
 
GRITSUNIAK:  Thank God we survived all this. We hid in the cellar for ages. Two days ago, there were a lot of explosions and today, it is calm. 
 
KILEY:  There is no power, no water supply, but plenty of resourcefulness. 
 
GRITSUNIAK:  We are storing water here, in drums. 
 
KILEY:  This summer, under Russian occupation was not wasted. 
 
GRITSUNIAK:  Tomato juice, salads pickled in a jar, canned grapes, tomatoes, juices, and even canned currants. 
 
KILEY:  You are obviously a born survivor. 
 
GRITSUNIAK:  Well, I am. He's the one who's scared and I'm not. 
 
KILEY:  Just a few days ago, this village was the scene of ferocious fighting as the Russians were driven out of this part of the Kherson region. The problem for those who remain behind, the villages here, is that the war is not over because the Russians are easily within range and hit this place on an almost daily basis. 
 
GRITSUNIAK:  In the next village, the few locals left were too anxious about a Russian return to speak on camera. And we were told to stay out of sight. Five Russian rockets landed here this morning, we were told. 
 
Liberated roads and tracks are still heavily mined, slowing efforts to rebuild. Russia has retreated from here. But a shift in much of its effort to attacking Ukraine's power grid and infrastructure. 
 
Civilian targets are a priority for long-range Russian missiles. 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Dozens of missiles, civilian sites are the main target. Russia is waging war on electricity and heat for people by blowing up power plants and other energy facilities. 
 <br>[16:25:00]
 
KILEY:  Fifteen civilians, hospitalized after this strike in Dnipro. Temperatures are falling, millions are often without power. In the cities, that is a looming nightmare. Here, they may be better prepared. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KILEY (on camera):  Now, of course, the Russians are under attack from Ukraine in the east, where the fighting has got very, very intense in the Donetsk oblast. Things have gone a little quieter, notwithstanding the bombardments across the river in Kherson province. But the Ukrainians are still making these desperate, desperate pleas to try to get more anti-aircraft equipment in from NATO and other Western allies, so that they can tip the balance in the air in their favor as they are on the ground. 
 
KEILAR:  All right. Sam Kiley, live for us in Ukraine, thank you for that report. 
 
And just in, the chairman of the January 6th Committee has just commented on the panels final report. What this could mean for its unfinished business, as Republicans prepared to take control of Congress, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:30:33] 
 
KEILAR: In our national lead, a college community desperate for answers five days now after the brutal killings of four University of Idaho students. The police insist they can't say if they have identified a suspect or if there is still a threat to the community. 
 
As CNN's Veronica Miracle reports, we're learning two roommates in the house at the time of the killings. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHIEF JAMES FRY, MOSCOW POLICE:  We do not have a suspect at this time, and that individual is still out there. 
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Many questions and fear in Moscow, Idaho. 
 
FRY:  The four were stabbed with a knife, but no weapon has been located at this time. 
 
MIRACLE:  Ava Driftmeyer lives nearby. 
 
AVA DRIFTMEYER, STUDENT, UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO:  We're 100 feet away. You know, how close is this person, are they still around? 
 
MIRACLE:  The investigators say that the attacks took place early hours Sunday, sometime after 1:45 a.m., but they didn't find the victims Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves until that afternoon when a 911 caller reported an unconscious person. 
 
CATHY MABBUTT, LATAH COUNTY CORONER:  There is quite a bit of blood in the apartment, and it is a pretty traumatic scene to find four dead college students in a residence. 
 
MIRACLE:  The prosecuting attorney telling NBC police do know who the 911 caller is, but they will not release their name or information they received. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The investigators are trying to ascertain why there was a delay, and what occurred and what was heard. 
 
MIRACLE:  Police say there were no signs of forced entry into the home. 
 
AARON SNELL, IDAHO STATE POLICE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  The evidence inside of the home says that they believe somebody targeted these individuals for some reason. 
 
MIRACLE:  Law enforcement says that surveillance video shows that two of the students ordering food from a food truck is being used to establish a time line. Two of the victims attended a campus party, the two who visited the food truck had earlier gone to a bar in downtown Moscow. Police say two roommates at home in the time of the stabbings did not witness the attacks. 
 
SNELL:  They were not injured and the two roommates have fully cooperated with the detectives and they have assisted with the investigation. 
 
MIRACLE:  Are they considered suspects? 
 
SNELL:  They haven't been ruled out. 
 
FRY:  We are not just focused on them, but everybody who is coming and going from the residence. 
 
SNELL:  The campus now virtually empty, students excused from classes and the students also saying their sense of security has now been shattered. 
 
DRIFTMEYER:  The fact that there's no answers is like the worst feeling ever. Like I know that all of us are waiting to get out of here as fast as we can. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIRACLE (on camera):  Brianna, here at the scene, we have seen investigators coming through evidence, taking photos inside the apartment. It remains a very active scene here.
 
Of the people that are still in the area, they say that the only reason that they are here is to wrap up their business and get home as quickly as possible. Many of them saying that a lot of their neighbors have left out of fear and they're getting out as soon as they can -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  It's is so senseless. Veronica Miracle, thank you for that report. 
 
Also in our national lead, Lieutenant Mariano Vargas has resigned from the Uvalde Police Department, the city's mayor tells CNN. Vargas' resignation comes ahead of a rare Saturday special meeting called by the city to decide his fate. New audio obtained by CNN showed Vargas knew children were alive in Robb Elementary last May and needed to be rescued, but failed to have officers intervene. 
 
And ahead, Ticketmaster's major move today after a system overload for Taylor Swift tickets. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:38:08] KEILAR:  This is just into CNN and our politics lead, January 6 Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson says the panel is expecting to publish its final report by early next month. He's also criticizing former Vice President Mike Pence's decision to not cooperate with their investigation, calling his refusal harmful for democracy. 
 
With us now is Democratic Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren of California who is also on the January 6th Committee. 
 
Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us this evening. We appreciate it. 
 
REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Of course. 
 
KEILAR:  So with this report coming in early December, will the committee make criminal referrals to DOJ then? 
 
LOFGREN:  Well, that is something that we have not yet decided, and as I think I have mentioned before, the subcommittee of the committee which is all of the lawyers are going through the evidence, and trying to reach a conclusion on what we would recommend to the full committee, and that process has not yet been completed. 
 
KEILAR:  OK. And I also want to ask you about what's really quite a momentous day here in Washington. You served in Congress alongside Nancy Pelosi for 28 years, you both represent districts in the Bay Area, and you were the first person that she embraced and spoke to after her announcement today, this is, and I'm sure you feel this, the end of an era today. 
 
LOFGREN:  Yeah. She is the most effective speaker in the history of the United States. Someone I consider a friend, someone who has been a role model for many of us. She is a fabulous speaker person, you know, I respect her decision of course, but the Congress will really just not be the same without her leadership. She is an amazing person. 
 <br>[16:40:01]
 
KEILAR:  And we are expecting it to very much change, because you have Congressman Hoyer and Clyburn who are also leaving the leadership, Hakeem Jeffries unopposed, so far, to succeed Pelosi, and it appears that Catherine Clark and Pete Aguilar.
 
And I do want to mention, we accidentally put up the wrong photo of Pete Aguilar, an incorrect photo, for which I want to apologize for earlier in the show, those are the folks right now who are appeared to poise to take those leadership positions if they continue to move in that direction unopposed, when it comes to Hakeem Jeffries, do you support him, and how do you think he would change things for the caucus? 
 
LOFGREN:  I think that he is very able, and I think that he will be elected minority leader, and since we are in the minority, it's not speaker. I'm glad that Nancy Pelosi will be around, because I think that for all of us, she's got something to add by way of mentorship. As I say, Hakeem is an enormously talented person, but stepping in Nancy Pelosi's shoes, well, they are stilettos, and so Hakeem will not be doing that, but it is a big job. 
 
And I think that we are a team here on the Democratic side, and we are all going to be working together in the interest of the American people. 
 
KEILAR:  And back to the January 6th committee, and what impact can the committee have before it is expected to basically die with this new Congress? 
 
LOFGREN:  Well, you know, Select Committees only live for the duration of the congress, and that was always true of this select committee, and we have known it from the very beginning. We are aiming to get our report done. I am glad that to hear that Chairman Thompson's will be done in early December, and that is aspirational, and we are working very hard doing the editing, but certainly, we will be done next month. I think that it will be useful for the American people and for history. 
 
We are also going to make available the evidence that we have acquired over these many months, and I think that will also be very useful for people whether or not every element is incorporated into the actual report. 
 
KEILAR:  Former Vice President Mike Pence was speaking with our Jake Tapper about testifying before the committee, and this is that moment from the town hall last night. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE PENCE (R), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT:  Congress has no right to my testimony. Congress doesn't report to the White House. The White House doesn't report to the Congress, and I believe in the separation of powers and to avoid what would be a terrible precedent. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  What's your response to that? 
 
LOFGREN:  Well, I think it is pretty ridiculous really. He has had, and if it is a separation of powers issue, he would not have had the chief of staff, his counsel and all of those other top people come over to speak to us. 
 
He knows, I would hope, you know, that former vice president is not a lawyer, but that argument is not correct. 
 
Former presidents have come over, and I mean, numerous former presidents have testified before the Congress, and certainly, he could have done so. We were working with his counsel over an extended period of time to try and work it out. I assume that is now off of the table, and given that it is almost the end of November, that is probably the last word, but it is an unfortunate decision on his part. 
 
KEILAR:  You mean he would not have allowed them or blessed him to come speak to the committee, I'm assuming the sort of your perception of what happened there? LOFGREN:  Well, if it's a separation of powers issue, not only do you
 
 not come, but your chief, you know, your chief of staff and your counsel and everyone else doesn't come, and he made them amply available to us, so the separation issue, I don't think, holds any water. 
 
He does not want to come. I think it is a mistake on his part. I think that it cheats history of his story, but there, you have it. 
 
KEILAR:  Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren of California, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
LOFGREN:  You bet. 
 
KEILAR:  And again, just a quick apology to Congressman Pete Aguilar for an incorrect graphic that incorrectly identified him earlier in the show. 
 
CNN is also live across the border in Mexico. The confusion, the misinformation, and false hope as migrants tried to desperately get into the U.S. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:49:08]
 
KEILAR:  In our national lead, a U.S. Customs and Border agent is dead, killed today in a shootout with suspected drug smugglers. Custom officials say a total of three agents were shot as they came upon a boat off the coast of Puerto Rico this morning. The two injured agents are in a San Juan hospital. One of the alleged drug smugglers was killed and another has been arrested. 
 
And we are back with our world lead. Homeland Security officials are shoring up resources along the southern border ahead of Title 42 ending next month. The Trump era immigration policy activated during the pandemic has been used to send millions of migrants to cross into the U.S. back to Mexico. 
 
CNN's David Culver is in Mexico just over the border from Texas. 
 
So, David, what are you hearing from migrants waiting to seek asylum? 
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Brianna, there is a lot of frustration. There's a lot of anger.
 <br>[16:50:01]
 
These are some of the folks, by the way, in this encampment trying to get to what has become their makeshift home. And I think there's just uncertainty overall. 
 
Before I show you some of the images that we've gathered earlier, take a look at this. This is one of the encampments. It's got hundreds of tents. Some of these folks have been set up for several weeks. It stretches all the way down on the Mexican side of the river, and they just wait. 
 
Now, yesterday was an interesting day because in the past 24 hours, they had estimated about 3000 people who were in these tents, many families. And they say, two thirds of that, as soon as they heard about the judge's ruling, decided to go across the river. 
 
And you can see some of the images. You can see folks who are making that track. It really, and this part of the river, isn't all that dangerous to get across. What they tell you is as soon as they step onto U.S. soil, they're really not sure what they are going to encounter because as we know, Title 42, this policy is still in place. They could still be expelled. If it's going to be held against them and they're seen as illegally crossing into the U.S. 
 
And so, it's a frustrating matter for them to try to navigate right now. We caught up with one family, the family of four kids. They made it here from Venezuela, crossed over seven different countries in four months. And they showed us their place and describe their conditions. Take a listen.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
CULVER:  He said, initially the started with just a box to stay in and then eventually they got into a tent. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CULVER:  And you can see, across the border, you actually have a U.S. border control there. They are standing by and actually helping some of the folks get to line and figure out how to register, how to be processed, and how to eventually make it either into the country or get sent back here -- Brianna.
 
KEILAR:  David Culver from the border, thank you so much for showing us the conditions there. 
 
Celebrities are facing lawsuits in a disgraced CEO showing very little remorse. New developments in the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:56:40]
 
KEILAR:  In our money lead, Ticketmaster won't be able to shake it off. In fact, they're kind of the anti-hero in this one. The ticket sales company says, it has to council tomorrow's general sale for Taylor Swift's Heiress Tour due to extraordinarily high demand. This move comes as more than 2 million tickets were sold during the presale for the concert, leaving an insufficient number of tickets left for the general sale. 
 
The debacle is stirring up outrage across the country among Swifties and politicians, including Senator Amy Klobuchar who says she has serious concerns about Ticketmaster's operations. 
 
And now to the dramatic rise and fall of crypto exchange FTX. Its CEO resigned the same day the company once valued at $32 billion filed for bankruptcy. And now that exec, just 30 years old, and celebrities who endorse FTX are being sued. 
 
CNN's Brynn Gingras has more on the company's sudden collapse and the shock waves that are hitting the crypto market. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPH CURRY, NBA PLAYER:  With FTX, I have everything I need to buy, sell, and trade crypto safely. 
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Steph Curry, Tom Grady, Gisele Bundchen, celebrities now caught in a swift collapse of FTX trading. They are among the defendants in the class action lawsuit for their promotion in the failed cryptocurrency exchange. 
 
CHARLES K. WHITEHEAD, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS LAW, CORNELL LAW SCHOOL: If you are a celebrity, we regularly do endorsements. You endorse sports drinks, you endorse tennis shoes. Financial instruments are different. And so, going out and saying that a financial instrument is great is not the same thing as going out and saying that a sports drink is great. And that creates liability. 
 
GINGRAS:  FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, the lead defendant in the suit, once a superstar in the industry who "Fortune" magazine hailed as possibly the next Warren Buffett, now has a legit business practices drawing comparisons to Bernie Madoff. 
 
WHITEHEAD:  It's not entirely clear who's actually getting the money and what's being done with the money. Yet it begins to look like a Ponzi scheme. 
 
GINGRAS:  The company once estimated by "Forbes" at $32 billion imploded in just ten days one and industry publication questioned FTX's inner workings, setting off a downhill spiral of investors quickly pulling out funds. The company filing for bankruptcy, investigations, and accelerating chaos in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, an unregulated market where consumers trade digital currency not backed by a central bank. 
 
RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL BUSINESS COLUMNIST AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES:  In some ways, this collapse of FTX is the Lehman Brothers moment of the crypto world. It is a classic financial crisis. 
 
GINGRAS:  The new CEO now leading FTX through Chapter 11, saying in a court filing, he's never seen, quote, such a complete failure of corporate controls. This, from the same man who managed and runs through its bankruptcy. 
 
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Dick Durbin, demanding documents from FTX to explain how billions just disappeared. 
 
SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FOUNDER, FTX:  How much of this is effectively an empty, you, know product? 
 
GINGRAS:  For his part, Bankman-Fried taking to Twitter, saying he f'ed up and in an interview with the "Vox" reporter last night, showing little remorse for money lost, saying, he's trying to fund- raise to pay customers, but it's likely the billions will never be recouped. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GINGRAS (on camera):  Now, we reached out to a number of celebrities named in that suit, did not get a response. A larger scale, Brianna, this is having a ripple effect mainly just in the crypto world. Financial experts are hopeful that does not change. But it's still unclear what the aftermath of this is going to look like. 
 
Washington, well, it's taking notice and speeding up the prospect of instilling regulations -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  Brynn Gingras, thank you for that.
