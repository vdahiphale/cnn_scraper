(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, it's 8 pm here in Dubai. I'm Becky Anderson. Hello and welcome back to a special edition of "Connect 
 
 the World". Live pictures now from Charleston, South Carolina that is where later this hour we are expecting to hear Nikki Haley formally jumps into 
 
 the next U.S. Presidential election.
 
Haley is the Former Governor of South Carolina and Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. She'll be the first Republican to officially 
 
 challenge her former boss, Donald Trump for the GOP nomination that announcement live when it happens.
 
First up, the NATO Secretary General says alliance members need to ramp up their production of ammunitions even further to help Ukraine. Jens 
 
 Stoltenberg earlier welcomed new pledges by allies, which include more heavy weapons and military training as comments come after NATO Defense 
 
 Ministers met in Brussels for two days of talks. The NATO Chief says Ukraine has a window of opportunity to tip the balance in the war and time 
 
 he said is of the essence.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: This is now becoming a grinding war or attrition and the war of attrition is a war of logistics. And 
 
 therefore it this is so crucial for our ability to ensure that Ukraine wins is able to retake territory and launch offensives that ensure that it's 
 
 able to win the war and to prevail as a sovereign independent nation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, joining us now live to discuss this is the U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith. It's good to have you Ambassador. Thank you for 
 
 joining us. The NATO Secretary General there Jens Stoltenberg speaking today, he said the war is now becoming and I quote him here a grinding war 
 
 of attrition. That means realistically, doesn't it more U.S. defense spending likely is that possible?
 
JULIANNE SMITH, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Well, I think what we saw over the last two days is not just the United States but all of the NATO allies came 
 
 together here at NATO Headquarters and pledged additional forms of assistance. We were able to convene the 50 plus countries that are already 
 
 providing assistance.
 
And they came to that meeting ready to do even more. So it's not just the U.S. allies are united in their support for the Ukrainian military right 
 
 now. And we will get them everything that they need to prevail on the battlefield.
 
ANDERSON: That I understand. I was specifically talking about what the U.S. is prepared to do going forward. How far is the U.S. willing to go? For 
 
 example, what sort of percentage of U.S. GDP, do you believe is going to be sufficient here?
 
SMITH: Well, it's hard to put an exact number on it. What I can say with certainty is that the U.S. has already provided $30 billion worth of 
 
 security assistance with certainly more to come. You've heard some of the recent announcements about the Bradley's and the strikers.
 
You've also heard the U.S. move out on those armored tanks that were going to make the Abrams available in the coming months. So I don't see the U.S. 
 
 letting its foot off the gas. I see continued support. You've heard President Biden say for as long as it takes and I think that will be the 
 
 policy going forward.
 
ANDERSON: You talk about these Abraham's being released in the coming months and that is what will really worry people here because clearly, as 
 
 Jen Stoltenberg has described it, this is a grinding war of attrition.
 
And it seems quite clear that the U.S. and others now believe this could grind on for months, if not years. President Biden has ruled out sending F-
 
 16s to Ukraine; if other countries send those jets unilaterally, do they have NATO's and the U.S.'s permission will you then be obliged to send them 
 
 too I wonder?
 
SMITH: Well, I think our position on this has been very clear. The United States doesn't have any plans currently to send F-16s or any other fighter 
 
 jets. And we've also been clear in that each country needs to determine for itself what kind of contribution it wants to make.
 
And every country is making a variety of contributions, whether it's in the form of military capabilities, or in some cases, countries are providing 
 
 important humanitarian and economic assistance. So we will leave that decision in the hands of individual leaders and let them take their own 
 
 sovereign decisions as it relates to support for Ukraine
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
ANDERSON: We are just shy of a year into this conflict. How concerned are you personally? And what is the talk behind closed doors as Defense 
 
 Ministers meet as Ambassadors meet about how long this goes on? And whether there is any prospect at this point of a diplomatic political solution?
 
SMITH: Well, I'd say a couple things on that. First of all, I think the unity is strong. Putin expected us to wear down and eventually head for the 
 
 exits. And that's not happening at NATO. I'm here, meeting with NATO allies each and every day.
 
And I don't see any change in the level of resolve that you see across this alliance. Of course, we debate things, we have different perspectives. 
 
 Unity takes work to maintain. But that's the strength of the alliance, when we come to a common position we're able to then affect regional and broader 
 
 global security in a way that counts.
 
In terms of where this ends, it's hard to predict. We know one person who could end it today that's President Putin. And we will do everything we can 
 
 to continue to apply pressure on Moscow to affect his strategic calculus.
 
But I think you're right that many allies in the United States expect some sort of negotiation at some point. But right now, we are very focused on 
 
 getting everything the Ukrainian military forces need getting all of those capabilities in their hands, and completing as much training as possible so 
 
 that they're ready for this spring offensive that we expect to see in the weeks and months ahead.
 
ANDERSON: The NATO Secretary General appealing for more ammunition. Again, you've been in amongst key stakeholders this week. Is that ammunition 
 
 forthcoming? Because it's no point having hardware, if they don't have that ammunition, and it's clear, there is a deficit at present?
 
SMITH: Well, you're right. It's not just a matter of donating hardware, you've got to make sure that you have the spare parts, and you've got the 
 
 munitions to go with it. And so that was a key topic that was discussed here at NATO HQ over the last two days.
 
I think allies were very clear in the meeting. They're going to continue to send strong signals to industry to turn on production lines where 
 
 necessary. Allies are looking at things now like multinational or pooled buys to send an even stronger incentive to the private sector. And we're 
 
 coming together to take stock of what the alliance, what type - what type of shortfalls actually exist across the alliance and how we can quickly 
 
 address those shortfalls?
 
ANDERSON: I do want to ask about Finland, Sweden's succession to NATO. You will be across this Hungary and Turkey has yet to complete the ratification 
 
 process. How is their appeasement progressing? And what do you hope Finland and Sweden are going to bring to the table at this point?
 
SMITH: Well, first of all, I'd say Finland and Sweden are ready to join the alliance today. These are two countries that have had a long standing and 
 
 close relationship with the NATO alliance for quite some time they exercise and train with us.
 
They've participated in NATO missions over the years. And they represent the values that we all hold dear so they could join tomorrow. We are, as 
 
 you noted, waiting for two countries to ratify what we call the accession protocols.
 
This is a process we have to go through. What's been remarkable is the speed with which 28 other allies have gone forward with the ratification 
 
 process. So we will continue to encourage Finland and Sweden to meet with Turkey specifically when they can obviously the earthquake is all consuming 
 
 right now.
 
But we want to continue to see those three countries come together and address some of the concerns that Turkey has raised. And Hungary hopefully 
 
 in the coming weeks will be in a position where it's ready to complete the ratification process. Our hope is that both of these members will join us 
 
 fully fledged members in the months ahead, hopefully by the summit this summer.
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. It's good to have you thank you for your time. You're watching "Connect the World" folks well, that is the U.S. Ambassador 
 
 to NATO. Thank you. Children and the elderly among those are pulled alive from the rubble; nine days after that earthquake caused unimaginable 
 
 destruction in Turkey and in Syria but new victims are being found amongst the piles of debris which does seem absolutely remarkable given that more 
 
 than 41,000 lives are now confirmed loss.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well as the focus shifts to relief, the UN is asking for $400 million for Syria. Its aid trucks crossed the newly open route from Turkey 
 
 heading for serious opposition held northwest.
 
And among those helping Syria, Saudi Arabia will send its first aid shipment to the country so individual countries pitching in and more UN aid 
 
 is on the way. But each hour brings less hope and new discoveries of the dead. CNN's Nada Bashir has more on what are these incredible rescues and 
 
 the growing frustration with Turkey's government.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, it is truly remarkable that we are still hearing of these miraculous rescues nine days on. Just in the last few 
 
 hours, Turkish state media has reported that a woman and two other children were pulled from the rubble in Antakya 228 hours after the earthquake 
 
 struck.
 
And across Southeast Turkey there are search and rescue teams still working around the clock in the hope of finding survivors. Thousands of people of 
 
 course, waiting for news of their loved ones were still missing, presumed trapped under the rubble. But the window for finding survivors is closing 
 
 and this is quickly becoming more of a recovery effort, as survivors start to come to terms with the sheer scale of the devastation.
 
Here in Istanbul, we're already beginning to see families impacted by the earthquake being evacuated to the city. Some are being hosted in university 
 
 dorms, for example, while others are being hosted by generous volunteers. Now there really has been a huge outpouring of support across the country.
 
And in this city we've seen humanitarian aid center has been set up to help distribute donations to those most in need. The Turkish government, 
 
 meanwhile, has a significant challenge ahead. More than 50,000 buildings have been deemed unsafe by authorities and now require immediate 
 
 demolition.
 
According to the authorities, more than 7000 personnel are currently working on assessing the damage caused by the earthquake with nearly 
 
 400,000 buildings already examined so far. And then there is the question of accountability. There is a growing sense of frustration and even anger 
 
 here in Turkey, with many now questioning whether enough was done by the government to prepare for a catastrophe of this scale.
 
Now the government says it has committed to rebuilding parts of the country impacted within a year and there's already an investigation into 
 
 allegations of construction negligence. Turkey's Justice Ministry says it has already identified more than 100 potential suspects, with several 
 
 people already arrested. But as the death toll continues to climb, we could still see further backlash against President Erdogan's government to come. 
 
 Nada Bashir CNN, Istanbul.
 
ANDERSON: Of course, the devastation is extreme, some of the stories of survival. Turkish media reporting that a woman and two kids were rescued 
 
 228 hours after that quake hit, that is more than nine days. But at least two other women spent more than 200 hours trapped in the rubble of 
 
 collapsed buildings but weren't pulled out alive.
 
And rescues found a dog and carried that to safety eight days after the disaster. While rescue was listened to more voices in the rubble doctors 
 
 and nurses working around the clock to save and care for the survivors who got out. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta went inside a Turkish trauma hospital in 
 
 the quake zone and this is his report.
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Guys have made my way to an airstrip here a Turkish military airstrip, where so many of the 
 
 donations from all over the world, this is where they arrive. And then helicopters and planes and other vehicles come and take the supplies and 
 
 try and get them to places where people really need them. You know, we talked about more than 41,000 people have tragically died.
 
But there are also people who are survivors who have been injured and are in need of some of these supplies. In fact, we went to the largest Trauma 
 
 Center in this area, a trauma center that was not damaged by the quake and they've been taking care of patients, thousands of patients 5000 over the 
 
 last several days. Want to give you a look at what it takes to run a trauma center in the middle of an earthquake zone.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. GUPTA (voice over): Time is the great equalizer in hospitals all across Turkey. And there isn't enough of it here in a Donna city at the Teaching 
 
 and Research Hospital.
 
DR. GUPTA (on camera): The patients come in with fractures with what sort of injury?
 
DR. SULEYMAN CETINKUNAR, CHIEF OF STAFF, ADAN CITY TEACHING AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL: Patients consist of limb loss, tissue crashes, tissue loss, and 
 
 brain trauma.
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
DR. GUPTA (voice over): Dr. Suleyman Cetinkunar is Chief of Staff here. Within minutes his trauma team is paged again, another helicopter is 
 
 arriving.
 
DR. GUPTA (on camera): We're now walking with the Chief of Staff of the hospital to the helipad, and tells me that they've had some 5000 patients 
 
 that have come here over the last seven days. The orthopedic surgeons, the neurosurgeons have been operating for seven days straight basically, this 
 
 is the largest trauma hospital in the quake zone.
 
DR. GUPTA (voice over): The doctors move fast, the goal to care for this 26 year old woman. Her kidneys are failing from something known as crush 
 
 syndrome; too many toxins were released into her blood after her limb was finally freed. She will need emergent kidney dialysis.
 
Over and over again patients from the quake zone finally, thankfully, making it here for help. And one with the most remarkable story I have 
 
 heard, this beautiful family of five felt the earth shake and then watched the unthinkable happen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our block of flats is seven storey's high.
 
DR. GUPTA (voice over): They could do nothing but watch is eight month old baby - was somehow hurtled from the window, five storeys to the ground. And 
 
 then look what happened to their building just flattened. Somehow Nilay survived after being trapped her for almost 14 hours. And she began to dig 
 
 and scrape through the rubble for any sign any sign at all, that her baby girl was still alive.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And at that point, the fifth day, we thought we would be seeing her lifeless body.
 
DR. GUPTA (voice over): But then, something astonishing happened. Someone showed them this post on Twitter. At first they weren't sure. But this baby 
 
 girl looked very much like her daughter.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You see, we had no idea she had been saved. DR. GUPTA (voice over): In the chaos a Good Samaritan had rescued the girl and she was flown here. Broken and battered, left leg shattered, skull 
 
 fractured a small collection of blood on her brain. But yes, very much alive.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. GUPTA: Guys, just such a miraculous story. You think about that eight month old girl. I mean, she was thrown out the window but had she not been 
 
 thrown out the window she would have likely been crushed. You saw just how that building was so pan caked. People don't like use the word miracle very 
 
 often. But that was pretty, pretty miraculous; I think you'd have to agree.
 
Guys, this is an area Turkish airstrip where so many of the donations that are coming in from all over the world. This is where they arrive. Then 
 
 there are planes and helicopters and other vehicles that take these supplies and get them to the people who need them the most.
 
And keep in mind, there are a lot of people that are still out there. They've survived but they may be injured, and they're in tremendous need. 
 
 And that's what these supplies are going to help serve.
 
ANDERSON: Well, that's Dr. Sanjay Gupta who was with us here in Dubai, a couple of nights ago before he deployed for that trip. Well, the Champions 
 
 League held a moment of silence for earthquake victims, so football players and fans paid their respects before two rounds of 16 matches in Italy and 
 
 in France on Tuesday.
 
European soccer's governing body UEFA says 20 matches this week we'll hold, an honor of the quake victims including a commemorative banner with a 
 
 message we are together with you in Turkish and in Arabic. UEFA says they are donating more than $200,000 to support humanitarian efforts.
 
Well, these are live pictures now from Charleston, South Carolina. That is where later this hour we are expecting to hear Nikki Haley formally jumping 
 
 to the next U.S. presidential race. We'll be back after a quick break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back to "Connect the World". We're coming to you live from the World Government Summit where some 10,000 international government 
 
 officials thought leaders, global experts and decision makers have gathered to discuss strategies for better international cooperation and frankly, 
 
 better government around the world.
 
One of the bigger names taking part in this World Government Summit was Elon Musk. He's pledged to step down as Twitter CEO and he told summit goes 
 
 that he thinks that will happen by the end of this year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELON MUSK, TWITTER CEO: I think I need to stabilize the organization and just make sure it's a financially healthy place. And have the product 
 
 roadmap is clearly laid out. So I don't know I'm guessing probably towards the end of this year. Should be good timing to find someone else to run the 
 
 company because I think it should be in a stable position around the end of this year.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Musk tweeted that his dog will be the new CEO of Twitter. And while that may seem like a joke, it caused a stir in the crypto 
 
 currency markets. Musk's dog, of course, is the same breed as the mascot of Dogecoin leading some speculators to think that Musk will soon announce 
 
 integration between Dogecoin and Twitter. The price of that coin rose more than 5 percent after Musk's dog tweet.
 
Well, let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi met with the 
 
 Syrian President Bashar Al Assad on Wednesday in Damascus. This is the first such visit since the Syrian conflict began over a decade ago.
 
Jordan's foreign ministry says the visit is a show of solidarity following last week's earthquake. Well, New Zealand police says - the East Coast of 
 
 North Ireland left at least four people dead, more than 1400 others have been reported as uncontestable, thousands are displaced.
 
Meanwhile, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake hit near the country's Cook Strait, no major damage has been reported. China's top diplomat Wang Yi met with 
 
 French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Wednesday that is part of an eight day tour of Europe.
 
One will also visit Russia and will attend the Munich Security Conference in Germany this weekend. Indian tax officers are spending a second day 
 
 searching the New Delhi and Mumbai offices of the BBC the British Broadcasting Company on Wednesday.
 
They say they are looking into whether the BBC diverted profits and avoided paying taxes. Many of those suspect this is just the Indian government 
 
 trying to strike back at the - Four area documentary that was critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Searchers have raised concerns that the 
 
 Modi regime is not interested in freedom of the press. CNN's Vedika Sud reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice over): India's government does not like what some journalists are saying about it. Last month, the BBC documentary 
 
 critical of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was banned across the country. On Tuesday, agents from the Indian Tax Department enter the BBC's 
 
 offices in New Delhi and Mumbai. Employees weren't allowed to leave or to enter by agents who said they were carrying out a survey.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
SUD (on camera): Outside the BBC office in New Delhi, the local press back watch is known as the ruling political party issues a new challenge to a 
 
 media outlet, it considers hostile.
 
SUD (voice over): Journalist Siddique Kappan doesn't have the might of an international news organization behind him. Instead, he says his reporting 
 
 of a politically charged rape case under more than two years in prison without a trial. Kappan was charged under an anti-terror law he says it's 
 
 being wielded by the government to silence dissent.
 
As long as you support the government publish the press release the newspapers, you're a good journalist. If you raise your voice against the 
 
 government, if you highlight the failures, draconian laws will be slapped against you, Kappan tells me. He says supporters of the Modi government 
 
 have threatened him online.
 
SUD (on camera): Kappan is out on bail, but he says he still doesn't feel free. He's been holed up in this tiny two room apartment with his family 
 
 often too worried to go outside.
 
SUD (voice over): India's media landscape is massive. According to Reporters Without Borders, there are over 100,000 newspapers across the 
 
 country and over 350 TV news channels. But despite its size and diversity, the media industry in India is sounding increasingly similar.
 
SIDDHARTH VARADARAJAN, FOUNDING EDITOR, THE WIRE: If you look at television channels, look at the big papers, what you get is a much sanitized version 
 
 of what's happening and in many cases the activist spousal of the government's agenda.
 
SUD (voice over): The Wire is an independent news organization. Its founder says the Indian press has been in crisis since the Modi government came to 
 
 power in 2014.
 
VARADARAJAN: India's democracy is on factory is on life support.
 
SUD (voice over): The Indian government hinted at irregularities being the reason for raids at BBCs offices. But for critics, the world's largest 
 
 democracy has little tolerance for voices of descent. Vedika Sud, CNN, New Delhi.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well out of the blue Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stunned a lot of people today with a shock resignation announcement a short 
 
 time ago. She talks about the personal toll of the job during what was a news conference in Edinburgh. She has led the pro-independent Scottish 
 
 National Party in the country's devolved government since 2014. But now she says it feels right to step down.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICOLA STURGEON, SCOTTISH FIRST MINISTER: Since my very first moment in the job, I have believed that part of serving well would be to know almost 
 
 instinctively when the time is right to make wait for someone else. And when that time came to have the courage to do so, even if too many across 
 
 the country, and in my party, it might feel too soon.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: She says she'll stay on in the job until a successor is in place. Well we're still waiting for Nikki Haley to speak these are live pictures 
 
 from Charleston, South Carolina where we are expecting her. We are convinced that she will formally announce her race for president in 2024. 
 
 For the GOP, we're back after this, stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Right. Welcome back. We're waiting on Nikki Haley to formally announce that she will run as a candidate for the Republicans against her 
 
 former boss, Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Donald Trump of course the only other Republican candidate to have or candidate to have announced a 
 
 run for 2024, the GOP is expecting to have a long list.
 
Nikki Haley will be at that podium shortly. We'll get to her when she gets there. We're learning the names meantime of the students who were killed in 
 
 Monday's mass shooting on the Michigan State University campus. CNN's Adrienne Broadus has that story and takes a look at how yet another 
 
 American community in America is coping with a deadly outbreak of gun violence.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): How many more, that's the message that reads on a rock at Michigan State University that has 
 
 turned into a memorial for victims, a Monday night's shooting.
 
STELLA GOVITZ, FRESHMAN, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY: I don't know if like you ever like truly heal from it. But I think that we just have to support 
 
 each other as much as possible.
 
BROADDUS (voice over): Some parents reuniting with students Tuesday as the campus begins to heal and loved ones mourn the loss of Arielle Anderson, 
 
 Alexandria Werner and Brian Fraser.
 
A vigil was held in Grosse Pointe, Michigan for Frazier Monday night. He was a sophomore at MSU and President of the Michigan beta chapter of Phi 
 
 Delta Theta. Anderson, a junior at MSU was also from Grosse Pointe.
 
JON DEAN, GROSSE POINTE, MICHIGAN DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT: It touched our community not once, but not twice.
 
BROADDUS (voice over): Werner, also a junior and a star athlete at our high school.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She was special. And that's what we honor.
 
KELLY HORNE, ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AND VARSITY BASKETBALL COACH: We're struggling; we're all struggling here at the high school because of what an 
 
 incredible person that Arielle was.
 
BROADDUS (voice over): Emma Riddle has now lived through two school shootings. Her father says one at MSU and one at Oxford High School in 
 
 2021.
 
MATT RIDDLE, DAUGHTER SURVIVIED MSU AND OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTINGS: This can't possibly happen again. There's no way it's mathematically unlikely 
 
 right? Like, you know, I'm an engineer and I think it's there's no way and then you say, well, it did so what does that mean? Well, what it means is 
 
 that we're failing. People like my daughter, we're failing students.
 
BROADDUS (voice over): This as new video shows the dramatic moment students were hiding in a class room, reacting to - while on the phone with police. 
 
 The shooter's motive is still unclear. According to police, they are now investigating a two page note found in the gunman's backpack, saying he's 
 
 going to "Finish off Lansing" and that there are "20 of him who will carry out other shootings" according to a source familiar with the investigation.
 
Law enforcement now investigating a local residence where the gunman's father says he lived with him. The shooter purchased two handguns in 
 
 Michigan in 2021. A law enforcement source tells CNN.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do have at least one mapping.
 
BROADDUS (voice over): Despite the tough circumstances, there's one greeting among MSU's department that still unites them.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go green. You guys smiled instantly. That's horrible and disgusting and tragic as that was like we are all in it together.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: That was CNN's Adrian Broaddus reporting. Well, even before Monday's mass shooting, the state of Michigan was still coping with the 
 
 massacre at Oxford High School 50 months ago that left four dead. And that's not all, the Michigan State University shooting happened just hours 
 
 before the five year anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Here's the message one Parkland 
 
 survivor had for MSU students.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AALAYAH EASTMOND, PARKLAND SURVIVOR: The journey of healing is different for everyone, especially in the lens of something as traumatic and 
 
 unexpected as this. Honestly in the first weeks of me, surviving the shooting at my high school, I was super reserved to myself and didn't want 
 
 to speak out. But I found power and advocacy and healing and advocacy.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
EASTMOND: So really, I just want to send my love and support to all of the young people that, you know, just experienced this horrific tragedy. But 
 
 just to stay strong in these upcoming days and just to stay with your community, being with your community and healing together is really how you 
 
 get through something like this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: U.S. President Joe Biden marking the Parkland anniversary by announcing $231 million dollars in federal funding to curtail gun violence. 
 
 Those funds will be used to create projects like red flag programs, as well as mental health and substance use treatment courts.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: And it's a family's worst nightmare. It's happening far too often this country, far too often. 
 
 While we gather more information, there's one thing we do know to be true. We have to do something to stop gun violence ripping apart our communities.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: According to the gun violence archive, the U.S. has already seen 71 mass shootings so far this year. Country has topped 600 mass shootings 
 
 every year, for the past three years, sobering statistics. We're still waiting for Nikki Haley to speak. These are live pictures from Charleston,

ALAN GREENBERG, HEAD OF STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS, ENTELECHY ACADEMY: First of all, you can't put the genie back in the box. But actually, ChatGPT is 
 
 not what this is all about is conversational AI.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That was former Apple exec and tech expert, Alan Greenberg, speaking there today at the World Government Summit in Dubai about one of 
 
 the most pressing topics surrounding the future of technology and the future of so much of what we do.
 
Artificial Intelligence, I spoke to many leaders in this space, particularly about the role AI will play in education. And one of them is 
 
 the Executive Chairman of Udacity known as the University of Silicon Valley, Sebastian Thrun. He proclaimed the conversation around education is 
 
 now interlinked with AI and this was supposed to be a discussion about the future of education.
 
In our interview, I asked him to expand on why it is that when we talk about the future for education and the disruption to the education system, 
 
 why it is that we should be talking about AI. Have a listen to this.
 
SEBASTIAN THRUN, UDACITY FOUNDER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER: What happened this year in 2022, 23 is the single biggest thing we ever going to see in 
 
 our lifetimes. We'd see that a machine suddenly called like ChatGPT, we don't know what this means, that that machine can do almost everything, we 
 
 teach our kids in school.
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
THRUN: It can produce an essay, it can rhyme, it can produce a rap song and give you answers to questions. It even passes the bar exam and becomes a 
 
 lawyer without any training. It's amazing what AI can do. And it has raised the fundamental questions, what's going to happen to us now that AI can do 
 
 all these things, what is left for us to do?
 
ANDERSON: So is this a good thing or a bad thing to your mind?
 
THRUN: It's always a good thing, because progress has always been a good thing. Like, hundreds of years ago, we all walked in farming. We didn't 
 
 read or write, there was no education, there's already - hierarchy. Because technology hadn't made farming efficient yet, farming today is like 
 
 hundreds of times more efficient.
 
ANDERSON: You talk about the upside of technology and innovation, will I get it on something like AI, there will be people watching this who say 
 
 hang on a minute, it doesn't critically think for you, there will be those who say, this is pretty frightening stuff.
 
THRUN: Yes. So if you believe in a static world, and you believe in a zero sum assumption, like someone gets a job, somewhere else loses a job, its 
 
 frightening stuff. But if you believe in a growth world where we as a society become richer and more experienced and more diverse, then it's a 
 
 good thing.
 
Because all of a sudden, we're not coming to this stupid, boring, repetitive jobs that that we do as like pilots and myself, or as a no, as 
 
 lawyer or as a medical doctors often, when we do the same stuff over and over again, I think we can now branch out and be more creative as society.
 
ANDERSON: So what is the future of education?
 
THRUN: We have to figure that out. I think, to me, personally, it's mostly skills; it's being able to command these technologies. And it's the 
 
 mindset, the second mindset to be open mind that is called this, this learning mindset, this exploitive mindset with you willing to learn new 
 
 things and learning to adapt to new things.
 
ANDERSON: You are big on nano degrees and working with companies to up skill the workforce to bridge the information and technology gaps. Have the 
 
 results been successful? And you've been a pioneer, what are known as mocs. Is there a future for that sort of --?
 
THRUN: Yes, it will be found out, what we found when we did our first class with 160,000 people says a word thirst for education. And it's right now 
 
 it's very unevenly distributed. So you can go to Harvard and Stanford, get a world class education. But if you grew up in Sub Saharan Africa, you 
 
 think you have no chance.
 
So our mission has become to democratize, democratize the access to with education. So every smart person, there's 8 billion people in the world, 
 
 every smart person has the same chance. When that happens, we have a double the world's GDP right there that moment.
 
ANDERSON: Why is it that the investor at present has taken a somewhat negative stance towards - tech stock?
 
THRUN: Look, the stock market is up and down and unveils manufacturers and so on. But when you include investor's contaminations, I find it amazing 
 
 how nations like the UAE, Abu Dhabi, Oman, Egypt, Senegal, and so many others are really doubling down on their people's education right now, at 
 
 this very moment.
 
We've proven that education is a financially viable investment for governments. We've moved the GDP of Egypt noticeably by building a massive 
 
 outsourcing organization using Udacity training. That if that doesn't speak for itself, this year, there are lots of investments maybe not conventional 
 
 for profit and IPO type investments but the world is investing in education.
 
ANDERSON: Well, the influence of technology is one of the many factors impacting learning today learning environments. His Excellency Dr. Ahmed 
 
 Belhoul Al Falasi joins me now for more on this. He's the Minister of Education here in the UAE and spoke at the summit about the future of 
 
 education. And I have to let my viewers know that you didn't write your speech. Off times, you might say, well, you're a minister, perhaps other 
 
 people would write your speech for you. But the speech you made yesterday was written by?
 
AHMED BELHOUL AL FALASI, EMIRATE MINISTER OF EDUCATION: ChatGPT. And actually that intentionally to send the message that we should not demonize 
 
 AI. That was actually contrary to the advice I got from my comms team saying, what message would the most of education be sending? If students 
 
 see him after delivering a speech announcing that look, by the way, this speech was done by gentle AI.
 
I just wanted to be mystified and make people comfortable and say, look, this will be part of our life going for and that's exactly the message I 
 
 managed to get across.
 
ANDERSON: This is a country that's 50 years old, it came late to the game as far as education is concerned, has been playing catch up. But also in 
 
 playing catch up and devising its education system and I find this so fascinating. You have been completely as many sectors and industries have 
 
 here, being completely prepared to take on new technology and innovation. Tell me about what's going on here in the education sector today.
 
FALASI: Well look, as you have three dimensions, we came late into formal education. So my own father was paid some petty cash to go to school. And 
 
 now we're talking about AI right? So for us I mean within the region, we're doing quite well in terms of international rankings and assessments, but 
 
 globally we're still behind.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
FALASI: So I believe that by using generative AI and any technology tool that can supplement the role of the teacher will be able to bridge that gap 
 
 as fast as we can.
 
ANDERSON: You use the term supplement.
 
FALASI: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Supplement the role of the teacher, because let's be quite frank, there will be people watching this who is saying, you know, let's is quite 
 
 clear. I think the education systems that many of us went through are probably not fit for purpose these days. And that's, you hear a lot about 
 
 that.
 
But nobody wants a computer taking over at the end of the day. I mean, it's quite a worrying idea that AI would be at the forefront of every, every 
 
 decision you were taking about the new environment. So this is supplement to.
 
FALASI: So there wasn't, it was at the back seat. So we used to analyze student debt and outcome predicts, you know, failure before it happens, not 
 
 from the passenger side, but as co-teaching with the teacher. I think, again, look, we need to be aware that the way we assess needs to change 
 
 with time, so I'm an engineer by discipline, when I was younger; we're given four minutes to memorize.
 
And the exam was about an hour and retrieval of that formula. Because at the workplace, if you look at an aircraft, you'd have a pilot or co-pilot 
 
 and engineer that engineers role and the safety of that aircraft depended on his ability or her ability to memorize the formula in case of an 
 
 emergency and to devise the flight back. Now we're trying to--
 
ANDERSON: I want to interrupt you.
 
FALASI: - go ahead.
 
ANDERSON: Stay with me, Nikki Haley, about to take to the stage where we are expecting her to formally announce her nomination or candidate for the 
 
 Republican Party in the race for 2024. And of course, Nikki Haley will be second, the second person to do. That her former boss, Donald Trump has 
 
 already announced that he will run, so let's just pause for a moment while we get ready to hear from Nikki Haley who is making our way to the podium 
 
 at present. Will try and pick up this conversation about the future of higher education after this announcement.
 
We have heard Nikki Haley speak about this race on social media. But it's her opportunity to meet some of her supporters and to speak to not just the 
 
 United States, but a channel like this providing a platform for the second Republican candidate in the race for 2024 to give us a sense of the flavor 
 
 of what that race will be all about, Nikki Haley for you ladies and gents.
 
NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Wow, this is fantastic. Thank you so much. It's a great day, and thank you all. Thank you all for being here. 
 
 You know, I have to say before I start, I've got to give a shout out to the people who took the podium before me to pastor Hagee. I still say I want to 
 
 be you when I grow up. Thank you.
 
Candice Glover, you are a star and a source of pride for South Carolina. That was amazing. Kate and Dawson you will forever be the best party 
 
 Chairman South Carolina has ever had. To Cindy and Fred Warmbier, and their family, you will always have my heart.
 
Otto is so proud of you today. I know that. And to Ralph Norman, you know I would have been right there with you in Congress holding them accountable. 
 
 God bless you. I love you. Thank you so much. I'm so glad to be with the people I love in the state, I love to talk about saving the country I love.
 
I have always had a deep belief in America, but I know America is better than all the division and distractions that we have today. And I'm 
 
 confident that the American people agree.
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
HALEY: We're ready, ready to move past the stale ideas and faded names of the past. And we are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into 
 
 the future. I come here today with a vision of that future. I see a strong America full of opportunity that lifts up everyone, not just a select view. 
 
 I see a proud America confident in who we are and what we stand for.
 
And I see America leading the world in freedom and in peace. But this vision isn't just fine. It's the core of our nation's history. And it 
 
 called to my parents over 50 years ago. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants and I am blessed that they are here today.
 
My parents left India in search of a better life. They found it in Bamberg, South Carolina, population 2500. Our little town came to love us. Our 
 
 little town came to love us. But it wasn't always easy, the only Indian family. Nobody knew who we were, what we were or why we were there. But my 
 
 parents knew.
 
And every day they reminded my brothers and my sister that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America. They were right then and 
 
 there right now. My parents came to a country that was gaining strength and growing and confidence. But that was then, now America is falling behind.
 
Our future is flipping. Our leaders are failing us failing us. And no one embodies that failure more than Joe Biden. Right now, in the greatest 
 
 country in human history, we have too many families paying too much for groceries, too many mothers searching frantically for baby formula. And too 
 
 many children who are so far behind in the classroom, they may never get ahead.
 
We have too many small businesses who can't afford rent and too many big businesses getting taxpayer bailouts. We have too much crime on our 
 
 streets, too many drugs flooding our cities and too few police and border patrol. And from Joe Biden on down our leaders put too much trust in big 
 
 government and too little trust in the American people.
 
They have a spiraling towards socialism with the new trillion dollar spending bill every few months and a national debt over $30 trillion. This 
 
 is not the America that calls to my parents. And make no mistake this is not the America I will leave to my children.
 
We must stop socialism before it's too late. It's weakening America from within. But there's something else that's eating away at our national core. 
 
 On Biden and Harris's watch a self-loathing has swept our country. It's in the classroom, the boardroom and the back rooms of government. Every day 
 
 we're told America is flawed, rotten and full of hate. Joe and Kamala even say America's racist. Nothing could be further from the truth.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
HALEY: The American people know better. My immigrant parents know better. And take it from me; the first minority female governor in history, America 
 
 is not a racist country. This self-loathing is a virus more dangerous than any pandemic. It's a system of a lack of pride in our country and a lack of 
 
 trust in our leaders.
 
And it ignores the values that have sustained America since our founding. I have traveled around the world and back. I've seen what else is out there. 
 
 America isn't perfect, but the principles at America's core are perfect. And the American people are not full of hate. We're full of love and we are 
 
 sustained by faith. I always go back to the book of Joshua.
 
Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged for God will be with you wherever you go. Strengthening America, believing once 
 
 again in America is the only way to defend ourselves from those who want to destroy us. When America's distracted the world is less safe. And today our 
 
 enemies think that the American era has passed. They're wrong.
 
America is not past our prime. It's just that our politicians are past theirs. Joe Biden isn't leading from behind; he's not leaving at all. On 
 
 his watch a terrorist mob conquered Afghanistan and killed our troops. Iran is on the brink of getting the bomb. North Korea is launching more missiles 
 
 than ever. Russia started the biggest war in Europe in 75 years.
 
And in communist China, we face the strongest and most disciplined enemy in history. It is unthinkable that Americans would look at the sky and see a 
 
 Chinese spy balloon looking back at us. China's dictators want to cover the world and Communist tyranny. And we're the only ones who can stop them.
 
But let me be clear, we won't win the fight for the 21st century if we trust politicians from the 20th century. America is on a path of doubt, 
 
 division and self-destruction, a path of fading patriotism and weakening power. The stakes are nothing less than our survival. And you and I and 
 
 every American is being summoned to bold action.
 
And so I have an announcement to make. I stand before you as the daughter of immigrants, as the proud wife of a combat veteran and as the mom of two 
 
 amazing children. I've served as governor of the great state of South Carolina and as America's Ambassador to the United Nations.
 
And above all else, I'm a grateful American citizen who knows our best days are yet to come if we unite and fight to save our country. I have devoted 
 
 my life to this fight and I'm just getting started.
