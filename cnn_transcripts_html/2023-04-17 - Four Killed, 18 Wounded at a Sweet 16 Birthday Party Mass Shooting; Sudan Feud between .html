ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and around the world. You're watching "CNN Newsroom", and I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead, new details about some of the victims from a mass shooting at a sweet 16 birthday party in Alabama, how some members of the community are remembering those who were lost. 
 
Fighting in Sudan enters a third day as the army and paramilitary groups struggle for power. We'll look at the toll it's taking on civilians. 
 
And G7 Foreign Ministers meet in Japan, two days after an explosive object was thrown at that country's prime minister. We'll show you the dramatic video of the moment a bodyguard jumped into action. 
 
ANNOUNCER:  Live from CNN Center, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH:  Thanks for joining us. With the new school week starts in just a few hours here in the United States, one community will be facing it with a sense of loss, both impossible to explain and yet all too common. 
 
Dadeville, Alabama is the latest city grappling with a mass shooting. Police say four people were killed at a Sweet 16 birthday party late Saturday night. Twenty eight were wounded, some critically. A second victim has now been identified by family members as high school senior Keke Smith. She was a student athletic manager on the track team who friends say, was always smiling. Also killed was Philstavious Dowdell, a beloved athlete, and the brother of the birthday girl. 
 
Police are asking for help from the public, they have not released any details of a suspect or a motive for the killings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SGT. JEREMY BURKETT, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY:  Four lives were lost in the tragic event that occurred here in Dadeville. As far as the injuries, there are 28 individuals that were injured during the course of the incident. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Dadeville, Alabama, where she met with those who knew some of the victims. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I spoke with Michael Taylor, who is the assistant football coach over at Dadeville High School, and he says that this is personal because one of the known four victims so far of the shooting is Phil Dowdell and he -- Taylor says that Dowdell has been like a son to him. He's known him since he was 9-years-old. 
 
He is in utter disbelief at the news. He calls Dowdell a freak -- a freak athlete, somebody who was so blessed by God across the spectrum, basketball, track, football and that he was about to turn the page on a new and exciting chapter in his life. He was about to graduate next month and actually got a scholarship to play Football at Jacksonville State University here in Jacksonville, Alabama. Taylor spoke with Dowdell's grandmother this morning. Here's what she said. 
 
MICHAEL TAYOLOR, DADEVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH:  The biggest thing is she don't understand why did it happen, you know. We don't have any enemies who feel just told me, about a month ago. So culture anything ever happened to me, even when I go to college, take care of my two sisters. I've never dreamed that he was talking about this.
 
ROSALES:  And as you can understand, this is a terribly traumatizing situation for this tight-knit community of 3,000 people. The superintendent says that tomorrow they will have counselors at the county schools to help the students grieve through what has happened.
 
Isabel Rosales, CNN, Dadeville, Alabama.

CHURCH:  Also on Saturday, someone fired shots into a crowd at a park in Louisville, Kentucky, killing two people and wounding four others. This is Louisville's second mass shooting in less than a week. Last Monday, not far from the park, a gunman killed five people at a bank and injured several others. 
 
In a statement, U.S. president Joe Biden asked, what has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear, when parents have to worry every time their kids walk out the door to school, to the movie theater or to the park? He went on to say guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising, not declining. 
 <br>[03:05:01]
 
This is outrageous and unacceptable. Americans agree and want lawmakers to act on common sense gun safety reforms. 
 
A Kansas City teen who was shot after going to the wrong home while trying to pick up his siblings has been identified. One of the attorneys for the victim's family says his name is Ralph Yarl. He was hospitalized Thursday night after being shot by the homeowner in a possible case of mistaken identity. His family has now started a GoFundMe page for his medical expenses. 
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
Meanwhile hundreds of protesters gathered outside the teen's home in Kansas City on Sunday demanding justice. The city's mayor has assured the public that detectives are thoroughly investigating the case. 
 
Sudan is seeing a third day of fierce fighting between the country's army and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group. Witnesses tell CNN that battles continued around Khartoum overnight and became especially intense after morning prayers.
 
There were also reports of airstrikes around the airport in the capital as well as near both RSF and Sudanese military garrisons. The civilian death toll has risen to at least 97 according to a Sudanese doctors union. There are reports of water and power cuts and shortages of fuel, food and medical care. 
 
Our Larry Madowo joined us now live from Nairobi, Kenya with more. So Larry, what is the latest on the fighting in Sudan? 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Rosemary, it was a bloody weekend in South -- in Sudan, and now it's starting out to be a third day of another violent day. People in Sudan have walking up to sounds of artillery and bombardment. People tell CNN that they're hiding far away from windows because they're afraid of stray bullets hitting their homes. Some fear they may soon run out of food or medicines. 
 
A short while ago we heard from the foreign secretary of the U. K. James Cleverly, as well as the U.S. home -- U.S. foreign affairs secretary, so to speak, Antony Blinken, and they're both called for immediate return to negotiations between the two men who are warring in Sudan. I want to play for you, the foreign secretary right now. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAMES CLEVERLY, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY:  We call upon an immediate cessation of violence, a return to the talks which seem to be heading in the direction of civilian government, and of course, that is the ultimate desired outcome. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO:  The U.S. and the U.K. are two key diplomatic planks in Sudan, but so is the region. The Arab League and the African Union are both held emergency sessions yesterday. A lot of African leaders are heading to that -- Sudan today, including the chair of the African Union and the president of South Sudan, of Kenya and Djibouti to try and reconcile these two warring men. This is where things stand as we speak. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  Two generals at war. Since Saturday, the forces of General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, known as a Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, or RSF, have been locked-in battle with the Sudanese Army led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. 
 
The fighting comes as Sudan tries to finalize a deal to return to civilian rule after two military coups in recent years would temporarily united the army and the RSF. 
 
In a phone interview, Dagalo, who is better known as Hemetti, told me ruling Sudan isn't his endgame. 
 
MADOWO (on-camera):  What do you personally want from this situation, General Hamdan? Do you want to lead the army? Do you want to be the chief? 
 
GENERAL MOHAMMAD HAMDAN DAGALO, LEADER OF THE PARLIAMENTARY RAPID SUPPORT FORCES (through translator):  I don't want to be the leader of the army. There's a framework agreement between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don't want to lead anything. These are all propaganda they are making.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  As part of the agreement, the RSF, some 100,000 strong, would merge with the Army. But differences over how long that would take and who would end up with more power aggravated tensions between the two factions, which have since erupted into open warfare. 
 
Residential areas across Sudan have become battlefields with anti- aircraft weapons in the streets and warplanes hovering overhead. Scores of civilians have been killed. The army blames the RSF for the violence, with Hemetti pointing the finger back at al-Burhan. 
 
MADOWO (on-camera):  What is your message to the many people of Sudan who has scared about this fresh round of violence? 
 
DAGALO (through translator):  We offer a serious apology to them, because what we can say is al-Burhan is the one that forced us to do this. It was not us who did this. We were defending ourselves. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  Doctors unions say it's been difficult for medics to move about, amid reports of many people being trapped near fighting hotspots. Despite a U.N.-brokered temporary truce, there were reports of gunfire in Khartoum, which Hemetti again, blamed on the army. 
 <br>[03:10:04]
 
DAGALO (through translator):  We're under attack from all directions. They are attacking us with marked and unmarked vehicles. Unfortunately they're not stopping. MADOWO (voice-over):  It's unclear what side was firing during the
 
 ceasefire. But the Army says it retains the right to respond if any violations occurred.
 
Sudan's neighbors are looking for ways to deescalate the violence. Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate talks between the two sides. The African Union and the Arab League both held emergency sessions with more calls for an immediate end to the hostilities.
 
The army has said there will be no dialogue until the RSF is dissolved. Hemetti says the stakes are so high in Sudan that any possible negotiations would have to be serious. 
 
DAGALO (through translator):  We are not refusing to go to the negotiating table as long as the negotiation is true and truthful, honest, not playing games. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO:  Hemetti also speculates that General Burhan appears of lost control of his army, that's why they didn't, for instance, respect that temporary truce. Right now, 97 people have been killed in this conflict since Saturday, and more than 1,100 people wounded. The longer it goes on Rosemary, the more that those numbers will increase. 
 
CHURCH:  Alright, Larry Madowo, joining us live from Nairobi, many thanks 
 
Amid the escalating violence in Sudan, Qatar Airways is suspending service to their country for now. In a tweet, the company says the suspension is due to the closure of Khartoum International Airport. The airline says the move is temporary, and it will continue to monitor any developments. 
 
And we'll have more on the Sudan crisis later this hour. I will speak with an expert about the possibility that Sudan might return to civil war. 
 
And we're getting a better look at the attempted attack on Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Saturday. Video posted to social media shows a cylinder shaped object land near the Prime Minister, one of his bodyguards springs into action and kicks it away while putting up a protective board to shield the prime minister. Mr. Kishida was evacuated from the scene unharmed. 
 
Meanwhile, police have raided the home of the 24-year old man accused of throwing the explosive object. More than 10 boxes of materials were removed from the property. Police are still investigating the motive for the attack and say the suspect is staying silent. 
 
Well, all this is happening as the G7 Foreign Ministers are meeting in Japan right now as a precursor for next week's G7 Summit in Hiroshima. 
 
And for more on this developing story, I'm joined now by Mark Stewart from Tokyo. Good to see you, Mark. So, extraordinary images of this heroic bodyguards springing into action amid new concerns about political violence at the G7 after that attempted attack on Japan's prime minister bring us up to date. 
 
MARK STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi again, Rosemary. This is certainly attention-getting, especially that video where that security guard basically whisks the prime minister to safety and kicks that -- that metal cylinder. 
 
It's important to make a distinction, though, that was a local political gathering, The G7 meeting that's happening now and then the one in Hiroshima will be, of course, on a much larger scale, and won't be open to the public as much. But certainly what happened here is raising questions of safety, something that the prime minister did address. Take a listen to his recent remarks. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  For event schedules like the G7 Summit, where dignitaries from around the world gather, I believe Japan, nationwide, will have to work together to make the utmost effort to provide security and safety. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART:  So, as you mentioned, there is a G7 gathering right now. Foreign ministers currently taking place in Japan in anticipation of that larger meeting in Hiroshima. And again, most of this is closed off to the public. We're just having private meetings, there are photo ops, there are meals together, but not necessarily a meet and greet as we saw in this event in Japan. 
 
It's important to note that in Japan, unlike other parts of the world, it's very common for politicians, for candidates, to have this one on one time with the public without restrictions. If you go to a political rally in the United States often cases, you will have to go through a metal detector. Your bags will have to be checked. 
 
In many of these rallies in Japan, that is not the case. And many of these rallies are open to the public. I just was at a subway stop, and there is a politician campaigning there, no restrictions. But as far as the G7, Rosemary, security will be very tight and again less access for the public. 
 
CHURCH:  Right. Mark Stewart, joining us live from Tokyo. Many thanks for that report. 
 
French president Emmanuel Macron is expected to address the nation in the coming hours just days after enacting his controversial plan to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64. 
 <br>[03:15:07]
 
France's prime minister said on Saturday that the government is determined to keep pushing forward with the reforms. Meanwhile, union leaders are vowing to continue with their protests. The country's biggest union is calling for two demonstrations later this month, as well as a massive turnout on May 1st, International Labor Day. Well, not even the Orthodox Easter could stop the Russian assault on
 
 Ukraine. But despite the latest barrage of missiles, Ukrainians still celebrated the holiday with prayers and hope. We'll bring you the latest.
 
Plus a horrifying scene at a swimming pool in Mexico. Seven people are murdered, one of them just a child. We'll have the latest on the search for the gunman.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Russia marked Orthodox Easter in Ukraine with a barrage of missiles, with the church among the targets on Easter Sunday. Villages searched the rubble near the city of Zaporizhzhia where their church suffered massive damage. 
 <br>[03:20:03]
 
No services were underway when the missile hit and no one was hurt, but the head of the local military was incensed, saying nothing is sacred. 
 
And there was no lull in the ferocious fighting in and around Bakhmut. Ukraine says almost 100 Russian shelling were recorded around the city in just 24 hours and about 30 firefights raged between Ukrainian and Russian forces for control of the devastated city. But there was also a little joy on this holiday. 130 Ukrainians are now free after a prisoner exchange with Russia. 
 
Russian president Vladimir Putin met with Chinese Defense Minister Li Xiang Fu in Moscow on Sunday, just weeks after Chinese leader Xi Jinping also visited the country. Mr. Putin told Li that president Xi's visit was, quote, "very productive," and he praised their countries' bilateral cooperation in multiple areas, including the military. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  There is a very good development of relations between our countries in all areas in the economic, social, cultural and educational sectors, but we are also working actively through the military departments. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  And this was Li's first foreign trip since becoming defense minister. He emphasized the quote, "special character and strategic importance of the Moscow-Beijing relationship." 
 
And CNN's Claire Sebastian is following all these developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Claire. 
 
So, President Putin met with China's Defense Minister, what came out of that meeting? 
 
CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Rosemary. Nothing concrete, although obviously that was a meeting that was going to be very closely watched, given what we know about the U.S. concerns that China may be considering supplying military aid for Russia's war in Ukraine. 
 
Nothing obvious came out, but these optics matter. This is the third high-level Chinese visit to Moscow in as many months. We first had the top diplomat, then, as you mentioned the President himself, Xi Jinping, and now the new defense minister in his first overseas trip in that role, very significant to see the commitment the level of engagement on both sides, and I think to some degree, the target audience of those upticks was the United States. 
 
The Chinese defense minister not missing an opportunity to mention the cold war, saying that Moscow and Beijing have very strong relations that far surpassed the military political alliances of the cold war. I think pretty clear statement on the fact that both sides are hoping this relationship will serve as a counterpoint to the U.S.-led alliance and its support for Ukraine, even though of course publicly, Beijing has not officially expressed support for Russia's war. It continues to foster that relationship. 
 
So, as I say, no concrete steps emerging from this meeting, but very significant upticks as we watch how this relationship unfolds.
 
CHURCH:  And Claire, what is the latest on fighting around Bakhmut? 
 
SEBASTIAN:  So, an exceptionally violent bloody weekend, Rosemary, according to the Ukrainian side, the spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian armed forces said that there was an unprecedented in recent decades level of fighting over the weekend, and that has continued into Monday morning. 
 
The Ukrainian general staff, saying that Russia is attacking Bakhmut suburbs, including locations on the supply routes that Ukraine uses to get, you know, food and medicine, ammunition in and, of course, wounded soldiers out, they have said in recent days that those suppliers remain open. But clearly, they are coming under attack. 
 
Now, also over the weekend, the Russian ministry of defense reported that Wagner had captured two districts to the north and south of Bakhmut. We have not been able to independently verify that, but I think that shows, you know, 8.5 months into this battle just how incremental it still is, two district in a town that had a pre-war population of only 70,000. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH:  All right. Our thanks to Claire Sebastian, joining us live from London. 
 
In the Ukrainian-held city of Slovyansk, it has been a difficult Easter. Russia's bombardment of the city on Orthodox Good Friday shelling, that hit an apartment building and destroyed a children's playground left at least 15 people dead and two dozen others injured. 
 
As Ben Wedeman shows us for many, the Easter holiday was a time to pray that someday peace will come again. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Air- raid sirens, and a sermon.
 
It's orthodox eastern-Slovyansk, a town battered Friday, Good Friday, by deadly Russian missile strikes. That didn't stop residents from packing the church with worshippers spilling outside. 
 <br>[03:25:04]
 
I always pray for Ukraine for our children, says 73-year-old Anya. I asked for peace as soon as possible to live a little bit longer without war, we don't want to die. 
 
Anya and others have brought bags and baskets of food to be blessed. In these troubled times, more people than ever attend church, even if some are reluctant. 
 
WEDEMAN (on-camera):  Not everybody can make it to Sunday services. These emergency workers have been here all-night because they believe they're still more bodies under the rubble. 
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over):  This was the deadliest strike on Slovyansk since the start of the full scale Russian invasion. And as 300 missile gouged out the top floors of this apartment block, killing, among others, a little boy.
 
The child who died was only 2-years-old, says Tatiana. His father is still there. If only they could lift those slabs, they could rescue him. That family, like many others, fled Slovyansk early in the war, but came back after the Russians retreated last autumn. Officials say around 30,000 residents have returned in recent months. 
 
I knew all of those who were killed, says Lilia, a neighbor. It's horrible. 
 
Elsewhere in town, another missile landed in a playground as fate would have it Friday was cold and rainy. The playground was empty. 
 
The Easter services here go on for hours, allowing those shaken by recent attacks to renew their faith that this war will eventually come to an end.

CHURCH:  A U.S. helicopter raid targeted and killed a senior ISIS leader and two others in Syria early Monday morning. That word coming from a spokesman for U.S. central command. The spokesman says the ISIS leader, who was not identified, was also responsible for planning terror attacks in the Middle East and Europe.
 
One week ago, another helicopter raid captured an ISIS operative and two associates. It's part of an ongoing U.S. campaign focused on defeating the terror group in Syria and Iraq to prevent them from regaining strength. 
 
Mexican authorities are trying to track down the gunman who killed seven people at a swimming pool on Saturday. A young child is among the victims. It's unclear why they were targeted, but the area is known for gang activity. 
 
More now from CNN's Rafael Romo.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A relaxing and sunny afternoon abruptly turned into hell in Mexico, Saturday, when gunmen suddenly showed up and opened fire at a crowded swimming pool. 
 
It happened in Cortazar, a city in the Mexican central state of Guanajuato. According to police, at least seven people were killed, including a 7-year-old child. The victims were three men and three women, in addition to the minor.
 
Mexican media report they were all members of the same family, but officials have not confirmed that. Social media videos show people in swimsuits screaming and hugging their children after the mass shooting.
 
According to a statement published by the city of Cortazar, it all started at about 4:30 in the afternoon. After shooting the victims, the unidentified gunmen vandalized the swimming pools shot before taking security cameras and a monitor with them. The Mexican army and security forces have been deployed to search for those responsible for the attacks. 
 
So far, Mexican officials have not disclosed the motive. According to an assessment by the U.S. State Department gained violence associated with the theft of petroleum and natural gas from the state oil company occurs in Guanajuato. It also says that a high number of murders in Guanajuato southern region is associated with cartel-related violence. Guanajuato is a major agriculture and manufacturing hub and the native state of former Mexican president Vicente Fox. Several major carmakers, including Chevrolet, Ford, GMC, and Toyota have assembly plants in the state.

CHURCH:  Still to come. It is the U.S. president versus the Speaker of the House in a standoff that could determine whether the U.S. defaults on trillions of dollars in debt. We will have the latest on what's at stake in Washington. 
 
Plus, a former lawmaker in India is shot dead while in police custody. We'll head to New Delhi for details on how the government is responding to the shocking attack.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:33:00]
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR:  The U.S. Congress is back in session later today after a two-week break. One of the first things they will have to address is a looming deadline on increasing the debt ceiling, but it could prove difficult given the ongoing standoff between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 
 
CNN's Alayna Treene has more now from Washington. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER:  House Republicans have begun putting together a deal that would raise the debt limit for one year, as well as include budget savings worth roughly $3 trillion to $4 trillion over the next 10 years, according to sources familiar with the proposal. 
 
Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says that he wants to put this on the floor at some point in May, which is no easy feat, given that Republicans have largely been divided on how to approach these debt limit talks, and they have a very slim majority in the House.
 
But the broader strategy from Kevin McCarthy here is to try to get all Republicans on the same page and then use that to force the Biden administration back to the negotiating table as well as argue that any sort of deal that they reach must include strings attached. 
 
Another big problem, though, underlying all of this is that president Biden and Kevin McCarthy have not held negotiations on the debt limit for several weeks now. They last met in early February. And currently, there's not another meeting on the books. We'll see if that changes with this latest proposal.
 
Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
CHURCH:  And earlier, I spoke with CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein about the debt ceiling negotiations. I asked him whether he thinks republicans will be successful in their attempt to push the White House into a deal. He says it's not likely given President Biden's past experience. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  President Biden as the vice-president under Barack Obama was in the middle of the last time we had a debt ceiling crisis this severe, both in 2011 and then in 2013 when the Republicans who control the House. 
 <br>[03:35:01]
 
At that point, demanded budget cuts in return for raising the debt ceiling. In 2011, President Obama did negotiate with Republicans. They went right up to the brink. The deal virtually fell apart. And at the last minute, they were able to cobble together reductions that allowed John Boehner to move through the debt -- the debt ceiling increase through the House. 
 
President Obama and Joe Biden came out of that experience and said never again. And in fact, in 2013, when Republicans, again, tried to leverage concessions in return for raising the debt ceiling, including rolling back portions of the affordable care act, Obama and Biden refused to negotiate. That is the position that he is sticking to now, and there are no indications that he is moving off of it. 
 
You know, I think the assumption in Washington has always been that there would be enough Republicans who recognize the magnitude of defaulting on the debt, and would break from the party to allow a debt ceiling increase to go through. But that is far from clear, Rosemary, and as you can see, the weeks are taking by without any real progress. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  In India, a former lawmaker convicted of kidnapping was killed along with his brother in a dramatic attack that was caught on live television. 
 
CNN's Vedika Sud joins us now live from New Delhi with more on this search. Vedika, what is the latest on that fatal shooting of the former lawmaker, and how is the government responding? 
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER:  Fatal and highly dramatic, well, as far as the state government of both there for the issues concern, which is led by prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, they have come under heavy criticism for what the opposition leaders in the state and outside the state are calling lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh under the governance. 
 
But at the very outset, I would also like to warn our viewers, Rosemary, that the footage we're about to see could be disturbing for some. Let me take you through the sequence of events on Saturday evening.
 
You know, usually you'd see something like this, Rosemary, in a Bollywood movie. It would be orchestrated the shooting, the gun shots, but this actually happened in the presence of several police officers in the presence of the media, and this was covered, believe it or not, on live television. 
 
You have a former lawmaker from India who was -- who has been convicted. He is a convicted criminal along with his brother. They pulled out of a jeep, a police van, and were taken towards a hospital in a city in Uttar Pradesh, of course, in the presence of police personnel, and all of a sudden you see a lot of reporters approaching them. 
 
Now, these two men are handcuffed and there is a chain around the handcuffs that's in the hands of the police officers as well. Now, these media personnel go up to talk to them. There is a brief interaction before you hear the first gunshot that goes off and what follows is at least a dozen more. 
 
After that, there's complete panic in the area. You don't see much on camera. I'm assuming that the camera person might have fallen with the camera because of which you don't see real movement, but you can hear the voices of panic. 
 
A lot of questions being raised over the security that these two men had who had been taken for medical examinations at that point. Also, right now, what we do know is that the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, has held a series of meetings to understand what the situation of law and order he's in the state after this incident, which is making headlines every day ever since it's happened. 
 
And we're going to see now what he has to see. He really hasn't come out. There's been no press briefing from him yet. But clearly, this is pointing towards the nervousness that the panic that Uttar Pradesh could be grouped under after what they've seen on live television, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  Alright. Vedika Sud, joining us live from New Delhi. Many thanks. 
 
Global and regional powers are calling for an end to the conflict in Sudan, amid fears of a return to civil war. We will have the latest and discuss the situation with an expert when we return. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:42:05]
 
CHURCH:  Fierce fighting is raging in Sudan for a third straight day between the country's army and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group. Witnesses say battles in Khartoum became especially intense after morning prayers. There were also reports of airstrikes around the city's airport and near both RSF and Sudanese military garrisons. A Sudanese doctors union says the civilian death toll has risen to at least 97. 
 
Murithi Mutiga is the Africa program director with the International Crisis Group and joins us now from Nairobi, Kenya. Thank you so much for being with us. 
 
MURITHI MUTIGA, AFRICA PROGRAM DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP: Thank you. 
 
CHURCH:  So as we just reported, more than 90 civilians have been killed and more than 1,100 injured in ongoing clashes across Sudan, and now a temporary U.N.-brokered ceasefire has failed to end intense fighting between the army and paramilitary group.
 
So what are the ramifications of this and how likely is it that the country will return to civil war, do you think? 
 
MUTIGA:  I think it's a terrifying reality for many in Sudan. Today, we have to remember Khartoum, for example, is a city of six million. It's the middle of Ramadan. You have 40-degree heat at the moment. Electricity is cut off in many neighborhoods. Many hospitals are running out of supplies, according to the World Health Organization. So, it's really, really worrying and the possibility of civil war is,
 
 unfortunately, very high. What we see here at the contradictions of the state that, the former long-serving ruler, Omar al-Bashir built, which was that he kept the military and the various paramilitary groups very divided so that he could govern effectively from this standpoint. 
 
Unfortunately, now, they never really accepted to share-power the civilians and they can't even agree how to share-power among themselves and we see very worrying street to street fighting today. 
 
CHURCH:  So, what do you think it will take to find a solution to this to end this fighting? 
 
MUTIGA:  The ultimate solution will have to come from within Sudan among the various parties. I think it's really encouraging that apart from the military and the RSF as you mentioned. The other parties in terms of the civilians and the rebel groups, the various actors that have been within the government are calling for an urgent ceasefire, are calling for resumption of talks. I think it's encouraging that we see strong and robust regional diplomatic initiatives at the moment.
 <br>[03:44:55]
 
The presidents of Kenya, Djibouti, and South Sudan have been added by the regional block, eager to trouble to Khartoum at the earliest possible opportunity, but we need to see concerted efforts, not just by at the regional actors but also by par brokers such as Sudan, I mean, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Americans, all of whom have some influence on the various actors. 
 
I think what's critical is to ensure that the ceasefire comes sooner rather than later. If it continues as things done, then it will be much more difficult to pull back. 
 
CHURCH:  And of course, that failed ceasefire was supposed to allow for the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid amid food, medical and fuel shortages. So what happens to those people who won't receive that help? 
 
MUTIGA:  Yes. So, the two sides have treated blame for the very quick collapse of this -- of the failed, you know, humanitarian ceasefire. I think we see a very urgent and worrying situation. As I mentioned in the middle of the Sudanese summer, it's -- you have power cuts, you have water cutoff to very many neighborhoods.
 
It's very critical also to remember that we don't have sight of what's happening outside the capital. You've had reports of fighting not just in the West in Darfur but also in Kordofan, Gedaref, Kassala, and other areas. 
 
So I think this really just emphasizes the need to a move towards a quick ceasefire. If we cast our minds back to April 2019, we have to remember this was one of the most inspiring and revolutions. We call it that around the region. You know, you had a peaceful day, vast protest movement, toppling a long-serving autocrat. I think it's very important for the Sudanese people to recognize the promise of that uprising, to urge the various military actors, although it might be a colonial effort, to step back. But as I mentioned, what's critical is that the ceasefire needs to come soon. Otherwise you have a real possibility of a spiral into civil war in a country where the various actors are armed to the teeth with the Buddha (ph) are very poorest, and it's a baby fragile ritual. 
 
CHURCH:  So how much hope do you have that a new ceasefire will be put in place and a solution will ultimately be found to bring this fighting to an end? 
 
MUTIGA:  I think what's -- what gives some hope is that neither of the sides can really win this. Sudan is one of the biggest countries in Africa. It is very hard to govern, just threw a feared all through the military force. I think, while one of the parties might be able to hold sway in the capital, they wouldn't be able to govern the country on their own. 
 
So, I think the various actors need each other and if they are to really about to reason, it's important that they recognize none of them can win. So, there is hope in the fact that none can really sustainably prevail, but I think it's really important that we see continued concerted action not just by regional actors, but also by those further abroad to try and add the various actors to come back to the negotiating table to agree to a civilian government, which they were all very close to bring to and maybe to plant some of the issues which they're enabled, and which brought them to the, to fighting, especially on reform of the security forces, perhaps to plant that for later. 
 
CHURCH:  Murithi Mutiga, thank you so much for talking with us, appreciate it. 
 
MUTIGA:  Thank you. 
 
CHURCH:  And just this programming note. Coming up later Monday, Christiane Amanpour sits down with Former Irish Premier Bertie Aherne, Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former U.S. President Bill Clinton for an exclusive reunion interview in Belfast, marking the 25th anniversary of the historic Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland.

CHURCH:  The NBA playoffs continued on Sunday with the opening games of four more series. Less than 48 hours after qualifying for the playoffs, the number eight-seeded Miami Heat beat the Milwaukee Bucks 130 to 117. Jimmy Butler led Miami with 35 points as they got the win on the road against the league's top team. Over in the Western Conference, the Los Angeles Clippers beat the
 
 Phoenix Suns 115 to 110. Clippers superstar Kawhi Leonard scored 38 points while Kevin Durant led the Suns with 27 in his first playoff game with the team. 
 
Well, it is the end of an era on Broadway. The curtain has come down for the final time on "Phantom of the Opera." The show ran for 35 years, making it the longest-running play in Broadway history, but it was a victim of the post-pandemic economy and cost nearly a million dollars a week to fund. 
 
Polo Sandoval has more now from New York. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you can't be the longest running show on Broadway and pick up some fans along the way. In fact, since it first debuted back in 1988, all the way down to this past Sunday when the curtain closed one last time, "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway entertained roughly 20-million audience members here at the historic Majestic Theater in Times Square, all of them drawn here by Andrew Lloyd Webber's organ-heavy score, those beautiful sets and not to mention the elaborate costumes. But it was all extremely expensive as well. In fact, the pandemic really changing the course for this iconic show. 
 <br>[03:54:54]
 
In fact, the costing roughly a million dollars to produce on a weekly basis, the profit simply not enough to offset the cost. So, that's why the creators, the producers, directors, all making that very, very difficult decision to close that show. Certainly, some sad news for some of the fans that have followed the show for quite some time. 
 
In fact, we caught up with one that was able to see one of the final shows just a couple of days ago. 
 
UNKNOWN:  I was introduced this musical when I was seven. I was in line for a car wash with my mother. She is going through a CD booklet. She goes, have I ever showed you Phantom, I said, no. I fell in love with it, I really did.
 
I began singing. I grew up to be a vocalist. I now hold my bachelors in music with the musical theater in concentration. And seeing the heartbeat of Manhattan leave, it is quite sad, honestly. 
 
SANDOVAL:  Well, "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway, also one of the largest single generators of income and also jobs, employing roughly 6,500 employees here on Broadway during the course of its run, again, about 35 years, though there will be production scheduled for later this year in South Korea, Italy, and Prague. 
 
Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) CHURCH:  We could soon be one step closer to exploring mars if everything goes as planned for Elon Musk and SpaceX. In Southern Texas, a SpaceX vehicle called Starship is scheduled for blast off in about five hours. If successful, the test flight will make a partial lap of earth's atmosphere and then splash down near Hawaii. This is the vehicle that Elon Musk hopes will take humans to mars. 
 
And thanks so much for your company. I'm Rosemary Church. Have yourselves a wonderful day. "CNN Newsroom" continues with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo, next.
