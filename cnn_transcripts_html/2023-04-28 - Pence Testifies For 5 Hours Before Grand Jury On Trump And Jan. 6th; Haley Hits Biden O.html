AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR: They have so much access to other witness testimony. They have things they want to ask him that they've heard from other people, right?
 
ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Including his aides -- 
 
CORNISH: Yes.
 
LOUIS: -- as a matter of fact. And that -- but, by the way, is one reason you do it is to make sure that everybody who was in the room at a given time is saying the same thing. Make sure you have a good solid account. So I think the prosecutor was doing a very, very good job of staying on top of it and making sure they got this testimony. It really sort of buttons up the case in a lot of ways.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: We talk about Nikki Haley, who has already said that anyone over 75 who wants to be president should have a competency test. But this is what she said about Joe Biden and this second run yesterday. Here it is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you vote for Joe Biden, you really are counting on a President Harris. Because the idea that he would make it until 86 years old is not something that I think is likely. It's why I've continued to say we need to have mental competency tests up until the, you know, starting at 75.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: She then doubled down on that yesterday with this tweet, again, basically saying -- she said, "This is bad for Joe Biden. It's embarrassing for the media. It's a scar on the country because Kamala -- it's scary for the country because Kamala Harris is waiting in the wings." She's talking about controversy over if Biden got this question ahead of time from an LA Times reporter. LOUIS: Yes, I think -- 
 
HARLOW: But why is she doing this?
 
LOUIS: I think that's a little foreshadowing. I think that like many of the other candidates who would like to be president, she knows she can't get past Joe Biden. And so, I think we're getting a little foreshadowing of them trying to move Kamala Harris up. The numbers suggest that she's not nearly as popular. She's a more inviting target.
 
She's going to be somebody who I think they're going to sort of push forward as a specter, like, oh, I'm really running against Kamala Harris. She thinks -- she may think -- 
 
HARLOW: I think he is not going to make it. To me, it's just like a whole another -- 
 
CORNISH: This can have an impact to happen with McCain and Palin. People started to question, if you want McCain, it means you're going to have to get Palin. And that did drive away some voters.
 
LOUIS: Every poll that's been looked at. And there's been, you know, academic studies and the reality that we've watched over several presidential cycles is people do not vote for the vice president. That person is part of an internal conversation, usually within the party, but it's not in a general election going to make the difference.
 
Again, I think of it as them -- and by this, I mean, Republicans, because she's not going to be the only one who does this. I think they're looking for a talking point. If you can't argue against Joe Biden, you have to find another argument. And that's I think where they're going.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: And the White House was pretty blunt in their response. They said they forgot Nikki Haley was running when they were asked about that comment.
 
LOUIS: Yes, that's it. Yes, Nikki who, right? I mean, look, she's studying for the wrong test to a certain extent. The person she needs to get past is not Kamala Harris, it's not Joe Biden, it's Tim Scott. She's got a senator -- a popular senator from her own state who actually is in office.
 
And so he doesn't have to chase after headlines the way Nikki Haley has to do. So sort of say something outrageous because she's an ex- governor and she's an ex-ambassador, and she's somebody that's not in the news unless she says something outrageous, which I think is maybe what she did yesterday.
 
CORNISH: Errol, thanks so much for this insight.
 
LOUIS: Glad to be with you.
 
HARLOW: Have a great weekend.
 
Ahead, how A.I., Artificial Intelligence could be a game changer in policing. Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: What percentage of body camera footage gets reviewed now?
 
ANTHONY TASSONE, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, TRULEO: A fraction of 1 percent.
 
YURKEVICH: And Truleo could look at what percentage of body cam video?
 
TASSONE: 100 percent.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Wow. Vanessa Yurkevich with a fascinating report. That's ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:37:38]
 
COLLINS: Police departments across the country are now using Artificial Intelligence technology to evaluate officers in the field. The program uses A.I. to scan body camera footage, and then it analyzes whether or not it believes an officer handled a situation professionally or not.
 
CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich saw firsthand how this technology works.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Officer Dan Janeda is on patrol. He has all his tools for the day, including his body worn camera, which automatically captures videos of his encounters with civilians.
 
(on-camera): Safety first?
 
OFFICER DAN JANEDA, CASTLE SHANNON, PENNSYLVANIA POLICE: Absolutely.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): 20 videos a day, over 100 hours a week. His final invisible piece of equipment, Artificial Intelligence. A program called Truleo, which analyzes what he records.
 
(on-camera): Did you have fears about what it meant to have Artificial Intelligence tracking your day to day?
 
JANEDA: I did have apprehensions. It is A.I. Technology can sometimes have drawbacks. It's not perfect.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Yes.
 
JANEDA: But at the same time, I've seen things play out enough where technology has helped us.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): And that is what Truleo's co-founder and CEO Anthony Tassone is aiming for. (CHANTING)
 
TASSONE: We started Truleo after George Floyd was murdered in May of 2020. How do we prevent this from happening again?
 
YURKEVICH (on-camera): What percentage of body camera footage gets reviewed now?
 
TASSONE: A fraction of 1 percent.
 
YURKEVICH (on-camera): And Truleo could look at what percentage of body cam video?
 
TASSONE: 100 percent.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): The A.I. was trained by humans to detect 5 million key terms.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I got them in the yard.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Like profanity noncompliance, as well as professional language or explanations. The goal is detecting early, problematic police behavior before it turns deadly.
 
CHIEF KEN TRUVER, CASTLE SHANNON, PENNSYLVANIA POLICE: I get an email alert every day at 06:00.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Dan Janeda's Chief Ken Truver of Castle Shannon PD in Pennsylvania, has been using Truleo for a year. He's also an adviser.
 
(on-camera): These are the keywords that you put in?
 
TRUVER: They are. So stop resisting, custody, arrest, anything to do with the pursuit. I'm looking for high risk things.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Truleo transcribes entire encounters from body cameras, but pinpoints the exact moments that need review.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop resisting. Just relax.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just relax.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just relax.
 
TRUVER: Not a whole lot of resistance, but it was giving me exactly what I was looking for.
 <br>[06:40:02]
 
YURKEVICH (on-camera): And so for you, this is a good interaction with one of your officers and a civilian?
 
TRUVER: It is.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): The Alameda Police Department in California has been using Truleo for a little over a year. It's seen a 36 percent drop in use of force by officers, Tassone says. The A.I. pointed out risky interactions with civilians, giving officers the chance to review and change their behaviors.
 
(on-camera): What would Truleo's involvement have been in a situation like Tyre Nichols?
 
TASSONE: I feel very strongly that Truleo not only would have recognized, obviously, the event of the murder of Tyre Nichols, but the hundreds of events that took place prior to that. I believe Truleo would have prevented the death of Tyre because it would have detected the deterioration in the officer's behavior years prior.
 
YURKEVICH (on-camera): There are 18,000 police departments in the U.S. Just 20 are using Truleo, with 20 more signing on this year, including Aurora PD in Colorado.
 
CHIEF ART ACEVEDO, AURORA, COLORADO POLICE: It will be an early warning system that will help save careers and ultimately maybe even save lives.
 
YURKEVICH (on-camera): In 2019, three Aurora police officers were charged with the death of Elijah McClain, using excessive force during his arrest.
 
ACEVEDO: If we see just a little change in the officer's performance, we'll be able to actually intervene early on, get them help, get them counseling, get them training, do whatever it takes to get back on the right track.
 
YURKEVICH (on-camera): Back in Castle Shannon, Chief Truver says the technology has only proven what he already suspected about his officers.
 
(on-camera): What has this changed anything?
 
TRUVER: No. And I don't think that's a bad thing. I want to catch something before it happens. I don't want to be reactionary. We want to be looking ahead to make sure that we stay ahead of the game, ahead of any issues. And I don't think that's a bad thing.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH: Now, the Seattle Police Department was one of the first to adopt Truleo, but in recent months, they've actually canceled their subscription with the A.I. platform because they had concerns over citizen privacy.
 
We, obviously, asked Truleo about this. They said that all of the data, all of the video lives on the department's server, so the department is the one in control. And Truleo also said that there is way -- there are ways to protect privacy, redacting certain information, making sure citizens feel like their footage encounters with police officers are being looked at safely, and their information is not going outside of the police department. HARLOW: Yes. You would need to know the identity of a person, like he brought up Tyre Nichols, for example. You'd need to know the identity of the person to get involved in a situation.
 
I -- so many questions. This is so fascinating. How expensive is it? Can departments afford this?
 
YURKEVICH: Departments can afford it if the municipalities and cities are willing to pay for it. It's about $20 to $50 per month per officer. If you're a larger department, it is more expensive. But there are federal funding programs that you can certainly apply for to help offset those costs.
 
But this technology being used by a small group of police departments. But obviously, the goal for this founder is to get it to go nationwide.
 
HARLOW: Yes. And Audie makes -- made a good point about it, too.
 
CORNISH: Yes, of course. It'll prevent lawsuit costs theoretically.
 
YURKEVICH: Right. The costs to pay for this could be, at the end of the day, maybe cheaper, more affordable for some departments who could face lawsuits in the future, as you mentioned.
 
COLLINS: We'll see if it's adopted on a widespread basis.
 
Vanessa, great report. Thank you.
 
YURKEVICH: Thank you.
 
CORNISH: The chair of the Federal Reserve duped. He thought he was talking to President Zelenskyy. That was not the case. What we're learning about this apparent prank?
 
COLLINS: I can't believe this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:47:47]
 
HARLOW: This morning video is circulating. Everyone's talking about this. A prank video chat involving the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell thought that he was talking to the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So how do you assesses the policy of the Central Bank of Russia, for example? So they managed to save the rebel. Why?
 
JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: Yes. So I should say that in our system, in our governmental system, it's really the administration, which is to say, we're not part of the administration. We're an independent central bank.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: A Federal Reserve spokesperson acknowledged Powell participated in a conversation in January with someone who misrepresented himself as the Ukrainian President. But the spokesperson notes the clip had been edited and could not confirm its authenticity.
 
No sensitive or confidential information was discussed. The matter was referred to law enforcement, but just the fact that it happened is wow.
 
Senior Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans is here with us. Wow, right?
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's embarrassing. And it was meant to be embarrassing, you know. These are two Russian pranksters who are supporters of Vladimir Putin who've done this to other people. Christine Lagarde, for example, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
 
So they somehow have managed to hoax their way, prank their way to the very top. You know, this was supposed to be a friendly conversation. The United States showing its support for Ukraine. That's what Jay Powell thought he was doing, but instead, he was talking to true, kind of notorious pro-Putin Russian pranksters.
 
CORNISH: Wow.
 
ROMANS: And it's all floating out there in Russian media.
 
COLLINS: It's so bad. It's so bad. It makes me cringe. I saw yesterday, I was like, oh, my God. And I know they're probably so embarrassed by it.
 
Could we talk about something else before you go? Because this is a totally separate topic, but this is a headline that really caught everyone when it was -- the amount of women CEOs compare -- finally met up with the number of male CEOs not total named John and James, right?
 
ROMANS: This is breaking the glass ceiling. Breaking the John ceiling. I don't know. There are 41 -- a record high 41 CEOs who are women. It has taken a long time to get to that number. 41 out of 500. And here's how they stack up.
 
41 female CEOs finally is more than CEO named John. There are 23 of those. Tom, Dick or, Harry, there are 24 Tom, Dicks, or Harrys. There are three CEOs named Jennifer. A record high number of Jennifer.
 
COLLINS: Three general.
 <br>[06:50:07]
 
ROMANS: It just -- it's a reminder. And for the past few years, economists and, you know, observers have kind of go back to this and they talk about it. It just shows you how kind of ridiculous it is and how slow it has been for women in corporate leadership.
 
A record high 41, yay. But, you know, breaking the John ceiling is really kind of a sad commentary on affairs, right?
 
CORNISH: I know.
 
ROMANS: Will you talk of the why it is? I mean, why aren't there more women leading these companies? Is it because the pipeline doesn't -- 
 
CORNISH: You're talking about the elite companies, right? Small business owners, women -- 
 
ROMANS: Yes, absolutely. These are the -- 
 
CORNISH: -- have been that totally surging.
 
ROMANS: These are the S&amp;P, this 500 -- 
 
HARLOW: Public companies.
 
ROMANS: -- biggest public companies. And is it the pipeline that is not conducive? Is it something about people hire and promote people who they either know or see themselves in? So if you've got men running the show, then the men promote, you know, that way. So we'll see.
 
HARLOW: Christine, thank you.
 
ROMANS: You're welcome.
 
HARLOW: Very, very much.
 
CORNISH: An Alabama woman was in severe pain, unable to move, so she calls 911 and says she was stunned when her neighbor showed up to answer her call for help. CNN's Isabel Rosales reports on how a firefighter went beyond the call of duty.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DYLAN FARLEY, FIREFIGHTER/PARAMEDIC, MOORES MILL VOLUNTEER FIRE RESCUE: Hey, Ms. Judy, how are you?
 
JUDY GROOVER, 911 CALL LED TO FRIENDSHIP WITH FIRST RESPONDER: I'm fine.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There's a half a century between them.
 
FARLEY: I'm good. I'm good.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): But a couple of moving boxes and a medical emergency mark the beginning of a beautiful friendship between Dylan Farley and Judy Groover.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tell me exactly what happened.
 
GROOVER: I just moved here and I've been unpacking boxes and my back is killing me.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Judy calls it one of the most painful experiences of her life.
 
GROOVER: It just -- it was excruciating. It really was.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): The then 78-year-old was lifting heavy moving boxes on her own. She's new to Moores Mill, Alabama, so no friends or family were on hand to help.
 
FARLEY: I could step out my front door and see her house, and it just wouldn't make sense to go out your front -- be able to see someone in need, and then not go help them.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Before Judy could hang up the phone with 911, Dylan was at her door.
 
GROOVER: I was thrilled to see him. I said, gosh, you were fast. And he explained that he was my neighbor.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): As he helped her into the ambulance -- 
 
FARLEY: I got a key to her house so I could come, feed the dog and take care of everything later if she was still at the hospital.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): But Dylan knew his work wasn't done. These days, paramedics are trained not just to answer calls, but to prevent the next one. So Dylan texted colleagues at the fire station, and he showed up at Judy's door again, this time with 10 other volunteer firefighters ready to help remove those stack boxes so Judy wouldn't get hurt again.
 
GROOVER: I just -- I was dumbfounded. I thought, you know, that that's above and beyond the call of duty.
 
ROSALES (on-camera): These are strangers to you.
 
GROOVER: Yes. They are. But it didn't take long that they weren't strangers. We got to laughing and had a good time really.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): With laughter and memory sharing, she says it was almost like a party.
 
GROOVER: Well, they found a box of booze.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Since then -- 
 
FARLEY: Hi, Ms. Judy.
 
GROOVER: Hey.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Her new friends and neighbors have made repeat house calls.
 
GROOVER: I'm very stubborn, very independent, but I have learned to have patience. And this back deal has really made me aware that I'm not spring chicken anymore and I have to rely on other people.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): The moving boxes are long gone, but their bond still growing.
 
GROOVER: I don't know how to put it other than just close friends.
 
FARLEY: Oh yes.
 
GROOVER: Yes.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Isabel Rosales, CNN, Atlanta.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COLLINS: Lovely story there from Isabel.
 
Also this morning news, legendary TV show host Jerry Springer has died. We're going to take a look back at the rise to his top -- his time at the top of daytime TV. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(CHANTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[06:58:51]
 
COLLINS: I mean, how many times did you watch that show? This morning, his fans, Jerry Springer's, are remembering him. The legendary TV host has died. A family spokesperson announced that he died at his Chicago home yesterday after a battle that he had with pancreatic cancer. He was 79 years old.
 
Before he ever became a talk show host, though, he was a politician. In the 1970s, he was on the Cincinnati City Council before he became the mayor of Cincinnati. He even ran unsuccessfully for the governor of Ohio. But it was that daytime talk show that so many watch and propelled him into the zeitgeist of 1990s culture.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What the hell do you think you are?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You better stop disrespecting me.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, hey, hey.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, you do not get in her face.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can see -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) CORNISH: So as you can see, the show was panned as trashy, salacious and violent. TV Guide ranked it number one on a list of worst shows in the history of television. Still, Springer always defended his program.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JERRY SPRINGER, LEGENDARY TALK SHOW HOST: Look, it's an absurd show.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why do you keep doing it?
 
SPRINGER: Well, I told you. One, I enjoy it, and two, there's a part of me that doesn't want to give in to -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Snobbery.
 
SPRINGER: Yes. Because I will say that the argument against the show is totally elitist. The only reason people argue against the show is because these people don't speak the Queen's English.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Springer help propel the career of his friend and mentee, Steve Wilkos, who worked as security, would break up a lot of those fights you just saw before eventually getting a program of his own.
 
In a statement to CNN, Wilkos wrote, "Other than my father, Jerry was the most influential man in my life. Everything I have today I owe to him."
