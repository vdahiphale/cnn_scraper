COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What`s up lovely people. It`s Tuesday time to shine, hope you`re ready to rock and fuel your mind. I`m Coy Wire. This is 
 
 CNN 10. Let`s get informed and uplifted with the best 10 minutes in news. We`re going to start today with the latest news on the suspect in a recent 
 
 leak of classified Pentagon documents posted on social media. On Friday, in federal court in Boston, Jack Teixeira, a former airman of the 
 
 Massachusetts Air National Guard was charged under the Espionage Act for the unauthorized retention and transmission of National Defense Information 
 
 as well as the removal of classified materials.
 
According to court documents, Teixeira worked as a low-ranking I.T. official and held top secret security clearance. He allegedly posted about 
 
 the documents online in December and shared photos of them in January. Detailed intelligence assessments were among the leaked U.S. documents.
 
Now CNN has reviewed some of them and they contain a wide array of highly classified information such as info from eavesdropping on important allies 
 
 and adversaries as well as evaluations on the status of the Ukraine war. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann has more.

OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  In a federal courtroom in Boston, 21-year-old, Jack Teixeira, faced his legal fate for the first time 
 
 charged through the Espionage Act with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and national security information. The Airman First 
 
 Class at the center of an investigation into a leak of top-secret information.
 
In court, his father yelled out, "Love you, Jack." The response, "Love you to, Dad."
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you surprise by this?
 
LIEBERMANN:  Outside the courthouse, Teixeira`s family thrust into the spotlight with national security interests at stake said nothing. Teixeira 
 
 was an I.T. specialist with the Massachusetts Air National Guard. He enlisted before graduating high school. His senior year photo had a quote 
 
 that now appears prophetic, actions speak louder than words. He`s had a top-secret clearance since 2021. And access to sensitive compartmentalized 
 
 information in a job that requires a lifetime binding nondisclosure agreement.
 
MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  People who sign agreements to be able to receive classified documents acknowledge the importance to the national 
 
 security of not disclosing those documents, and we intend to send that message how important it is to our national security.
 
LIEBERMANN:  One day earlier at one hour south, Teixeira was spotted on his back porch reading a book, moments later the FBI tactical team closed in on 
 
 Teixeira taking him into custody outside his house.
 
On Discord, an online platform frequently used by gamers, Teixeira built his own group of friends and followers. Court documents allege that late 
 
 last year he began sharing classified information, a user in the chat group telling the FBI at first it was just paragraphs of text and then 
 
 photographs of documents that contained what appeared to be classification markings.
 
ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST:  The fact is, it`s quite easy to do if you are a person who has decided to violate your oath, to 
 
 violate the training and the rules that you operate under and to proactively make a decision to break the law.
 
LIEBERMANN:  In the days before his arrest, court documents say Teixeira used his government computer to search classified intelligence reporting 
 
 for the word leak on attempt to find out if investigators were on to him.
 
(On camera): After Teixeira`s first court appearance on Friday, he`ll have a detention hearing on Wednesday. This whole legal process it seems moving 
 
 forward very quickly. About a week from when President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and others first learned about the leaks to the 
 
 arrest and the prosecution now moving forward for Jack Teixeira. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.

WIRE:  Ten-second trivia.
 
Where did Napoleon Bonaparte crown himself emperor of the French?
 
Arc de Triomphe, Palace of Versailles, Champs-Elysees or Notre Dame Cathedral?
 
Napoleon was at Notre Dame in 1804 when he took the crown from Pope Pius VII and placed it on his head by himself.
 
Notre Dame, an 860-year-old Cathedral in Paris is one of the most iconic churches in the world, but a massive blaze in 2019 destroyed large parts of 
 
 the relic including its idyllic spire and its roof which collapsed as firefighters battled the blaze. The roof had been said to be made of a 
 
 forest because of the acres and acres worth of trees that were made into beams to build it. But Notre Dame is being rebuilt now. Let`s meet up with 
 
 CNN Senior International Correspondent Jim Bittermann in Paris to see how this majestic monument is coming along.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It was the most haunting image of a sickening afternoon. The spire of Notre Dame crashing 
 
 through the cathedral roof as flames burned all around. In the four years since as giant oaks have been felled, and the ashes cleared away, shock and 
 
 dismay has turned to confidence that the spire and the cathedral will rise again. And soon, if you believe, the general, who President Emmanuel Macron 
 
 put in charge of rebuilding the monument.
 
GENERAL JEAN-LOUIS GEORGELIN, FRENCH ARMY GENERAL IN CHARGE OF RESTORATION: The President say we will rebuild this cathedral in five years, is the 
 
 world`s (inaudible) and reputation of France is at stake.
 
BITTERMANN: The General wants the Chief of Staff of the French army went to visit an extraordinary woodshop in eastern France to inspect how the work 
 
 is going. Here carpenters are moving around tons of oak like children`s building blocks to rebuild the spire that collapsed as well as the rest of 
 
 the cathedrals roof beams which were destroyed in the fire, cutting and fitting, precise down to the millimeter.
 
(On camera):  Well, much care and effort and money are being expended to make sure the reconstructed Notre Dame is just like the old one. The 
 
 workers who are working on these giant pieces of wood say they are sometimes amazed at how they could have done all this 1000 years ago.
 
(Voice-over):  One person who`s had a better view than most of the Notre Dame reconstruction is photographer Tomas Van Houtryve. His photos are 
 
 going up along the walls of the Notre Dame worksite. He began taking pictures of the cathedral long before the fire, sometimes using an ancient 
 
 wooden camera as old as the iconic spire itself.
 
Van Houtryve was then commissioned to document the Working side by National Geographic and the French establishment charged with the Notre Dame 
 
 restoration and preservation. As the monument slowly rose again from the ashes, he emotionally recorded the work inside and outside.
 
TOMAS VAN HOUTRYVE, PHOTOGRAPHER:  When you`re inside Notre Dame, you feel something. It`s a place of reverence. And when you`re inside it, and you 
 
 see it and it`s damaged to stay, you feel something even more. I mean, it goes straight to your heart.
 
BITTERMANN:  Van Houtryve has watched firsthand, as not only the damage from the fire was cleared away, but as well centuries of grime that had 
 
 accumulated before the fire. In some ways he believes the newly restored Notre Dame will be even better than what was there before.

WIRE:  What would you do if you were outside having some lunch or sipping some coffee and a motorized robotic trash can just wrote up on you and 
 
 started staring at you with this little camera lens? Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 is about a recent study in the streets of New York that 
 
 found while robot trash cans promoted social interaction and encouraged recycling. Some folks weren`t about it at all.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Come here, buddy. Thank you. Good job.
 
WENDY JU, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, CORNELL TECH:  When we did this project, we were actually hoping to roboticized chairs and tables literally our 
 
 partners, you know, and the business improvement district said, are you kidding? It`s New York, you have to do trash.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Oh, good boy. Oh, there you go, good boy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s recycling.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, it`s recycling. Oh, you are. You are a bad boy. You don`t know what you`re doing. Yeah, it`s OK. They`re learning. It still 
 
 helps.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That`s creepy. That`s just freaking creepy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.
 
ILAN MANDEL, PH.D STUDENT, CORNELL TECH: We`re not trying to sell a trash robot, we`re trying to understand how people interact with robot objects.
 
Before we do the deployment, we watch how the people who clean the streets actually do their work.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There you go.
 
MANDEL: The work they do is incredibly nuanced and difficult and very unlikely to be automatable without completely restructuring the 
 
 infrastructure of the street.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What does he want?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That cup bro.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will give you my straw.
