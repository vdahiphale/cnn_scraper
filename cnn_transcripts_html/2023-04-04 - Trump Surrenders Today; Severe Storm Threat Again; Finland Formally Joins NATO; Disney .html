THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[09:30:00]
 
ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: I mean it's got to be genuinely terrifying, right? I mean John and I have both been involved in prosecuting really dangerous people, powerful people, violent criminals, people accused of murder, mass attack. In a way that this is different because of the size and intensity of the following that this particular individual has. And John's right, the fear is really not so much with the mass gathering. I can give you my first-hand testimony. I was at Trump Tower yesterday. Maybe two or three dozen protesters. Mild. What protest should be, just cheering and signs. This morning I was there, as of an hour and a half ago, nothing. But the fear is always, as John said, that lone wolf.
 
Remember, very shortly after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August, a person stormed an FBI headquarters and was shot and killed. That's what you're afraid of.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, counselor, we've been talking about this indictment, which will be unsealed. We will actually find out a ton more information, we think, than we have known to this point. What are you looking for that might make the case stronger than we thought, or perhaps weaker than we thought?
 
HONIG: First of all, how much information are they going to give us in this indictment? Prosecutors write indictments and you have completely way over how much or how little you put in there. Many indictments have nothing more than the language that's in the statute books. Just fill in the person's name and the dates and that's that. Other indictments, what we call speaking indictments, tell the full story. So, how much detail are they going to give us? 
 
And then the second thing, what are the charges? We've all been expecting charges relating to the business records relating to the Stormy Daniels hush money payments. If that's it, I'd be a little nervous for the D.A. I'd be nervous going just on that. So, will we see something that catches us by surprise, some other financial angle, some other unexpected charge?
 
BERMAN: So finally, Mr. Miller, we've been reporting, CNN is reporting, that Trump's lawyer is claiming that Trump is going to speak before and after the arraignment. Is that up to him? Because once he walks in that door he's under arrest. MILLER: So, technically, he's in custody, but he's going to walk down that hallway. He'll be with his Secret Service detail. He will not be handcuffed, like the last two Trump associates who were brought through that hallway in cuffs by the same district attorney's office. 
 
But, I think what we're talking about is maybe three things. Maybe a one or two word or one sentence utterance towards the cameras that are that pool camera that is set up in the hallway that will get him on the record. Number two, what happens in court? Does he say not guilty?
 
BERMAN: Yes. 
 
HONIG: Right.
 
MILLER: Does his lawyer say not guilty? Or does he put a flourish on it? And this is things -- this -- 
 
HONIG: It happens.
 
MILLER: These are things that defendants actually practice in the mirror and are careful decisions like 1,000 percent not guilty. Absolutely not guilty. That's the second piece. And then the third piece is just the reverse, which is on the way out does he pass by those cameras? Now he's not in custody, released on his own recognizance, and say maybe more than a sentence. 
 
BERMAN: We will be watching very closely. 
 
John Miller, thank you. 
 
Elie Honig, thank you, as always.

SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Something else people are watching this morning, 70 million people from the Great Lakes to Texas are under threat of severe weather. The storms could bring damaging winds and giant hail. 
 
The big concern is the possibility of long track tornadoes that could hit parts of Missouri and further south into Texas. In the danger zone again, areas already devastated by deadly tornadoes over the weekend. 
 
CNN's Derek Van Dam is in Little Rock, Arkansas, for us.
 
Derek, people are still trying to recover. We can see all the damage behind you. But they might have to face this again?
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: Yes, there's almost a real thing called severe weather fatigue, where people are just getting continuous back to back severe weather events. The damage that you are seeing behind me is from exact wording that you talked about, strong, long-tracked tornadoes. The tornado that caused this damage was on the ground for, get this, almost 32 miles. 
 
Now, it's the exact wording that the National Weather Service is using to talk about the threats that we have here in Little Rock and the general surrounding areas, and also to the north as well. We'll highlighting that in just a moment. But look at this extensive damage. We have had utility crews trying their best to cut back the trees, pushed back some of the worst impacted buildings.
 
But I want you to see what 165 mile per hour winds are capable of, toppling trees onto homes. Of course, you can imagine just how dangerous that is. 
 
You see my graphics and we talk about the threats today. There are two distinct areas that I am concerned about, the Midwest, so Davenport into this -- the eastern sections of Iowa. That has a moderate risk. And then to the south, that is where we're currently located. That is an overnight threats. So, the potential for nocturnal tornadoes exists here. That means the potential to catch you off guard as you sleep. Have multiple ways to receive your weather alerts. 
 
And you can already see there's so much lift in the atmosphere that storms are already firing in Davenport. 
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
There is the greatest risk for our tornadoes today. It is going to be a long 24 hours. And we talk about severe weather fatigue. It's real here. People are tired, and they're also scared.
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: Derek Van Dam. Every time you give a report, I learn something new. Long track tornadoes can last hours, not just minutes, like we're used to when we see a tornado. 
 
VAN DAM: Right.
 
SIDNER: Thank you so much, live there from Little Rock, Arkansas.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: Finland is officially the 31st member of NATO. Something Russia has long feared. We have new reaction from the Kremlin. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: It is an historic day for NATO and a major setback for Vladimir Putin. As of this morning, Finland has officially become the 31st member of the NATO alliance. 
 <br>[09:40:05]
 
I'm going to show you a live look in Brussels. Right here, in just moments, the Finnish flag will be raised at NATO headquarters in Brussels for the first time. The most immediate and significant impact of Finland's membership comes down to one number, 832 miles. That is the length of Finland's border with Russia. To put that in perspective, we want to show you what NATO's eastern flank looked like before and then what it looks like today, more than doubling NATO's presence against Putin's border. 
 
Additionally, NATO will now have access to Finland's military assets. Unlike many members of the military alliance, Finland did not cut back on military spending after the Cold War. The country has upwards of 257,000 troops, both active and in reserve, as well as hundreds of tanks and combat aircraft. 
 
It's also important to remember the original goal of NATO, formally known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The group was formed in 1949 to challenge Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II. The treaty was signed 74 years ago today. And at the heart of that treaty is Article 5, the principle of collective defense, which is, an attack on one member of NATO is, quote, shall be considered an attack against them all. This article has only been invoked once in NATO's history after September 11th. 
 
Now, Finland's membership coincides with a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that includes Secretary of State Tony Blinken.
 
Let's go to CNN's Nic Robertson in London for much more on this.
 
Nic, we just heard from the secretary of state, Blinken. Let's play this. Listen here. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm tempted to say this is maybe the one thing that we can thank Mr. Putin for, because he, once again, here has precipitated something he claims to want to prevent by Russia's aggression, causing many countries to believe that they have to do more to look out for their own defense and to make sure that they could deter possible Russian aggression going forward. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Now, Nic, part of the rationale that Putin offered for initiating his invasion of Ukraine was his fear of NATO expansion. This seems the exact opposite of what Putin was going for. 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Oh, a hundred percent. He sold it to the Russians that he was going to go into Ukraine to force -- essentially force NATO back. 
 
What's really fascinating here is that it's the Fins, not anyone else, that decided they wanted to join NATO. If you go back just a year and a half ago, most Fins thought they didn't really need to be in NATO, but as soon as Putin went into Ukraine, the position changed on that almost overnight, within the space of a couple of weeks. The majority of the Finnish people said, look, we want to become members of NATO. And the political leaders moved very quickly to make sure that that was going to happen. 
 
You talked there about that massive military capacity that Finland has those 270 odd 1,000 potential troops available there. They've been partnered with NATO for years. They've been training with NATO. Their equipment is compatible with NATO equipment. So, they're a ready force. So, when you hear NATO secretary general say this makes Finland safer and NATO stronger, that's the message to Putin that he just inherited a much bigger problem precisely because he went into Ukraine. So, he sold the Russians a failure. 
 
BOLDUAN: And Sweden applied for membership at the very same time as Finland, Nic. And, of course, you remember that. Their application is delayed. What's happening there? 
 
ROBERTSON: Yes, it's being held up by Turkey and Hungary at the moment. The thinking is at the moment that if Turkey gives a go ahead, then Hungary will as well. Turkey was the last NATO member, the 30th member, to ratify Finland's application to join NATO. 
 
So, what is Turkey holding out over? They're saying that Finland -- that rather Sweden is harboring terrorists, Turkish terrorists, the PKK, the Kurdish workers' party. So, this is something that is a contentious issue with Sweden because Sweden says these people you're asking for, they are in our country. We give them due process. And there's no need to extradite them as you want. 
 
But I think something that kind of -- a fly that flew in the ointment during those tense negotiations just in the past couple of months was a far right Danish politician having a protest in Sweden's capital, Stockholm, burning a Koran, and that really ticked off the -- ticked off the Turkish. So, at the moment, the talks between them are at a standstill. But the secretary general of NATO did say today he hopes that Sweden will be able to join by the early summer.
 
BOLDUAN: And we were just looking at live pictures from Brussels of the NATO secretary general speaking at this ceremony where the Finnish flag is about to be raised amongst its now NATO allies. 
 <br>[09:45:08]
 
It's good to see you, Nic. Thank you so much. 
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: A big vote in Chicago today. Voters are heading to the polls this morning to chose the next mayor of the windy city. Crime and education are huge issues on the ballot. Which two of these gentlemen will win? We'll talk all about it. 
 
And, let the celebrations begin. For the fifth time, the UConn Huskies are the new NCAA champs. We'll replay highlights from last night's championship game.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And this day belongs to the Huskies. UConn has its fifth. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) SIDNER: Disney is fighting back against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. CEO Bob Iger calling Florida's actions against the company anti- business after Governor DeSantis tried to strip some of Disney's oversight of its own theme park. This fight has been simmering since Disney objected last year to legislation to limit discussions of LGBTQ issues in Florida schools. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOB IGER, CEO, DISNEY: And so our point on this is that any action that thwarts those efforts simply to retaliate for a position the company took sounds not just anti-business, but it sounds anti- Florida. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[09:50:13]
 
SIDNER: CNN's Rahel Solomon is with us now. 
 
Rahel, the CEO also had some really strong things to say to his shareholders as well.
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: He had some strong words and also made some bold predictions, saying, essentially, we are investing a lot of money in Florida over the next decade, saying that they plan to invest $17 billion in the state of Florida. That should generate 13,000 jobs, according to Bob Iger. But this should also mean more visitors to the state of Florida, which means, of course, more money for the state of Florida. 
 
Now, Sara, at the center of all of this is that special tax district that Disney has enjoyed for quite some time. And more specifically at the center of this is the board of the special tax district because up until recently Disney had appointed that board. Disney had very close ties with that board. That has recently changed. 
 
But what DeSantis' office has recently discovered is that that previous board actually gave Disney back some of its power. And so now you have DeSantis saying, wait a minute, you are trying to undermine us. 
 
I just want to read for you a comment that his office made after we heard from Bob Iger, saying, the Florida legislature and Governor DeSantis worked to put Disney on an even playing field and Disney got caught attempting to undermine Florida's duly enacted legislation in the 11th hour. 
 
So, what happens now? Well, DeSantis is calling for an investigation into that previous board. And as he has said recently, it ain't over yet. You ain't seen nothing yet.
 
SIDNER: Happiest place on earth, getting into a tussle with the governor. It's just sort of an interesting dichotomy. 
 
But how critical is Disney to the Florida economy? I know being from Florida it's a big deal.
 
SOLOMON: Yes. I mean for a lot of people, when you think Florida, you think Disney. And when you think Disney, you think Florida, right. It is that type of relationship. And Disney is the largest private employer in central Florida. It generates lots of jobs. It generates lots of revenue. And it really powers a tourism industry in that part of Florida that generates billions of dollars in tax revenue for Florida, employs 75,000 people, 50 million visitors annually, not including the pandemic, but on a good year, in a normal year, that's what we tend to see. 
 
But I think DeSantis' office would say, yes, sure, Disney is important for Florida, but Florida is important for Disney too.
 
Rahel Solomon, she knows all the business, including some of mine. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. 
 
John.
 
BERMAN: All right, cries of joy this morning in the most remote corners of the nutmeg state. The UConn Huskies are the NCAA men's basketball champions for the fifth time. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The coach's son is going to dribble out his dad's championship, 76-59. Every dog has his day, and this day belongs to the Huskies. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: It certainly did. Now, San Diego State surprised almost everyone to even get to the finals. But, in the end, UConn was just too much. Much too much. 
 
Coy Wire is in Houston.
 
And, Coy, look after a tournament filled with all kinds of surprises and drama, this was kind of, you know, in the hand pretty early.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes, Uconn, you concurred (ph) As a four seed they beat their opponents, John, by an average of 20 points during this tournament. One of the most dominant performances by any team in any March Madness ever. Coach Dan Hurley's Huskies, all heart. He told me that his team doesn't have an Achilles heel, John. He said, we'll out rebound you, play harder, beat you at the rim and make the three. Well, they did all that against San Diego State. 
 
The Huskies stormed out to that 16 point lead in the first half, then shut down any and all Aztec efforts to come back. A 76-59 wins. It's UConn's fifth natty (ph). That's as many as Duke and Indiana. Adama Sanogo, a junior from Mali, is your tournament most outstanding player. 
 
And Coach Hurley's son, Andrew, getting to give dad a big old hug just after that clock struck zero. I caught up with coach on his way to the locker room to celebrate the
 
 biggest moment of his career. 
 
Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: What kind of emotions are you feeling? 
 
DAN HURLEY, HEAD COACH, UCONN: All types of emotions. Obviously, you know, -- yeah. All right, baby! Yeah, baby! Let's go!
 
Yes, you know what, you just -- you're just so proud that you're able to, you know, deliver on the promise you made to the university that we could get this program back. And then the promises you made to the players, that we could do something special like this together. 
 
WIRE: When I talked to you yesterday, when I talk to you, Coach, you said you got emotional thinking about the fans and all the love they give you. What message do you have for them? 
 
HURLEY: I -- I'm crazy, you know? I'm a -- I'm a maniac, just like our fan base. So, I think that's why we're such a great fit for each other. And I just can't -- we cannot wait to get back to Connecticut and celebrate and share it with them. 
 
WIRE: Congrats, champ. 
 
HURLEY: Yes. Let's go, baby! I appreciate you, Coy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Congrats to coach. 
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
Congrats to Huskies Nation. The best part of this whole deal, John, is UConn, the entire team gets free burgers, fries and shakes for an entire year from the Way Back Burgers franchise. As a college kid, yes, please. 
 
BERMAN: Yes, I would eat nothing else for an entire year of that were the case.
 
Coy, so, the Hurley's, we talked about the coach Dan Hurley and his son who finished out the game, they're not the only family celebrating this morning. 
 
WIRE: Yes, listen to this, John. Star UConn guard Jordan Hawkins and his cousin, Angel Reese, who starts for LSU's women's team, both crowned national champions on the same weekend. And I asked Hawkins how he felt about that after the game. He said, look, this cookout, this barbecue is about to be turned all the way up when our family gets together. 
 
BERMAN: That is so cool. All right, Coy Wire, in Houston, glad you got to see it, my friend. Thank you very much. 
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: That is super fun.
 
All right, still ahead for us, in just a few hours, Donald Trump, the first former president in history to face criminal charges, will surrender to authorities in New York and make his first court appearance. We're following every moment.
 
And, a new world health organization study has found a staggering number of people around the world are facing infertility. We'll bring you that next hour.
