VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. Welcome to CNN THIS MORNING. It is Sunday, November 17th. I'm Victor Blackwell. You know, it's National Take A Hike Day. Why --
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Are you talking --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BLACKWELL: -- find that funny?
 
WALKER: I think he's telling me to take a hike.
 
BLACKWELL: Take a hike. No, I mean, as the weather is kind of get into that fall temperature.
 
WALKER: That is so random, National Take A Hike Day. I've never heard of that before.
 
BLACKWELL: Well --
 
WALKER: Well, now I know.
 
BLACKWELL: Now you know.
 
WALKER: All right. I'm going to go take a hike, guys. Good to be with you all. I'm Amara Walker.
 
And here is what we are working on for you this morning. New CNN reporting reveals that president-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon paid a settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault. What we know about the payout is coming up.
 
BLACKWELL: President Biden and his Chinese counterpart stressed the critical need to maintain stability between the two superpowers as president-elect Trump waits in the wings. We're live in Peru with the latest.
 
WALKER: And the fourth typhoon to hit the Philippines in less than two weeks is hammering the country right now with 115 mile per hour winds.
 
BLACKWELL: New allegations against Sean Combs in new federal court filing. Prosecutors say he's trying to taint the jury pool and tamper with witnesses while in jail.
 
President-elect Donald Trump took a break from transition planning to watch a UFC event and mingle with some fans last night.
 
Elon Musk, Kid Rock, other supporters were there. He waved to the crowd. You can see some of the video.
 
Meanwhile, there are new revelations and concerns about his cabinet picks. The attorney for Trump's defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth says the former Fox anchor did pay a woman who accused him of sexual assault. But he says the 2017 incident in Monterey was a consensual sexual encounter.
 
WALKER: And despite widespread unease on Capitol Hill, Trump is pushing ahead with his decision to nominate former representative Matt Gaetz as his attorney general. Lawmakers and allies warn Gaetz faces an uphill battle for confirmation.
 
CNN's Daniel Strauss is with us now. Daniel, let's start with these allegations involving Pete Hegseth. How do you think this will affect his chances of confirmation?
 
DANIEL STRAUSS, CNN REPORTER: I mean, it was already an open question right now about Hegseth's chances, simply because this was a surprising pick and one that his critics say is unqualified to run the entire Department of Defense. Now, here there's more ammo against Hegseth. These questions about whether he was vetted, his temperament and his background will further imperil his nomination prospects when he is one of the most unusual picks of a handful of nominees that Trump has already made for his cabinet.
 
BLACKWELL: A handful and check out Matt Gaetz. He needs 51 votes to be confirmed or at least 50, and the vice president. What's the likelihood of that happening? Any more reporting there?
 
STRAUSS: I have heard -- a congressional chief of staff source of mine has said when I asked about how likely it is that Gaetz would be confirmed, this person asked if this was an actual question. The chances of him getting confirmed with so many questions, with an ethics investigation that was about to be released, about his conduct really makes this unlikely in the long run.
 
There are already four or five Republican senators who say they want this ethics release on Gaetz released and they really have a number of questions. And look, this is an unusual situation. Gaetz is not a former DOJ official. His experience as a lawyer is pretty marginal. So, his elevation to run the entire justice department would be a pretty big. BLACKWELL: All right. Daniel Strauss, thanks so much. Joining us now, Stephen Neukam, congressional reporter for Axios. Good morning to you. And let's stay with Matt Gaetz as the president's pick for attorney general.
 
Sources tell CNN that Trump believes Gaetz is his most important member of his cabinet. We heard the reporting on some feeling in Congress about getting to confirmation.
 <br>[06:05:01]
 
But what is the president willing to do and are there enough Republicans who are willing to buck the president after this win?
 
STEPHEN NEUKAM, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, AXIOS: I think right now there probably are enough Republicans in the Senate to kill that confirmation. Of all of the nominations that were released over the last week or so the Gaetz nomination, when we were on Capitol Hill this week was the -- I think, the one that made everybody stand still and we saw the most criticism from Republicans.
 
Now the question is, and the president-elect has already signaled that he wants Congress to allow him to do recess appointments, right, that would sort of take the confirmation out of the Senate's hands. It remains to be seen whether Senate majority -- the new Senate majority leader, when we get the new Congress in January, John Thune, will allow that to happen. And I think that that's the big fight and the thing that's going to come to a head between congressional leadership, Republican leadership and the president-elect.
 
BLACKWELL: Let's talk Pete Hegseth now, the president's pick for defense secretary. And we use that terminology intentionally because he has not been formally nominated for the position. He's just been chosen and announced.
 
So, as we take the first step of this process, does this revelation that he paid an accuser and denies the allegation of sexual assault, does the payment make him any less likely to be the actual nominee once this process starts?
 
NEUKAM: Maybe. Look, I mean, I think even if he gets through that stage, the path to confirmation is pretty fraught. We heard from a number of Democratic and Republican senators who, you know, put aside any of the accusations that came out -- major concerns about, you know, somebody who has never led a major organization, has never implemented policy at a huge business, at an executive level.
 
I mean, the Pentagon, you know, millions of employees, a very complex network of people and the way that that institution works, there's major doubts that somebody who has never been within, you know, that confine of power will be able to be secretary of defense.
 
So, you put aside the allegations, I think, just the nomination on the face of it, if he does get through to actually being nominated is pretty difficult. BLACKWELL: Well, Stephen, so I just question whether congressional Senate Republicans are going to reject two of the Trump nominees. Maybe one of them between Gaetz and Hegseth based on the reporting. But it's plausible that they will send two of them back or force him to withdraw one of them.
 
NEUKAM: Withdraw one of them? Or, you know, we've heard conversations from conservative circles of the president, you know, maybe testing a theory that he can adjourn Congress himself and force these people into positions for at least two years by making recess -- recess appointments, right? I mean, that's the major fight and the executive power that I think that if these nominees aren't able to make it through the Senate in a normal process that we might see the president-elect revert to.
 
BLACKWELL: And they'll have to go into recess for 10 days for that to happen, to allow him that time consciously to appoint them in during the recess. Let's talk about the president-elect's choice for the Department of Energy, fracking company CEO Chris Wright. Let me play a bit of a video that he posted on LinkedIn last year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRIS WRIGHT, CEO LIBERTY ENERGY: There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either. Humans and all complex life on Earth is simply impossible without carbon dioxide. Hence the term carbon pollution is outrageous.
 
We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLACKWELL: Well, he certainly plants his flag. I mean, first, let's just say about that last part that the extreme weather is more frequent. There has been pushback about what's causing it, but it just is true that it's happening more frequently. But what does this this suggest to this election portend for the next four years of energy and environmental policy from the administration?
 
NEUKAM: Yes, I don't think there's going to be much of a priority on the environmental side of things from the president's agenda.
 <br>[06:10:02]
 
And then, obviously, you know, we've heard him talk about energy independence, drill, baby, drill. Look, hearing things like that is going to be nails on a chalkboard to a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill. But I think the reality is is that somebody like Mr. Wright probably has a better chance of getting through the Senate, of being confirmed, just because he has a bit more of a blase, a bit more of a -- a more normal nominee than when we talk about former congressman Gaetz for attorney general. So, I think that his glide path to getting through the Senate might be a little bit easier than some of the others. BLACKWELL: All right. Stephen Neukam, thank you. Enjoy the Sunday.
 
WALKER: A historic day ahead for President Biden as he'll become the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Amazon rainforest. The president-elect Trump, his incoming agenda will loom large as Biden meets with world leaders at the G20 this week. We are live with the latest.
 
And we're live with the possible progress in getting an American initiative for a ceasefire deal implemented between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. And federal prosecutors outline new allegations against disgraced music mogul Sean Diddy Combs. What he is accused of in federal jail, that's a little later.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:15:55]
 
BLACKWELL: President Biden will travel to Brazil in a few hours on the next leg of his South American tour, after a meeting on the sidelines of the APEC Summit with Chinese president Xi Jinping. White House officials described the meeting as candid, constructive and wide- ranging.
 
WALKER: Yes. Biden raised concerns about Taiwan, trade and the deployment of North Korean troops in Ukraine, but the election and the incoming Trump administration, of course, loomed large over the discussions.
 
Let's talk more about this. And joining me now is CNN global affairs analyst Kimberly Dozier and CNN military analyst retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Welcome to you both. Good morning.
 
Kim, let's start with you. Donald Trump was clearly looming over this final meeting between him and Xi. What did you make of President Xi's stern warning? He said, quote, "Make the wise choice. Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along with each other."
 
President Xi was speaking to President Biden, right, but he was actually sending a message to Trump. What did you make of that? Did you sense that Xi is concern about what lies ahead for U.S.-China relations?
 
KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Absolutely. It's as if he was sending a message and so was President Biden that, here's what it looks like when two leaders work together, keep having the tough conversations.
 
The National Security advisor, Jake Sullivan, briefed us after their meeting and said that the conversations aren't always pleasant but they're blunt and that that's important that the two men feel that they can have that kind of truth talking to each other.
 
And they did announce a couple of advances in that they announced that they agreed not to use A.I. to control nuclear weapons. So, they sort of put down a marker about that. They also talked about the success in keeping fentanyl, et cetera, narcotics from China flooding U.S. shores, and talked about the fact that the numbers of people affected had gone down so that China and the U.S. were cooperating on this even though they have a host of other issues that they're at loggerheads on.
 
WALKER: Yes, we can talk about those issues amidst this truth talking as you speak of. Colonel Leighton, at the APEC Summit, at the sidelines there Biden did raise several contentious issues with Xi, according to the White House readout. It included, you know, recent ramped up aggressions in the South China Sea and Taiwan, Chinese cyber-attacks on the U.S., its support of Russia in the Ukraine war. Do you see, Colonel, any of these issues getting amplified or perhaps worsening under Trump's second administration?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think it's certainly possible, Amara. And one of the key issues here is the fact that there are several flashpoints that you mentioned. You know, the cyber-attacks, like the Volt Typhoon attack against U.S. infrastructure starting out in the Pacific but then it broadened to both military and civilian infrastructure throughout the United States. You have the South China Sea and Taiwan, as you mentioned.
 
Plus, the fact that China is really going into a lot of the areas of the world that were previously dominated by the U.S. And Latin America is a case in point in this case. You have a port just north of Lima called Chancay, which has a large Chinese development effort going on right now. And what they're doing is they're building the largest container port in South America, right there in Peru that will benefit China because it shortens the trade time between -- the transit time between Latin America and China itself.
 
So, those are the kinds of things that are going on. These flashpoints are ones that are inevitable. They have to be managed and there's a great risk that they -- that things could get out of hand if they're not managed properly.
 
WALKER: And, Kim, as Biden heads to his last G20 Summit, this one is in Brazil, what will his role there be as the outgoing president?
 <br>[06:20:05]
 
Will he be trying to reassure allies, given that he is a lame duck with a successor who has pledged to basically undo many of his policies?
 
DOZIER: Well, he'll probably have the public phase and the private phase. Publicly, he'll be reassuring those attending that this is how democracy works. Our institutions in the United States are strong, and that's why I am here meeting with you and pushing forward some of these initiatives that we've worked on for four years. And we're essentially tossing them to the next administration so they can carry them forward.
 
Privately, I expect some of the close allies, like the members of the Five Eyes, the people who cooperate on intelligence, the U.S., Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia to have the blunt conversations of, what happens if Tulsi Gabbard is confirmed as Trump's director of National Intelligence when she has publicly mouthed and espoused a lot of Russian disinformation?
 
And they'll have to talk about, you know, here are some measures you might want to take. We can't stop you from that. But trust us, there are parts of our institution that will keep working with you no matter what's happening in the White House.
 
WALKER: What about Ukraine, Colonel Leighton, and the messaging there? I mean, we saw last year at the G20, it was deeply divided over the war in Ukraine. The western nations, basically, unsuccessfully pushed for strong condemnation of Russia.
 
And we see, you know, this contrasting picture between Biden and Trump. Biden has offered Ukraine unwavering support, right? And of course, Trump has cast a lot of doubt on America's commitment to Ukraine. How does Biden balance his message, then, on Ukraine?
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, I think that's going to be one of the toughest high wire acts that President Biden has to undertake, Amara. And one of the things that he has to do is, basically, tell the western world, and as many of the G20 countries as he can pull along with him, that they need to continue to support Ukraine no matter what happens here in the United States.
 
So, this is kind of a weird role for the president of the United States to be in because the transition is a different one than we've had before 2016. In other words, for the most part, foreign policy has been one of continuity between different U.S. presidents. But in this particular case, there's a risk of discontinuity. And that could adversely affect Ukraine and its ability to prevail in this war.
 
WALKER: And lastly, Kim, you know just like we saw in Trump's first term, do you expect that China is going to use Trump's second term, you know, his unpredictability, his America first policies to its advantage and try to fill that void the U.S. leaves on the world stage, and also, you know, use these kinds of summits, like the G20, to position or market China as the alternative, stable ally?
 
DOZIER: Well, Beijing has had a long-range plan to extend its influence that has happened during the Trump administration last time and during the Biden administration, with investments across the world as part of its one belt, one road plan.
 
But there's an opportunity here for Beijing to step in on the climate talks. Since Trump has signaled that he may even pull out of most of the climate accords that the U.S. is part of this is an opportunity for Beijing to take the lead in trying to reduce carbon dioxide. And also, just to use it as an influence mechanism to show that it is willing to be part of these international forums to drive progress forward while the Trump administration is signaling it's going to be increasingly isolationist.
 
All the while, you've got Biden probably telling them, look, in two years he'll be a lame duck. Trust America, we'll be back. WALKER: Kim Dozier, Colonel Cedric Leighton, thank you very much. The gymnastics world is mourning the loss of an iconic coach. The life and legacy of Bela Karolyi after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:28:46]
 
BLACKWELL: Top stories for you now. Let's talk about this really sad loss for the sports world. The coach known for catapulting U.S. women's gymnastics into a world force has died. Bela Karolyi and his wife trained multiple champions and Olympic gold medalists in the U.S. and Romania including Nadia Comaneci, Dominique Dawes, Kerri Strug, Mary Lou Retton. His training tactics came under scrutiny, though, and he was sued for taunting athletes at his Texas gym. Karolyi was 82 years old.
 
WALKER: A super typhoon has made landfall in the Philippines. The country has evacuated more than half a million people. Typhoon Man-yi is the unprecedented fourth typhoon to hit the Philippines in less than two weeks, and it has the force of a Category 3 hurricane. Civil defense officials said no deaths have been reported, but winds have wiped out homes and schools and buildings.
 
BLACKWELL: Well, thank you for being a friend. The U.S. Post Office will honor the life and work of Betty White with her own stamp. It's nearly three years after she died in 2021, just weeks before turning 100. The stamp was designed by an art director for the postal service. It will be available in 2025.
 <br>[06:30:03]
 
Israeli airstrikes are hitting Beirut for a sixth straight day, and at least two explosions struck the Lebanese capital earlier this morning as Israeli ground troops are advancing further into Lebanon.
 
WALKER: Now, a Lebanese official tells CNN that there are extensive discussions taking place among Lebanese political officials regarding a potential ceasefire.
 
U.S. officials have been pushing for one to prevent an expansion of Israel's ongoing offensive in parts of Lebanon.
 
CNN's Nada Bashir has more now from London.
 
Nada, what are you learning?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): We have been hearing from sources and Lebanese officials who have said there is some sense of optimism around this latest attempt to secure a ceasefire between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel.
 
This ceasefire, according to sources proposed on the table, would outline a 60-day cessation of facilities that would eventually, hopefully, lead to a lasting ceasefire between the two parties. But of course, questions as to where things stand currently. As you mentioned, we are continuing to see devastating airstrikes across Lebanon in the country's capital, Beirut. We are seeing an expansion of Israel's ground incursion in parts of southern Lebanon.
 
And we've previously heard from Israeli officials, including Israel's defense minister, rejecting any notion that Israel would agree to a ceasefire with Hezbollah unless Israel's military aims have been fully met. And similar messaging, of course, to what we've heard in Gaza with regards to the stalling ceasefire talks there.
 
But officials have told CNN that Hezbollah is considering the proposal currently on the table, that there are extensive discussions taking place between Lebanese political officials in Beirut, and that they could potentially see an official response as early as Monday night. But of course, the situation in Lebanon and between Hezbollah and Israel is still very much in flux, particularly as we continue to see the sixth straight day of airstrikes targeting parts of Beirut.
 
What is crucial and what we are hearing from officials familiar with these talks is that this current proposal on the deal, on the table put forward by the U.S., stands within the parameters of UN Resolution 1701, which essentially ended the war between Lebanon and Israel back in 2006, and would crucially stipulate that the only armed groups that should be present beyond the Litani River, beneath the Litani River in southern Lebanon, should be the Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping forces.
 
That would mean a removal of any Hezbollah militants in this area. That is something that Israel has been pushing for whether we see an agreement, that remains to be seen.
 
BLACKWELL: Nada, I mentioned at the top that Israel is pushing deeper into Lebanon. What more has Israel said?
 
BASHIR (on-camera): That's right. We've been hearing more details about this expansion of Israel's military operation in southern Lebanon. We'd previously heard from Israeli defense officials saying that they would plan to continue to move deeper. We've certainly seen that with the targeting of parts further deeper into parts of southern Lebanon, including in the area of the village of Chamaa, where we've seen a shrine, essentially to Saint Peter, being destroyed by Lebanese forces. It's our understanding that the Israeli forces, rather, were pushed back following Hezbollah fire. And we are continuing to see Hezbollah rocket fire targeting Israeli territory.
 
But again, no clear details as to how far the Israeli forces plan to expand their operation in southern Lebanon.
 
BLACKWELL: All right. Nada Bashir for us in London. Thank you.
 
WALKER: All right. Disgraced music mogul, Sean Diddy Combs, heads back to court this week, as federal prosecutors allege in new court filings that he is trying to taint the jury pool, even while he is in jail.
 
Our legal analyst will weigh in.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:38:22]
 
WALKER: Prosecutors accused Sean Diddy Combs of continuing efforts to obstruct the federal investigation into his sex trafficking case, and trying to taint the jury pool from his Brooklyn jail cell.
 
In court papers that were filed late Friday, prosecutors say the music mogul had been trying to evade government monitoring by using the telephone accounts of at least eight other inmates. Combs is also said to have used three-way calls to reach out to individuals not on an approved contact list. Prosecutors argue that Combs should not be entitled to another bail hearing after he sought to contact potential witnesses, including accusers with the goal of blackmailing them to keep quiet or help in his defense.
 
Joining me now is defense attorney Misty Marris.
 
Misty, good to see you this morning.
 
Let's first talk about these allegations from prosecutors of Diddy trying to tamper with witnesses and taint the jury pool. Tell us more about what they're saying regarding these calls that he -- P. Diddy made and what was said, and how he was able to, you know, get the telephone accounts of other inmates.
 
MISTY MARRIS, TRIAL ATTORNEY: Absolutely. I mean, this is something, Diddy's really not doing himself any favors if any of this is true.
 
So what prosecutors are alleging is that he's using different ways of communicating from behind bars in order to speak with witnesses and potentially alter what their testimony would be to be more favorable for him. Part of the reasoning for denying his bail application two times before was because prosecutors had made the argument that he had a tendency to try and interfere and intervene with these witnesses.
 <br>[06:40:07]
 
So what prosecutors are alleging is that, number one, he would make calls to individuals from behind bars that are permitted, like his sons or other people in his -- in his camp. But then they would have a three-way call, bringing other parties onto the call. That's not permitted, the reason being all jailhouse calls need to be monitored and are recorded.
 
So there has to be a knowledge of who's on that other line.
 
And then also you made a great point. They say, prosecutors, he was paying money in order to use a specific number. Every prisoner is assigned a number for those communications. So, he was using the number of other prisoners in order to -- 
 
WALKER: Wow.
 
MARRIS: -- evade, yes, oversight. So, all of that feeds into this argument that he's still, even behind bars, trying to engage with witnesses improperly. WALKER: And other allegations include him orchestrating social media campaigns, basically enlisting his own family members, including his children, to post on social media to allegedly taint the jury pool.
 
MARRIS: That, I think, is the less -- the less serious argument for prosecutors with respect to the bail application, because there's a counter-argument to that, that his family can make statements about him, about that he's innocent, a birthday message, which was the subject of this particular issue.
 
The more problematic conduct about tainting the jury pool is allegations that he was actually leaking items that would be evidence and trying to give that over to others to post. So that would qualify as obstructionist behavior as well.
 
All of that, again, these are just allegations, if true, would really be very detrimental to his newest bail application, but could also impact the case, both in the courtroom and potentially add more charges.
 
WALKER: Yes, you would imagine so, especially when this is their third time around trying to get -- 
 
MARRIS: Yes.
 
WALKER: -- this proposed bail application granted for $50 million. What about new charges? And could he face new charges as a result of potentially obstructing a federal investigation?
 
MARRIS: Absolutely. We know that there's already been grand jury proceedings, and it looks like that we're on a road towards a potential superseding indictment. A superseding indictment means that new charges could be added to the case. Those charges, given what we've seen in the allegations by prosecutors in this bail opposition, those could be witness tampering. It could be obstructing justice. It could be tampering with witnesses, tampering with evidence.
 
So, all of that could be new charges he could face, given this conduct that's being alleged by prosecutors.
 
WALKER: So, Misty, when this bail hearing happens, I think it's coming up this week, it'll be the third, as we said, request. What do you expect to happen? Will it be denied?
 
MARRIS: Yes, look, right now, one of the primary concerns of the judges that had seen this bail application previously, is he a danger to society and is he a flight risk? Those are the two prongs. What was flagged and specifically said by the judge is that if he's behind bars, he won't be able to tamper with witnesses. Whereas if he's outside, there's evidence that he might.
 
Well, now he's providing evidence that even behind bars is conduct. Even behind bars, he's still trying to get at those witnesses. So how can the judge say, OK, go on your own volition, even though it's this beefed-up package for bail, the proposal, including 24-hour security and monitoring in his own home. Is that really going to stop him? If being at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Center can't, I expect this to be denied, especially given these new allegations.
 
WALKER: Yes, it's not looking good for Diddy, is it?
 
Misty Marris -- 
 
MARRIS: (INAUDIBLE).
 
WALKER: -- we'll leave it there. Thank you so much.
 
BLACKWELL: A new report from the Justice Department found that Atlanta's Fulton County Jail unconstitutionally subjects inmates to inhumane and violent conditions.
 
Now, the Justice Department started investigating after the 2022 death of LaShawn Thompson. He was found dead in his cell, covered in lice and filth.
 
CNN senior national correspondent Ryan Young has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Fulton County officials have 48 days to rectify some of the issues at the jail or the Justice Department could move forward with putting more stringent restrictions on that jail facility. We know the county plans to spend $300 million trying to rectify some of these issues.
 
But let's take this into account. There have been over 314 stabbings. There's been sexual assaults. Inmates have died. And what we also learn is as you look at the jail facility, there are metal parts that fall down off that jail all the time. And inmates turn those into weapons. Those weapons are used against other inmates and sometimes targeting staff.
 
This has been a long-standing issue with the Fulton County Jail. They know they need to make improvements. The $1.7 billion facility for a new jail that's been denied. So, this $300 million fix is going to be very important as that facility moves forward.
 <br>[06:45:12]
 
But take a listen to what the DOJ found during a 16-month investigation.
 
RYAN BUCHANAN, U.S. ATTORNEY, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA: Aside from the glaring risk of violence detainees face insidious threat of unsafe living conditions, constant exposure to rodents and pests and an unsettling disregard for food safety. Detainees in the Fulton County Jail lack basic necessities like working toilets and sinks and are exposed to flooding standing water, mold and what could only be described as filth. Pests carrying bacteria and disease not only run rampant in food preparation areas, but have infested the bodies of the people in the jail. YOUNG: And of course, officials are looking at this very closely. One of the cases that stood out was LaShawn Thompson. He died back in 2022 and when his body was found he was covered in lice. This is a case that got a lot of spotlight and triggered some of these investigations at that jail.
 
There have been times the AC has broken at that jail in the hot Atlanta heat and it made conditions for those who were living inside just unbearable. We know the county plans to spend $300 million to try to rectify the situation on the inside. It's something the DOJ and this community will be paying attention to.

You've seen it on viral videos. Smash and grabs, stores being targeted, vandalism, and it's happened at the restaurant. It's why Christy decided to support California's Proposition 36, the get-tough- on-crime measure passed in Blue, California, and will now increase penalties for repeated theft offenses and certain drug crimes.
 
VEGA: I voted for Kamala Harris. I voted for Adam Schiff. But I voted for yes on Prop 36 and on Nathan Hochman.
 
BERNAL (voice-over): She's referring to the newly elected Los Angeles District Attorney, a former Democrat turned Republican and now independent, who beat L.A.'s more liberal DA, George Gascon.
 
NATHAN HOCHMAN, DISTRIC ATTORNEY-ELECT, LOS ANGELES COUNTY: So many people would come up to me and they would just shake their head and say, what the heck is going on here in L.A. County? They were fed up with crime.
 
BERNAL (voice-over): In San Francisco, a Democrat also defeated its current mayor, seen as being ineffectual in fighting homelessness and crime.
 
And in Oakland, the mayor and the Alameda County District Attorney both recalled after similar criticism. A trend, USC professor Christian Grose says, is directly related to crime.
 
CHRISTIAN GROSE, USC PROFESSOR: The national views on crime are not that different than the state attitudes on crime.
 
BERNAL (voice-over): He says social issues still trend blue and voters here still prefer liberal candidates.
 
GROSE: But the crime issue is the one exception where the crime issue is really becoming more conservative in the state.
 
BERNAL (voice-over): It's about perception, he says, adding that while crime may not be at historic highs, that public perception is what motivated people to vote.
 
At Casa Vega, it was also crimes that were not prosecuted. But Christy says that the election results give her hope.
 
VEGA: I will definitely continue to be a Democrat, but I will not just be a tribal Democrat. And I think that that's where the country in general has lost its way.
 
BERNAL (voice-over): Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.

WALKER: Medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro have become known as so-called miracle drugs for people struggling with obesity.
 
BLACKWELL: Tonight, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes an inside look in this long investigation over a year into these revolutionary medications.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Over the years, the evidence has become increasingly clear on this. For so many people, obesity is not a choice.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We now know of over 1,000 genes that play a role in our body weight. It's sort of like a thermostat, OK, where for some people, a thermostat is set at whatever temperature it is in a house, whereas for other people, that thermostat is set slightly higher, slightly lower.
 
And so, if it's set higher and you end up having to eat more, you're going to be larger than someone else.
 <br>[07:00:03]
 
GUPTA (voice-over): It's why obesity is now considered a disease, not of the intestines or your stomach, but of the brain. It's a huge shift in the way that we think with huge implications for treatment. But these are still early days.
 
And remember, at one time, even depression and addiction were seen as failures of willpower instead of a brain disease. Changing the perception of obesity. That's going to take time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's definitely true that there are people out there who've said time and again, obesity is not really a disease. All you need to do is eat better and exercise more and you'll be okay.
