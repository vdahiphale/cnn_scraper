ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, all around the world and to everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead, President Joe Biden hosts NATO leaders at the White House as the chorus of Democrats and supporters calling for him to withdraw from the 2024 race gets louder.
 
Plus, a man suspected of killing three women with a crossbow has been captured in London. 
 
And the Euro 2024 final match is set after a dramatic goal by England in the 90th minute. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from Atlanta, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. U.S. President Joe Biden will face a major test today when he holds a press conference at the end of the NATO summit in Washington. NATO leaders and nervous Democrats have been watching his every move over the past few days. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden hosted allies for a lavish dinner at the White House where he toasted NATO's strength.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We're neighbors because we all share common beliefs in dignity, equality, democracy, freedom. And we're all neighbors because we're there for one another. The neighborhood I grew up in, that's what you do. When a neighbor needed help, you pitched in. When the bullies threatened the block, you stepped up. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: There haven't been any major gaps or missteps at the NATO summit, but sources tell CNN Democratic donors are holding back big checks over concerns about the president's viability.
 
Actor George Clooney, who helped raise nearly $30 million for Mr. Biden in Los Angeles last month, now says he should exit the race. Even some leading Democrats in Congress seem to think the president's decision to stay in the race could change. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER EMERITA: It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision. 
 
WILLIE GEIST, "MORNING JOE" CO-HOST: He has said he has made the decision. He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run? 
 
PELOSI: I want him to do whatever he decides to do. 
 
SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): I have complete confidence that Joe Biden will do the patriotic thing for the country. And he's going to make that decision. He's never disappointed me. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Peter Welch of Vermont is now the first Senate Democrat to call on Mr. Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. He joins nine Democratic members of the House. Welch says he has great respect for the president and understands why he wants to run. But he writes in a "Washington Post" op-ed, and I'm quoting here, "we cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night. I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw."  
 
But so far, despite the mounting pressure, there's no sign President Biden is willing to exit the race. CNN's Kayla Tausche has more now from Washington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With world leaders at hand, President Biden eager to get back to business as usual. 
 
BIDEN: Stronger supply chains, stronger economy, stronger military and a stronger nation. 
 
TAUSCHE (voice-over): And the White House wants to move on from speculation about the president's political future. But for Democrats, the domino effect continues. Actor George Clooney penning an op-ed in The "New York Times" calling on Biden to step aside, writing, It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe big f-ing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.
 <br>[03:05:10] Filmmaker Rob Reiner joining Clooney, writing on X, Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.
 
And House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi noncommittal. 
 
PELOSI: It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.
 
TAUSCHE (voice-over): And Colorado Senator Michael Bennett on CNN became the first Senate Democrat to break with Biden publicly. Bennett calling the state of the race very worrisome. 
 
SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide. And the White House in the time since that disastrous debate, I think has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election. 
 
TAUSCHE (voice-over): An adviser to the president said few in Biden's inner circle are concerned enough to pierce Biden's firm position. Only family could do that and only if there's hard data. The adviser telling CNN of his wife and sister, Jill and Valerie, won't let him go down in flames. 
 
Since the debate, CNN's poll of polls shows Trump leading Biden by five points. The first time this year, the candidates are separated by a margin of more than three points. And some donors planning events in Chicago and Florida say they're now up in the air. But for Biden, it's full steam ahead for now.
 
BIDEN: Every NATO member is committed to doing their part to keep the alliance strong. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: Larry Sabato is the director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. He's also the author of "Return to Normalcy: The 2020 Election That (Almost) Broke America." And he joins me now from Charlottesville. Always good to have you with us. 
 
LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR OF CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: Thank you, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: So we are seeing fresh doubts as pressure continues to build on President Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race. The highest-ranking Democrat and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the decision needs to be made soon because time's running out. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants a frank discussion with the president on his candidacy.
 
And now actor George Clooney wrote in a guest essay for The "New York Times" that, quote, "we are not going to win in November with this president." All this coming as more elected Democrats voice their concerns. So right now the president is standing firm. But is the dam about to break? SABATO: I don't think it will break because elected officials are
 
 deciding that Biden should move along because the way Biden looks at it, he's the head of the party. He's the highest elected official. And therefore he would have the final word there.
 
What's most significant about that list is George Clooney. It's the donors who appear to be moving in the other direction, particularly some big donors like Clooney. And reports are suggesting that the fundraising, both big and small donors, has fallen off a cliff since the debate. If anything ruins Biden's plans to continue running, it would be donors closing their wallets and pocketbooks. 
 
CHURCH: So the latest CNN poll of polls shows Joe Biden at 44 percent behind Donald Trump's 49 percent. Can the president win this election with numbers like this and what trends are you seeing in all the numbers that you're monitoring? 
 
SABATO: Well, the trends are not good for the Democrats, and they really need to focus on the fact that things aren't going well.
 
You know, I'm hearing a lot of happy talk from some of the Democratic leaders and also the Democratic groups that tend to lead delegates and donors. 
 
But their suggestions are not based in reality. Look, when the debate -- right before the debate was held, Biden was behind, but he was only behind a couple of points, though that would help. They have defeated him because of the Electoral College. Now he's behind four, five, six points, depending on the survey. That is absolutely devastating.
 
It would actually mean that Biden would lose every single one of the seven swing states and that Trump would end up with a very large majority in the Electoral College. That would be a disaster that would deprive the Democrats of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
 
That's what Democratic leaders are trying to get across to President Biden. But I don't think he's, at least to this point, receiving the message. 
 
CHURCH: That's why they're panicking right now. So President Biden, he faces a big test Thursday when he holds a news conference at the end of the NATO summit and takes questions from the media. The world will be watching everything he says and does. What needs to happen Thursday for him to convince the world that he is the right nominee to take on Trump? 
 <br>[03:10:09]
 
SABATO: I don't think a press conference can do it. I don't think an interview with a journalist can do it.
 
Yes, they're trying to take incremental steps that might make a difference. But even putting all of them together, it is almost impossible to wipe out the image of that debate from your mind, even if you're pro-Biden and you like him and respect what he's done. That's the fundamental problem. Biden did so poorly in the debate that it's become an indelible memory for most people. 
 
CHURCH: And it has to be said that these fresh doubts are not going away, are they? In fact, we're seeing them gain momentum. So what should President Biden do and when will it be too late to make a change at the top of the ticket if that is what ends up happening? 
 
SABATO: President Biden obviously should listen carefully. I'm sure he's listening. I think that also extends to his immediate family. They apparently strongly support Biden staying in.
 
And it's going to take a lot more donors and officeholders speaking out. They can't just tell people like me behind the scenes how strongly they feel about it. I'm interested to hear it, but we don't have any influence on the decision.
 
They have to tell the president and his family and key staff what they feel and why they feel it directly. 
 
CHURCH: And do you think it's wise for them to -- to change the top of the ticket? 
 
SABATO: I think we're moving in that direction. At first, I wondered whether it would really solve anything, but this has gone on so long and it's already eaten up a good deal of support that Biden had. And he couldn't afford to lose anybody. And yet he is. He continues to lose ground.
 
I don't agree with those who are saying it'll be a landslide for Trump. That's almost impossible to believe, given the opposition that we've had to Trump really since 2016. But it could be a decisive loss and things would have to change pretty dramatically and also quickly.
 
When does the grace period end? I think it's shortly after, maybe a week after the Republican convention. There is a grace period next week because the Republicans are meeting a convention and the spotlight will shift to Donald Trump. But that's only going to last as long as their convention. And then the spotlight comes right back to Joe Biden. And it is a harsh spotlight. 
 
CHURCH: Larry Sabato, I appreciate your analysis as always.
 
SABATO: Thank you. 
 
CHURCH: Donald Trump is facing a Monday deadline to announce his running mate when the Republican National Convention gets underway in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. CNN's Kristen Holmes has new reporting.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump has yet to make a decision on who his vice presidential pick will be, but he was weighing in on all three of the top contenders over the last two days, some with more negative input than others. Now, as we have reported, there are three people who have been circulating at the top of the list. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio. Now, he did weigh in on Burgum and not necessarily in the best light. Something we have heard from allies of Rubio as well as Vance is that Burgum went too far on the issue of abortion when he passed a near total abortion ban in the state of North Dakota.
 
People have warned Donald Trump that that could be bad for Trump because they think that it would bring the issue of abortion, something Donald Trump has tried to stay away from on the campaign trail, back into the spotlight. Donald Trump himself has said that privately, but now he was saying it publicly. Take a listen. 
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a little bit of an issue. It's a pretty strong ban. You know, I think Doug is great, but it is a strong he's taken a very strong stance or the state has. 
 
HOLMES: He also had a compliment for Senator J.D. Vance after reports he didn't like his facial hair, saying he actually liked it and it made him look like a young Abraham Lincoln.
 
And when it came to Marco Rubio, he acknowledged that it was complicated because they both lived in the same state, that the residency itself was a little bit difficult. But he said that it was easily fixed. We are still told by people close to Donald Trump that he has not yet made up his mind or if he has, he's not sharing it with anyone yet.
 
As we have said on Monday, that is the latest that he can decide. But one source told me it could come as late as Monday morning.

CHURCH: Nine tornado warnings were issued in western New York on Wednesday by the National Weather Service in Buffalo, the most ever issued there on a single day. At least two tornadoes were confirmed, part of the remnants of Hurricane Beryl. 
 <br>[03:15:01]
 
The twisters uprooted trees, damaged homes and took down power lines. Thousands of utility workers, rescue teams and other crews have been deployed to help with the damage. Flash flood warnings are still in effect from New York to Maine. Flood watchers will remain in effect across the northeast until Thursday afternoon. 
 
The National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for parts of southeast Texas, including the city of Houston. They warn the heat index could top 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Texas experienced Beryl as a category one hurricane, which knocked out electricity to millions of customers. More than 1.3 million of them are still without power days later. That's according to tracking website PowerOutage.us. That affects people. That affects pets. Houston's mayor says it's also affecting first responders. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN WHITMIRE, HOUSTON, TEXAS MAYOR: We have nine fire stations closed, had to relocate because when the power went out, they didn't have generators. Great cities do not operate like that. It's neglect. It's severe neglect. And we're going to fix it as we go forward.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has more on the heat affecting not just Texas, but other states across the country as well. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Another hot day in Houston in store for us. Yes, 105 could be the heat index in some spots around Houston later today.
 
Not so much maybe at the airports, but we'll have to see. Officially the number says 97, but some of the suburbs could be without a doubt 105 later on today and without electricity and without a fan. It feels significantly better in the northeast today, at least it will, as we cool things down probably 10 to 15 degrees with the cold front as it comes on by.
 
It felt like over 105 in D.C. yesterday and now we're only going to be around 92 for the actual air temperature and a lot less humidity as well as those storms went by. 
 
Back out to the west, we don't have to worry about the humidity, just the heat itself where Vegas was 118 today, likely 117. I don't think you can feel the difference.
 
Even for Phoenix, another day in a row above 110 in the afternoon. And the morning lows aren't cooling down either, so it's not like you can open up the doors and let in some cool air because it's well above what your air conditioner is probably set at. They're all across the desert.

CHURCH: Still to come, Gaza ceasefire talks wrap up in Qatar, and Israel's prime minister shares his position on the discussions as it stands now. The latest on the war in Gaza, that's next. 
 
Plus three British women killed in an attack that authorities say involved a crossbow. Now the suspect has been found in a quiet London, north London neighborhood.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Gaza ceasefire talks have wrapped up in Doha as the Israeli military expands its evacuation orders to the entire Gaza city. In Qatar, a diplomatic source says mediators from the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Egypt were cautious but hopeful when heading into talks, but it's not clear if any progress was made.
 
Israel's prime minister met with the top U.S. envoy for the Middle East in Jerusalem. Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized his commitment to a ceasefire deal as long as Israel's quote "red lines are preserved." 
 
This comes as the Israeli military ordered Palestinians to evacuate all of Gaza city, urging more than 250,000 people to head south since Sunday amid ongoing Israeli operations. Doctors Without Borders says its last health facility in northern Gaza is closing following the evacuation orders.
 
The IDF says it has opened a safe passage for civilians to reach humanitarian zones. Hamas says the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal to point zero. The Israeli army is defending its actions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (through translator): In the end, it reduces Hamas' capabilities, allows us to advance with the achievements, allows us to carry out a very important mission, pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: The Biden administration is set to resume shipping 500 pound bombs to Israel. The delivery was paused in May because the shipment contained both 500 and 2,000 pound bombs. U.S. officials were concerned the larger bombs might be used by Israel to attack Rafah, an area that was densely populated with civilians. While the U.S. is releasing the 500 pound bombs, the 2,000 pound bombs are still on hold.
 
Well the White House is explaining the decision to permanently remove the troubled floating pier off Gaza. It was being used to deliver life-saving humanitarian aid to the enclave, but had been plagued by rough seas, forcing it to shut down multiple times. The Pentagon says it will be removed as soon as next week, after the remaining aid has been unloaded. A top White House official told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the pier did not work as well as they had hoped. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: We said from the beginning that that wasn't exactly what this pier was designed to do over a long period of time, and that it would be a hard, complicated task. It proved to be that. It's also very susceptible to the weather.
 
We can get this ceasefire deal in place, and we've got negotiators in Cairo right now talking about this. It would give us six weeks of calm in phase one, which would allow for a much more freedom of movement of that humanitarian assistance inside Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: And CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following developments for us. She joins us now live from London. So Salma, ceasefire and hostage talks in Doha have ended. What more are you learning about what might have been achieved and what comes next? 
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and these ended just a few hours ago, Rosemary, so we're still waiting to find out more. But there had been a lot of hope and optimism around this new round of negotiations, and that's because there was a major stumbling block that had been unlocked by the United States. 
 <br>[03:25:06]
 
Hamas had insisted that any deal should include a permanent commitment to end the war from Israel. It was able to back down on that insistence. That opened up the room, allowed Prime Minister Netanyahu to give the green light for his negotiators, his spy chief, to head to Doha this week. Of course, they met with the Egyptian spy chief, as well as the head of the CIA from the United States. And it's all about drilling down the details of this potential six-week ceasefire. 
 
So take a step back, larger picture here. We have a deal on the table that was proposed by President Biden. It is three parts. We are currently discussing the first part of this potential deal, and that would include a six-week ceasefire that would see Israeli hostages, the most vulnerable among them, the elderly, exchanged for a certain number of Palestinian prisoners.
 
It could also see the six-week period of a ceasefire, Israeli troops withdraw from major population centers and allow some Gazans to return to their homes. These are the proposals that are on the table. But as you can imagine, working out the details of this is extremely complicated. Just to mention, in the past, hostage negotiations or Palestinian prisoner swaps have taken years to complete. 
 
Mediators are, of course, hoping to find a resolution in a matter of weeks. But it's all about the logistics here. Which Palestinian prisoners will be released? Which Israeli hostages will be released? Can we get an agreement upon the names? What will be the sequence and the logistics of how individuals will be released and exchanged across these territories? So a lot of details that need to be worked out yet. 
 
And meanwhile, on the ground, of course, you have a humanitarian situation that grows worse and worse by the hour. You mentioned those evacuation orders. They have been expanded to include all of Gaza City. You already have -- nearly every single Gazan has been displaced, ordered out of their home by the Israeli military sometime during this conflict, many of them more than once.
 
You have a massive death toll, according to Gaza's health ministry, 38,000 people, most of them children, have been among the victims of this conflict. Famine and starvation is spreading through the enclave. That's according to the United Nations. You mentioned the hospitals as well in Gaza, MSF saying they've had to
 
 close their last medical center in the north of Gaza. So all of these dire conditions on the ground worsening, Hamas saying that Israel's renewed offensive on Gaza City only threatens the peace talks, meaning more and more suffering on the ground, more and more desperation for a resolution. But still no clear answers, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: Salma Abdelaziz bringing us that live report from London. Many thanks.
 
British authorities have captured a man wanted in connection with the deaths of three women in an attack police believe involved a crossbow. Officials said suspect Kyle Clifford was found in north London Wednesday afternoon, less than a day after the wife and daughters of a BBC journalist were killed. 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson has the story now from London.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): It began Tuesday night. Emergency services called to the house of a BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, after women's screams were heard coming from the home. 
 
Medics found Hunt's wife, Carol, and his two daughters, Louise, aged 25, and Hannah, 28, seriously injured. They'd been brutally attacked. The medics were unable to save the women, and a massive 24-hour manhunt began in search of their killer. 
 
CCTV video captured near the family's house appeared to show a man leaving the vicinity carrying an object tucked under his arm, covered in a white cloth. Police believe he may have been carrying a crossbow. 
 
Police tracked the 26-year-old suspect to a north London cemetery, 45 minutes' drive away. Police say the suspect, Kyle Clifford, is a British military vet, and police believe he knew the victims. Police say when they captured Clifford, he was injured and taken away on a stretcher. 
 
ROBERTSON: This is where they brought him out of the cemetery on the stretcher into the street here, put him on an ambulance, took him to a nearby hospital, and for all the neighbors around here watching this, it was utterly shocking. 
 
YOLANDA NDUNGUNE, ENFIELD RESIDENT: In the morning I went to the work, it's a quiet place, I didn't see anyone. When I come back to the work, I saw the policemen. Every year in the bus stop I saw the policemen in the cars, and here I saw the policemen. I was asking, what happened? One people told me they looked at one man and killed the lady.
 <br>[03:30:00] 
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Other nearby residents described seeing ambulances, fire trucks, and heavily armed police around the cemetery where Clifford was captured. The police believe it was a targeted incident, but aren't specifying how he knew the Clifford family, although he appears close in ages to Hunt's daughters. 
 
The BBC called the murders utterly devastating in a statement released to staff.
 
Late into the evening, police investigators were still searching for evidence in the cemetery. However, they are not, at this time, searching for any other suspects.

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: George Clooney is weighing in on the mounting concerns over President Joe Biden and his re-election chances. What the actor is saying as we look at celebrity influence in politics. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Returning now to our top story. U.S. President Joe Biden is set to hold a news conference in the hours ahead as the NATO summit wraps up in Washington. On Wednesday, he hosted a dinner at the White House attended by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and other world leaders.
 
But the summit has been overshadowed by mounting questions and concerns over President Biden's re-election bid. Earlier in the day, he sat down for talks in the Oval Office with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. Mr. Biden called the U.S. and the U.K. the best of allies and said the two men had much to talk about, including soccer.
 <br>[03:35:06]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Start off, we can talk about what we call football, what we call soccer. By the way, you know, soccer has become incredibly popular here in the United States. It really is growing. And at any rate, there's a lot going on. I think you're seeking closer ties in Europe. It's good for all of us, the transatlantic alliance. I think it's a great idea that we're going to be working together on. I thought we had a good meeting today, NATO. 
 
KEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Very good.
 
BIDEN: I thought we had a good meeting. And I think things are moving in the right direction. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: On the sidelines of the NATO summit, Canada has announced an additional $367 million military aid package for Ukraine. A separate NATO declaration issued Wednesday says in part, we welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made on its required democratic, economic and security reforms. As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. Ukraine's president is thanking Denmark and the Netherlands for donating U.S. F-16 fighter jets to his military. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made the announcement. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: As we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is underway. Coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands. And those jets, those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir is following all the developments. She joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Nada. So how significant is this new NATO pledge of support for Ukraine? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that the plans have been in the works for some time now for Ukraine to be supplied with these F-16 jets for more military and defense support to be offered to Ukraine as the war continues to grind on.
 
But President Zelenskyy has been pushing for more concrete commitments from the NATO allies and that certainly was his intention as he went into the NATO summit earlier this week. Now, we have heard from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as you heard, they're making the announcement those F-16s are already said to be on the way from the Netherlands and Denmark with the support of the United States. What we've been seeing over the last few months is the training of Ukrainian pilots in order to be able to operate these jets.
 
They are said to have graduated earlier this year ready to fly those jets. And, of course, this announcement comes just a day after U.S. President Joe Biden announced further support for Ukraine in the form of air defense systems, that alongside other NATO allies pledging their support on that front. 
 
Again, another key area that President Zelenskyy has been pushing for for some time now. But also, of course, there has been a continued push for concrete commitments when it comes to Ukraine's future, a potential bid to join the NATO alliance. That is certainly something that has been a key objective for Ukraine from the outset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
 
You heard there another firm commitment from NATO allies saying that Ukraine's future is within the NATO alliance. That is irreversible. But important to know that, again, no clear timeline has been set out for when that might take place, when that process will get underway. And, of course, what we have been hearing from NATO allies is that Ukraine continues to need to fulfill those commitments, those prerequisites in order to be granted NATO membership.
 
That is, of course, still on the cards. They are still waiting for that process to really get underway. But as you heard there, they have acknowledged progress being made by Ukraine. So, clearly, that commitment remains firm from these NATO allies.
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Nada Bashir joining us live from London with that report. 
 
A growing number of Democratic lawmakers are voicing their concerns over President Joe Biden and his chances for re-election. But now some big names in Hollywood are also weighing in. CNN's Brian Todd has details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A stunning rebuke of the president from a star actor who raised $28 million at a fundraiser for Joe Biden less than a month ago.
 
George Clooney writing in a "New York Times" op-ed, quote, "we are not going to win in November with this president." 
 
Analysts say it's significantly damaging to Biden because Clooney is more than a celebrity endorser. 
 
LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, "PBS NEWSHOUR": He is someone who has spent time with President Joe Biden. George Clooney is someone who has long trafficked in Democratic circles. He's someone who consistently is a solid fundraiser for Democrats and contributes to Democratic campaigns. So, and he's known the world over.
 <br>[03:40:01]
 
TODD (voice-over): Filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner also called for Biden to step out of the race. Actor Michael Douglas said this about Biden on ABC's "The View." 
 
MICHAEL DOUGLAS, ACTOR: I'm deeply, deeply concerned. I mean, especially it's difficult because the Democrats have a big bench. 
 
TODD (voice-over): It's called into question whether some other major celebrities, people who can move votes like Taylor Swift, will be weighing in one way or another. Swift endorsed Joe Biden in 2020.
 
MARC MALKIN, SR. EDITOR, "VANITY": I would be surprised if she dipped her toe in to say that Joe Biden should leave the race. Whether or not she endorses Joe Biden right now, that's, of course, a huge question, especially after the debate. 
 
TODD (voice-over): Historically, it's Democrats who many of Hollywood's biggest players have gravitated to for decades with endorsements, money or simple cachet.
 
MALKIN: Go back to, obviously, JFK and Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe. You look at Obama. You know, he had Oprah Winfrey, Beyonce, Jay-Z. You had Bill Clinton, Barbra Streisand. I remember Melissa Etheridge was a big Bill Clinton supporter. TODD (voice-over): The Obamas were such magnets for celebrities that
 
 stars like Mariah Carey and Denzel Washington came to their inaugural balls.
 
Beyonce sang the national anthem at Barack Obama's second inauguration.
 
And videos were posted on social media showing the Obamas dancing at a Beyonce and Jay-Z concert in 2018. Sometimes the celebrity endorsement has lapsed into the downright bizarre, like when Mitt Romney supporter Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican convention spoke to a chair who he pretended was Barack Obama.
 
CLINT EASTWOOD, ACTOR: What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that. He can't do that to himself. 
 
TODD (voice-over): Republicans Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger came from Hollywood to win major office and were attractive to celebrity endorsers.
 
Donald Trump, despite his previous success on "The Apprentice," has received mostly support from non-A-list celebrities like Dennis Quaid, Roseanne Barr, and Scott Baio. 
 
MALKIN: With Donald Trump, there's only one celebrity that matters, and that's Donald Trump. 
 
TODD: Mark Malkin from "Variety" points out that sometimes celebrity involvement in politics can backfire for the celebrity. Robert De Niro, he says, has gotten some brushback for speaking out so forcefully against Donald Trump. And CNN reported that singer Mariah Carey, after she visited the Bidens at the White House last December, got some complaints on social media saying that she was turning a blind eye to the suffering in Gaza.

CHURCH: There's a growing movement around the world against over- tourism, as those who live in popular destinations push back against higher costs and lower quality of life. 
 
And later this hour, why Flavor Flav was hanging out with the U.S. Olympic water polo team. We'll explain.

CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, last weekend in Barcelona, protesters sprayed visitors with water and chanted, Tourists Go Home. It was part of a demonstration against tourism's impact on the cost of living and quality of life. These complaints are becoming more common in tourist hotspots around the world. 
 
CNN's Barbie Nadeau has the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): This summer is on track to break records when it comes to tourism. But increasingly, it's the locals who need the break. 
 
In Barcelona, spraying holiday makers with water to chase them away from cafes, posting fake warning signs on the beaches of Mallorca. Tired of being pushed out of city centers where rents have skyrocketed and prices have increased so much that residents no longer feel at home.
 
UNKNOWN: We come here to demonstrate against mass justification in Barcelona. Last year, the city has turned completely for tourists and what we want is a city for citizens and not in service for tourists.
 
NADEAU (voice-over): The sentiment is echoed in busy tourist havens like Venice, where authorities have taken drastic measures, charging an entrance fee to the city on busy weekends. 
 
NADEAU: Here in Rome, tourists are important to the city's economy, but the price is often high. Visitors have caused damage to these famous Spanish steps, gone swimming in the historic fountains, and even carved their names in the ancient Roman Colosseum.
 
NADEAU (voice-over): Over-tourism has spread to all corners of the world. In one Japanese city, locals have blocked the view to Mount Fuji to dissuade visitors. In Austria, blocking tourists from taking selfies. And in Amsterdam, cutting down on the city's famous river cruises to try to wrestle back control of the city. 
 
Many tourist cities clamping down on short-term rentals. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): Unfortunately, they live with this conflict. Those who live in the historic center complain because there is too much tourism. But if there is no tourism, there are no restaurants or hotels to offer work. Therefore, I believe they have to make peace.
 
NADEAU (voice-over): As important as tourism is to many local economies, striking a balance for those who call these popular places home and those who want to enjoy them is an even bigger priority.

CHURCH: Welcome back everyone. Well, it's taken about 58 years, but England's football team now has a chance to do what it hasn't done since 1966. Win a major title. On Wednesday, the Three Lions secured a spot in the Euro 2024 final after a victory over the Netherlands that went down to the wire. Patrick Snell has details.

PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: So, the final of the European Football Championship is now set. Spain will play England on Sunday in Berlin at the Olympiastadion as the two countries battle it out to be crowned kings of Europe. On Wednesday night in Dortmund, a dramatic meeting between Holland and the Three Lions.
 
The Dutch ahead after just seven minutes. It's a stunning strike there from Xavi Simons. A superb hit right into the back of the net. It flew past a shot. Jordan Pickford approaching the 20-minute mark. A moment of controversy as England's Harry Kane gets his shot away as Denzel Dumfries challenges for the ball in the box.
 
Penalty-given Kane takes it himself and knocks it in perfectly. He's now the all-time top scorer in knockout games in this competition with six. And then high drama as the English win it in stoppage time. Cole Palmer with the assistant. Ollie Watkins producing a superb finish right into the corner. It's a sensational strike. What a moment. What a way to win it.
 
Look at the joy there for the Aston Villa man. England and their delirious fans. England 2-1 winners and into the final.
 
So it's England who will face Spain then in Berlin on Sunday. La Roja seeking to be crowned kings of Europe for a fourth time. England their first Euros title beckoning.
 
They hope they've got to get past Spain first though. But for now, it's right back to you.

CHURCH: Thanks for that. Well, Colombia will fight for the title in the Copa America final after coming out on top in the semis against Uruguay. The Colombian team sealed the spot thanks to this header in the 39th minute which gave it a one-nil victory on Wednesday. Colombia will play Argentina for the trophy in Miami Gardens, Florida on Sunday.
 
But the semifinal game was testy with some players from Uruguay getting into a scuffle with fans after the game. The team's captain claims the players were defending their family members from Colombian fans. 
 
We are approaching the final countdown to the 2024 Paris Olympics with just over two weeks left to go before the start of the game's opening ceremony. And on Wednesday, Team USA revealed the leotards and apparel that gymnastics competitors will wear during the Paris Olympics. 
 <br>[03:54:57]
 
Women's leotards will be covered in thousands of Lumina Swarovski crystals. USA Gymnastics said the eight leotards will feature more than 47,000 crystals. It's the first time USA Gymnastics' Olympic apparel has been revealed before the games began. Very pretty. 
 
Well the U.S. national water polo teams have a surprising and surreal new cheerleader, rapper and reality TV star Flava Flav. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLAVA FLAV, RAPPER: USA! USA! I don't have a six pack, I got a one pack. I have one question for y'all. Are you ready? I should be asking myself that, right? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: USA Water Polo announced Flava Flav's role as official hype man for the 2024 men and women's Olympic teams. He's also making a financial contribution to the women's team. The organization's marketing director says she knows how unexpected the partnership is. But Flava Flav himself says he's a girl dad and a champion of all sports and is thrilled to bring his energy and excitement to a sport that doesn't get the attention it deserves.
 
And finally, two NASA astronauts who were spending extra time in the International Space Station appraising the spacecraft that took them there, Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, spoke from the ISS on Wednesday, more than a month after their arrival.
 
The trip was originally supposed to last for about a week, but their Boeing Starliner spacecraft is having technical issues, so their return flight is on hold until that is resolved. And so far, there is no timeline for their return.
 
I want to thank you so much for your company this hour. I'm Rosemary Church. Have yourselves a wonderful day. "CNN Newsroom" continues next with my friend and colleague, Max Foster.
