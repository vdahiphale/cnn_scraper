COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Good morning. Good afternoon. Good night, wherever you are in this wonderful world. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start 
 
 by taking a trip to Japan today, where there are plans to release treated, radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming days. 
 
You may remember 12 years ago, an undersea earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, triggering a tsunami with 30-foot waves with disastrous 
 
 consequences. The quake was so strong. It moved Japan`s main island by eight feet, more than 20,000 people died or went missing. The earthquake 
 
 and tsunami also cut power to The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant, nuclear reactors need water to stay cool and prevent meltdowns. But at the 
 
 Fukushima Daiichi Plant, those cooling systems started to fail, reactor course overheated and contaminated water inside the plant with highly 
 
 radioactive material. It was Japan`s worst ever nuclear disaster, and it took years for the government to lift evacuation orders near the site. 
 
Japan was also left with tons of radioactive waste water, which it has stored and treated over the past decade. Now, the country says it`s running 
 
 out of space for the material and it plans to start releasing treated, diluted wastewater into the Pacific ocean as early as Thursday. There are 
 
 third parties involved to monitor the release, including the International Atomic Energy Agency. That`s the United Nation`s nuclear watchdog, so to 
 
 speak. But many remain uneasy and fear the contamination has already led some shoppers in parts of Asia to stock up on items like salt and seafood. 
 
 Here`s CNN International Correspondent, Anna Coren for more.

ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A toxic blight on Japan`s coastline, rising like a monument to the memory of nuclear disaster and 
 
 bottling up its dangerous legacy. 
 
Just over 12 years ago, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Japan`s coast triggered a tsunami. Power was cut at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. 
 
 Its cooling systems stopped working and the plant went into meltdown. Water was pumped in to reduce the temperature of the reactor course becoming 
 
 radioactive. 1.3 million metric tons has been kept here ever since. It`s been treated to remove and dilute the most dangerous elements. On Thursday, 
 
 Japan will begin to release that water into the Pacific Ocean.
 
FUMIO KISHIDA, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN (through translator): The offshore discharge of ALPS-treated water is an issue that cannot be postponed in 
 
 order to advance the decommissioning of the plant and the reconstruction of Fukushima.
 
COREN: The International Atomic Energy Agency backs Japan`s plan to slowly feed the water into the sea, but not all the dangerous elements can be 
 
 removed. A level of the hydrogen isotope called radioactive tritium will remain in the water. Japan and the IAEA says it`s safe in small amounts.
 
RAFAEL GROSSI, INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY: Tritium is present there in a very, very low concentration. And it will be diluted even further to a 
 
 point that it will be negligible.
 
COREN: The concentration of tritium released is set to come under the World Health Organization`s regulatory limit, but such assurances have not been 
 
 enough to assuage the fears of many in Japan and around the region. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I don`t believe it at all. It`s very dangerous. It contains very radioactive substances. It would become a 
 
 serious problem once it`s released into the ocean. We won`t be able to eat fish anymore.
 
COREN: Protests have been a constant since Japan announced its plan to release the water two years ago. Many worry about the potential for 
 
 bioaccumulation of dangerous elements in the ecosystem. While neighboring countries like China have accused Japan of treating the ocean as a dumping 
 
 ground. But the disaster of 2011 left Japan with few options.
 
GROSSI: This would not happen in a normal operation of a nuclear reactor. Here you had all this accumulation and then you had to deal with it. You 
 
 had to take a decision.
 
COREN: Many difficult decisions will need to be made at Fukushima in the coming decades. Part of the reason to release the stored water is to free 
 
 up space to safely decommission the plant. The legacy of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster will be a lasting one.

WIRE: Ten second trivia.
 
With current technology, how long would it take for humans to make a roundtrip to Mars? 
 
Six months, one year, two to three years, at least 15 years?
 
According to NASA, a crude mission to Mars and back would take two to three years. If you are going to be floating in space for two to three years, 
 
 what one food would you want to eat? Have you ever heard of the deep space food challenge? It`s an international competition put on by NASA and the 
 
 Canadian Space Agency to find ways to create healthy tasty foods for astronauts on long missions, like roundtrip to Mars. CNN Space and Science 
 
 Writer Ashley Strickland takes us to a culinary lab in San Francisco for more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PHNAM BAGLEY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CREATIVE DIRECTOR, NONFICTION DESIGN: So, one thing to know about food in space is like your taste buds are not 
 
 functioning. The same way as they are when you`re on the surface. 
 
The food that we give astronauts is actually quite pungent -- 
 
ASHLEY STRICKLAND, CNN SPACE AND SCIENCE WRITER: Mm-hmm.
 
BAGLEY: -- for them to even feel anything. 
 
STRICKLAND: Right. 
 
BAGLEY: Yeah. So -- 
 
STRICKLAND: Good strong flavors, right? 
 
BAGLEY: It`s not going to be subtle.
 
STRICKLAND (voice-over): Keeping astronauts healthy on long missions in space presents many challenges and food is a big one. Phnam Bagley is the 
 
 Co-Founder of Nonfiction, a design firm that is one of several finalists in a NASA and Canadian Space Agency Competition called the Deep Space Food 
 
 Challenge.
 
BAGLEY: So going to Mars, and you take two and a half, three years roundtrip, and astronauts can only eat so many freeze-dried, rehydrated 
 
 food before they go crazy.
 
STRICKLAND: So what are some of these greens that we`re seeing here?
 
BAGLEY: Yes. So this is an aeroponic garden, so you can see some baby bok choy, you can see some like butter greens.
 
STRICKLAND (voice-over): Nonfiction calls this a Culinary Lab. It`s a working mockup of a modular unit that can fit into a spacecraft. It grows 
 
 food has a coffee maker and can even grill meat.
 
BAGLEY: As we all know open fires are frowned upon in space. 
 
STRICKLAND: Right, yeah.
 
BAGLEY: So, let`s avoid that, right? 
 
STRICKLAND: Right.
 
BAGLEY: So what we decide to do is to use basically microwave to heat up the meat and then to essentially draw the grill pattern on the protein 
 
 using laser. There we go. 
 
STRICKLAND: Oh, wow. 
 
BAGLEY: So this little real mark on top, kind of like depending on how wet the -- the top surface was. But makes this piece of chicken look a lot more 
 
 appetizing, right? Space barbecue.
 
STRICKLAND: Space barbecue.
 
(Voice-over): This part of the culinary lab is what Nonfiction calls munch, it`s a bioreactor that grows algae that can be harvested and eaten by the 
 
 astronauts.
 
BAGLEY: So what we do is that we extract these little discs of microalgae, and then eventually we get a lot of it. 
 
STRICKLAND: Mm-hmm.
 
BAGLEY: And then this smells terrible and it doesn`t taste great, but it`s very nutritious. So what we do is that to hide the flavor, we actually mix 
 
 it with a lot of different types of ingredients here. You are in a Silicon bag and then you mix it up. 
 
STRICKLAND: OK. 
 
BAGLEY: And then it ends up as balls like this. And you can keep these for, you know, two or three days, and they`ll still taste pretty fresh.
 
STRICKLAND: I feel like I`m going to have a special meal. I`m excited.
 
BAGLEY: There you go. Astronaut food. It`s the future.
 
STRICKLAND: Here`s the space food. 
 
BAGLEY: Still better, right? 
 
STRICKLAND: It tastes really good. You got the peanut butter.
 
BAGLEY: Mm-hmm.
 
STRICKLAND: And oats. It`s really nice texture. 
 
BAGLEY: Mm-hmm.
 
STRICKLAND: That`s delicious. 
 
BAGLEY: Great.
 
STRICKLAND: I could absolutely -- I could eat this all the time. 
 
BAGLEY: Mm-hmm.
 
STRICKLAND: That`s really good.
 
(Voice-over): It`s not just that Intrepid space fearing humans need food to stay alive. The preparation taste and appearance of food can have real 
 
 psychological benefits for astronauts.

WIRE: And for today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a fur baby that created quite the brouhaha. Meet Chicken Cutlet also known as Chickie. This golden 
 
 retriever, nearly nixed her owners nuptials a dream wedding in Italy when she chewed up a passport just before the trip. Fortunately, the groom to be 
 
 was able to get a last-minute appointment at a passport office with help from a Senator and a Congressman who heard about the couples predicament.
 
Winner of #yourwordwednesday is Mr. Jose Antonio from Spain for submitting brouhaha, a noun, meaning a loud, chaotic reaction to something. Well done.
