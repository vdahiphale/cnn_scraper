BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST:  OUTFRONT next: 
 
The final stretch. Vice President Kamala Harris teaming up with President Biden as she courts, a crucial voting bloc in two in swing states. 
 
Plus, the right to meddle. Trump now claiming he had, quote, every right to interfere in the last election.
 
And grounded. The U.S. seizing the presidential plane of another foreign leader. That plane now in Florida. Why? And could it lead to an escalation between the two countries? 
 
Let's go OUTFRONT. 
 
Good evening. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett.
 
OUTFRONT tonight, the home stretch, Vice President Kamala Harris on the road as the 2024 presidential campaign enters the final push. And just a short time ago, Harris and Joe Biden traveled to the president's home state to rally the Democratic base.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS:  Who you lift up. Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work? That's what we fight for.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This woman knows what she's doing. Folks, I promise you, if your elect Kamala Harris as president will be the best decision you will have ever made.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) KEILAR:  The Harris campaign knows how important Pennsylvania will be in the November election of all the swing states. It has the most electoral votes, 19, and Biden bested Trump there by less than 2 percent of the vote.
 
Before arriving in the Keystone State, Harris was in Detroit, Michigan, speaking to another group of union workers, and stressing that while she may have momentum, this race is still too close to call.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS:  So, let's not paid too much attention to the polls. Let's know like labor always does, we are out here running like we are the underdog in this race because we know what we are fighting for.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  As of tonight, there are only 64 days in this race, significantly less in some states were early voting begins in just two weeks. 
 
And the Harris campaign is not taking anything for granted. President Biden is about hold a string of events across a number of key states where he narrowly beat Trump in 2020. As for the former president, his next major rally is not until Saturday. 
 
Kayla Tausche is traveling with Vice President Harris. She's OUTFRONT live in Pittsburgh. 
 
Kayla, you just learned some new details about what went into this first joint campaign event. What are you hearing? 
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Brianna, that teams of Vice President Harris and President Biden have long worked hand in glove for events like these, but I'm told that they worked incredibly close in touch. Well, they tried to craft remarks that were both coordinated and complimentary. And while Vice President Harris has been embracing a message of moving forward and not going back, much of that rhetoric was absent from today's remarks as the two leaders really revisited their embrace of organized labor over the last four years. 
 
And in particular, Joe Biden's embrace of organized as labor over his decades-long political career, with Biden at times getting wistful about having this support of union leadership and members over the course of his long career. They acknowledged that this is not a done deal going forward and there's still quite a bit of work to do with Governor Josh Shapiro earlier at this event saying that people hear attending the event needed to talk to their colleagues, their cohorts, and their unions to try to get them to make sure that they vote for Vice President Harris and essentially acknowledging that many rank- and-file members are undecided or have expressed a desire to vote for former President Donald Trump. 
 
But even so, President Biden is expected acting this to be first of many of these types of events. Later this week, he's going to be in Michigan and Wisconsin in those so-called blue wall states, talking up the investments that his administration has made in those states, even though his approval rating remains in a low 40s, it is still -- he's still very popular among those white, older working class voters. And that's where he and the Harris campaigns still feel that he can lend some support.
 
As for Vice President Harris, we've now learned from three sources that she's expecting affected to deliver a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday, unveiling the next tranche of her economic proposals, which CNN has previously reported with center on innovation, entrepreneurship, and trying to foster the creation of more small businesses, Brianna.
 
KEILAR:  All right. Kayla Tausche, live for us from Pittsburgh, thank you for that report.
 
OUTFRONT now, Michael Hardaway, former longtime aide to President Obama and former communications director to Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. Also with us, we have "New York Times" podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton.
 
Lulu, to you first. Today, marking the first joint campaign event with Harris and Biden since he dropped out of the race and endorsed her. And it's in Pennsylvania. 
 
How crucial is Joe Biden to Harris is success there? 
 
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  I mean, I think it helps theirs this conversation that keeps happening, that somehow Biden is a drag on her. She is his vice president. She can't run away from that, so she might as well embrace it, where it matters and it matters in a place like Pennsylvania and it matters with older white voters who have been traditional supporters of Joe Biden in Pennsylvania. 
 
You know, he loves to call himself Scranton Joe. This is exactly where he should be right now, lending a hand and what you saw there was, you know, typical Joe Biden really speaking to what he has provided to unions, talking about his real connection with union workers, and, you know, she was the second act to that, but I think it was a useful performance by both of them.
 
KEILAR:  And, Michael, President Biden today vowing that this is just the start of his campaigning for Vice President Harris. Let's listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN:  We made a lot of progress. And Kamala and I are going to build on that progress and she's going to build on it. I'll be on the sidelines, but I'll do everything I can to help.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  So, now, he will head to Michigan. He'll go to Wisconsin this week as well. Does his assistance in these blue wall states outweigh any risks or
 
 limitations on her ability to sell a forward-looking message and plot her on course?
 
MICHAEL HARDAWAY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It does because people love Joe Biden. On a personal level, he's incredibly good at connecting with people, especially working class people of all races, and helping them understand that he understands what they're dealing with. And if you look at his record, it very much is one that is pro-union and pro working class, specifically with the Butch Lewis Act, which saved the pensions of over 100 million Americans -- I'm sorry, over 1 million Americans, 52,000 of those in Pennsylvania. 
 
And so, it matters that he's out there and it matters that he's fighting on her behalf because he does this incredibly good job of connecting with people in a real way. 
 
KEILAR:  Shermichael, what do you think?
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I mean, look, I don't know if it's necessarily a good thing. I mean, the president wasn't performing very well with the very constituents that he's expected to assist, the vice president with.
 
You're talking about unions, I understand once a stalwart of the Democratic Party are now, we're seeing a lot of working class people migrate over to the Republican Party. That is -- it's an interesting reshuffling if you will of voters where they once were to where there appear to be going today. 
 
But I think Pennsylvania, Brianna, is going to be an incredibly important state for Trump and Harris. I would argue is a must-win state. I think of Harris can win it. She ultimately gets to 270. I think if Trump wins it, he ultimately gets to 270. 
 
It's the reason why you're seeing both candidates spend a lot of time there. They have surrogates there. Look at the massive amount of money and media buys they're spending and also Brianna, look at where they're putting their boots on the ground in Pennsylvania. What counties, who are they trying to target? Who are they trying to penetrate? 
 
One, do you want to overly excite your base? But for that small percent of people who may still be on offense there, you want to make that compelling argument now until November, of why you are better than your opponent. And so, I expect to see a whole lot more come the next couple of weeks in Pennsylvania by both camps.
 
KEILAR:  Shermichael, I wonder though. We see on the schedule, President Trump, he's holding a rally Saturday in Wisconsin. He's not out there on Labor Day, even as he's trying to court union workers. Is that a mistake?
 
SINGLETON:  So, from my understanding, the former president is getting ready for the upcoming debate. After the debate, his campaign trail is supposed to kick back up in terms of the number of places he's expected to visit along with J.D. Vance. You're also going to see more of J.D. Vance crisscrossing the country as well, hitting some of those crucial battleground states. 
 
And I think this is important, Brianna. Oftentimes, we hear from the Trump campaign, he doesn't prepare, he doesn't prepare. Well, I think the former president is taking this debate very serious with Vice President Harris. 
 
This is not going to be Joe Biden. She's going to be able to articulate her message on the issues. We may differ, but this is going to be a much more competitive race in a competitive debate. 
 <br>[19:10:00]
 
And so, he needs to spend that time being able to surgically argue why he's going to be the better alternative on the most consequential issues for the American people.
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  They both --  
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR:  -- think best take this very seriously, this upcoming debate -- Lulu.
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Yeah, one of the things that I thought was really interesting just watching her is that she was much more in this particular speech that she just gave forceful than I've seen her before. The joy seems to be, you know, kind of being ratcheted down and the fight seems to be ratcheting up because this really is now the crucial moment where are you are actually battling vote by vote as for Michael says, for these very tight margins in these very swingy, swingy districts. 
 
And so just the tone there struck me as different than the one that I've seen from her before. 
 
KEILAR:  Let's listen to a little bit of that. Here's more of Harris at her rally.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS:  As we fight to move forward, Donald Trump is trying to pull us backward. America has tried those failed policies before and we are not going back.
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS:  We're not going back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  So, Michael, I wonder about what you saw today, but also we should note the latest ABC poll found no real bounce for Harris after the DNC. Do you think that's a sign that enthusiasm and momentum may have maxed
 
 out on energizing Democrats, on energizing the base? And now, she's really got that hard sell for swing voters?
 
HARDAWAY:  You know, I think the good news for her is she's still doing incredibly well and all the swing states that matter in the Midwest. She's neck and neck with Trump in Pennsylvania. She's playing well in Arizona and in Georgia and even north Carolina. 
 
And so overall, she is doing incredibly well, but she has to be out there in these battleground states every there's single week, along with the president, and making her case, specifically in Pennsylvania because that for her is a must-win state. And I think she wins because she has a real record in terms of what this administration has done for working people in Pennsylvania and across the country. But she has a cell that record.
 
KEILAR:  Lulu, I want to listen to a Tim Walz moment on the trail. 
 
Labor Day, of course, its the home stretch for the baseball season. Were on the cusp for the NFL season two, and he gave a nod to both sports today when he was in Wisconsin.
 
Let's listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We respect differences. That's your opinion. Look, we're setting here together, Brewers and Twins fans, Vikings and Packers. 
 
Look, we respect it, but on things like health care and what books I read and democracy, we all oh, live by that very simple golden rule. Mind your own damn business.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  I'm curious, Lulu, how you think Walz compares as a kind of jovial Midwestern messenger straightforward when stacked up against J.D. Vance, who do you think is more relatable? 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  I mean, I think the polling shows that Walz is much more likable and relatable he has the dad vibes, right? And he gets the sports metaphors. You trust about whenever he can and this is the currency, the political currency that he brings to the ticket. 
 
I mean, J.D. Vance has been out there. He has been I think a very loyal attack dog for Trump. I don't know how effective he's been because what we've seen is the more that he engages, the less people seem to like him. And so again it is troubling for the Trump campaign that they do not have a Walz on their side. People are not connecting with J.D. Vance in the same way that they do with Walz.
 
KEILAR:  Shermichael, what do you think?
 
SINGLETON:  Well, look, I think J.D. Vance has showcased a real discipline as it pertains to sticking with the economy and immigration and making that case from the interviews I've seen. I certainly understand why Democrats will say some of the comments that he's made it in the past that have resurfaced are colorful, to say the least. I don't think there are many Republicans who are too happy about it. 
 
But I want to just quickly tap on the question you asked Michael about the momentum with Vice President Harris. If you remember a couple of weeks ago, the top pollster for the Trump campaign released an internal memo that stated expect to see the vice president continue to have this incredible rise for maybe the next 28, 30 days, at least until Labor Day. 
 
And sure enough, here we are right at Labor Day, we're sort of seeing the numbers flattened out, which is what I think a lot of Democrats and even Republican strategist have argued this thing is going to get incredibly close as we get closer to early voting as we get closer to November. 
 
So again, Brianna, I know a lot of people ask for who in the heck is left out there to decide this election? You do have those low propensity voters who may be registered, but they don't always engage. You're going to see both camps trying to target those voters with a message of something to try to get them the turnout. And I think that's the most fascinating to point of this race. 
 <br>[19:15:02]
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO:  And new voters -- I mean, new voters, there are people who are registering, who have been, who have come in. And I think that is also going to be one of the crucial elements here. 
 
KEILAR:  Lulu, Michael, Shermichael, thank you so much to all of you. Really appreciate it.
 
And OUTFRONT next, I'm going to speak to Pittsburgh's mayor. He was with Vice President Harris and President Biden tonight. What was his message to Harris as they're entering the final stretch here?
 
Plus, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defiant tonight, signaling he won't cave on a key issue that could lead to a deal with Hamas to free the hostages still in Gaza. The father of an American hostage still being held is OUTFRONT.
 
And, exclusive, never never-before-seen video that takes us inside Ukraine's daring mission to penetrate Russia's border.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:20:11]
 
KEILAR:  New tonight, President Biden in his first joint rally with Vice President Harris touting his economic record over his four years in office. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN:  Five years ago, I began my campaign for president right here in Pittsburgh. I said one of the reasons I was running was to rebuild the backbone and spine of America.
 
Well, five years later, we've done just that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  Biden also mocking his critics who warned that his presidency would result in economic collapse.
 
OUTFRONT now is Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey. He was with Harris and Biden just a short while ago at the rally in Pittsburgh. 
 
And, Mayor, it's, of course, widely believed that Pennsylvania is the key that unlocked this election. Polls are incredibly tight there. Harris and Biden there today, Trump and Vance campaigning there last week, what is your sense of where the race stands in your state right now? 
 
MAYOR ED GAINEY (D), PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA:  You know what, I just want to say, first and foremost, thank you for having me. 
 
We know where a battleground state and we know that in the city, we always have to prove that in order for us to make sure that candidates win and definitely, we have vice President Harris, that we have to come out and vote. So it just shows the importance of the city of Pittsburgh. I'm looking forward to make sure that we get the vote out. 
 
KEILAR:  And I know that you got to spend some time, obviously with Biden and Harris earlier I mentioned that. What was your message to them? What did you say to them about what you're hearing from people and where you think the race stands in Pennsylvania?
 
GAINEY:  Yeah. Well, one, I thought it was amazing to have the president and the vice president both at the Labor Day parade. Though they didn't march in a parade, for them to have an event to talk about, you know, being on stage together to talk about the agenda, to talk about why it's important for us to get the vote out for Vice President Harris, it just shows -- you -- it was so electrifying and just show how important this race is, and it also demonstrates how important the city is. 
 
And whenever we can highlight our city in a way that continues to demonstrate that we are the backbone of the union, that we're a union city, we've been a union and only built a common way, but help build this nation, them coming together, standing on stage together that picture of unity demonstrates what this race is all about.
 
KEILAR: And since Biden dropped out of the race, Pennsylvania voters have been sharing their opinions of Harris with CNN. 
 
These are Democrats. They're independents, they're also disaffected Republicans. And I want to play what some of them have said. Here it is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She has been villainized really well. She hasn't done enough publicly to work against some of those negative narratives.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I still don't feel like she's ready. I don't want to per se vote for someone that is a backup.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If I'm not over my grave concerns about Harris, I'll do a write in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  All right, Mayor, I think you could look at that and say that is some constructive criticism that the Harris campaign is listening to their right -- right there. 
 
What is the key to making people who would have voted for Biden, Biden voters in transforming them into Harris voters, in your opinion?
 
GAINEY:  You know, the one thing I've always tell people is that it is great that when you're a student, you can sit back and learn just how to be a leader. And I think through her public service to our public life, the one thing that Vice President Harris has done is demonstrating two over and over and over her ability to lead. 
 
And I think that's what people got to focus on and be able to be vice president, see what's going on. You're not coming in brand new. You're coming as someone who has been the vice president that understands from a national, international perspective exactly was going on in the world. There could be not -- no one right now more prepared to be president than Vice President Harris. 
 
And that's why I think you see the electricity. The polls don't lie. Since she got in this race, we see that she is now taking a lead in many polls, but that the voters are excited about her. Her -- today, it was electric. You should have been in the room. You could feel the energy, the momentum.
 
That's when you really get a good sense of what a leader was going to demonstrate to the rest of the city in the rest of the United States that she's prepared to lead. And I'm behind her 100 percent.
 
KEILAR:  Mayor, thank you so much. It was obviously a big day in your city and we appreciate your time tonight. 
 
GAINEY:  Absolutely. I thank you for having me. Have a great evening. 
 
KEILAR:  Yeah. Thank you. You, too. 
 
OUTFRONT next, President Biden, taking on Benjamin Netanyahu, and accusing the Israeli prime minister of not doing enough to free hostages in Gaza. The father of an American that is still being held there is next.
 
Plus, the U.S. seizing a plane considered to be another country's Air Force One. Could this lead to a serious confrontation?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:29:19]
 
KEILAR:  Breaking news, protesters gathering and tonight outside the residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The large group lighting fires, chanting quote, "you are guilty". This after the bodies of six hostages were recovered from Gaza.
 
And as a source warned CNN that Netanyahu may have, quote, torpedoed everything with his address to the nation this evening.
 
I spoke earlier today with a cousin of Carmel Gat, got one of the hostages found dead, who was expected to be released in the first phase of a potential ceasefire agreement. 
 
And he had this emotional message for Netanyahu.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIL DICKMANN, COUSIN CARMEL GAT AMONG SIX HOSTAGES KILLED BY HAMAS: This is exactly the opposite of what we want. 
 <br>[19:30:00]
 
Exactly the opposite of what Carmel would've wished for and exactly the opposite of what the hostages that are still held in captivity deserve. 
 
He is going to use the murder of my cousin in order to keep the war going. And this is exactly I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm furious. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KELAR:  Nic Robertson is OUTFRONT tonight.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  In the face of growing demands to get all the hostages home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubling down on his defiance. 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER:  We're asked to make concessions? What message does this send Hamas? It says killed more hostages, murdered more hostages. You'll get more concessions?
 
ROBERTSON:  Explaining he won't remove Israeli troops from the Gaza- Egypt border. A compromise Hamas demands.
 
His only concession, rare contrition for the six hostage families. 
 
NETANYAHU:  I told the families and I repeat and say this evening, I'm asking for your forgiveness that we didn't manage to bring them back alive. ROBERTSON:  Pressure for him to back down rocketed Sunday, hundreds of
 
 thousands of Israelis took to the streets, demanding he made the deal save the other hostages. 
 
That energy and anger still alive on Monday, although the tempo and numbers down, their demands not changing. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm here because I feel the government has neglected the hostages. They don't care about the hostages.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We want this government to cease to exist. We want letters. First and foremost, we want them to sign an agreement to release their hostages.
 
ROBERTSON:  The whole nation watching what's at stake. 
 
Hersh Goldberg-Polin's poignant funeral testament to that.
 
RACHEL GOLDBERG-POLIN, HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN'S MOTHER:  I beg your forgiveness. We tried so very hard some deeply in desperate. I'm sorry.
 
ROBERTSON:  Not the cathartic homecoming. His family believed to be in reach. 
 
GOLDBERG-POLIN:  We became absolutely certain that you were coming home to us alive, but it was not to be.
 
ROBERTSON:  An American, but a son of Israel, his family's pain for nations, too. Goodbyes, the country craves. 
 
And here --  
 
GOLDBERG-POLIN:  Okay, so before you go now in your journey, I hope it's as good as the trips you've dreamed about because finally, my sweet boy, finally, finally, finally, you're free. I will love you and I will miss you every single day for the rest of my life.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROBERTSON:  And we've learned this evening, this may not actually be the end of it. Hamas is now threatening if Israeli troops come to rescue hostages as they've tried and succeeded, they'll shoot the hostages. This isn't over yet -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  Certainly isn't. Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv, thank you.
 
OUTFRONT now, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of Israeli American hostage, Sagui Dekel-Chen.
 
Sagui is a husband and father to three young daughters, including a baby girl who was born after Sagui was taken by Hamas. 
 
Jonathan, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
Can you tell us about your reaction to this news of these hostages found dead as you you've been waiting now months to hear anything about your own sons location or condition?
 
JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMS: Well, my reaction like all Israelis was absolute horror and sympathy for the families of most of whom I've actually come to know over these currently 11 months, and double horror because we know for sure that none of these six beautiful young people needed to die had Israel move forward in good faith before and Hamas been pressured enough, this deal could have been signed a month-and-a-half, two months ago. And in all likelihood, most if not all of these young people who were brutally murdered by Hamas, would be alive today.
 
KEILAR:  Tonight, you heard Netanyahu. He said that he asked forgiveness from the families of the hostages, but then he doubled down on why he will not agree to a Hamas demand that is holding up a hostage deal which is securing that Philadelphi corridor along the southern side, the Egyptian-Gaza border. President Biden has told reporters he doesn't think Netanyahu is doing enough. 
 
What do you think?
 
DEKEL-CHEN:  Well, I think I know that all of his senior military and intelligence officials have said out loud, publicly repeatedly in recent weeks and months that there is no reason, no strategic or tactical reason, including the Philadelphi corridor for Israel to continue due to delay signing this or moving forward quickly towards signing of this agreement for a ceasefire and hostage release with Hamas. 
 <br>[19:35:25]
 
So the prime minister his justifications that we heard again tonight are based on issues that have nothing to do with our national security, but it would seem have far more to do with his own political interests and not rocking the boat within his own far-right coalition, full of messianic nationalists that care nothing for our hostages beyond lip service. 
 
And so, there's no doubt in their hundreds of thousands of Israelis out in the street, I think someone made the computation that it would be tantamount up to 35 million Americans protesting at one time. I mean, think about that. The Israeli street has spoken about this. It is time for our government to stop delaying and time for the international community to do everything it must have pressure Hamas to get to yes.
 
KEILAR:  I think that's the hope of so many of these families. During her eulogy, the mother of American Israeli hostage Hersh Goldberg- Polin, whose body was one of those recovered this week and she said that she hoped his killing would be a quote, turning point. 
 
You are in Israel where we've been watching these protests that you mentioned. Do you have hope that this is going to be enough? I mean, you put it into perspective for just how big this would be population- wise. But do you think this is actually something that gets through to Netanyahu? DEKEL-CHEN:  It's very hard to know look, we can do what we can do
 
 here in Israel. It's see me, it seems to be clear that the Biden administration will in the same way that Netanyahu is doubling down on this fantastical narrative that he has about security in Philadelphia which by the way, he didn't even mentioned for the first eight months of this war.
 
We will need help. Need help in getting the Netanyahu government to yes. I want to believe that a combination of this massive pressure within Israel and Israel's friends, Israel's friends, making it clear the Israeli government that there are no more excuses for these essentially political delays. And  Netanyahu I don't know if he has the moral backbone to stand up to his radical right messianic sell it coalition partners. 
 
But he must find it. Israel is lost. Otherwise, this is really about the heart and soul of our own country, the lives of the hostages, and stopping the madness in Gaza.
 
KEILAR:  Jonathan, you met with White House officials last night, many of the families who have been in regular touch with them. How much faith do you have in the Biden administration right now to actually influence Netanyahu? 
 
DEKEL-CHEN:  Well, as little faith, I think that, you know, most Israelis and certainly myself included have in my own government. I have absolute faith in the Biden administration, just the proven time and again, since October that they understand the gravity and the urgency of the situation right here, right now. But every day that passes, more and more hostages who have survived somehow for the last 10 or 11 months living hell in Hamas captivity are at risk. 
 
And so I believe that the Biden administration will put maximum pressure on both Israel and Hamas through the intermediaries, of course, to get both parties to yes. But at the end of the day, there are two men that have to sign on a document, one is Yahya Sinwar, a mass murder who's somewhere underground, one would think, in Gaza. And the other is Benjamin Netanyahu who seems to be more interested in the preservation of his own political power than the cohesion and the best interests of our country. 
 
KEILAR:  Jonathan Dekel-Chen, thank you for being with us. We are thinking of your family and your son, and we appreciate your time tonight.
 
DEKEL-CHEN:  Thank you for having me.
 
KEILAR: OUTFRONT next, a bold move by the U.S., tonight, seizing a plane that is considered another country's Air Force One. What happens now? 
 
Plus, a new and dangerous escalation as Russia makes it easier for Putin to use nuclear weapons against the West.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:44:19]
 
KEILAR:  Tonight, first on CNN, the U.S. seizing the airplane of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Federal officials boarded and took the jet while it was parked in the Dominican Republic. CNN cameras exclusively capturing the planes arrival in Florida. And it's been described as Venezuela's equivalent to Air Force One.
 
Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT.
 
And, Oren, what more can you tell us about this seizure? 
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  This jet was in the Dominican Republic for what effectively was routine maintenance according to local officials there. When the U.S. had the opportunity to seize it and pounced on that opportunity, the FBI flying the plane from the Dominican Republic to Florida and there you can see it on the ground in Fort Lauderdale.

It's not quite the 747 jumbo jet the U.S. uses as Air Force One, but it is effectively Venezuela's air force one used by President Nicolas Maduro to fly around for his own meetings. Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying that it was purchased in violation of U.S. sanctions by a shell company for some $13 million. It was illegally flown out of the United States back in August of 2023, and then it was used by Maduro. And according to Merrick Garland in a statement after the seizure also by his, quote, cronies then flown around. It was seen not only on flight-tracking sites, but I believe also seen in pictures there. And it was seized because it was purchased in violation of those sanctions. 
 
Obviously, the U.S. and Venezuela have a frosty, if not outright, a hostile relationship between the two of them. And that has only gotten worse since the presidential election of July, one that the U.S. did not recognize as free, fair, and legitimate because of that election, the U.S. reimposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil and gas industries, the U.S. and a number of other countries not recognizing those as free and fair elections. 
 
So where does this go from here? Well, now, the U.S. has to pursue forfeiture, which means Maduro's regime has a chance to essentially appeal this and put in their argument as to why the jet should be returned to them. The U.S. has also made clear that they will try to collect whatever intelligence they can from Venezuela's air force one -- Brianna.
 
KEILAR:  Very interesting story. 
 
Oren Liebermann, thank you for that.
 
And also tonight, nuclear threat. Russia making it easier for Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons due to quote, Western actions related to the war in Ukraine, a top Russian official telling that to state media. This as Ukraine's President Zelenskyy acknowledges a, quote, most difficult situation in the eastern part of the country where Russian troops continue seizing territory amid Ukraine's ongoing incursion into Russia.
 
Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Monday morning, right before dawn, a massive barrage of Russian missiles targeting Ukraine's capital. Air defenses able to shoot down most of the incoming rockets but some clearly impacting inside the city. Russia attacking Ukraine's largest cities just as millions of children were set to go back to school for the first day of the new term.
 
UNIDENTIFIED GIRL (through translator):  Tonight, the explosions were very scary. I quickly run to the bathroom, I could even feel the breeze from the impact of the explosion.
 
PLEITGEN:  Ukraine continuing its own incursion into Russian territory in an effort to force Vladimir Putin's army to move units away from other frontlines. 
 
And now for the first time, CNN has obtained exclusive video showing how the Ukrainians first penetrated Russia's border. Elite mine- clearing teams secretly infiltrated and blew up minefields in the heavily fortified border area, clearing a path for the troops to get through.
 
But Ukraine remains both outmanned and outgunned in most areas, increasingly relying on drones to level the battlefield.
 
We visited the FRDM drone firm as they tested their new octo-copter attack drone, already carrying mock bombs, dropping them accurately from heights around 250 feet aboveground.
 
Realizing the enemy's advantage in terms of numbers of people, we cannot risk people. He says, so we are working harder to have even better drones.
 
The drones, a major factor on the battlefields where Ukrainian forces are currently trying to stop sustained Russian advances in the east of the country.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin saying, Ukraine's incursion into western Russia will not stop his armies from pushing forward elsewhere. 
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The calculation was to stop our offensive actions in key parts of the Donbas. The result is known, yes, of course, our people are going through a tough time, especially in the Kursk regions.
 
PLEITGEN:  But the drone teams say they are not done yet working on ever more sophisticated unmanned aircraft to hit the Russian invasion force. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) KEILAR:  Fred Pleitgen is joining us now from Kyiv. 
 
And, Fred, Putin just said, in your report that his offensive in the east is not slowing down. What are the Ukrainian say?
 
PLEITGEN:  You know, Brianna, the Ukrainians have acknowledged that one of the reasons why they sent their forces on that incursion into Russian territory was to try and make the Russians redeploy their troops from some of the front lines where they're putting the Ukrainians under pressure. 
 
And Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of this country, he came out today and said, yes, the Pokrovsk front is one of those places does where they want to try to get the Russians to redeploy forces away from there and possibly towards the Kursk region.
 <br>[19:50:00]
 
Now, Zelenskyy said today that he believes that that is something that's still could happen. But at the same time, he also acknowledged that right now for the Ukrainians, the most difficult front lines are in Toretsk, which is the area around Bakhmut, and, of course, Pokrovsk as well -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  All right. Fred Pleitgen, thank you so much for that report.
 
OUTFRONT next, former President Trump now suggesting he had every right to meddle in the 2020 election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with the presidential election, where you have every right to do it?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:55:15]
 
KEILAR:  Tonight, Donald Trump is claiming he had, quote, every right to interfere in the 2020 election. That bold admission coming even as he faces an updated indictment in the January 6 case. Here's what he told Fox.
 
[BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  It's so crazy that my poll numbers go up. Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election where you have every right to do it, you get indicted and you poll numbers go up?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR:  OUTFRONT now, Sergeant Aquilino Gonell, one of the Capitol police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol and was injured on January 6. He is also the author of the book, "American Shield".
 
Officer, thank you for being with us tonight. 
 
I do want to start with those comments that you just heard from Trump. What do you think about what he said that he has every right to interfere, had every right to interfere in the election?
 
SGT. AQUILINO GONELL (RET.), FORMER CAPITOL POLICE SERGEANT INJURED IN JANUARY 6 ATTACK:  I saw a confession. That's what it is. I mean, he thinks he's entitled to do what he did, overthrow the will of the people and that's very unfortunate. I hope Jack Smith is listening. 
 
KEILAR:  There's a critical hearing speaking of just days from now in Trump's January 6 case in the federal case, and the indictment has been reworked by Smith to reflect some of the limitations of that Supreme Court immunity decision. 
 
Do you think that Trump will ultimately be held accountable for election interference?
 
GONELL:  That is my hope. I mean, you know, if it wasn't because of what he did on joining six with his actions or inaction, when the mob was attacking us, the Capitol police and the Capitol on his behalf, I wouldn't have lost my career. 
 
And, you know, I hope that he -- after going through the judicial process, if found guilty, then he should be accountable.
 
KEILAR:  The right to a speedy trial is a right of the defendant? It's obviously not one that happens in the interest of the public, for instance. So this is a right that favors Trump. 
 
But the fact that you likely will not see that move forward and have an answer for his actions, leading up to an on January 6, what does that mean to you? Before the election, I mean. 
 
GONELL:  I mean, I'm still hopeful that will happen. I mean, the disappointing thing has been taking almost four years, so three years and a half for this indictment to come through. I think that if it wasn't because of the expectation that he will be daddy. I don't think he'll be running for president. And that's the only reason why he, he became a candidate to stay out of jail. 
 
In my opinion, I think that he should have been expedited a long time ago to the system.
 
KEILAR:  Do you think people have forgotten about what happened on January 6 and the lead up to it? Do you think is factoring into their decision is they consider how they're going to vote?
 
GONELL:  I hope not. Look, again, if this attack on the Capitol was -- would have been done by any other group, I'm sure the Republican 220 electoral officials from the Republican side that would have been calling for a speedy trial for accountability, for honoring the officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, instead of not putting not even the plaque on the tunnel of the capitol, a law that two years ago, it was passed. And yet, Mike Johnson still refused to, even entertain the idea the U.S. putting those names on the wall. 
 
So the future president, before they get sworn in they get to see where officers like myself, race, or to defend the Capitol.
 
KEILAR:  I want to ask you about a fundraiser for January 6 rioters. It was scheduled to be held at Trumps Bedminster golf club. It's postponed until after the election. It was billed as the J6 Awards Gala. 
 
Trump was invited to speak. Last we heard he was not, but this is his golf club hosting these folks. 
 
How do you feel about that? And if he does ultimately attend after the election and what does it say to you?
 
GONELL:  He says, I mean, it's clearly that he had -- him and his allies had chosen to side with the insurrectionists instead of the officers like myself, Again, we risked our lives are many other officers like myself had to leave the job. The department because of the injuries and the mental health -- mental health trauma that we sustain. 
 
If you look at it, they had condone the attack rather than denouncing and -- so I think its very unfortunate and they should all -- they should side with the police officers not with me. I do have a GoFundMe as well. And those are the things that instead of supporting the police officer, he's now supporting -- he's supporting the writers themselves. 
 
KEILAR:  Sergeant Gonell, we appreciate your time. Thank you so much. 
 
And an exclusive interview to tell you about before we go, an OUTFRONT tomorrow, Erin sitting down with Stormy Daniels. Do not miss that tomorrow night at 7:00.
 
And thank you so much for joining us.
