JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: You're watching CNN Newsroom. Coming up this hour. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I have avoided a bloodshed in Venezuela. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: But not so fast our president elect, the day after Nicolas Maduro wins a rigged election, anti-government protesters -- protests rough around the country.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Our response will come and it will be harsh.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: The Goldilocks dilemma for Israel how to respond to a weakened rocket attack strong enough with deterrence without sparking an all- out war with the militant group Hezbollah.

VAUSE: Take your daughter to work day North Korea style, how Kim Jong Un plans to hand over the family business to a fourth generation. NIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from Atlanta. This is CNN Newsroom with John Vause.
 
VAUSE: We begin in the Middle East where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to weigh his options on how best to respond to a deadly rocket attack, which killed a dozen children over the weekend. Israel has blamed the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the strike on the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. 
 
Netanyahu visited the site of the attack Monday and warned Hezbollah to expect a severe response. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NETANYAHU (through translator): Hezbollah backed by Iran fired an Iranian missile that took the lives of 12 pure souls. 12 children that were playing soccer here and unfortunately couldn't make it to the bomb shelter. Our heart is torn by the heavy disaster. 
 
We embrace the families that are going through an indescribable suffering. These are our children, the children of all of us, and the State of Israel will not and cannot ignore this. Our response will come and it will be harsh.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: During a phone call with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Monday, the Israeli Defense Minister insisted Hezbollah will be held responsible for Saturday's attack. Even though the militant group has denied responsibility, and Iran's recently elected president has warned of severe consequences for Israel if it carries out a major strike on the Lebanon based group Hezbollah.
 
Secretary Antony Blinken has urged the Israeli President to find a diplomatic solution to prevent any further escalation in the conflict. More now from CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman reporting in from Beirut.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As Lebanon awaits Israel's next move hope lives on that somehow a major escalation can be avoided. Lebanon's caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told me that through diplomatic context, the government has received assurances that the Israeli response to the deadly strike on the Golan Heights will be limited. 
 
He said the government's interpretation is that Beirut and its airport will be spared and specifically Beirut southern suburb where many of Hezbollah leaders are believed to be based. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has in the past declared that strikes on any of those locations will be met with an equal response against similar targets in Israel. 
 
Skyrocketing tensions are sending jitters through the country with the United States, Germany and Italy, among others, urging their nationals to leave while flights out are still available, the U.S. adding that if Americans remain in Lebanon, they should be prepared to shelter in place for a long period of time. 
 
Despite all this life goes on in Lebanon, hundreds of thousands of relatively prosperous Lebanese from the vast diaspora have returned home for the summer, determined to enjoy their time with friends and family despite the specter of war. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN reporting from Beirut.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: Live now in Tel Aviv and Ambassador Alon Pinkas, former Israeli Consul General to New York. Ambassador welcome back.
 
ALON PINKAS, FORMER ISRAELI CONSUL GENERAL TO NEW YORK: Thank you. Good morning, John. Good to be with you.
 
VAUSE: Thank you. Now the Israeli Prime Minister seems to have everything to gain by either continuing the war in Gaza or opening a second front with Hezbollah. There's also his right-wing coalition, which seems to be foaming at the mouth over the possibility of a war in the north. And then there is public pressure to act in the immediate aftermath of the death of dozen kids, where the Israeli voice is arguing against the meteor strike on Hezbollah.
 
PINKAS: They're barely to be heard. It's usually military or diplomatic former officials and experts were saying you only delude yourself into thinking that you control escalation, meaning that this is like playing ice hockey on a wafer thin a one centimeter thin ice rink. 
 
Meaning that if Israel response in what would be called a massive retaliation that would necessitate or Hezbollah to respond. Once Hezbollah response, Israel response. Once Israel response, Iran may get into it and before you know it escalation spiral.
 <br>[01:05:00]
 
So, supposedly, John, there is this very vaguely delineated area in which you can respond in a way that would look like it major, but not break the rules and not cross any red lines. I'm sorry for this convoluted explanation. 
 
Now, if you asked me that it's almost impossible to achieve something that would look massive that would low deal, I'm sorry, deal -- Hezbollah with a blow yet not generate or not precipitate a response from them. I don't know what can be done. Honestly. 
 
VAUSE: Yes. I want you to listen to the Israeli Defense Minister. He was speaking Sunday, a day after a dozen children were killed in that rocket attack. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YAOV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): I moved to the Army's Northern Command to see the response plans. This is Hezbollah, where you're talking about, Iran's proxy in the region. Hezbollah will not be cleared of this event, despite its ridiculous denials. It committed the shooting, and it will bear a heavy price for its actions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Made the point, this is Hezbollah. This isn't Hamas. This is Hezbollah. So is our Israelis ready to see major cities like Haifa and Tel Aviv come under consistent rocket fire from Hezbollah? There are fears the Iron Dome missile defense system could be overwhelmed reports of shortages of manpower within the Israeli army to shortage of accurate bombs and shells for the troops fighting Hamas in Gaza. 
 
It seems the last time Israel faced a conflict this kind of -- with this potential was Yom Kippur War back in 1973. Every other war up until since then has been in Israel's favor. It's been short. It's been quick, it's been over. This could be a whole different set of circumstances.
 
PINKAS: You're absolutely right. I can't argue with any point that you raise, except for one thing that in 1973, Israel was fighting state actors, as opposed to now when it is finding non-state actors that do not feel bound or constrained or inhibited by things that countries do. All that said and establish. 
 
To put it in context, Hezbollah has in excess of 100,000 rockets and missiles. Israel believes that at least 25,000 perhaps 30,000 of them are precise munitions, meaning precise missiles, meaning that they could hit Haifa, as you mentioned, or infrastructure or military bases in the northern and even central part of Israel. And so that's an entirely different ballgame. 
 
On top of which the Israeli public, following 10 months of the war in Gaza and the horrors of October 7 is jaded, is depleted and deflated. To tell you that Israel now has the stamina or the military capabilities for a lengthy conflict. That's a very hard question. You know there's no yes or no answer to it.
 
The question is, John, whether or not Israel needs to do this, you started our conversation with that question. And my answer is no, it does not.
 
VAUSE: There's also Lebanon and all this. I want you listed the Lebanese caretaker Foreign Minister on his take.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HABIB: We think that there will be a little bit of escalation, but not that big. Because the Israelis themselves are going to be hit. It's an opportunity for them to do something it shouldn't be big, because we know we cannot control Hezbollah retaliation as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: For Lebanon, clearly there's this hope that the retaliation will be limited, in many ways, because Lebanon will pay the highest price in terms of blood and treasure all this and have absolutely zero say on what happens next. 
 
PINKAS: Yes, absolutely. Look, people need to understand Lebanon is a failed and dysfunctional state, unfortunately. And I say unfortunately, because it's been taken over by a state within a state and armed militia Hezbollah with ideological, financial and military ties to Iran. That is behaving as if it owns Lebanon. 
 
So every time people say, Israel -- is the source of this conflict is the demarcation line of the international border between Israel and Lebanon and Israel needs to negotiate the Americans keep on saying it all the time. Israel needs to negotiate with Lebanon. 
 
But when you don't -- when you negotiate with Lebanon, you're not really negotiating with the real power broker in Lebanon, which is Hezbollah and so I can totally sympathize with what the Lebanese official just said. It's more wishful thinking than any effect on the policymakers.
 <br>[01:10:00]
 
VAUSE: Ambassador Pinkas, it's always. Thank you for getting up early and thank you for being with us. We appreciate your time and your insights. Thank you, sir.
 
PINKAS: Thank you very much John.
 
VAUSE: Israeli authority say two military compounds were breached Monday by right-wing protesters. That angry over an investigation into nearly a dozen IDF soldiers accused of abusing Hamas prisoner. Israeli civilians as well as members of the far-right party -- members of parliament rather were among the protesters arguing the soldiers are being treated like criminals. 
 
Protesters were eventually dispersed. Prime Minister Netanyahu and members of his Cabinet had since denounced the breakups. 
 
Angry protests have erupted across Venezuela just hours after Nicolas Maduro was formally declared winner of the presidential election and a third term and offers a vote which by most accounts appears to be rigged. Protesters have been blocking roads, chanting fraud and toppling a statue of the late leader Hugo Chavez.
 
Maduro warned Monday night the government knows how in his words to defeat those who are violent. Along with most Venezuelans, the U.S. and regional leaders have also questioned the legitimacy of the election. With the Maduro government refusing calls to release tally sheets and other voting data. 
 
The Council of the Organization of American States plans to meet Wednesday as the urgent requests of nine Latin American countries. And in the past 24 hours, Venezuela has withdrawn diplomats from the seven countries in tit for tat, expulsions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADURO (through translator): How do you call this democracy, Constitution, terrorism? We have told the militants of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela not to fall for provocations, because their goal is by assaulting headquarters to clash and have well bloodshed. Now it's clear what I was saying that I have avoided a bloodshed in Venezuela.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: The opposition in Venezuela has outright rejected Maduro's claimed a victory saying its own candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez won the weekend vote and they claimed to have gathered evidence including voting tally sheets to prove it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARIA CORINA MACHADO, VENEZUELAN OPPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): Today, we have great news to share with all Venezuelans. It's a miracle. It's a miracle. But today, I want to tell all Venezuelans both inside and outside the country, all believers in democracy around the world, that we now have the means to prove truth of what happened yesterday in Venezuela.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: A man in Caracas is journalist Stefano Pozzebon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: Protests have erupted in the city center of Caracas less than 24 hours after the government control electoral authority proclaimed Nicolas Maduro as the winner of last Sunday's presidential election. The election which results -- whose results were disputed by many countries in the region. And as you can see, those results have triggered widespread anger in the city of Caracas. 
 
Nobody has called for these protests to be organized. But these people have taken to the streets by themselves, about 50-meter from where I am, you can see the tear gas for at the bottom of these roads of these Avenue because there are intense clashes with forces of the government -- security forces of Nicolas Maduro. 
 
You can see there a semi armored vehicle, I can see from the bottom. People around me are shouting on a microphone that they want freedom, and that they want to leave the streets until Nicolas Maduro is ousted. 
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): On the other hand, the government of Nicolas Maduro has proceeded by claiming the legitimacy of that election. Maduro was formally proclaimed a winner on a Monday morning by the electoral authorities. And shortly before that, the Attorney General had this to say to anybody who wished to think that they could protest these results.
 
TAREK SAAB, VENEZUELAN ATTORNEY GENERAL (through translator): Act of violence and cause to ignore the official results can be framed in the crimes of public instigation, obstruction of public roads, resistance to authorities and incitement to hatred with a sentence of 10 to 20 years.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): That announcement was made on national television here in Venezuela. And it's just a measure of how tense the situation is right now in Caracas, as there are very many moving pieces in the chessboard between Venezuelan government, the opposition and many countries around the world from Brazil, to Chile, Peru, and the United States all urging electoral authorities to release all the data from that controversial and contested election.
 
The opposition, just as a reminder, claiming to have won that election with almost 70 percent of the votes while the government control electoral authority gave the victory to Nicolas Maduro with 51 percent of the vote. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Caracas.

 <br>[01:15:00]
 
VAUSE: Benjamin Gedan is the director of the Latin America Program at the Wilson Center. He's also the former South America director for the White House National Security Council. Thank you for being with us.
 
BENJAMIN GEDAN, DIRECTOR OF LATIN AMERICA PROGRA AT WILSON CENTER: My pleasure. 
 
VAUSE: So as the so called President Elect Nicolas Maduro formally claimed what appears to be very much a fraudulent when the opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, declared that Edmundo Gonzales, the opposition candidate is actually in fact, the real winner. Here she is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO LCIP)
 
MACHADO (through translator): We want to tell our Venezuelans and to the entire world that Venezuela has a new president elect, and that is Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia. We won and everyone knows it. Everyone knows it. I want you to know that this was something so overwhelming, so big that we want in every sector of the country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: And the Gonzalez campaign says it has proof to back up their claim, notably the tally sheets from the weekend vote. At this point, though, could they have every single paper ballot cast in the election verified and signed by each individual voter, and it still wouldn't have much impact on Maduro? He went to a lot of trouble during the election. It seems unlikely he'll stand down because there's something like evidence of wrongdoing.
 
GEDAN: Well, look, it's a dictatorship. It's not a democratic political system. And so fundamentally, Nicolas Maduro and his henchmen can do whatever they please. But I wouldn't say it's irrelevant. I think as this evidence accumulates, the views of the Venezuelan people and the international community can be reshaped in a way that we put quite a bit of pressure on the government. VAUSE: Well, the German Foreign Minister zeroed in on why this rigged election in Venezuela seems different from previous rigged elections in Venezuela. Here she is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANNALENA BAERBOCK, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Many people in Venezuela had hoped that they would finally be able to vote freely, that they would finally be able to take a step towards democracy again, not only were they bitterly disappointed, but no major international election observers were allowed in. 
 
And so it is a bad day for the people of Venezuela. We had hoped for democracy, it has obviously failed again with this election.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUISE: You there's -- there was a real effort by a united opposition for a democratic change of government. Tens of -- hundreds of thousands of people, you know, voted lined up for hours rather than simply to vote. People don't do that to support the status quo. So it's changed with the ballot box, not possible in Venezuela?
 
GEDAN: Actually think this rigged election was quite different from the last rigged election. The last time around the opposition was divided fundamentally opted to boycott the whole process. That was six years ago. This time around you had a united opposition massive opposition turnout, and even low turnout in districts that traditionally are strongholds of the ruling party. 
 
I think we learned a lot about public opinion in Venezuela, not only from pre-election polls, which showed overwhelming support for change, but also from the performance of voters the day of the election, even if we don't have all the evidence of who turned out and for whom they voted.
 
VAUSE: So just sum that up. What do we actually learn for the weekend vote?
 
GEDAN: There was great hope startup in Venezuela for the first time in many, many years. This political movement has governed Venezuela for 25 years. This President has been in charge for over a decade. And I think many Venezuelans before the last election campaign had really given up hope of any political change. 
 
And now emotions have been stirred up. We're seeing protests after the announcement of the fraudulent results from the government. And we're seeing quite a bit of pressure regionally and domestically for political change. I don't think this story is over, even though the voting has concluded and the fraudulent results have been announced.
 
VAUSE: It was interesting though, congratulations for Nicolas Maduro from countries like Russia, as well as from Cuba and also from Beijing. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIN JIAN, SPOKESPERSON, CHINESE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: China congratulates Venezuela for smoothly holding the presidential election, and congratulates President Nicolas Maduro for his reelection. China and Venezuela are good friends and partners supporting each other.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: It seems to say a lot when the only congratulations on the outcome of your so called free and fair democratic elections are coming from countries which do not have free and fair democratic elections. So where does this leave Venezuela internationally?
 
GEDAN: Yes, so I wouldn't exaggerate the isolation of Venezuela is a pariah state in the Americas. Certainly it has no partners any longer in Europe. These aren't small partners, though, that remain their authoritarian states. But Russia and China historically have provided critical support for Venezuela at critical moments. 
 
But you're absolutely right to suggest that Venezuela very much stands alone right now, certainly in the Western Hemisphere. Even former leftist allies, like the president of Brazil, the President of Colombia have begun distancing themselves from Venezuela, and insisting upon some sort of transparency in the counting of votes. 
 
So I think this has really damaged Venezuela's standing even again among typically allied countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.
 
VAUSE: Benjamin Gedan, thanks so much for being with us. Really appreciate your time as well as your insights, sir. Thank you.
 <br>[01:20:00]
 
GEDAN: Thanks for the invitation.

BIDEN: We can and must prevent the abuse of presidential power and restore faith in Supreme Court.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): The President also calling for a constitutional amendment to limit the broad presidential immunity granted by the courts conservative majority last month in a controversial ruling involving former President Donald Trump.
 
BIDEN: President now a king above the law, just imagine what a president could do, trampling civil rights and liberties given such an immunity.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): The reforms have virtually no chance of passing in this divided Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson declaring the President's moves dead on arrival. Biden delivering his message at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, a site offering historical parallels between the two Democratic presidents before Biden, President Lyndon B. Johnson was the last president to abandon a reelection bid in an election year.

SAENZ (voice-over): Biden now hoping to leave his own imprint on the car treat as his time in office winds down.
 <br>[01:25:04]
 
SAENZ: Vice President Kamala Harris endorse President Biden's proposals in a statement on Monday saying that the Supreme Court is facing a crisis of confidence.

(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: Former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump appointed three of the courts six conservative justices, and he's criticized Biden's proposed reforms, telling Fox News he'll keep the court just the way it is if he is elected in November.
 
From his also accusing Democrats without evidence of staging a coup by endorsing vice president Kamala Harris for president after Biden dropped out of the race. 
 
Meantime, Donald Trump has agreed to be interviewed by the FBI over the attempt to kill him earlier this month. The FBI wants to know his perspective on what he observed that day, and then out releasing new evidence about the would be shooter. CNN's Josh Campbell reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TRUMP: What happened --
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): To understand what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, the FBI said investigators have conducted over 450 interviews as they work to identify a motive. The famed FBI profilers assessing the 20-year old shooter was a loner.
 
KEVIN ROJEK, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: We have learned the subject was highly intelligent, attended college and maintain steady employment. This primary social circle appears to be limited to his immediate family. 
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): He was also a loner online using an alias to make 25 firearm related purchases last year, and six purchases of chemicals and explosive materials this year, the FBI said, none of which raised suspicion with his parents.
 
ROJEK: shooter had a long interest in science and things like this and had been doing experiments.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): And examination of the gunman's laptop did provide some clues.
 
ROJEK: Searches related to power plants, mass shooting events, information on improvised explosive devices.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): And in one stunning Google search just days before the shooting, he typed --
 
CHRIS WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: Quote, how far away was Oswald from Kennedy. 
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): On the day of that internet search, the FBI said the shooter registered to attend the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, apparently conducting reconnaissance days before the event, including using a drone to survey the venue and bringing at least one explosive device to the rally, which investigators found in his car. 
 
While the specific motive of the gunman who was shot and killed by a Secret Service counter sniper remains a mystery. New details are also surfacing about the apparent failure by law enforcement to prevent the attack.
 
ROJEK: Shortly after approximately 5:00 p.m., we assessed the shooter was identified by law enforcement as a suspicious person, a local officer took a photo of the subject and sent it to other SWAT operators on scene as well as local command personnel.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): But what happened next, according to local officers who spoke with ABC News portrays a security effort plagued by dysfunction. 
 
GREGORY NICHOL, BEAVER COUNTY SWAT TEAM: I sent those pictures out to that group and advise them of what I noticed and what I'd seen. I assume that there would be somebody coming out to, you know, speak with this individual or find out what's going on. 
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): An officer did finally hoist onto the roof of the building to confront the shooter, but dropped to the ground after the gunman pointed his AR-15 rifle at the officer. 
 
Seconds later, the shooter opened fire on the former president. The Secret Service now facing serious questions not just from the public and Congress, but also from local officers who were on the scene the day of the attack.
 
JASON WOODS, BEAVER COUNTY SWAT TEAM: We were supposed to get a face to face briefing with the Secret Service snipers whenever they arrived, and that never happened. 
 
CAMPBELL: Now we're learning that former President Trump will sit down for an interview with the FBI. These are standard victim interviews likely no real investigative value, but it's notable and that it comes after Trump has continued to slam the Bureau for not coming out quickly to acknowledge that what he suffered from was a gunshot wound. 
 
The bureau has since said that whether it was an entire bullet, whether it was a fragment of a bullet, there's now no doubt in their mind that what struck him was a round of ammunition. Josh Campbell, CNN, Los Angeles.

VAUSE: When we come back, angry protesters greet Israel's Prime Minister on a visit to the site of a deadly rocket attack in the occupied Golan Heights as details in the moment. Also an Arabic knife attack on children by a teenage boy in a dance class allegedly in northern England. Those details in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [01:32:03] 
 
VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone. I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.
 
More details now on our lead story.
 
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited the site of Saturday's deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which killed a dozen children and injured more than 40 people. 
 
Israel has blamed the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the strike, but that group denies responsibility. Netanyahu met with some of the victims' families and promised a severe response. 
 
But his visit was also met with angry protesters, some chanting, "The government is not welcome here." 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): And to our brothers and sisters, the Druze community has paid a heavy price so far in the war. I salute the brave soldiers who gave their lives for all of us. And I say to you, we are brothers. 
 
We have a covenant of life. But unfortunately, it is also a covenant of bereavement and sorrow. And we embrace you. 
 
And to the whole community. I say, don't let your spirit break and don't lose hope in the face of the ax of the evil axis of Iran and Hezbollah because the state of Israel will continue to stand at your side here and in the entire region. 
 
Today, tomorrow, and always.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Earlier I spoke with H.A. Hellyer, Middle East Studies scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for international peace about the ramifications of any Israeli response.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So Israel's most important ally, the United States, is among the countries working to try and prevent this conflict from escalating into a regional war. 
 
I want you to listen to John Kirby, spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Look, Israel has every right to respond. It's Hezbollah that started firing on Israel way back in October. And I think we need to keep that in mind. But nobody wants a broader war and I'm confident that well be able to avoid such an outcome.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Ok. That's not entirely true. Israel and Hezbollah have actually been trading cross-border fire since 2006. It just ticked up after Hamas attacked on October 7. 
 
And since there's been that fear of miscalculation since then, like what happened over the weekend, does political pressure now determine what happens next as well as the need for deterrence any responsibly punishing and significant which then forces Hezbollah to respond in kind. And then we get into this spiral of an escalating conflict. 
 
DR. H.A. HELLYER, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: I think there's a big risk of escalation that could spiral out of control. I think that the United States and others have been pushing the Israelis not to fire on Lebanon in a way that would entice then Hezbollah to retaliate, you know, we have this ongoing for tat reprisals that can really spin out of control. 
 
I have to say that over the past ten months, this fear of escalation has been continuous, which is why so many actors in the region have called for a ceasefire in Gaza. And instead, the Israelis have continued to bombard Gaza and risks spiraling the entire the region out of control.
 <br>[01:34:56]
 
VAUSE: Yes. And any war between Hezbollah and Israel will see a lot of pain, a lot of suffering in Lebanon itself where the militant group is staying. 
 
Lebanon's caretaker foreign minister admits his government is essentially a bystander in this conflict. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDALLAH BOU HABIB, LEBANON CARETAKER FOREIGN MINISTER: We don't want escalation. The most important thing is that if they -- it's an opportunity for them to do something, it should be big because we know we cannot control Hezbollah retaliation as well. 
 
So Hezbollah is going to retaliate if they have -- if they have -- in the normal situation well, you know, we have war in south Lebanon, whether we like it or not.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So while there may be a limited target response by Israel, which is what the foreign -- caretaker foreign minister seems to be saying which will allow for de-escalation, given the threat posed to Israel by Hezbollah, is it just a matter of time before there is in fact a major escalation? If not this time, you know, sometime in the coming future, in the not-too-distant future, rather, can Israel continue to have a heavily armed terror group on its northern border? HELLYER: So I think we have to, you know, make a few things clear
 
 here. First, the risk isn't simply to Lebanon. It's also to Israeli cities and towns because the reprisals from Hezbollah are likely to be quite severe. 
 
You also set a targeted response. In escalation -- I don't think there's anything called targeted. I think unfortunately the calculations that people make will be based on variables that they cannot control. 
 
And with any response from the Israelis, without taking into account the broader context in which this conflict is occurring which of course is the bombardment of Gaza and the destruction of so much of it, you're going to continue to have this situation where unfortunately there will be reprisals, there will be escalations.
 
The key to deescalating this entire situation is Gaza. It is getting a cease-fire there. If there's a ceasefire in Gaza and tensions on the border I think diminish tremendously and you can have a negotiated political document between Hezbollah and the Israelis.
 
VAUSE: Just when it comes to the response, when Israel responded to Iran's barrage of missile fire within about a week or two after that happened -- that was targeted. It wasn't an overwhelming response in terms of military might, but it sent a clear and distinct message to the Iranian regime.
 
Is something similar to that possible with Hezbollah?
 
HELLYER: Of course it is. And by the way, what happened then as well with the Iranians, I think on both sides was incredibly reckless. And we were all in the region more generally, but also in the world very fortunate that didn't spiral out of control. 
 
But there's something called the law of unintended consequences. People can't calculate these sorts of things with any degree of certainty and that's why again, you know the way forward is to move towards actively de-escalation as opposed to assuming that this constant reckless behavior can continue without something really spiraling out of control. 
 
It's a deep risk, I have to be clear, John, over the past ten months. This is why so many have been calling for a ceasefire in Gaza so you don't have these sorts of situations coming up. If all-out war breaks out, it will be catastrophic and devastating for everybody.
 
VAUSE: Absolutely. 
 
H.A. Hellyer, thank you so much for being with us. Really appreciate it.
 
In northern England two children have been killed, nine wounded in a knife attack at a Taylor's-themed dance class. 
 
As CNN's Anna Stewart reports, a 17-year-old boy has been arrested by police. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was late morning in Southport, a seaside town in the northwest of England when police first received reports of a stabbing. It was quickly declared a major incident with multiple victims. Later in the day, police announced two children had died. 
 
The attack took place during a Taylor Swift-themed yoga class aimed at six- to 11-year-olds when a man walked in with a knife and started attacking the children. 
 
Police said nine other children were injured with six still in critical condition. Two adults were also injured as they tried to protect the children from the assailant. All those injured suffered stab wounds.
 
A local business owner described it as like a scene from a horror movie, according to P.A. Media. And he described mothers arriving at the scene screaming.
 
Merseyside police arrested a 17-year-old male from Banks, a village just outside of Southport on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. 
 <br>[01:39:50]
 
STEWART: They said the incident is not being treated as terror-related and inquiries are ongoing to establish a motive. 
 
U.K. leaders expressed their shocked at the attack. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer posted a statement on X saying "Horrendous and deeply shocking news emerging from Southport. My thoughts are with all those affected."
 
And King Charles issued a statement sending "heartfelt condolences, prayers, and deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those who tragically lost their lives. And to all those affected by this truly appalling attack".

VAUSE: Still to come here on CNN. There's new intelligence showing Kim Jong-un's health is getting worse. It seems official training is now underway in secret for his daughter to one day be the next Dear Leader.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Rescue and relief operations underway this hour after a landslide in southern India left at least 24 people dead. Emergency responders say at this stage, it's unclear how many people may be trapped. The landslide also destroyed a bridge.
 
In southern China, dams and dikes have failed in heavy rain, leaving at least four people dead, three others missing. Historic rainfall has caused the area's third breach in the past two days. More than 4,000 people have fled their homes. Search and rescue efforts are underway with more than 1,200 rescue workers in the region.
 
Beijing's increasingly aggressive military action in the South China Sea is the focus of high-level discussions between the U.S. And the Philippines. U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense have been meeting with the Philippine president, among others. 
 
CNN's Mike Valerio is in Seoul. He joins us now live for, you know, why does it matter? And in particular, what are the Philippines looking for here. 
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sure. Well John, it matters because so much of our global trade, up to 30 percent goes through this one body of water, the South China Sea. That's the latest estimates that we have from 2016. 
 
So if you look around the room, chances are John, you'll have an electronic device that came through the South China Sea on the way to your home. 
 
And also what the Philippines wants, they need from their point of view, help from the United States to keep these sea lanes free and specifically, again, from their point of view, free from Chinese influence. 
 
So it's all about the map, John, when we look at map of the South China Sea for decades now since the late 1920s China has said that they're abiding by what they call the nine-dash line. And you can see that we have the full line around China's territorial -- territorial claims in red much of the international community vehemently disagrees with that, chief among them, the Philippines. 
 
In the 70s, so many nations around the world came together through the United Nations and said that the territory extends 200 nautical miles away from any nation's coastline, be it the mainland or island. 
 
So the Philippines, what they're saying here is that, ok, well, China is stepping way over its maritime claims and into our economic -- exclusive economic zone.
 <br>[01:44:55]
 
VALERIO: So they're looking for help from the United States to keep these sea lanes free from Chinese influence. 
 
We heard from the Philippines' president, President Ferdinand Marcos a little earlier today. Here's what he said on that front in terms of help from the U.S.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FERDINAND MARCOS, JR., PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT: I'm always very happy that these communication lines are very open. So that all the -- all the things that we're doing together in terms of our alliance, in terms of the specific context of our situation here in the West Philippine Sea and in the Indo-Pacific are continuously examined, re- examined and re-examined. So we are agile in terms of our responses.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALERIO: Ok. So cutting through all of that diplomatic speak from the president of the Philippines, what matters here, John, at the end of the day, the United States is going to cut a check for about $500 million in military aid for the Philippines used for everything from cyber security to new navy craft to help the Philippines better patrol their exclusive economic zone. 
 
The question though that we're watching from here in Asia, is whether any of that money will really matter. Will China's behavior change based on this show of the alliance between the United States and the Philippines. 
 
And, you know, a lot of our analysts here at CNN, who we talk to throughout the diplomatic quarters in Seoul and Tokyo and Beijing, they're very skeptical that this aid may change China's behavior. 
 
China thinks in terms of decades, centuries, a global power for millennia, and they want to control this crucial stretch of ocean. So were going to be waiting to see what, if any, behavior changes happen in the near and long-term, John. 
 
VAUSE: Mike, thank you. Mike Valerio live for us there in Seoul.
 
Well -- excuse me -- for North Korea's Kim family, the family business is running North Korea. Kim Jong-un took over from his father, Kim Jong Il, who took over from his dad, Kim Il Sung. 
 
Now new intelligence from South Korea indicates Kim Jong-un's health may be getting worse. And he may be about to break with tradition with official training apparently underway in secret for his young daughter to take over one day.
 
She's been seen on take-your-daughter-to-work day, overseeing military parades, or a test of ICBMs, even attending meetings of the workers party and she's not even a teenager. 
 
CNN's Will Ripley has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In flood-ravaged North Korea, along a swollen river near the Chinese border, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un overseeing the evacuation of thousands.
 
Noticeably absent from state media coverage, Kim's young daughter, Kim Ju-ae, now undergoing secret succession training, South Korean lawmakers say, suggesting the elementary age girl is being groomed as the next North Korean leader.
 
Two lawmakers in Seoul briefed by the National Intelligence Service say Kim Jong-un's health may be deteriorating. His doctors searching for new medications to treat Kim.
 
He has a family history of heart disease, weighs more than 300 pounds, a dangerously high body mass index in the mid-forties, high stress, smoking and drinking, all putting the 40-year-old Kim at high-risk lawmakers say. 
 
They add succession plans could change, but right now, all signs point to Kim Ju-ae, who could become the first female and fourth generation leader of the ruling Kim family.
 
Kim Il Sung died in 1994. Kim Jong Il died in 2011, the year Kim Jong- un came to power in his 20s.
 
His second child believed to be 10 to 12-years-old, bearing a striking resemblance to her father, a fixture by his side since her debut in late 2022 at missile launches, military banquets, massive parades.
 
South Korean intelligence says she's now engaging in non-public activities. Pyongyang aware of reaction to her young age, adjusting propaganda, reducing public appearances, as her father consolidates the Kim family's power, bolstering ties with Russian strong man Vladimir Putin, building up his military spy satellite program. And South Korea says stepping up training for a successor to someday take control of North Korea's growing nuclear arsenal.
 
Kim Jong-un is the third son of the late Kim Jong Il. He was reportedly chosen as the successor on his eighth birthday. But the outside world didn't find out until many years later. 
 
This very public reveal that we saw of Kim Ju-ae about a year-and-a- half ago, may have been the beginning, experts say, of a personality cult for Kim's daughter but now that people know who she is, she needs to build her military credentials behind the scenes over time.

VAUSE: The first night in Indonesia's soon-to-be new capital for the President Joko Widodo wasn't a good one apparently. He says he didn't sleep very well in the eagle-shaped palace in Nusantara. Construction of the capital has faced long delays, also managerial and land issues.
 
President Widodo has been pushing for completion before he steps down in October. The capital is moving away from Jakarta because it's congested, polluted, and sinking into the Java Sea. 
 
Still to come, California's Park Fire keeps growing despite firefighters efforts. We'll have the very latest on how they're trying to contain this inferno.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: The man arrested in connection with California's Park Fire has been charged with arson, according to court documents filed Monday. He has not entered a plea yet, but will be arraigned on Thursday. The Park Fire has now become the sixth largest fire in California history. 
 
CNN's Camila Bernal reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Thousands and thousands of acres that look similar to what you see here behind me, so much destruction. 
 
And fire officials telling me that the center of the fire is still very active. It's still in very steep terrain in areas where firefighters have difficulty getting to. 
 
But there are two things that have been beneficial. One, better weather conditions over the weekend, and the second is more resources.
 
We now have about 5,000 firefighters on the ground and they've been able to do a number of things, including coming out to areas like this one to do ground assessments. We now know that about 100 structures have been destroyed.
 
And the other thing that fire officials told me is that they were able to do a direct aggressive attack on those flames. And that's what helped bring up those containment numbers. 
 
Officials also saying that one of their priorities is to get people back into their homes especially the people of Butte County. This is a county that already lived through the deadliest fire in California history. 
 
And so what they're doing is trying to inform the people of this county and get them back safely into their homes. So yes, there is some progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done here. 
 
Camila Bernal, CNN -- Butte County, California.

VAUSE: Paris is waking to day four of the Olympics with more than two dozen sports holding competitions. Medals up for grabs in eight of them. 
 
That's including the women's team artistic gymnastics, where American Simone Biles will be going for her eighth Olympic gold medal -- medal overall rather, and her first gold since Rio in 2016. 
 
Team U.S.A. took their first medal in men's team gymnastics in more than a decade Monday. They secured bronze. That's after an impressive pommel horse routine by Stephen Nedoroscik, who called it the greatest moment of his life. 
 
U.S. women's water polo team is building a big fan base in Paris, due in part to their hype man, rapper Flavor Flav. He made it his mission to draw attention to the sport as the U.S. Women go for a fourth consecutive gold medal.
 
CNN's Coy Wire caught up with the rap star.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FLAVOR FLAV, RAPPER: I always dreamed about coming to the Olympics one day, because the only time I've ever seen Olympics was on tv. But now I get to actually be here and experience it. 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: It's incredible. You went from being public enemy number one to number one friend and hype man for Team U.S.A. water polo. Tell me that story. How did all come about? 
 <br>[01:54:46]
 
FLAV: Well, it all started by Maggie Steffens (ph) putting out the story, you know what I'm saying. My manager, she has her head in everything so she brought this story to me. And she said Flav, tell me what you think. 
 
I've read the story and everything, you know what I'm saying? And I'm like, you know what, I'd love to help these girls out, sponsor these girls, you know what I'm saying? So I'm glad that day, you know, took my offer for sponsorship. 
 
WIRE: And what are some of the ways you've been able to help support them? 
 
FLAV: Well, first of all, first of all, I've been cheering them all like crazy, you know what I'm saying? I mean, everybody know that I'm the original hype man. 
 
WIRE: We know that.
 
FLAV: You know what I'm saying. And these girls man, they got -- you know, they got three back-to-back gold medals right now and I would love to cheer them on, you know, to get that fourth one, you know.
 
WIRE: Yes.
 
FLAV: But I mean, my thing is this, you know, these girls when they're not in the water, they're home, you know, live in actual working lives, you know what I'm saying. One, two and three jobs. 
 
And they're out here busting their butts to make United States look good, you know what I'm saying? So, I said why not help give these girls a boost.
 
WIRE: All right. Something else you got to see out here on the rooftop of our WBD house.
 
Look over here. We have a bar, we get to watch all the games. So why not do that while we finish our chat.

WIRE: What was it like?
 
FLAV: Man, first of all, it takes a lot of strength, takes a lot of endurance. And when I jumped in the water with these girls, I was in there for a full, honestly, a full seven minutes.
 
WIRE: And how did you feel?
 
FLAV: But listen, that was like the hardest seven minutes ever in the water in my life. 
 
But then they gave me the ball to see what it's like, you know?
