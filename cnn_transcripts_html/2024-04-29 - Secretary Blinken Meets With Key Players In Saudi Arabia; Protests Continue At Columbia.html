ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: All right, fury on campus, Columbia University sets a deadline in about two hours from now for protesters to 
 
 clear out or face suspension. 
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: "One World" starts right now. Some of the world's most elite universities are facing a crisis between 
 
 protesting students, school administrators and law enforcement. As you just heard, Columbia University issuing that ultimatum of suspension after days 
 
 of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. 
 
ASHER: Also ahead, he's got a two million dollar bounty on his head. He's one of the FBI's most wanted and he is speaking exclusively to CNN. One on 
 
 one with one of Haiti's top gang leaders.
 
GOLODRYGA: It's an interview you don't want to miss. And later in the hour, good news. Disney is coming out with another "Lion King". 
 
ASHER: Great news. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Even better news. Beyonce, of course, will once again voice a character. Who won't love that? The best news. Her surprise co-star, we'll 
 
 tell you about -- up next. I like that. It was like a mix of "Texas Hold'em" and our show "Open". It worked really well.
 
ASHER: I actually chose the music for this show. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Bravo. Good job.
 
ASHER: I had a lot of compliments on it. 
 
GOLODRYGA: It's fantastic. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. 
 
ASHER: And I'm Zain Asher. You are indeed watching "One World". All right. I want to begin with fresh momentum on a potential ceasefire and hostage 
 
 release deal between Israel and Hamas. As America's top diplomat visits the region, we are learning more details about a new proposal that is in the 
 
 works right now.
 
GOLODRYGA: That's right. Antony Blinken is meeting key players in Saudi Arabia right now. This is his seventh trip to the region since the war 
 
 began. Now, while that's going on, a Hamas delegation is in Cairo discussing a new framework proposed by Egypt. This one calls for up to 33 
 
 hostages to be released over several weeks. A response from Hamas' top leader in Gaza is expected within days, possibly even hours. Blinken is 
 
 urging Hamas to take that deal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel. 
 
 And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: As talks continue, Israel is keeping up airstrikes on Gaza ahead of a promised ground invasion set to take place in Rafah. Hospital officials 
 
 in Rafah report that at least 20 people were killed. That includes an infant and a toddler, as well. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is slamming the 
 
 Netanyahu government for his actions in Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNIE SANDERS, U.S. SENATE INDEPENDENT: Right now, what Netanyahu's right- wing extremist and racist government is doing is unprecedented in the modern history of warfare. Right now, we are looking at the possibility of 
 
 mass starvation and famine in Gaza. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Now, as comments come as the situation in Gaza sparks pro- Palestinian protests across U.S. college campuses, dozens of students have been arrested as the unrest spreads from coast to coast, raising questions 
 
 about the First Amendment rights to free speech.
 
ASHER: Columbia University even issuing this warning, clear the encampment or face suspension. Protesters are gathering this hour. In a moment, we're 
 
 going to be taking you there to that campus live.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: We do have reporters covering all of these different angles. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us, but let's begin with Kylie 
 
 Atwood at the State Department. Kylie, you interviewed last week, Secretary of State Blinken. You talked about these hostage negotiations. 
 
Now, comes word of potentially another proposal through Egypt. And as we just heard, the Secretary of State calling this an extraordinarily generous 
 
 deal. What more are we learning about the possibilities of finally reaching a deal? 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right. Some optimism on behalf of the Secretary in terms of what Israel has put on the table here 
 
 and some pressure when it comes to trying to encourage Hamas. Once again, we should note to accept the deal that has been put on the table.
 
And notably, he also said effectively that time is of the essence here, that Hamas has to decide and has to decide quickly. Of course, the backdrop 
 
 being U.S. concerns and concerns in the region that Israel has said they're going to go ahead with that invasion of Rafah soon. And the expectation is 
 
 that they would do that if there weren't some sort of agreement come to -- come to here with regard to the ceasefire and the release of these 
 
 hostages.
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
So, we'll have to watch and see where this goes. But I think the context here is also important in such that the Secretary said last week that there 
 
 hasn't been the type of escalation towards a wider regional conflict in the last few days or week or so that we had seen, obviously, between Israel and 
 
 Iran in recent weeks. 
 
And he was hopeful that without that escalation, Hamas isn't looking towards this to turn into a wider conflict. And that might actually prompt 
 
 them to come to an agreement here for what the Israelis have put on the table. That was before we actually saw the -- the portion that Israel has 
 
 put on the table here. But he was optimistic about just sort of this moment in time and the atmospherics surrounding that. So, we'll have to watch and 
 
 see. 
 
The Secretary is also, of course, in Saudi Arabia to discuss what could be a historic broader agreement to bring this entire conflict to an end, which 
 
 would include that normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a defense agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and of 
 
 course, some sort of framework that would be implemented for a two-state solution. So, a lot of pieces here that he is working on while he is in the 
 
 region and really, all eyes on, if there can be an agreement on a ceasefire to prompt this all to move forward.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right, Kylie Atwood, thank you so much. 
 
ASHER: Thanks, Kylie. All right, let's turn now to Jeremy Diamond, who's in Jerusalem for us. Jeremy, just walk us through what you can actually tell 
 
 us at this point about what is in this latest deal proposed by Egypt. 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a really critical moment, and it is one where we could see in the coming days whether or not a 
 
 hostage deal is actually possible or whether instead we'll start to see in a matter of weeks Israeli troops beginning to move into that southernmost 
 
 city of Rafah. And that's because this framework is really a last ditched attempt in many ways by the Egyptian government to try and avoid that Rafah 
 
 offensive, which would be right on its doorstep.
 
Egyptian officials have put this latest framework on the table that would see the release of 20 to 33 Israeli hostages released over the course of 
 
 several weeks. The ratio of numbers of days to hostages would be one to one. 
 
So, as many hostages as are released would be the number of days of that initial ceasefire.Israel has also agreed in this framework to the 
 
 unrestricted access of Palestinians to northern Gaza, something that has been a key sticking point for Hamas over the course of the last several 
 
 weeks. 
 
But now the question is, what will Hamas' response be and how exactly will the issue of a more permanent ceasefire be linked? Because also in this 
 
 framework is the notion of a sustained calm, which is effectively a one year ceasefire that would come into place after that initial release of 
 
 some nearly 33 Israeli hostages. 
 
So, Hamas officials are currently in Cairo discussing this latest framework. Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, has this framework in hand. 
 
 And his response is expected as early as tomorrow, perhaps in a matter of days. And that will give us a sense of whether or not there is a serious 
 
 way to move forward here with these negotiations or whether it's clear that these talks are at a dead end, in which case Israeli officials are 
 
 determined to move forward with that ground offensive in Rafah.
 
ASHER: All right, Jeremy Diamond, live for us there. Thank you. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Let's turn now to Columbia University, which has been given protesters opposed to the war in Gaza less than two hours now to clear out 
 
 and campus or face suspension. Omar Jimenez joins us with the latest. So, a two hour ultimatum here. What is the response been from students that 
 
 you've spoken to, Omar? 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, well, Zain and Bianna, obviously that two hour deadline from now at this point is one of the most concrete 
 
 steps the university has made here, essentially telling the students they have to leave this encampment or they will face suspension at the very 
 
 least, the inability or ineligibility to finish the semester on good standing.
 
Now, as far as what we've heard from students, we've been getting some glimpses. One, now suspended student group here at Columbia is encouraging 
 
 students not to leave the encampment and not to sign anything that the university puts in front of them, because that's one of conditions for them 
 
 to leave the camp. 
 
They have to sign on that they will adhere to university policies. So, that, of course, is the situation brewing on campus right now, as we're 
 
 also starting to get reports that potentially, other protests might form outside. So, a lot to monitor there. 
 
But all of this comes just hours after the university president, Minouche Shafik, announced that negotiations between the student protesters and the 
 
 university essentially have ended, that they were not able to come to an agreement. So, what that means is the university says it will not divest 
 
 from Israel, which, of course, was one of the central factions of why this encampment-led protest began in the first place. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
They also said, though, that while they won't divest from Israel, they said that they would expedite a process to allow students to put forward 
 
 proposals in front of the body that considers divestment opportunities. Also, that they would invest in health care and education in Gaza. 
 
But also, that the university said while they tried to create an environment that was constructive, that was of constructive dialogue and 
 
 was able to have protests on it, that at the end of the day, it did not create a safe environment for many Jewish students, so much so to the point 
 
 that many decided to do their education from home, a dynamic the university called tragic.
 
And it's one that one now anonymous Jewish student is using to sue Columbia University, alleging that they created a dangerous environment for Jewish 
 
 students, so much so to the point that they couldn't get the education that they were promised. 
 
So, that's another dynamic that the university has been trying to deal with, as well. All of it as we approach a little bit over two weeks from 
 
 now, graduation here. And the university was definitive today, saying they will have a commencement, which implies that they plan to have this 
 
 encampment resolved by then. In what manner, we do not know. But we are starting to see some of those first concrete steps being taken, of course, 
 
 starting with that deadline this afternoon.
 
GOLODRYGA: And we'll be watching that deadline closely when two o'clock comes. Will protesters from that encampment finally disperse or will they 
 
 remain defiant and stay in place? And ultimately, will the school then resort to calling in law enforcement? Once again, we shall see. Omar 
 
 Jimenez, thank you so much.
 
ASHER: All right, let's focus now on another school that is not too far away from Columbia. I want to bring in Yale law student Chisato Kimura, who 
 
 has been active -- an active voice on campus for Palestinians. Chisato, thank you so much for being with us.
 
So, a lot of universities right now are in this really difficult position of, on the one hand, of course, having to make room for free speech, allow 
 
 and embrace free speech, while at the same time obviously making sure, as well, that Jewish students on campus feel that they are allowed to learn in 
 
 a safe environment. Just walk us through what the demands are, at this point in time, from protesters on campus and what response those demands 
 
 have been met with by university leaders. 
 
CHISATO KIMURA, YALE LAW STUDENT: Sure. So, Occupy Yale -- I'm just one of many students here, but it's a very wide coalition. It's a multi-faith 
 
 community that's built on the demands of disclosure of all financial investments that Yale is holding, divestment from weapons manufacturing and 
 
 then reinvestment of that money into the local New Haven community and to food security and education and to affordable housing. 
 
GOLODRYGA: As we just heard from Columbia University, despite protests and pressure to divest from Israel, that will not be happening on campus there. 
 
 You are calling for a divestment from Israel for what you call genocide. We should just note that the Biden administration, as early as this month, 
 
 said they have no evidence of genocide being committed in Israel or by Israel. But you obviously are entitled to your own views.
 
What I think is a question is that you and your organization don't have a First Amendment right to protest on private property. There have been 
 
 ultimatums made by university leadership to leave your encampment, as well. Why will you not heed those guidelines? 
 
KIMURA: Well, I think, you know, first of all, it's really important to clarify that it's not just my views. It's the views of many, many people 
 
 here. That's why students across the country are mobilizing, why people across the country are mobilizing. 
 
But in terms of understanding what's happening, the violence that's happening against Palestinians in Gaza as genocide, you know, the ICJ has 
 
 said that there is a plausible case, which is the highest determination they could have made at this point, that there is genocide happening.
 
You know, international community of legal experts, human rights lawyers, academics have many, many, folks have come together and recognized 
 
 correctly that what is happening is genocide. And I think that's really important in grounding why we're here, because we see the violence live 
 
 broadcasted across social media, across media. And I think it's impossible to ignore.
 
And it compels us to speak out against it. And it compels us to hold those accountable. Our university, Yale University, is actively profiting off of 
 
 the genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. And that's why we're out here. And, you know, what we're doing is peaceful protest. We're calling, we've 
 
 been trying to communicate with the university for the last seven months for them to divest from weapons manufacturing to no end.
 
They haven't responded to us. They have refused to negotiate with us. So, taking up space on campus and peacefully protesting is just one of many, 
 
 many ways that community members and students have come together to demand that Yale end its complicity in the genocide in Gaza.
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
GOLODRYGA: Again, there has been no determination of genocide. But to make your argument, if you were calling for these actions, given what you view 
 
 as violation of international law and laws of war, you were violating your own school's law. And that is that you can't protest in an encampment and 
 
 occupy the space.
 
I mean, the Yale college dean sent out a note that was hand-delivered saying, "Students who continue to occupy cross campus without regard for 
 
 university policies risk university discipline and arrest or re-arrest." So, are you prepared for that situation? 
 
KIMURA: I mean, I can't speak for other students, but I think the thing to focus on and what we are highlighting by being out here with folks across 
 
 the country, across the world are highlighting in their different forms of activism is that what is going on in Gaza is very, very serious. So 
 
 serious, in fact, that the ICJ has said that there's a plausible case of genocide that international legal experts have found.
 
The U.N. experts have found that a genocide is on-going in Gaza. And so, you know, at the end of the day, it becomes a moral question of when there 
 
 is an on-going genocide that is being broadcasted, live broadcast to the world, why would we not do everything that we can, including peaceful 
 
 protest, to call for an end to the genocide and call for an end to our institution's complicity in that genocide. 
 
ASHER: And so, Chisato, just in terms of where this goes from here, I mean, assuming that Yale doesn't end up divesting or cutting its financial ties 
 
 with Israel, you know, even the head of Columbia University had offered at some point to say, listen, we're not going to divest from Israel, but we 
 
 are going to invest more in education programs and health programs in Gaza.
 
There's still a stalemate there. And there's a two o'clock deadline, as you know, for Columbia University protesters to leave their encampments. So, 
 
 just in terms of where it goes from here at Yale, if there is no divestment, what happens next? 
 
KIMURA: Well, I think, you know, I can't speak for the entire coalition. I'm just one student out of, you know, hundreds of people who are here and 
 
 who have been protesting Yale's role. 
 
ASHER: All right. It looks as though we have lost Chisato's live shot. Do we have her back? Do we have her audio? Chisato can you hear us? 
 
KIMURA: Yes, I can. Can you hear me? 
 
ASHER: Okay. Yeah, you cut out briefly.
 
KIMURA: Sorry.
 
ASHER: You're saying that you couldn't speak for the other protesters at Yale, that you were just one student and then you cut out. Can you go from 
 
 there? 
 
KIMURA: Of course. Yeah, sure. I'm just one student of many. But, you know, it's entirely in the administration's hands. We've made our demands very 
 
 clear. We think and we've made it clear to them that at the very least, in terms of coming to the negotiating table, in terms of setting up any 
 
 meetings or anything like that, we need disclosure. 
 
We need access and we need transparency to Yale's financial investments, because otherwise there's no reason to meet. We have no information going 
 
 into the meeting. And what we're doing here is we are very ready to negotiate in good faith with the university. And we're just calling on the 
 
 university to do the same thing. It's entirely up to Yale University how they respond to peaceful protests calling for Yale's end to profiting off 
 
 of genocide.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, we should just note that the images that you were seeing, the aerial images from a college campus, that actually is not Yale. I 
 
 believe that was Columbia University's encampment from today. 
 
But Chisato, to your point, I mean, obviously, as you know, the BDS movement has existed long before October 7th. And I don't believe, to this 
 
 date, there has been one university that has cut ties to Israel over these calls. 
 
So, as you say, you're willing to see whatever circumstances happen to you and your fellow protesters if, in fact, the authorities are brought in. Are 
 
 you worried at all about the police getting involved the way we saw on Columbia University's campus and the way we're seeing across campuses 
 
 throughout the country?
 
KIMURA: I mean, yes, police have already gotten involved. The administration, last Monday morning at 6 A.M., called on the police 
 
 department to ambush the encampment as it existed last week, ambush the encampment with no warning, and swept the encampment, searched through 
 
 every tent, searched through everyone's belongings, and ultimately arrested nearly 50 students and community members. 
 
So, Yale already has brought in a militant police department in response to our peaceful protests calling for an end to the genocide. Yes, so we've 
 
 seen that. And I think, I mean, I'm not sure if you can see behind me, but the encampment has grown stronger. There are more people out here. And in 
 
 response to Yale's attempt to repress and silence our demands.
 
ASHER: Chisato, we really appreciate you joining us. And please do keep in touch. And we'd love to have you on again, depending on what happens with 
 
 the protests there. Chisato, thank you. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Coming up for us, deadly flooding sweeps across Kenya, killing dozens of people. A report from one of the hardest hit areas, just ahead.
 
ASHER: Plus, CNN heads into violence-ridden Haiti for an exclusive interview with influential gang leader Vitel'Homme Om Innocent. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're venturing deeper into land that for months, Haitian security experts have warned stay away 
 
 from. But we've been assured by this gang's leader that we'll be safe. We only hope his messaging reached all the checkpoints. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:23:22]
 
GOLODRYGA: Now, to a CNN exclusive. Our network is the first foreign news organization to interview Haiti's influential gang leader Vitel'Homme 
 
 Innocent. Did I say that correctly? He is on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list and has a two million-dollar bounty on his head for alleged kidnapping 
 
 and murder of Americans. 
 
ASHER: CNN's David Culver asked him a wide range of questions about the deadly violence and the unrest in Haiti. Before we show you the interview, 
 
 of course, we do want to warn you that some of the content in David's piece that you're about to see is really graphic and, as you would expect, 
 
 difficult to watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CULVER (voice-over): This war-torn intersection in Port-au-Prince is the blurred boundary signaling we are now in gang territory. 
 
CULVER: This is an area we have never been into before.
 
CULVER (voice-over): We're told to drive to this road and someone will meet us.
 
CULVER: He's assured us that he's sending somebody and so we are to just wait for that person. It looks like a vehicle here, a truck.
 
CULVER (voice-over): The armed men in the front seat motioned for us to follow, so we do. Over rocky and flooded streets. We're venturing deeper 
 
 into land that for months Haitian security experts have warned stay away from, but we've been assured by this gang's leader that we'll be safe.
 
We only hope his messaging reached all the checkpoints. 
 
CULVER: Four guys in the car behind us as well, so they're fully escorting us in. 
 
UNKNOWN: Now they've added a motorbike with two guys.
 
CULVER (voice-over): After 45 minute, several dozen masked men and women, most carrying guns, direct us towards a driveway. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
CULVER: All right, this guy in front of us now seeming to be leading us to some sort of house. Good.
 
CULVER (voice-over): We're about to step out and meet Vitel'Homme Innocent, considered by both U.S. and Haitian authorities to be a violent criminal 
 
 and leader of the Croix Barrier gang. He's one of the FBI's 10 most wanted, with a bounty of up to two million dollars, accused in the kidnapping of 
 
 American missionaries and the death of another American hostage, Vitel'Homme rarely seeks media attention, yet, given he commands what some 
 
 U.S. officials say is the largest gang in Port-au-Prince, and his domain includes the U.S. Embassy, we wanted to better understand his motives. 
 
 Vitel'Homme agrees to meet us. 
 
CULVER: Hi there.
 
CULVER (voice-over): On his turf. 
 
CULVER: I'm David. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): Flanked by his followers, he leads us inside this flashy mansion.
 
CULVER: And so is this your home? 
 
CULVER (voice-over): In a room filled with gold-rimmed furniture and stuffed animals, I ask him about the crisis engulfing Haiti. "Our dream is 
 
 to rid the country of the corrupt oligarchs and politicians who are holding us back," he says. We need to get rid of the system and return stability to 
 
 Haiti. He speaks with intention and calls for greater dialogue. 
 
"But if it's the same system that's been in power, then as armed groups, we will never put down our weapons," he says. 
 
CULVER: And so, do you have regular communications with, as you say, the other armed groups? "Yes, we're united, he tells me." The gangs have formed 
 
 a coalition known as Vive Ensemble, or Living Together, and collectively they push back on foreign intervention, holding tight their grips over a 
 
 fractured state, some using terror tactics like kidnapping, rape and murder to sustain control. 
 
CULVER: Is that something you've participated in, in ordering your men and women to kidnap? He says he hopes to defend himself in court against those 
 
 allegations. And while not denying his followers have kidnapped people, he deflects blame to outside forces for creating a state of corruption as he 
 
 sees it. He's eager to show us other parts of his home and territory and introduces us to his top commander. 
 
CULVER: So you're his cousin? 
 
CULVER (voice-over): Security experts suggest Kraze Barye has more than a thousand armed gang members, including recently escaped inmates. 
 
CULVER: As you can see, a lot of his armed soldiers and followers are around us. And he's suggesting that we follow and drive with them. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): He brings us to the edge of his territory. We notice his guards, normally curious and watching us, are instead looking outward, 
 
 cautiously, toward another gang's territory, a reminder that the coalition of gangs might be more fragile than portrayed.
 
In the midst of our tour, a disturbing video starts circulating on WhatsApp. It reportedly shows the devastating and deadly aftermath of an 
 
 allied gang attack on a community a few miles from where we are. 
 
CULVER: The destruction, the violence, the deaths that have played out -- do you take any responsibility for that? 
 
CULVER (voice-over): He only says he made mistakes and is not perfect. He blames politicians. We're interrupted. Something nearby puts his guards on 
 
 edge. We pick up the conversation a short distance away. Senior editor Caitlin Hu further pressing for an explanation to the horrors we've seen in 
 
 Haiti.
 
CAITLIN HU, CNN SENIOR EDITOR: But we have also met in hospitals, women, children, innocent people who have been burned, who have been forced to 
 
 leave their homes, who have been shot, who have been raped. Why are innocent people suffering in this struggle? 
 
CULVER (voice-over): He does not clearly answer. Instead, he frames the months of deadly street violence as collateral damage. He points the finger 
 
 at police, saying they refused to engage in dialogue and instead recklessly opened fire. Police say they're desperately trying to keep the gangs from 
 
 gaining more ground. 
 
Vitel'Homm claims to be a man of faith, devout in practicing voodoo, a common religion here in Haiti.
 
CULVER: I've heard rumors and I don't know how true they are. So I ask you that you have voodoo protection. Do you feel that protection? "Yes," he 
 
 tells me confidently.
 
Adding that he prays daily for his fellow Haitians. Ultimately, what is it going to take to bring stability and a future of calm to this country? He 
 
 says he and the other armed groups need to be included in discussions of Haiti's future. That's the only way he sees convincing gang members to drop 
 
 their guns in exchange for a future outside of violence. As curfew nears, we head back the way we came. 
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
Vitel'Homme stopping several times along the way, mingling with locals, handing out food, smiling as though on a campaign trail. He wants us to 
 
 meet these two men, blind refugees. They tell us Vitel'Homme took them in. But it leaves us wondering, why help these men and force so many others out 
 
 of their homes? "Look at actions over words," he tells me.
 
As we near the edge of his territory and the end of our five-hour visit, Vitel'Homme gets out of his motorcade, waves for us to move forward and 
 
 strolls to the desolate street corner. He then comes to our door and shakes each of our hands. His actions, intentional and symbolic.
 
CULVER: Here we are, just a few blocks from the U.S. Embassy, and that's clearly a demonstration of how confident he is and the many he has around 
 
 him displaying their show of force. A flexing of strength in a lawless nation, where today at least, gangs hold the power. David Culver, CNN,

GOLODRYGA: Police in Atlanta, Georgia, arrested 28 people at Emory University during protests against the war in Gaza last week. Several 
 
 protesters were among those taken into custody. 
 
ASHER: Now, the faculty is organizing a no-confidence vote against the school's president. He called in local police to clear out the protesters. 
 
 Nick Valencia is joining us live now at Emory University in Atlanta. So, Nick, just set the scene in terms of what is going on. Obviously, we've 
 
 seen a very active and heavy presence by police, and there has been a lot of outcry and outrage about that. Just walk us through what you're seeing 
 
 on campus. 
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that huge police presence has come and gone. And it's just, you know, staff and faculty, students here, that 
 
 day of action continues with this faculty walkout that you see behind me. But really, the drama that happened here on Thursday has led to a lot of 
 
 fallout here on campus. 
 
There's pushing a no-confidence vote here, that ballot making its way to faculty, expressing a referendum against the university's president, that 
 
 they have no confidence in his ability to lead this institute of higher learning. That fallout is also very personal as well for this individual 
 
 who joins us now, Noelle McAfee. She is the chair of the philosophy department here at Emory. You were detained during those violent arrests on 
 
 Thursday. First, we want to ask you, how are you doing? 
 
NOELLE MCAFEE, EMORY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: I'm fine. A little shaken up, but fine. I stepped in when I -- I came down to the quad just to see what 
 
 was happening. I was worried that the administration would once again call in the Atlanta P.D., and then a peaceful protest would become mayhem. 
 
CULVER: And it did. 
 
MCAFEE: It was worse. Then the Georgia State Patrol marched in. I watched them march in, and once they took their position, all just attacked the 
 
 students. It was just an attack on the students. And this happened within seconds. I was just there as an observer and saw it right in front of me, 
 
 this young person in the long braids just being on the ground with all these officers pummeling her or them, pummeling. And so --
 
GOLODRYGA: Okay, it appears we have some issues with Nick's audio there with the professor. You're looking at images from last Friday at the 
 
 university, obviously, as we heard now, there isn't a police presence right now, but there is concern that things could continue to escalate, and there 
 
 is additional pressure now from the administration on the school president. 
 
ASHER: In terms of that no confidence vote, Iargely symbolic, but still a vote nonetheless. And you're looking at pictures that came from late last 
 
 week. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, over the weekend, Hamas released a video of two more hostages being held in Gaza. In the video, which CNN is not airing, 
 
 American-Israeli Keith Siegel pleads for Israel's prime minister to negotiate a hostage release deal.
 
One would assume this was clearly under duress, given that he is being held by Hamas. It is the first video released of Siegel since he and his wife 
 
 Aviva were abducted from a kibbutz in southern Israel on October 7th. His wife was released in November as part of a hostage deal.
 
Also appearing in that video is Israeli hostage Omri Miran, who was also abducted by Hamas gunmen on October 7th. Now, the families of both men are 
 
 demanding the Israeli government approve a deal for the return of all hostages.

DANI MIRAN, FATHER OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE OMRI MIRAN (through translator): I'm convinced that all the people of Israel and the nations of the world want 
 
 to see the end of the bloodshed and the end of the suffering of our people. Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and the cabinet, please make any deal, make 
 
 any deal, but every deal is executable. I'm asking you to get a decision now, now, now. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: That was Omri Miran's father. And joining us now is his brother- in-law, Moshe Lavi. And Moshe, our audience obviously recognizes you. You have been with us throughout this crisis over the last six months, pleading 
 
 and making the case for your brother-in-law's release, as well as the release of all the remaining hostages.
 
You and I exchanged messages over the weekend once this video from Hamas was released, showing proof of life -- sign of life. It appears to be very 
 
 recent from your brother-in-law. You've spent time with your sister Lushe there and their two daughters. First, your reaction when you saw this video 
 
 over the weekend. 
 
MOSHE EMILIO LAVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW OF HOSTAGE OMRI MIRAN: Yes, thank you so much for having me again. I just -- I'm at the Hostages and Missing 
 
 Families Forum headquarters right now, just next to the Hostages Square where we held a press conference.
 
The weekend has been very difficult seeing the video. Our family was spread all around, to be honest, because we did not expect a video to be released 
 
 on Saturday evening. I was on my way to the rally. My sister Lushe was on the way to the emergency room because she was feeling unwell. And then the 
 
 video was released and we all returned home to make sure that we congregate together as a family. 
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
It was such a difficult thing to watch because Omri is not -- seen well. His smile is gone. The spark in his eyes is no longer there, but at least 
 
 he's alive. We're trying to focus on that and we're going to focus on that and push our policymakers to understand they need to bring them home alive.
 
ASHER: Yeah, Moshe, as you're speaking, I'm looking at the picture right behind you of Moshe in happier times wearing white. It looks as though he's 
 
 by the water or perhaps on the beach or something. He looks so much happier.
 
And actually, Bianna, my co-anchor, was just showing me a picture of Omri before he was kidnapped. And we compared it side by side during the 
 
 commercial break of what he looked like in that video. And it is shocking. I mean, he barely looks like, if I'm honest with you, the same person. He's 
 
 obviously been through so much. 
 
This is a Hamas propaganda video, right? That is what this is. And that is why CNN isn't airing it. That's why most media outlets aren't airing it at 
 
 this point. But just from your perspective, what good can actually come from the family's perspective, what good can come of this video of Omri 
 
 being shared widely? 
 
LAVI: Yes, like I said on platforms, on social media over the weekend, the content of the video does not matter. The content was dictated by Hamas and 
 
 was forced upon Omri to say, and it's a war crime to force hostages, to hold hostages in the first place, and of course, to use them as a 
 
 propaganda tool. 
 
But what we do want people to take from the video is that two hostages there, Keith Siegel and Omri Miran are alive and that these two hostages, 
 
 alongside 131 other hostages, need to return home to their families. And the fact that they're still alive, that they can still communicate with us, 
 
 that we can still feel them and feel that they're so close and yet so far, requires us to continue and push our policymakers to do everything they can 
 
 to bring them home.
 
And I'm so inspired by my sister and by Dani's father. Both of them spoke in the press conference today. And, you know, from their behavior, from 
 
 their conduct, they always remind me of "Ulysses" poem, the poem "Ulysses" by Tennyson, how they strive to seek to find and not to yield. What they do 
 
 all the time, sense Omri was taken from us. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Such poignant words there. And I'd like to read to our viewers some of what your sister said today. She said, "The sign of life we 
 
 received is a wake-up call to the decision-makers. We are aware that there is a concrete deal on the table. Don't miss another opportunity to bring 
 
 back my Omri and everyone. You owe it to us." 
 
And that's speaking to the Israeli government. Obviously, it takes two sides to agree to a deal, as well. There appears to be one -- another one 
 
 on the table, perhaps fewer hostages released, but nonetheless, that is something as opposed to nothing. Are you optimistic that this time around 
 
 we could finally see another deal? 
 
LAVI: We have no choice but to remain optimistic. I'm a realist as a human being and also from my political kind of outlook, but I have to remain 
 
 optimistic in this specific context because Omri drives strength from our optimism, which is reflected in the advocacy work we do.
 
We know there is a deal on the table. We know, according to Secretary Blinken and the U.K. Foreign Minister Cameron, we know that Hamas needs to 
 
 agree to this deal, that this has been the most generous thing offered to them. And if they know better, they will agree to this and make sure that 
 
 we end the bloodshed and bring home the hostages.
 
But we will continue pushing wherever we need to push, whether in the international community, which while some stood with us since the first 
 
 day, the majority, member states of the U.N., have not stood with us and have not demanded from us to release the hostages immediately and 
 
 unconditionally. 
 
And we continue pushing our government to do all they can to uphold the social contract with us, our citizens, the citizens of the state of Israel, 
 
 and prioritize the sanctifying of life, the sanctity of life, prioritizing that over other objectives they have. And they need to understand that 
 
 while war is the continuation of politics, like Klosovic said, the politics eventually is also the continuation of war. We need to use diplomacy in 
 
 order to solve the crisis. 
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
Otherwise, I don't think we'll be able to remain the same society -- resilient society we were, and face any challenge in the future, because we 
 
 know our enemy and we know ourself. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah.
 
LAVI: But if we don't bring home the hostages, I think we'll know ourself.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, I think you speak for so many thousands of people there in Israel, as we've seen the turnout once again of protests demanding that a 
 
 deal be reached to bring these hostages home. Their families have been protesting. Israelis have been protesting. Your brother-in-law has missed 
 
 so many milestones these last six months. We hope that finally, this deal can be reached. 
 
LAVI: Including his birthday.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, including his birthday and his daughter's first birthday, as well. And you mentioned your sister going to the emergency room. We hope 
 
 she's feeling better, as well. Moshe Lavi, thank you so much for joining us.
 
ASHER: Thank you, Moshe. All right, still to come in Kenya, heavy flooding leads to misery after weeks of devastating rain and deadly flash-flooding. 
 
 We'll take you there live after this short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: Looking at video there, rescue workers in Kenya searching for the missing and the dead after catastrophic floods deluge the country. At 
 
 least 71 people have died and dozens are still missing. Heavy rains have recently inundated large swaths of the country.
 
ASHER: Yeah, dramatic video shows a truck full of people literally trying to cross the river. You can actually, if you look closely in this video, 
 
 you can actually see it. You can hear their screams. I'm not sure if we have audio, but as the truck overturns and gets swept away, there we have 
 
 it, swept away by the raging floodwaters and more devastating images show communities destroyed, cars overturned, my goodness, trees uprooted and 
 
 homes swept away from the mass flooding. 
 
CNN's Larry Madowo is in one of the hardest hit areas in Kenya. So, Larry, my goodness, when you look at this video, it looks almost biblical, right? 
 
 You're seeing cars overturned. You're seeing homes destroyed. I mean, people like digging through the debris, searching for loved ones, 
 
 survivors, belongings. Just set the scene for us in terms of what you have seen in one of the hardest hit areas.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Zain, we've been here all day and the scene has been apocalyptic. It's nightfall now and there's still so many 
 
 people who remain unaccounted for. In this small town of Maimahi, everyone we've spoken to has either lost a family member or they have people that 
 
 remain unaccounted for.
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
Just this evening before nightfall, in an area where they believed that they had already cleared the survivors and pulled out bodies, they heard a 
 
 phone vibrating and they began to dig through it again. And when we left there, they were still trying to just work through the furniture, the 
 
 roofing materials and household items to try and get to the bottom and see if there's somebody in there. 
 
Overall, what happened here last night, flash flooding coming from the hills and just sweeping through everything in its path. It came from a 
 
 blocked tunnel under an old railway line here and that stormwater completely overwhelmed that tunnel, bursting through it and then sweeping 
 
 down for several kilometers in every direction. 
 
There are homes here where there was an entire home, a permanent home, nothing is left except the foundation. There were big SUVs, trucks, even 
 
 one trailer that were flung several hundred meters downstream. So, the governor of Narkuru County here in Kenya telling CNN, 71 people have been 
 
 confirmed dead but she fears that there could be so many more downstream once they come to terms with the full extent of the damage here. 
 
The search and rescue operation will continue tomorrow. This is the worst devastation we've seen since the flooding began in Kenya. The rains began 
 
 in Kenya at the beginning of March. Across the nation before this tragedy, 103 people have been reported dead in different parts of the country. 
 
With these 71, we're getting closer to 200 and when we come back tomorrow, the death toll will suddenly have risen. East Africa have been seeing a 
 
 huge amount of rainfall across the region. Tanzania reported 155 people dead and the Met departments here are reporting, forecasting that there's 
 
 still a lot more rain to come. 
 
Governments here telling people to move to higher ground, not to risk their lives. Here in Kenya, for instance, the government has had to postpone the 
 
 re-opening of schools nationwide for at least a week to avoid endangering the lives of learners. But when you see just so many roads cut off, so many 
 
 rivers bursting their banks, so many people displaced, you see why that was a necessary action. 
 
ASHER: And you know what, Larry, it makes you really nervous about what is coming down the pike for Kenya, not just in terms of this disaster and the 
 
 death toll rising, but when you think about climate change and what it's doing to East Africa, where will we be in five to 10 years from now when 
 
 this sort of climatic event is going to be obviously much more common and much more frequent. Larry Madowo, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
 We'll be right back with more.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:55:08]
 
GOLODRYGA: We've saved some fun news for you, finally, this hour. It's considered to be one of Disney's most successful productions. Yes, it's -- 
 
 talking about the original "Lion King" which was animated and released in 1994. Well, if you're a fan, we've got some really good news for the winter 
 
 holiday season for you. 
 
ASHER: That's exactly right. Today, Disney released the first trailer for "Mufasa: The Lion King". It is the prequel to the 2019 "Lion King" remake 
 
 and follows the story of young Mufasa, Take a look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOICE-OVER: A lion was born without a drop of nobility in his blood. A lion who would change our lives forever. Mufasa.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: I mean, animation and CGI and everything has just gotten so incredible. 
 
ASHER: So much -- it's surreal.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, some big names in showbiz are joining the cast, including Blue Ivy Carter. Of course, that is the firstborn daughter of Jay-Z and 
 
 Beyonce. Beyonce herself reprises her role as the voice of Nala.
 
ASHER: It makes me nostalgic for the 1994 version. I was 10 years old when the 1994 version came out. I loved it so much. Watched it on repeat with my 
 
 sister, but very excited to see what Beyonce does with this. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Nostalgia's good. Maybe we can watch it again this week. Well, that does it for this hour of "One World". Thanks so much for watching. I'm 
 
 Bianna Golodryga.
 
ASHER: And I'm Zain Asher. Amanpour is up next. You're watching CNN.
