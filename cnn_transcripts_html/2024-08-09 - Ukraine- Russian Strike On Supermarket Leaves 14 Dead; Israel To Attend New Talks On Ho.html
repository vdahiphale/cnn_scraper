<br>[12:00:24]
 
ISA SOARES, CNN HOST: Tit for tat Russia responds to massive strikes from Ukraine. ONE WORLD starts right now.
 
A rescue operation is underway. Supermarkets, homes, and a car wash were the targets of Russia's latest air strike. We have the very latest for you.
 
Also ahead, it is official, after a lot of back and forth, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, will debate head-to-head.
 
And then later, imagine making it to the Olympics. Now imagine doing it seven months pregnant. Meet the women competing for two.
 
Well, live from London, I'm Isa Soares. My colleagues, Zain and Bianna are off today. And you, of course, watching ONE WORLD.
 
And we'll begin this hour with Ukraine's shock incursion into Russia.
 
The governor of Lipetsk Region in the western Russian, says the area has been hit by a massive Ukrainian drone attack.
 
The reported strike comes after Moscow accused Ukrainian troops of crossing the border into its Kursk Region, remember, that was on Wednesday.
 
Russian civilians have been fleeing Kursk, as Ukraine's cross-border assault into Russia shows no sign of easing.
 
And Russia's response, well, it's been swift. This dramatic video telling the story, several people have been killed and wounded in a Russian strike 
 
 on a supermarket in Ukraine's Donetsk Region. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says people are still trapped in that rubble.
 
Let's get the very latest. I want to go straight to the Pentagon, CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins me with more.
 
So, Natasha, clearly is we've just outlined the incursion into Russian territory by Ukraine continues, what more can you tell us about this and 
 
 reaction, if any, at this stage from the United States?
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, we really haven't gotten a clear explanation from the Ukrainians about just what the 
 
 goals are of this very significant incursion into the Kursk Region.
 
But U.S. officials, they say, that it is not actually a violation of their support, of course, for the Ukrainians, and that it does not violate any 
 
 kind of policies or your restrictions that the U.S. has placed on the U.S. provided and Western provided weaponry that they have given to the 
 
 Ukrainians.
 
As of right now, the reaction is, look, the Ukrainians have to do what they have to do to try to basically divert Russian resources and take the 
 
 battle, essentially, to the Russians in a way that allows the Ukrainians to then take back their own territory.
 
And so the reaction that we're getting now is a little bit of confusion about what exactly this is trying to achieve, but not necessarily anger 
 
 from the U.S. in a way you might expect, particularly given, you know, all of the warnings from the U.S. over the last two-plus years about the 
 
 possibility that this war could expand, that it could escalate, and that the Russians might see this kind of incursion into their territory as the 
 
 potential -- you know, as the U.S. potentially being involved in this and kind of pushing the Ukrainians to do that.
 
You know, since the policy changed by the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to kind of hit back at Russia right over the border with Ukraine 
 
 and Russia, it seems to be like the U.S. now is acknowledging that in order to fight this war effectively, the Ukrainians have to take these battles 
 
 and these fights into Russian territory itself.
 
And so, well, we haven't yet gotten a full explanation from the Ukrainians about what they're trying to do here. A couple possibilities have emerged, 
 
 of course, including that they are trying to kind of scatter Russian troops along the border, try to divert resources.
 
And, you know, more importantly, perhaps, is the psychological effect, that this might have on residents inside Russia itself. And the idea that now 
 
 Ukraine is basically putting everyone on notice that they are going to be fighting inside Russian territory, something that the residents of Kursk 
 
 Region have made very clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent days, they find pretty terrifying.
 
And they are writing letters and they are saying, look, you might say that the situation here is under control, but it actually is not.
 
SOARES: Yes. Political element also in this potentially that, you know, Ukrainians are showing the world they're still in the fight and potentially 
 
 to embarrass Putin, which clearly we are seeing that is doing that.
 
Natasha, appreciate it. Natasha Bertrand there for us with the very latest.
 
Well, with fears of the wider war growing by the day, Israel says it will attend talks next Thursday aimed at ending the fighting Gaza and freeing 
 
 the remaining Israeli hostages. No word yet if Hamas will attend.
 
Mediators from the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt have pushed for the talks, saying there is no time to waste. Have a listen.

SABRINA SINGH, DEPUTY PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Last week, Secretary Austin bolstered our force posture in the region to improve U.S. force protection, 
 
 increased support for the defense of Israel, and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to a various number of contingencies.
 
The Secretary and the Department remain intently focused on de-escalating tensions in the region and pushing for a ceasefire as part of the hostage 
 
 deal to end the war in Gaza.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[12:05:21]
 
SOARES: Let's get more on all these strands. Our Clarissa Ward joins us now from this story from Israel.
 
And, Clarissa, Hamas, from what I've seen, has not yet responded to that call for negotiations. But also the question is, who would show up for 
 
 Hamas? Who represent Hamas, given that the head of the political wing of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, has just been assassinated?
 
Just talk us through the thinking, the strategy here to try and potentially get a ceasefire and a hostage deal.
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it's pretty telling, Isa, that this is not so much as a call or an invitation to 
 
 attend the ceasefire negotiation talks on August 15th, next Thursday.
 
It's really more of a demand. And it's coming not just from emissaries, but from the actual leaders of Egypt, of the United States, and of Qatar.
 
I think it was really born out of a frantic diplomatic effort to try to avert some kind of a retaliation, principally from Iran, but also 
 
 potentially from Hezbollah.
 
Now, the question is, will it be successful? Who will attend? As you mentioned, Israel has said it is attending. Hamas has yet to respond after 
 
 the assassination of Haniyeh. Yahya Sinwar, one of the architects of the October 7th attacks, who is underground in Gaza, has been announced as the 
 
 head of the political bureau.
 
Now, he has also announced an emissary Khalil al-Hayya to act and attend talks or participate in them.
 
But as I said before, they haven't said defense -- definitively, whether or not they will be attending.
 
And when I talk to analysts and officials across the region, their consensus is that there is still a lot of daylight between the two sides. 
 
 And it is going to be very difficult to try to pull off any ceasefire agreement.
 
We've seen these three countries, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt, trying to head that off by saying, look, let's come up with a bridging agreement to 
 
 try to temporarily at least resolve some of these issues where there is still a huge difference of opinion on the matter.
 
But I would say more broadly, there is not a huge amount of optimism. Many see this as kind of a stalling technique to keep the diplomacy going, to 
 
 keep the urgency going, and in the process, hopefully to avert more escalation in the region, Isa.
 
SOARES: Yes. I think that is one of the concerns that this perhaps is a stalling technique, because as we heard from the Jordanian Foreign Minister 
 
 on CNN, they have been much closer to ceasefire talks and hostage talks and deals prior to this moment.
 
So ceasefire talks then, Clarissa, August 15th, next Thursday.
 
But what are you hearing in the ground as to whether there will be a retaliation, whether it be from Iran, Hezbollah, before then? Because of 
 
 course, as we've said to our viewers, both a promise retaliation.
 
And I've seen that Israel is looking to build a tent city in the south. What more can you tell us about this?
 
WARD: So Iran has been a little bit ambiguous in recent days in its messaging. It appears to be at least giving itself the option that it 
 
 doesn't have to retaliate. Hezbollah has been a bit more definitive and certainly the feeling from Israeli officials has been that they do expect 
 
 Hezbollah to act, but perhaps unilaterally. They expect it to happen in the coming days.
 
Of course, we don't have a crystal ball. Israel is trying to prepare itself. As you mentioned, there are now talks ongoing about finding a place 
 
 to set up a tent city, if thousands of people were to be evacuated from that northern border already, some 90,000 or 60,000, I should say, Israelis 
 
 have been forced to leave their homes. But if that number was to increase, where would they all go? There's talks about putting them in the south.
 
And meanwhile, and crucially, I think, you know, the offensive in Gaza continues to grind on Khan Yunis now, the beleaguered city, there is 
 
 another IDF operation in place.
 
Many people now being forced out of that city. Again, some of them have been displaced four or five times.
 
And, by the way, IDF troops only left Khan Yunis, Isa, on July 30th. So that's really feeding into a broader fear here that Hamas is regrouping 
 
 when the IDF pulls out of these areas.
 
And just one other really sort of shocking statistic that has been put out by the U.N. satellite agency, which has just finished putting together data 
 
 about the amount of destruction in Gaza.
 
And I think it's important for our viewers to hear. In 10 months of fighting in Gaza, the total debris from all the devastation, all the 
 
 strikes, all the destruction is 14 times greater than the combined debris from all conflicts all over the world for the past 16 years.
 <br>[12:10:05]
 
So that really puts into, I think, stark contrast.
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
WARD: -- just how important it is for the people of Gaza, also for the hostage families here in Israel, to try to push that ceasefire across the 
 
 finishing line before this escalates.
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
WARD: But again, not a huge amount of optimism that that is possible right now.
 
SOARES: And some of the images I've seen, just this morning, in fact, out of Gaza, to show you that some parts of Gaza, just a wasteland, a total 
 
 wasteland.
 
Clarissa, appreciate it. Thank you very much.
 
Well, the last time Donald Trump held a campaign rally, his rival Kamala Harris, had no running mate, and there was no debate on the books.
 
A lot of changes you can see just six days. Tim Walz has joined the democratic ticket, and Trump and Harris will now debate on September 10th.
 
That's just 56 days before the election. He heads to Montana for a rally later on today at a rambling, rant-filled news conference on Thursday, if 
 
 we can call it news conference.
 
Mr. Trump responded to questions about his seemingly light campaign duties. He called the question stupid. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why haven't you been campaigning this week?
 
DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Because I'm leading by a lot and because I'm letting their convention go through. And I am campaigning a 
 
 lot. I'm doing tremendous amounts of taping here.
 
We have commercials that are at a level I don't think that anybody's ever done before.
 
I'm speaking to you on phones. I'm speaking to radio. I'm speaking to television. Television's coming over here.
 
Excuse me. What are we doing right now?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: In a quick fact check, he's not leading by a lot. That is important. We've seen the polls.
 
Also, at that news conference, Trump told a story about being in a helicopter during an emergency landing with former San Francisco mayor, 
 
 Willie Brown.
 
Brown says it never happened, but here's how Trump tells it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: I know Willie Brown very well. In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought, maybe this is the end. We were in a helicopter going 
 
 to a certain location together.
 
And there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing. And Willie was -- he was a little concerned.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Well, let's get an update on the campaign. We're joined by Kristen Holmes. Kristen Holmes in Washington.
 
So, Kristen, I mean, that press conference campaign, speech, rally speech, happened roughly in my show yesterday, a whole hour or so. And it was a 
 
 very incoherent rant, let's be honest.
 
But how does the Republican campaign, how do they think he fit?
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it depends on exactly what you mean by how did he do. I mean, the question, of course, 
 
 being, did he answer questions? Yes. Did he speak for more than an hour? Yes. And did he get the message across, which they've been trying to get 
 
 across, that Kamala Harris will not talk to the press, that she won't do a press conference, that she won't sit down for an interview?
 
And if you stand it by all those measures, then, yes, Donald Trump did what his campaign wanted him to do. He did get that message across.
 
However, of course, there are still a lot of questions among Republican allies of what exactly the campaign is doing and what Donald Trump is doing 
 
 now that we are in a very different race.
 
And yesterday, it was actually my question that I asked him about what he was doing with this light campaign schedule. And it wasn't necessarily the 
 
 question that upset him, it was the part of the question that you couldn't hear where I said that allies have concerns that he's not taking this race 
 
 seriously.
 
And that's when he said that it was a stupid question because he doesn't want to hear that people who are close to him have criticism about the 
 
 campaign. But that criticism really still continues because, as you mentioned, he has one rally this week.
 
We have seen Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in every single battleground state. Donald Trump, he's going to Montana, a very red and reliably red state.
 
Now, in his defense, and he defended himself during this press conference for going to Montana, he said he was doing it for the Senate candidate. It 
 
 is the second most expensive Senate race in the country. It is one of the only two Senate races in which the incumbent is a Democrat.
 
In this case, John Tester, and it is a state in which Donald Trump won by a wide margin. So there is a chance he could help the Republican candidate in 
 
 that state. But that doesn't change the part of this that is that he has not been in a battleground state since last Saturday. And we don't expect 
 
 to see him again till possibly next week in one of these public events in a battleground state.
 
Now, I spoke to a number of his campaign advisors yesterday before we actually got to this press conference, and they said that they are still 
 
 optimistic about this race. They say that, yes, Kamala Harris has changed the game in the sense of enthusiasm around the democratic ticket. But at 
 
 the end of the day, when she comes down from what they call a honeymoon phase, it is fundamentally the same race. They believe that it's the same 
 
 race because Biden's policies were unpopular. Polling shows that. They believe they can link Harris to those policies because she is second in 
 
 command.
 <br>[12:15:09]
 
But of course, the question is whether or not this still stands. Our people -- there's -- we're in such unprecedented times right now. Our people going 
 
 to shift because of the policies. Our people just excited that the candidate is not President Joe Biden.
 
There are a lot of unknowns, so yes, they remain cautiously optimistic, but we have a lot of questions as to what this looks like. And one thing is 
 
 very clear. This is a different race, and this is a much closer race now.
 
SOARES: Indeed, we certainly need that debate to happen and there will be time for us to ponder all those questions and find some clarity in those 
 
 answers.
 
Kristen Holmes, appreciate it. Thank you very much.
 
And still to come right here on the show, the fastest man on earth, how now sidelined by COVID. The latest from Paris just ahead.
 
And Botswana celebrates this man for taking home the gold in the 200-meter sprint. CNN goes a one-on-one with the Olympic champion after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOARES: Well, if first night in Paris belonged to sprinter, Letsile Tebogo, Friday belonged to him in Botswana. Tebogo's cold winning performance in 
 
 the men's 200-meter sprint, prompted Botswana's president to declare today a public holiday in his honor.
 
Our Amanda Davies caught up with the Olympic champion.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LETSILE TEBOGO, BOTSWANA 200M SPRINT GOLD MEDAL WINNER: I feel energized. I feel born again. I feel everything is just all new to me, even though we 
 
 didn't have some rest last night because I think I went to sleep around 4 A.M.
 
It was more of an emotional day yesterday. I didn't show it to the -- to the camera. I didn't show it to the people.
 
But when I immediately went, I got into my room. I started to become emotional. And then just -- so what I've been through and made it into the 
 
 global stages, the biggest achievement ever. 
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: You've spoken about the importance of your mom and how tough it has been for you since her passing in May. I know 
 
 you paid tribute to her with your spikes last night.
 
TEBOGO: Yes. I did pay tribute to her last night with the -- with the spikes. And it meant a lot for me because I knew that I had to carry her 
 
 with me because she's been the backbone of me since day one. She's been there through thick and thin that I went through. So I had to carry her 
 
 with me.
 <br>[12:20:13]
 
And even though we're not sure if we're going to medal, but I just had to - - even on the 1-- on the 100 meter final, this is the same spike that I wore.
 
DAVIES: What do you think she would have said to you last night?
 
TEBOGO: Me knowing her, she wouldn't -- she wouldn't say a word. She would just cry it out and then we'll just talk it when we get home, when the dust 
 
 has settled.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Well, American sprinter, meantime, Noah Lyles, fell short of the sprint double after testing positive for COVID.
 
In the highly anticipated men's 200-meter sprint, Liles was bested by Botswana. You just heard there, Letsile Tebogo. But the American didn't go 
 
 home empty-handed. He took home the bronze, of course, with news then emerging he was suffering from COVID.
 
Team USA teammate and gold medalist, Quincy Hall, had this to say about Lyles' diagnosis. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUINCY HALL, TEAM USA 400M GOLD MEDAL WINNER: I've seen him leave the village like maybe a couple of days ago. So I knew something was off. I 
 
 didn't know he had COVID, but I knew something was off.
 
But for him, they'd be out there still compete and take a bronze medal as a show that he doesn't give up. He's a dog too.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Free fighter indeed.
 
CNN's World Sport, Coy Wire, joins me from Paris with more.
 
Coy, great to see you. It just wasn't to be, was it, for sprinter, Noah Lyles, in the 200-meter sprint? Do we know how he's doing at all, Coy?
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes, Isa. Good to see you too.
 
Lyles said that he believes his Olympics are over. It looks like we will not see him in the 4-by-100 relay final tonight.
 
But we may see him again, Isa. The medal ceremony for that 200-meters is tonight. And I just spoke to the head of Team USA Communications who told 
 
 me Lyles is invited to attend to receive his medal tonight. If he does, he'd be wearing a mask.
 
Also, she added that Lyles demanded that if he goes to make sure that whomever hands him, the medal is comfortable doing so.
 
Team USA's Tara Davis-Woodhall won gold in the long jump. Last night, she was seen celebrating with her husband, Hunter Woodhall, afterwards. He's 
 
 going to be competing in the Paralympics here in Paris.
 
Tara said it's been a long journey to get to this moment. And I caught up with her just moments ago to ask about it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TARA DAVIS-WOODHALL, LONG JUMP GOLD MEDALIST: I think my bottom was COVID when I couldn't compete and share what I love to do with the world.
 
And I didn't know who I was as a person besides a track athlete. So I had to find myself and finding myself, you know, met, you know, where are we? 
 
 Who are we?
 
And now I can just show the world who I am. And I get to deal with the smile on my face now.
 
WIRE: Yes, big old smile. I bet that will never come off.
 
DAVIS-WOODHALL: Never.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: All right. Finally, excitement is building for a huge men's hoops game tomorrow, Isa. Team USA, host nation France, in the gold medal game.
 
The U.S. has star-studded NBA legends lineup, barely squeaked by Serbia in the final minutes of the semifinal. Now they take on French phenom, Victor 
 
 Wembanyama, the NBA's rookie of the year. They have future Hall of Famer, Rudy Gobert. Bercy Arena will be rocking, Isa.
 
Full of French fanatics as the U.S. looks to claim a fifth straight Olympic gold.
 
SOARES: I can't wait to see. Look, you've had a tough gig, I have to say. This is a tough assignment you have. I feel for you, Coy. You must be 
 
 exhausted.
 
WIRE: I'm going to be all right.
 
SOARES: Just what has been -- you're going to be all right. I'm glad. I'm glad.
 
What is -- just talk us through, what has been your favorite moment? Because there have been so many in this Olympic. Team and I were talking 
 
 about this earlier.
 
WIRE: Gosh. There's so many. You go from the Simone Biles and the Katie Ledeckys.
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
WIRE: And then -- but it's usually the next thing. And right now, happening right now is the breaking competition. Break dancing in the Olympics. 
 
 They're out there. The beat boys, beat girls, they're popping and locking.
 
Oh, it is the party is really jumping here in Paris now.
 
SOARES: How do they judge that? How -- can I ask? How do they judge that?
 
WIRE: To put it simply for you, think of the floor routine in gymnastics. You have your judges.
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
WIRE: You have your level of difficulty and you go out there and pick the music, whatever you want to rock to and you just let it fly.
 
SOARES: I can't wait to see it. You did a really good impression of it, Coy. You have -- you have -- you have a potential there. Have potential 
 
 there.
 
Coy Wire, great to see you, my friend. Thanks very much.
 
WIRE: You too. Thanks.
 
SOARES: Well, let's talk further about some of those big moments in Paris. You could hear Coy. You couldn't pick one. There's so many.
 
Professor Jules Boykoff teaches about politics and sport at Pacific University in Oregon. He's also authored five books on the Olympics. Jules, 
 
 welcome to the show.
 
I mean, you know, we -- I can talk about myself particularly. I have been pretty much hooked on these Olympics. I'm not sure if it's because we -- I 
 
 needed some levity outside of the trouble news cycle we have.
 
But just the performances, the stunning Parisian backdrops, the records being broken, how do you assess these Olympics? How does it compare to 
 
 previous ones?
 <br>[12:25:05]
 
JULES BOYKOFF, PROFESSOR, PACIFIC UNIVERSITY: Well, I've attended numerous Olympics. I've lived in numerous Olympic cities like Rio de Janeiro, ahead 
 
 of those Olympics in London, ahead of those, and during those.
 
So, you know, I have had my fair share of Olympic cities. And on one hand, people have really gotten in the spirit here. Everywhere you go, you see 
 
 posters of Victor Wembanyama, you see Leon Marchand, the great swimmer from France, who's done so well in these Olympic Games.
 
You know, on the other hand, there's been real concern around issues of displacement of local populations, migrant, non-house people, as well as 
 
 surveillance and policing that has really ramped up here.
 
And so, for the thinking sports fan who loves celebrating the athletes, but also cares about justice, there's a lot to think about.
 
SOARES: Let's talk about one of the controversies that's probably the most well-known for any of us following the Olympics. And that came as a result, 
 
 Jules, of this boxing match, right? Between Algeria's Imane Khalif and Italy's Angela Carini.
 
How do you think that was handled?
 
BOYKOFF: Well, for starters, Imane Khelif has been wronged. She has had a wonderful boxing tournament, just been a superstar and shown incredible 
 
 focus with all the hubbub around her.
 
Her situation has been weaponized by people who do not have good faith arguments to make. 
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
BOYKOFF: And she is a woman. Let's be absolutely clear. She is not trans. She is not non-binary. She is a woman and has been her entire life.
 
And, you know, the focus on the issue of boxing, like she has done, has been just so impressive here. This has been totally weaponized across the 
 
 world, but certainly in the United States.
 
But anyway, you slice it, the people that are weaponizing it are not using actual evidence. The International Boxing Association, the group that said 
 
 that there was some issue here with this boxer in regards to chromosomes, has issued no actual reports to the public.
 
And let me tell you, they are shady. They are not to be believed. They have a very strong links to the Kremlin. And I don't believe a word that they 
 
 say to be perfectly honest.
 
So I'm rooting for Khelif in the final -- 
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
BOYKOFF: -- in boxing. And let's take it all the way.
 
SOARES: So unfair to both those women, of course.
 
Let's talk about the other concern that we have certainly mentioned on this show. And that's concerns over the River Seine's water quality, especially 
 
 after several Olympic triathletes fell ill. Although I have to say in the last 24 hours, we heard one of those didn't contract E. coli.
 
How do you think the French handled this?
 
BOYKOFF: Well, you know, the Olympics have a slogan that athletes are first, but I think with this issue, they've come closer to last.
 
And quite honestly, they've put athletes' safety in jeopardy in order to host this event along the water.
 
While here in Paris, I've interviewed people from the Surfrider Foundation, who have been doing testing on the water in the Seine for a long time. 
 
 They've had serious concerns.
 
But let's face it, they've only been testing for two bacteria. Whereas in reality, we don't even know the other toxins, like pesticides, 
 
 pharmaceutical runoff, and so on that are in that river.
 
So, you know, I think personally, they've put athletes' safety at real jeopardy here. And I think it's time to hit the pause button and really 
 
 think about ways of doing better in the future.
 
SOARES: Let's focus on then on some of the more viral moments, I think, is fair to say, some that are caught our eyes on social media. You might have 
 
 seen it. And one of those moments was this gentleman here.
 
That's the Turkish pistol shooter, Yusuf Dikec, who became, I think it's fair to say, a social media sensation, right? Thanks to what was a very 
 
 relaxed demeanor. I think he got a silver medal.
 
What did you make of that moment, just this casual manner on the whole?
 
BOYKOFF: I absolutely loved it. You know, I love these lesser-known athletes that the world comes to embrace on the world stage.
 
The guy who started the Olympics, a Frenchman named, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, he had a slogan. It was the important thing in the Olympic Games 
 
 is not to win, but to take part.
 
And I feel like there's some athletes who've really embodied that here. You know, I was at track and field the other night, and I saw Layla Almasri 
 
 from Palestine, run the 800.
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
BOYKOFF: Did she get first? No, but she actually finished. And she set a record for Palestine and under obviously difficult conditions.
 
I watched the 5,000 where you had Ankita Dhyani running from India. She was lapped by the other runners in the 5,000.
 
But when she crossed that finish line, the fans, myself included, were cheering for her as if she'd won the race.
 
So, you know, the Olympics tend to bring out the best in athletes and certainly the crowds that are in the venues.
 
SOARES: What was your favorite moment then, Jules? What was your favorite moments?
 
BOYKOFF: In terms of sport, I have to say -- 
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
BOYKOFF: I've had a lot of them, but, you know, I was at Rugby Sevens early on in the competition. And Argentina was playing against Kenya.
 
And as you'll know, Argentina was recently in a bit of a kerfuffle because some of its footballers were caught on tape singing a racist song about 
 
 players from France.
 
The French fans totally got behind Kenya and they just chanted Kenya, Kenya, the entire match. And you would have thought it was a home match for 
 
 Kenya.
 <br>[12:30:04]
 
So, you know, it's impossible. I know I'm a political scientist, but it's impossible to get away from politics. And some of my favorites have been 
 
 when fans recognize the politics and have a little bit of fun with it.
 
SOARES: Yes. And actually, I want to show a view as just one of my favorite moments, the moment of two U.S. athletes, if you remember, when the 
 
 Brazilian, Rebeca Andrade, was in the middle, she won a gold and the two U.S. athletes there, Simone Biles, including, bowing down to them, 
 
 saluting. It's a remarkable moment, of course, of sportswomanship and having, of course, three podium of all black Olympians. Really remarkable 
 
 indeed.
 
Appreciate it, Jules Boykoff. Thanks very much for taking the time to speak to us.
 
BOYKOFF: Thank you.
 
SOARES: Now, one of the challenges the next U.S. president will face will be the Israel-Hamas war. How will the winner handle the conflict? We'll 
 
 take a closer look after this break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOARES: Welcome back to ONE WORLD, I'm Isa Soares.
 
Kamala Harris has been clear about where she stands on most issues, but one issue as her walking a political tightrope. We are talking about the 
 
 Israel-Hamas war.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that, otherwise, I'm speaking.
 
(CROWD CHEERING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Well, that was after pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted Harris at a Wednesday rally in Detroit. It highlights really the complex dynamics 
 
 of the Israel-Hamas war, on both a diplomatic as well as a political level.
 <br>[12:35:09]
 
The war is a key issue for progressive and young voters, especially in places like Michigan, a battleground state with a large Arab and Muslim 
 
 population.
 
And that population has been vocal about not being happy with the position on Israel coming from the Biden White House.
 
Well, time now for The Exchange in my conversation, Nada Al-Hanooti. She's a community organizer helping to politically empower Muslim and people of 
 
 color in the community with a group Emgage. Nada, welcome to the show.
 
Let me just pick up with that little clip that we just play there from Michigan from Kamala Harris. In your view, in your opinion, did she read 
 
 the room, the space well? Did she get the tone right?
 
NADA AL-HANOOTI, NATIONAL DEPUTY ORGANIZING DIRECTOR, EMGAGE: Yes. Thank you so much for having me.
 
I would say, unfortunately, she did not. You know, she's coming to -- she's coming to a state where it's not only a battleground state, but it is Arab 
 
 America. It does have a large population of Muslim-Americans.
 
And those protesters actually came in because they do not want to Trump presidency. They came in to shift her -- to help shift her on Gaza policy, 
 
 right? And then her reaction was, if you want Trump to keep speaking, that's actually very divisive and very harmful because they are therefore 
 
 the exact opposite.
 
They want her to be better on Palestine. They do not want a Trump presidency. And they're all quite frankly sick of their family members 
 
 being slaughtered overseas with our tax money. So it was very disappointing.
 
And what is also very disheartening is that we saw Kamala on a good trajectory, right? We saw we were very pleased to see that she refused to 
 
 attend the Netanyahu address, right? We were very pleased to see that she was more sympathetic with her language towards Palestinians and even with 
 
 her pick with Tim Walz.
 
But this was definitely a bad a step in the wrong directions for Michigan voters or Michigan voters who are quite frankly grieving and just simply 
 
 trying to pressure on her to be better with Gaza policy.
 
And let's be frank, you know, protesting the most American thing that anyone could do.
 
SOARES: And we have heard, Nada, and seen really how energized the Democratic Party has been, you know, with Kamala and Walz, as a Democratic 
 
 ticket. And this has been reflected, of course, in the polls.
 
I think it just run -- get my producer to bring it up to really show how far they've come along, as you can see there. But when it comes to the Gaza 
 
 humanitarian crisis and the war, of course, has dragged on for months killing roughly 40,000 people.
 
I want to hear from you. I mean, how do Palestinian Americans, Arab- Americans feel? How do they feel about this ticket, the Kamala Harris and the Tim Walz ticket?
 
AL-HANOOTI: No. That's a great question. So, you know, their American community and a lot of our progressives really did get excited when we saw 
 
 Biden stepped down, right? We saw this is an opportunity to open dialogue with the Harris administration.
 
But we all know the fact is that voters vote with their heart. And right now, Arab-American and Muslim voters are heartbroken.
 
And a lot of them, you know, my own community members here in Dearborn, Michigan, have lost upward 100 plus family members in Gaza, right? And it's 
 
 very hard for them to comprehend a reality that is worse than that.
 
So what we want right now is, again, we do not want a Trump presidency. But what we want is more. We want the Harris administration to be more 
 
 intentional about speaking to the Arab-American community.
 
And we want more empathy with her and she needs to be prepared to listen because right now, we're grieving. And a lot of our community members, 
 
 again, it's very hard for them to see past their pain. It's very hard for them to see a reality that is worse than that.
 
So when we have the Democratic Party saying, hey, it's going to get worse under Trump. No, we need you -- 
 
SOARES: Yes.
 
AL-HANOOTI: -- to come to us. And we are values-based voters, right? We need to know that VP Harris sure will share our values of a ceasefire.
 
We'll see -- we'll share our values for human rights and share our values for Palestinian self-determination.
 
SOARES: So given this then, I mean, I wonder, Nada, how the outreach has been from the campaign and how important that is right now.
 
I just want to, in fact, for you to listen to Michigan, what Michigan Representative Debbie Dingell told my colleague, Kasie Hunt. Have a listen 
 
 to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): I think they want to see and understand that she cares and what her (INAUDIBLE) strategy is going to be.
 
And she's walking a very delicate line here. But I do believe that her understanding of this community and reach out is critical.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: So reach out is critical. Speak to that. Speak to that because I do wonder if you're not hearing clarity, voters in Michigan elsewhere, Arab-
 
 American, Muslim-Americans are not getting clarity on policies where she stands. Then how would they vote or will they not vote at all?
 <br>[12:40:06]
 
AL-HANOOTI: Right now, we're having a lot of people saying, they're going to vote for their conscience and they're going to vote for third-party. 
 
 But, again, we can't -- we can't help but emphasize, it's not too late for Kamala to do the right thing.
 
And one message we have for her campaign, and for the Democratic Party, is that you cannot win without the Muslim vote. We proved that in 2020 when we 
 
 had 145,000 Michigan Muslims go out to vote and Biden won by 155,000 votes.
 
So caring about Gaza is not only the right thing to do for folks abroad for your Muslim sisters and brothers, and Palestinian Arab sisters and 
 
 brothers, domestically, but it's so vital for our American democracy.
 
It's so important to ensure that we don't have a Trump presidency. I cannot emphasize to you enough how much it's how important it is for her to care 
 
 about this policy item and to communicate and have those open conversations with our Muslim communities here in Michigan.
 
SOARES: Nada Al-Hanooti. Really appreciate, Nada, you're taking the time to speak to us here on the show. Thank you very much.
 
AL-HANOOTI: Thank you for having me.
 
SOARES: Pleasure.
 
And still to come right here, Haiti has been torn apart by gang violence for years. CNN goes on patrol with Kenyan forces working to tackle the 
 
 violence. That is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOARES: Well, Haiti has been torn apart by gang violence for years. But earlier this year, this fighting and arrest escalating, remember, causing a 
 
 humanitarian crisis.
 
Now, the weary population is hoping the development of Kenya forces to try to re-tackle the violence will lead to some peace.
 
Our Larry Madowo traveled to the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(GUNSHOTS)
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Gun battles rage on the street outside one of Haiti's biggest hospitals.
 
Kenyan police here to help local forces take back the capital from the gangs.
 
The first 400 officers from Nairobi quickly learning how volatile Port-au- Prince can be.
 
Minutes earlier, CNN was touring what is left of the hospital after gangs trashed it.
 
The country's interim prime minister telling us it was just reclaimed.
 
GARRY CONILLE, INTERIM HAITIAN PRIME MINISTER: There is no tactical or strategic value for the gangs taking over this. This is really just about, 
 
 you know, completely discrediting the state.
 
MADOWO: Is enough funding coming through for the multinational security support mission here?
 
CONILLE: Unfortunately, not enough and not quickly enough. Now, we understand there are a lot of emergencies going on out now. And we 
 
 understand there is, just to sort of make sense, some Haiti fatigue. The good news is that there is hope.
 
MADOWO: Midway through the interview, shots ring out.
 
CONILLE: This was huge.
 
MADOWO: The security detail springs into action.
 
We have been told we have to leave now. We've had shots in the air. The gangs are getting closer.
 <br>[12:45:02]
 
The prime minister and our team are rushed away.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go, go, go.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got your microphone.
 
MADOWO: The constant menace of gang violence dominating life here, even for the country's leader.
 
As night falls, we head out on patrol with Kenya's elite police forces who have been brought in to help turn things around.
 
They're using four of these American-supplied MRAPs, or tactical vehicles, and we're going to patrol from the airport, which used to be under gang 
 
 control until very recently, into the downtown area, which is still contested.
 
CNN was granted exclusive access to film the Kenyan's leading and international security force that is expected to brought the 2,500 officers 
 
 from 12 countries funded mainly by the United States.
 
Haitian police lead the way as the convoy scan surrounding buildings for any suspicious activity.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh.
 
MADOWO: We soon come under fire. Dozens of bullets hit the vehicles.
 
The officers are very casual about it. They're calling it rain. I guess they're used to it. This -- we're hearing a few more from this side of the 
 
 truck.
 
Some of these men in Haiti say they have fought Al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists on the Kenya-Somalia border.
 
Do you think you guys can bring peace here?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have a lot of confidence that we are going to win this battle.
 
MADOWO: More gunshots as we turn back, but the police decide not to engage.
 
Back at headquarters, the damage from the night becomes clear.
 
With 85 percent of Port-au-Prince under gang control, civilians here are paying a heavy price.
 
This is one of the few operational hospitals in the capital, located in the city's red zone and surrounded by gang territory.
 
22-year-old Neftely Marti (ph) has brought her malnourished baby in for treatment.
 
She was raped by a gang member. She told me and has had to flee her home because of the violence.
 
The hospital lost half of its staff last year. Those remaining are determined not to give up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have to fight back.
 
MADOWO: You can't leave it for the gang members.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have to leave it for the gang. Someone has to fight back. Someone have to stand up.
 
MADOWO: With an estimated 2 million Haitians living in fear of being raped or killed in their homes, fighting back against the gangs is now an 
 
 international effort.
 
Haitian forces and their allies need resources, but leaders here tell us funding and equipment are not arriving fast enough.
 
GODFREY OTUNGE, COMMANDER, MULTINATIONAL SECURITY SUPPORT MISSION HAITI: It's a matter of support. If they can be given the equipment that they 
 
 need, these are the brave and courageous people.
 
MADOWO: Through it all, this weary nation still has high hopes for peace.
 
Larry Madowo, CNN, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:50:32]
 
SOARES: Well, people in Denmark are celebrating the return of ramen noodles that were banned for being too spicy. Stores pulled three varieties of the 
 
 South Korean ramen brand in June after the Danish government claimed that the noodles posed a serious health risk.
 
The banned was aimed at children who were challenging each other on social media to eat the ramen.
 
But tests found that the noodles do not exceed a critical spice level.
 
To celebrate that reversal, the company took a victory lap while literally with social media influencers through Copenhagen Harbor.
 
And it looks like a cross between ballet and gymnastics and mostly performed underwater. Artistic swimming, of course, or synchronized 
 
 swimming, as it's been called until 2017, part of me, is one of the Olympic's toughest sports, as you all know.
 
And all that gracefulness comes at a price, as we hear from two members of Team GB. Have a listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the public have quite a skewed perception in the sport because everyone thinks it's flower caps and side dives -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- into the pool, but it's really not that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have to be good at swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics. It's really, really hard. And we have to make it look nice. 
 
 Like, we're not in pain, and the smile definitely is fake at the end of the day.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our sport is quite different to a lot of the other sports because there is that artistic side to it.
 
But at the same time, it doesn't take away how hard the sport is. So it's just the cherry on top of the performance.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's just like a nice feeling to know that we're carrying on those roots of, yes, legacy right from hundreds of years ago.
 
YASMINE JAHANMIR, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA: There's very much this theatrical lineage written into the scorebook of artistic 
 
 swimming. That's what makes it so cool.
 
Our first recorded mention is in the ancient Roman times and they would do performance naval battles.
 
We also see a lot of artistic swimming in theater in the 18 and 1900s. And this is a moment in which we see really the performance elements starting.
 
Our first key figure in artistic swimming is Annette Kellerman, an Australian long distance swimmer who made a series of silent films.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's Esther Williams day at Atlantic City, the aqua beauty arrives.
 
JAHANMIR: Esther Williams is the biggest moment in the public knowing about synchronized swimming because she did 22 aqua musicals between 1944 and the 
 
 mid-50s.
 
And almost everyone, even to this day, knows who Esther Williams is.
 
I think, recently, we're seeing a resurgence of it because it's nostalgic. It invites us to think about femininity and the strength of femininity in a 
 
 different way.
 
And Beyonce borrows this in her music film, Black is King.
 
(MUSIC)
 
JAHANMIR: They had been pushing for it to become an Olympic sport sort of since the '50s and '60s.
 
And in 1984, it was finally included in the Olympics.
 
The major differences between synchronized swimming as a sport and as a performance activity is that the sport is much more difficult and much more 
 
 technical.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have three categories for the scoring, difficulty, artistic impression and execution. Difficulty, depending on which moves you 
 
 execute.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Artistic impression is how well you can move to the music and then judges are marking how you're executing the move. And then 
 
 trying to hold your breath as well, but it is really, really hard.
 
JAHANMIR: They actually prize effortlessness. And I think that that comes from its performance background.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's just such a beautiful sport, honestly.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Like, I think that athletes all really put their heart into each performance. And I hope that comes across and hopefully it 
 
 carries on.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: And in case you are wondering, because I'm sure you are, what product is used to slip back the artistic swimmer's hair so it doesn't 
 
 actually move in the pool, the answer is gelatin. Gelatin powder and water mixed together. It seems like it might be a while to take quite a bit to 
 
 wash it out, but it keeps the hair in place. I could definitely do with all my baby hairs. I can tell you that much.
 
Well, two Olympians are sending a clear message at the 2024 Olympics. That women can do anything, an Egyptian fencer and a Azerbaijani archer, both 
 
 competed at the game's while pregnant, both women proving how strong you can be. Always go for your goals.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NADA HAFEZ, EGYPTIAN FENCER, COMPETED WHILE SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT: Actually, the first message, it was for myself even too, that I can achieve 
 
 a lot. And even if I have doubts, even -- no matter the challenges that I can achieve a lot.
 <br>[12:55:01]
 
This -- the other messages for my baby, I was really proud. The pride was also for my baby that we could achieve something together.
 
It's a good feeling. It's really a good feeling. I can't even express it. So it's a -- it's a message for my baby that with determination and with 
 
 hard work, you can do whatever you want and you can achieve your dream.
 
And the message for the -- for all women that we are strong and our bodies can surprise us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Hear, hear.
 
Well, athletes with children have been supported at the Paris Games by Olympic First, a nursery on site at the village so parents can balance 
 
 competition and as well spending quality time with their young children.
 
And that does it for this hour of ONE WORLD. I am Isa Soares. We're back in about an hour or so in my show, "ISA SOARES TONIGHT."
 
For now though, "AMANPOUR" is up next. See you in an hour or so.
