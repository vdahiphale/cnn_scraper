RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. And thanks for joining me. I'm Rahel Solomon, in today for Fredricka Whitfield. 
 
Any moment now, President Biden and the first lady are set to depart the White House. They're going to have a full day visiting areas of northwest Florida that were hit by Category 3 Hurricane Idalia last Wednesday. 
 
They'll be taking an aerial helicopter tour and meeting with residents impacted by those flash floods and powerful winds. Aerials like Suwannee County which was included in the president's disaster declaration. Residents there will have to federal funding. 
 
President Biden is calling on Congress for additional money to replenish FEMA's disaster relief fund and as costs mount from natural disasters from Florida to Hawaii.
 
CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Live Oak where we expect to see the president and first lady Jill Biden in just a couple of hours. Isabel, good morning. 
 
So the people that you have been speaking to in Suwannee County, I mean what do they tell you is their greatest need right now? 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rahel, good morning to you. 
 
They're telling me that power is a huge concern. Now, in this area of the Big Bend Live Oak, Suwannee County, it wasn't necessarily the rain fall or the storm surge that was an issue, it was actually the wind. Peak winds reading at 62 miles per hour at a nearby airport. 
 
That's enough to knock out the electricity and that's exactly what we saw according to PowerOutage.us. Right now 62 percent of households here in Suwannee County have no electricity. 
 
With the heat index of 97 today, no power, means no AC, that's a big, big concern. But they are getting some local help here. 
 
Take a look right this way. This is the Florida State Guardsmen, that newly activated force designed to alleviate the pressures on the National Guardsmen. 
 
They're helping them stay comfortable. You can see this line of cars, they're opening up their trunks and they're getting here cases of water put into their cars, also meals ready to eat. That blue, I don't know if you can see it over there, that's tarping to help out with the recovery efforts of their homes. And then at the end of this line they get packed with some ice to help with that heat. 
 
Here's what residents have told me they're confronting. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCARTHUR LINTON, SUWANNEE COUNTY RESIDENT: Dollar wise, you probably can't put a price on it, there's so much damage. It's probably somebody will have to come in here and probably put a price on the damage that was done in Suwannee County. This never been before. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: Yes. And here in about two hours President Biden, Jill Biden, and along with FEMA administer Deanne Criswell -- they're going to do an aerial tour. 
 
So from up above they're going to see the extent of the damage as they make their way over to here Live Oak. There, they will meet with survivors. They're going to thank personnel, first responders for how they responded to this hurricane, and their continuous help in these communities, helping them to recover as well, Rahel. 
 
SOLOMON: Isabel, the pictures are just stunning. Homes completely leveled in some parts there. 
 
Isabel Rosales, we'll check back with you throughout the show. Thank you, Isabel. 
 
And now to the huge travel crush across the U.S. Millions of Americans are taking to the roads and skies this Labor Day weekend. 
 
Pete Muntean has more on what to expect. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: It is a climactic end to a record-breaking summer of travel with a new survey saying more than half of all Americans expect to travel for Labor Day. 
 
At Chicago O'Hare, officials are bracing for a 7 percent increase in passengers compared to the holiday weekend last year. The TSA says after this weekend, this summer will set a new air travel record with more than 227 million people screened at airports since Memorial Day. 
 
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says flight cancellations are going down. But the latest numbers from Flight Aware show it is delays that have increased. 
 
This summer, more than 25 percent of flights arrived late by an average of 57 minutes. 
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: This year we have seen significant improvement. That doesn't mean that the system was immune from some tough travel days this year and this summer. 
 <br>[11:04:45]
 
MUNTEAN: AAA says even still, travelers remain undaunted, booking 4 percent more domestic trips compared to last Labor Day weekend and 44 percent more international trips with destinations like Vancouver, Rome and London topping the list. 
 
SCOTT KEYES, FOUNDER OF SCOTT'S CHEAP FLIGHTS: You are seeing flights and trips over to Europe and down to Latin America booming right now with numbers that are significantly higher than what we saw pre- pandemic. 
 
MUNTEAN: The crowds also stretched to the roads. AAA forecast that popular routes, like Palm Springs to San Diego and the Jersey Shore to Manhattan will hit peak congestion on Monday. Before this weekend, the average price for a gallon of regular gas flirted with a seasonal record set back in 2012. 
 
KATRINA SEAL, TRAVELER: Like everything else it just keeps going up. It's why I'm meeting my family halfway. I have driven all the way down to Baltimore and back.
 
DEBBIE MOORFOOT, TRAVELER: We knew they were going to go up. We knew it. So we filled up before we left Jersey. 
 
MUNTEAN: The TSA says Friday will go down as the busiest day for air travel over the holiday weekend but that is only the start. The agency says it will screen a total of 14 million people through Wednesday. 
 
Pete Muntean, CNN -- Reagan National Airport. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOLOMON: And another thing going up is temperatures. Labor Day weekend may mark the unofficial end of summer but in much of the country, the weather is anything like Fall. Another heat wave is expected to shatter temperature records across the U.S. into early next week.
 
Let's go to CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. She is in the CNN Weather Center. 
 
And Allison, we were just talking to Isabel in Florida and she was saying that the heat there for a lot of folks is pretty intense. 
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, which is unfortunate because you still have so many people without power, which means without air conditioning. And those heat index levels are in the upper 90s to even triple digits. And yes, you're going to continue to see that heat build across the
 
 center of the country and spread east as we go through the weekend. 
 
The only cool spot is really going to be out to the west. But in turn it's because you've got a lot of shower and 0thunderstorm chances. 
 
This is video from yesterday in Las Vegas. Cars trapped on flooded roadways, some water and basically mud flowing all down with it. 
 
Now, we do anticipate some more rain today, which is the last thing they need. Look at some of these totals, two and three inches across not just portions of Nevada, but also Arizona yesterday. Both of those states expected to get a few more showers in the forecast today, but it also is going to spread farther to the north.
 
So you're going to also see places like Utah, Idaho and Oregon also start to get some more of that moisture as we go through the afternoon and into the evening hours as well. 
 
But the heat is going to be the big concern for today. Look at this -- Omaha, Wichita, even Chicago all looking at temperatures the next few days into the 90s. 
 
Minneapolis, topping out at triple digits tomorrow. If they do that, it will only be the second time in recorded history in the month of September having those temperatures into the triple digits. Likely to break a record, and it's going to be one of over 100 records broken either today, tomorrow or through the day on Monday.
 
That heat will continue to spread over into the northeast and the mid- Atlantic by the time we get to Sunday and Monday. 
 
So, again, starting to see a lot of those numbers tick up. Take Washington, D.C., for example, high of only 85 today, not too bad. 90 starting tomorrow and then looking at triple digits by the time we get to Tuesday. Things don't really cool back down until we get to next weekend. So again, that heat really lingering across some areas. 
 
Now if you have some plans for the beach today or even tomorrow, keep in mind that these areas you see here in pink have the potential for some rip currents, mainly focused for today. That doesn't mean you can't go to the beach. It just means to be a little more cautious when you are out there and pay attention to any warnings that may be. 
 
Also keeping an eye on the very active tropics, Rahel, although it is that time of year again. 
 
SOLOMON: It sure is. But Allison, I was thinking that maybe Fall was here because here in New York it had started to get chilly. But apparently not yet. Apparently summer is not done with us yet. 
 
CHINCHAR: We have a few more days, yes. 
 
SOLOMON: Ok. Allison, thank you. We'll check back with you later. 
 
CHINCHAR: Thanks. Well, fans of singer Jimmy Buffett are in mourning today following the death of the legendary "Margaritaville" singer. 
 
(MUSIC) 
 
SOLOMON: A statement on his Web site says that Buffett died peacefully at home surrounded by friends, family and music. He was 76. 
 
The statement went on to say "He lived his life like a song until the very last breath, and will be missed beyond measure by so many." 
 
CNN's Stephanie Elam looks back at his enormously successful career both as a performer and a businessman. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(MUSIC) 
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jimmy Buffett's laid-back songs captured the feel of lazy days in paradise.
 
(MUSIC)
 
ELAM: Some called his signature sound Gulf and Western, a mix of country and Caribbean music.
 
JIMMY BUFFETT, SINGER: I love the Caribbean through a sort of a strange way. My grandfather was a sailing ship captain, and he sang the Calypso songs. 
 
So, all this sort of amalgamation of material came in and came back out. And I learned to be a performer, and that gave me the vehicle to do it.
 <br>[11:09:58]
 
ELAM: Buffett was born Christmas Day, 1946 on the Gulf Coast in southern Mississippi and raised in the port city of Mobile, Alabama. 
 
He began his career making country music, but only really found his musical voice after moving to Key West in the 70s.
 
(MUSIC) 
 
ELAM: His time among the colorful characters there helped inspire his tropical style and eventually led to his landmark 1977 album, "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes" and its famous hit song, "Margaritaville."
 
(MUSIC)
 
ELAM: But Buffett's greatest musical success was on the concert stage, not the charts. He made hundreds of millions of dollars touring over the decades, supported by his legion of diehard fans known as Parrot Heads.
 
BUFFETT: The audiences was just so much fun for me to look at. I mean, they're as entertaining to me as I hope I am to them.
 
ELAM: His music may have been laid back, but Buffett brought so much energy to his life. He piloted airplanes, wrote bestselling books, raised funds for Democratic candidates and amassed a fortune estimated at $1 billion through his Margaritaville lifestyle brand, which included restaurants, hotels, resorts, and casinos.
 
Like his music, it was all geared toward capturing the magic of the tropical places Buffett loved best.
 
BUFFETT: From New Orleans to the Gulf Coast, to down into St. Barts and other places. I still can find magic in most of those places where people think there isn't any left.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOLOMON: The king of cool, as Andy Cohen wrote on Twitter. And before his death Jimmy Buffett was preparing to release a new record. That's according to his Web site. Buffett won two Country Music Awards and was also nominated for two Grammys during his career. 
 
And we'll be back with much more on CNN NEWSROOM. 
 <br>[11:12:07]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back.
 
For many this weekend marks the end of summer, and for the country as a whole it was a summer marked by natural disasters. The deadly Hawaiian wildfire that turned parts of Maui to ash. Even more wildfires in the western U.S. And then the subsequent flooding that devastated parts of southern California. And now in northwest Florida the damage from hurricane Idalia. 
 
Florida and California specifically are both facing a unique crisis when it comes to rebuilding and recovering and that's because insurance companies are leaving those states, some insurance companies. 
 
Many are no longer accepting homeowners applications or they're just refusing to sell policies to small businesses because they say it simply isn't worth the risk anymore. 
 
I'm going to now bring in Sean Kevelighan. He is the CEO of the Insurance Information Institute. 
 
Sean, good morning, we appreciate you being with us today. I wanted to start with, you know, what advice you would have for residents perhaps in Florida or other parts of the country that are looking at their damaged homes from severe weather and wondering, do I rebuild, is it worth it, or should I just relocate? 
 
SEAN KEVELIGHAN, CEO, INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE: Well, certainly we're seeing a trend as you've brought up here that people are living more and more in harm's way. 
 
And in states like Florida and California, unfortunately you have circumstances that are really not insurance-involved as much as you would think. 
 
In Florida, in particular, there's what we call legal system abuse. Florida has more homeowners litigation, in fact, 80 percent of the homeowners litigation cases reside in that state when in fact only about 9 percent of the overall claims cases are in that state. 
 
So you've got extraordinary circumstances. We've seen some reform in the state passed but unfortunately, about 72 hours after the legislation passed before it got signed we had about 280,000 cases dumped into the system again. 
 
So it is troubling. We know the insurance customers are frustrated. Insurers are frustrated. They want to do business in a growing economy state like Florida, like California as well. 
 
California's circumstances are a little bit different. 
 
SOLOMON: Yes, quantify that for me, I mean if you might. I mean how much of some of the issues we're seeing is severe weather in states like Florida and California? And how much of it is these other issues like legislation and regulation as you point out? 
 
KEVELIGHAN: Well, yes. If you do a comparison, actually, Hurricane Ian last year was actually the second costliest in terms of insurance losses in history. And that was behind Katrina. 
 
Now, in those loss estimates they do factor in litigation costs. And so if you compare actually Katrina, which we all saw the damages and the destruction and the social change that it took on versus what happened in Ian, I think you can understand kind of the economic circumstances that are taking place in a state like Florida that need to change. 
 
We need to build communities to be more resilient but we also need to counter this legal system abuse that's going on. And we like to say, you know, Florida is a state that's coming near you with all of this litigations and all those billboards that you see and things like that. 
 
SOLOMON: Sean, help us understand the business model of insurance, because I think -- look, some insurance companies. Orion180, I was just reading a statement, said that we see Florida as an attractive insurance market, others however, as we pointed out are leaving the state. 
 
So help me understand the economics of how insurance works here. 
 
KEVELIGHAN: Well, insurance thrives in growing economies. Insurance helps develop economic growth. In fact, right now in Florida insurance is acting as a financial first responder. It will be helping rebuild those economies, those claims will be paid, those promises will be kept. [11:19:55]
 
KEVELIGHAN: And insurance likes to get into growing economies. It likes to help economies grow. 
 
But when you have circumstances where it's regulatory-related, like California, where you've got antiquated regulation that doesn't allow insurers to do things like model, to better predict; doesn't allow reinsurance costs to be factored in. and then Florida with just the overwhelming amount of litigation. It does stifle and allow -- not allow insurers to do business, not allow insurers to do profit.
 
In fact, in Florida it's just been a multi-million dollar loss year after year in that state. And we're seeing state insurance companies go insolvent. In fact, we had six insurance companies go insolvent before Ian ever hit last year. 
 
SOLOMON: Now, let me ask, I want to bring this back for people at home and viewers, homeowners insurance of course not only expensive and more expensive in certain states, of course. It also doesn't cover every type of damage. 
 
So from your perspective in terms of advice, what other types of insurance should homeowners absolutely have if they live in areas where severe weather is clearly a concern. 
 
KEVELIGHAN: Flood insurance. Most people don't realize THAT their traditional homeowners policy does not cover flood. It's a separate policy and in a state like Florida you need it. 
 
Florida's got better take-up rates than most of the country around the coast. But when you go inland you're seeing less than 5 percent take up rate for flood insurance. And as you're seeing these hurricanes are going right across the state of Florida and many Americans, and the hurricanes also going up inland across the whole United States. 
 
And it is a real tragedy right now, just how little people have flood insurance. So we always encourage people to call your insurance professional and ask for flood insurance. In fact, demand it if they don't want to give it to you. 
 
SOLOMON: Sean Kevelighan, we appreciate the time today and the advice. Thank you for the time. Have a great weekend. 
 
KEVELIGHAN: Thank you. Have a good one. 
 
SOLOMON: All right. And coming up for us, any minute, any day really, we could get a decision on Mark Meadows' attempts to move his Georgia election subversion case to federal court as one more of Trump's co- defendants pleads not guilty. 
 
Plus, hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching for a convicted murderer, who you see on your screen here, who escaped prison and is believed to be on the run and extremely dangerous. Details ahead. 
 <br>[11:22:07]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back. 
 
Former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani is the latest defendant in the Georgia election subversion case to plead not guilty. The former New York City mayor will not have to appear in Georgia state court next week. Giuliani, Trump and five other defendants have waived their right to appear at their arraignment hearing. 
 
Now, while 19 people have been indicted in the Georgia case, so far only Trump and 11 other defendants have formally entered their pleas. 
 
And this comes as we continue to wait for a judge's decision on whether the case for former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows will move to federal court. 
 
CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider has the details now on Meadows and several other developments in this really fast-moving case. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: We are waiting for word from the federal judge in Georgia to find out if Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows will be able to move his case from state court to federal court.
 
The judge has received briefing at this point from both sides in the case. It spans about 35 pages. All of that briefing that was submitted late Thursday afternoon, so presumably a ruling could come at any time. 
 
The judge here wanted more clarity on this issue of the numerous acts listed in the indictment against Meadows as part of this conspiracy case, and whether if Meadows was performing as a federal officer under just one of those acts, could the case be removed?
 
Well, the D.A. Fani Willis, of course, is saying no. She says the indictment didn't happen because of any single act, but instead, the broader conspiracy that Meadows was alleged to be involved in. 
 
Meadows's lawyers, of course, they're saying yes, even if one act touches on Meadows's job as chief of staff it should be removed. So we'll see how this judge rules. It's likely we'll see something maybe before Wednesday when Meadows is set to be arraigned in state court.
 
Then we also have defendant Kenneth Chesebro. He was Trump's campaign lawyer. He's filed various motions in state court. 
 
First, he wants the prosecution to speed up their production of discovery to him and his lawyers. His lawyers are saying it's unacceptable that prosecutors have said they'll hand everything over by September 15, which is two weeks from now, when they're speeding toward this October 23rd trial date. So Chesebro's lawyers say that they've given Willis' team a hard drive
 
 for the evidence, and they're saying that Willis' team really needs to speed it up. They say they can't say they're ready to go to trial but then slow walk this production of documents.
 
And then also Chesebro is telling the court that he wants a solo trial. You know, even though he and Sidney Powell both filed for speedy trials, he does not want to go to trial with Sidney Powell. He says he never had any direct contact with her and they're not accused of doing the same thing.
 
So a flurry of filings also as we wait for that federal judge in Georgia to act. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOLOMON: Ok. Jessica Schneider, thank you. 
 
And with me now to discuss these developments and so much more is Michael Zeldin. He is a former prosecutor and Robert Mueller's former special assistant at the DOJ. Michael, good morning. Good to see you again.
 
So as you know, we're waiting and watching to see whether this request by Mark Meadows to move his case to federal court will be granted. Obviously the judge is aware of this arraignment date. I mean when do you think we're going to get a decision? Do you think it has to come before the arraignment? 
 
MICHAEL ZELDIN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: No, they can be arraigned. And then the judge can make his decision when he's ready to make his decision. 
 
This is an important decision because there will be others who will be filing down the line for removal. And he knows that this is a precedent-setting decision so he wants to take his time and get it right. And we'll see how he decides. 
 <br>[11:29:48]
 
ZELDIN: I think in respect to what Jessica said, that the law in the 11th circuit, the federal circuit that oversees these district court judges is that if there's a portion of the work that was done in your official capacity, it gets removed as long as you have a colorable federal defense. In this case that defense would be immunity under the supremacy clause. 
 
So I think if he finds, the judge, as a matter of fact that Meadows was acting in part in his official capacity, this case will be removed. 
 
SOLOMON: Let me ask though, if some -- if some alleged actions were as part of his federal official duties, but others weren't, I mean, couldn't theoretically Fani Willis just remove those counts and leave the others? I mean, how would that work? ZELDIN: Well, she could try to change the indictment to say that he
 
 didn't do anything that was personal, rather under his official duties, take that out of the indictment. But I don't think that's really doable at this point. 
 
She's charged him, the facts have been alleged, and I think she's going to have to live with the decision of the court. 
 
SOLOMON: You know, Mark Meadows surprised a lot of people by testifying. It was pretty extensive. I want to say he was up there for three and a half hours at that hearing to move his case to federal court. How might that testimony impact his case? Clearly his team thought it was worth the risk. 
 
ZELDIN: Well, they did think it was worth the risk. It wasn't the only way he could have gotten his evidence that he was working under color of his federal authority in, but they decided that was the best thing for him to do. 
 
And he testified. And he set forth what he did and why he thought it wasn't under his, you know, political hat but rather under his official hat. 
 
Some people have said, well, you know, he was slicing it too close and that he really was misrepresenting it. But I don't think much of those arguments. I think that he said what he said which was that I was acting under the direction of the president to, in my role as an overseer of his job as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States With a duty to protect the Constitution, and blah, blah, blah, and that's what I did. 
 
And the judge will have to make findings of fact. It's really a fact- based decision that he has to make. Was the -- were these acts that were colorable under his authority as a federal officer or were they not? 
 
And if they were not, he stays in state court. If they were, he moves to federal court. Even if it's only a portion of them. 
 
SOLOMON: Michael, let me ask, these requests by different co- defendants to sever their cases from the others, for different reasons, but ultimately, I mean, what do you think we're looking at here? I mean, how many trials could this turn into? 
 
ZELDIN: Well, it's a great question. I would think that all of the people who filed for speedy trials should be tried together, meaning that they'll have the same trial date set. 
 
They can still file for severance of defendants and severance of counts as Chesebro has done. But they have a certain number of days within which to file a request for a speedy trial, or they waive it. 
 
And so they'll have to make their speedy trial decisions. And if they make them, I think those who make it will be tried together, unless they, in a separate motion to sever, are granted a motion for severance. And then there could be separate trials. Multiple trials for the D.A. is not good because she telegraphs all
 
 her evidence. She lets everybody know what her strengths and weaknesses are, and so you -- you know, you get to see the movie first, and then you get to act in response to it the second time. And that's just not a good situation for her to be in. 
 
SOLOMON: A lot to watch here. Michael Zeldin, great to see you today. Thank you. 
 
ZELDIN: Thanks. 
 
SOLOMON: All right. Let's go to the White House now where President Biden and the first lady, just left for their trip to Florida. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Jasmine Wright. She is there live. So Jasmine, what did he say when he left? Good morning.
 
JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes. Well, President Biden seemed to end the will he, won't he meet with Governor DeSantis, I was on the lawn within just a few moments ago before he left the White House. I asked him what happened with that meeting. He said I don't know.
 
And he was asked the same question when he was at JBA. Take a listen to his answer. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- with Governor DeSantis today? 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think he's going to be there. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have a message for him? 
 
BIDEN: We're going to take care of Florida. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WRIGHT: So there we heard from the president ending that question of whether or not he will be there. Now, this all happened after on Friday morning President Biden told CNN that he would be meeting with DeSantis after the White House was kind of coy about whether or not the two would meet. 
 
Later on that evening we heard from DeSantis' office who said that he had no plans to meet with President Biden when he was on the ground in Florida. 
 <br>[11:34:57]
 
WRIGHT: I want to read you a part of that statement because it was very specific. A spokesperson for DeSantis said, "In these rural communities and so soon after the impact, the security preparations alone that would go into setting up such a meeting would shut down ongoing recovery efforts." This is a bit of a twist here because just earlier on Saturday we heard from FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell who told CNN that they were in constant communication with the government of Florida, the Florida state government really trying to coordinate. 
 
And she said that President Biden had spoken to DeSantis to tell him that he was coming to Florida. And both FEMA and DeSantis' team mutually agreed that President Biden would come and visit Live Oak. And so therefore, it's kind of a back and forth. 
 
Now, of course, this is going to be the third time that President Biden is visiting a disaster site in Florida, those previous two times he had met with DeSantis, really trying to be cordial and congenial when working for the people of Florida. 
 
But here of course, there obviously was some sort of breakdown or miscommunication or just frankly a change of plans, and that it's not going to happen. 
 
SOLOMON: A lot to watch here, Jasmine Wright at the White House for us. Thank you, Jasmine. 
 
And still ahead for us, Russia claims they thwarted another Ukrainian attack on the Crimean Bridge, as the Ukrainians' counteroffensive appears to be ramping up. We're live in the region coming up next. 
 <br>[11:36:13]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back.
 
Russia says that it has stopped a third sea drone attack overnight on the bridge that connects Russian-controlled Crimea and the Russian mainland. The bridge was damaged, you might remember twice in the last year following drone attacks both recently in July. Russia's ministry of defense says that traffic on the bridge was temporarily restricted after the attempted attack. 
 
And this all comes as Ukraine's offensive intensifies on Russian forces, its counteroffensive along the front lines in the southeast area near Zaporizhzhia.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Melissa Bell because she is there. So Melissa, what's happening on the ground? I mean what can you tell us? 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the gains continue to be made ever so certain -- very incrementally. We've just been meeting, Rahel, with some of the men who've been leading that charge beyond Robotyne. 
 
They were some of those who'd helped liberate the last civilians in that village. There was just 500-strong before the war but then it's become such a big battle in this, the second counteroffensive of Ukraine that's been going on there for three months now. 
 
Robotyne, their first big gain. It's hugely symbolic. They've been telling us first of all about the battle for Robotyne. But what happened beyond, these are the men who day after day in their Bradleys go in and out down what they call the road of hell, the road that leads south from Robotyne. 
 
They wouldn't tell us, Rahel, just how far south they've gotten but they say that it is further south of Robotyne. They're making progress. 
 
What we're hearing from authorities is that land bridges towards the east are now being consolidated. They (INAUDIBLE) about consolidating their positions a few kilometers to the south of that town -- village of Robotyne as they seek to get further forward in what the men have described really as scenes of hell.
 
The "road of hell" they called it, skies black with drones, some of them Ukrainian, some of them Russian, very difficult to tell the difference. Huge artillery fire that we could hear in the forest that they were speaking to us in, ten kilometers from the front line. Furious artillery rounds from both sides going at each other. 
 
There is, of course, the danger of the aviation strikes that have been substantial from the Russian side, and of course, the mines. They said that no sooner have they managed to clear them, then the Russians, as they retreat, leave more behind. 
 
And it is that combination of factors that makes it as difficult as it is to make progress with huge losses on all side. Although they told us they reckoned that the losses were far greater on the Russian side. 
 
And so they vowed to plow on as difficult as it is as they seek to make their way to (INAUDIBLE) the next big objective, that logistical hub that would give them a huge, wonderful -- a great position to take on the rest of it which is towards the Sea of Azov to cut off that land bridge to Crimea, the ultimate aim of course, at this stage, Rahel. 
 
SOLOMON: Yes. A bridge of course, that's been targeted a few times now, clearly a bridge that is of symbolic value in this war. 
 
Melissa Bell live for us there in Zaporizhzhia. Melissa, thank you. 
 
And coming up for us, they are lacing up their cleats before they step foot on the gridiron. College football is back. Week one of the season has now kicked off, with a few high-profile games to keep on your radar. 
 
We'll have a preview coming up next. 
 <br>[11:43:18]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back.
 
Even though the calendar still says it's summer, fall is creeping closer and closer, and with it comes the return of college football. Carolyn Manno is here with a look at the first real weekend of games. 
 
Hey Carolyn, good morning. So what's on tap for today? 
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Rahel. Well, after 32 Saturdays without any college football whatsoever, the season is officially under way. We've got more than 70 games on the schedule this weekend which is just unbelievable when you think about the fact that football season is here again. Georgia once again start at the top ranked number one spot. The Bulldogs trying to win their third straight title, something that hasn't been done since Minnesota won three in a row back in the 1930s. 
 
They kick off their season tonight against U.C. Martin. There are plenty of other intriguing games, Coach Prime, Dion Sanders making his debut with Colorado against CCU at the top of the hour. the number 3 Ohio State faces Indiana. And North Carolina and South Carolina are set to clash in Charlotte -- it's a big rivalry. 
 
One of the biggest games coming tomorrow, fifth ranked LSU playing number 8 Florida state in Orlando at 7:30 Eastern. 
 
And just when you thought that conference realignment was over in college football, Rahel. Think again because the ACC board of directors voting yesterday to approve the additions of Stanford, Cal and SMU beginning next season. 
 
So the league will have 18 teams when all of the dust settles there. Stanford and Cal are the ninth and tenth schools to leave the PAC-12 conference, it's been a tumultuous month, the Big 10 luring away four teams. And the Big 12 poaching four other schools for next year. So that leaves just Oregon State and Washington State hanging in the PAC- 12 balance. 
 
Louisville getting their year off on the right foot against Georgia Tech last night in Atlanta but it did not look like that was going to be the case. The Cardinals were down by 15 at halftime. But quarterback Jack Plumber able to rally his troops. He had three touchdown passes to score 27 unanswered points and right the ship. 
 
Louisville cooling off to 39-34 win here, their first ever victory in the state of Georgia. 
 
Rahel, we'll have games every weekend from now until the national championship game on January 8th in Houston. So, if you're not a football fan, and you grab a pumpkin latte, this could be your signal that fall is officially here. Either way, football is back. 
 <br>[11:49:58]
 
SOLOMON: It is back, absolutely. All right. Carolyn, good to see you. Thank you.
 
And still ahead for us, a convicted murderer on the run. What we are learning about the manhunt to find the escaped Pennsylvania inmate, coming up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back. 
 
A triple shooting in Washington, D.C. has left two women dead and a teen girl in critical condition. The shooting happened around midnight Friday about a mile from the White House. 
 
Police that the victims were found in the rear outdoor parking lot of a building on 7th Street after reports of gunshots. The investigation into the shooting does continue. 
 <br>[11:54:57]
 
SOLOMON: And state and federal authorities are searching for a dangerous convicted murderer. They say that he was spotted on a residential surveillance camera close to the prison where he escaped from. 
 
Take a look at your TV here. 34-year-old Danelo Cavalcante broke out of the Chester County prison on Thursday morning. That's after being sentenced to life without parole last week. 
 
Now police say they believe he could still be in Chester County, Pennsylvania which is not far from Philadelphia. 
 
Here's CNN's Brian Todd. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hundreds of law enforcement officers on the ground, helicopters, drones, canine teams on the hunt in eastern Pennsylvania for an escaped convicted murderer. 34-year-old Danelo Cavalcante, a man law enforcement officials say whose depravity knows no bounds and who has nothing to lose.
 
CAPTAIN BOB WAGNER, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: I want to reiterate this man is very dangerous. If you see him don't approach him, and call 911.
 
TODD: Cavalcante broke out of the Chester County prison about 30 miles west of Philadelphia, Thursday morning. He was spotted later walking along a road near the prison. Officials believe he hasn't gotten far.
 
DEB RYAN, CHESTER COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: We believe that he is still in the general area. There is no evidence at this time to suggest that anyone has helped facilitate this escape or is assisting him at this time. We believe that he is hiding somewhere locally and that he is alone.
 
TODD: Other new information, law enforcement now believes Cavalcante wants to head south.
 
RYAN: When he murdered Deborah Brandao in 2021, he headed toward Brazil. We have evidence to suggest that he was captured in Virginia, but the ultimate goal was to go to Mexico and then to Brazil, which is his native country. TODD: Deborah Brandao was Cavalcante's former girlfriend who he is convicted of murdering in 2021 by stabbing her 38 times in front of her two young children. 
 
Investigators believe his motive for her murder was because Brandao had discovered that Cavalcante was wanted for another murder in Brazil. Law enforcement describes him as being fluent in Portuguese and Spanish, as being five-feet tall and weighing 120 pounds.
 
MICHAEL TABMAN, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT: He doesn't sound like a physically imposing individual. But he's violent. He is desperate. And therefore he's dangerous. 
 
He's going to become desperate just for food and drink and a place to stay, so he's going to have to do something and not get noticed, and that could lead to violence.
 
TODD: What kind of mistake could Cavalcante make to get himself caught?
 
TABMAN: It could be something simple like shoplifting. He's just hungry and he goes in and grabs something, someone calls the police, or not knowing who he is, someone gets into a confrontation with him for that.
 
TODD: Cavalcante's escape comes just weeks after another high profile manhunt of a violent escaped inmate also in Pennsylvania. Michael Burham escaped from the Warren County Jail and was later captured. 
 
Law enforcement experts say staffing shortages at these jails often lead to security breaches.
 
JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: It's just not the greatest place to work. I mean think about it. Who wants to work inside a prison who doesn't have to?
 
TODD: There's now a $10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Danelo Cavalcante. Law enforcement officials telling people in that area, now that the Labor Day weekend is upon us and a lot of people may be going out of town, to keep an eye on the homes of their neighbors who are going out of town, with the idea that Cavalcante might try to steal something from a home like that.
 
Brian Todd, CNN -- Washington.
