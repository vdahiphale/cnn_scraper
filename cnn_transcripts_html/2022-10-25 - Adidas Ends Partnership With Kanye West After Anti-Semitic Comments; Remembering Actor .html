SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Now, Erica, of course, no one expects his tenure in office as British prime minister to be any shorter than Liz Truss' record, short, 49 days in office, but if Rishi Sunak has any chance of lasting any longer than the next two years, when the next general election will be held, he has a heck of an uphill climb in order to win back favor for his party with the British public were an election to be hold today, at least that you consult the polls, the opposition, labor party, would absolutely wipe the floor with the conservatives.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR:  It will be interesting to see. All right, well, all eyes are on him, as he knows. Scott McLean, I appreciate it. Thank you.
 
Let's bring in our Rana Foroohar, she's a global business columnist, associate editor at the Financial Times and a CNN global economic analyst, as well the author of the new book, Homecoming, the Path to Prosperity in a Post-Global World. Rana, always good to see you.
 
So, when we look at what's happening, let's stick with U.K. for just a moment because we do know this has broader implications. Liz Truss's financial plan really rocked the British financial market, plunged the pound to historic lows. Based on what you know about Rishi Sunak, what we just heard from him, I mean, talk to us about these challenges he just inherited.
 
RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Yes. Well you know, Truss-anomics, as it were, broke because, essentially, Liz Truss was using a playbook from the 1980s. I mean, she was basically trying to channel Margaret Thatcher and say, look, we can cut taxes on the rich even as we're giving out energy subsidies and everything is going to be okay, and the markets just didn't buy it.
 
And that is reflective of a broader shift that I actually do cover in my book away from sort of hyper globalized, financialized trickledown markets where governments think that cutting taxes is the only thing that you can do to achieve prosperity.
 
So, I think the new prime minister is going to have to figure out what is the game plan, what is the new formula. And that is tricky for conservatives in the U.K. and for Republicans in the U.S. Are they still about just cutting taxes and letting the markets do what they want? I think the last few years have shown us that with the pandemic and the lack of PPE and the war in Ukraine and the energy issues there, that the market doesn't always know best and government does have a role to play. The question is how are they going to play it?
 
HILL:  Yes. I feel like the last couple of years have also shown us that on certain levels too, all of what we thought we knew has sort of gone out of the window, right? We look at the economy here in the U.S., is there going to be a recession, is there not, we look at jobs, unemployment is so low, and yet there are all these real concerns. So, recession obviously is going to be a major focus.
 
So, we just heard from Goldman Sachs's CEO David Solomon at the Saudi Arabia Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, and he weighed in on recession. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID SOLOMON, CEO, GOLDMAN SACHS:  When you find yourself in an economic scenario like this, where inflation is embedded, it is very hard to get out of it without real economic slowdown. So, I too am in the camp that we likely have a recession in the U.S., going to have I think most likely a recession, we might be in a recession in Europe.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  So, recessions likely in the U.S. and in Europe. I think the real question for people is what does that recession look like?
 
FOROOHAR:  It is a great question. You know, for sure, Europe is going to be hit harder than America. That is already happening. Their energy crisis could reach a scary point this winter. I mean, people are piling fire wood up to try and come up with alternative means for heating. In the U.S., I think it's going to be different.
 
Now, let's step back and say we haven't had a recession in a long time, and that is because we sort of stretched out the cycle. Recessions used to happen once every five years, seven years, now, it is a decade or more. And that is because easy money, low rates have sort of kept the music playing.
 
Rates are going up now. Everything that has been known, as you say, in the economy for last half century, cheap interest rates, cheap money, cheap labor from China, cheap energy from Russia is all going away. So, we are really in a pendulum shift.
 
And think that consumers are certainly going to feel it in higher prices, but I think that there is going to be a lot of pressure on companies to start doing more of their part to really take some of the pain and to not just put that all on either consumers or government.
 
HILL:  Well, we will be watching and hopefully talking about it more with you. As always, Rana, I appreciate it. Thank you.
 
Still to come here, Adidas cutting ties now with Kanye West in the wake of his anti-Semitic comments. Why that move is so significant in the fight against hate, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
HILL:  Adidas now the latest brand to sever ties with Kanye West after his series of offensive anti-Semitic rants. In a statement, the German sportswear company said it does not tolerate any form of hate speech and called Ye's comments unacceptable, hateful and dangerous.
 
Now, those comments, of course, also come at a time when anti-Semitic incidents are arising around the country, and that's even from Adidas, was called on for a number of days.
 
Here with me now to discuss, Attorney Sam Yebri, he is a former Anti- Defamation League Board Member, also current candidate for the Los Angeles City Council. Sam, I'm glad to have you with us this morning.
 
As we know, there was a hashtag out there, boycott Adidas, in the wake of the White Lives Matter T-shirt, pretty quickly said they were reviewing their partnership with Kanye West, but it did take several days for the statement that we got today. Are you satisfied with what you've heard from Adidas now?
 
SAM YEBRI, FORMER BOARD MEMBER, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE:  Well, good morning, Erica. I think this is a really important that Adidas heed the calls of so many people beyond from the Jewish community.
 <br>[10:40:02]
 
I think Americans and people around the world realize that this was an important moment right? Someone was saying that he can get away with some of the most nasty, pernicious lies about the Jewish people and get away with it with impunity, and Adidas finally indicated and showed that that is not the case.
 
HILL:  There was a really disturbing rise in incidents in your area over the weekend. This banner that was hung over the 405 expressing support for Kanye West, Governor Newsom condemned the increase in anti-Semitic incidents and hate in Los Angeles. But I know you're seeing some of it firsthand. You were on the receiving ends of some of these horrific fliers.
 
Can you just give me a sense of what -- does it feel like things have changes for you in the wake of these comments in terms of the hate that is being put out there and putting out so freely, it seems?
 
YEBRI:  Well, these folks are getting more brazen, so it is lost in discussion about the banners. It references Kanye West, but what is more chilling is the Nazi salute, the hail Hitler that people in broad daylight in the heart of Los Angeles are willing to show and be on camera. And now, it is appearing on our driveways, leaflets are left on cars, billboards are defaced with anti-Semitic remarks and now these hateful, ugly fliers were left in people's doorsteps, including my own, all throughout Los Angeles. So, it feels like something has changed is that this is -- this moment has given air to the most hateful, anti-Semitic people to come out and share these ideas and lies.
 
HILL:  There has been a significant increase when we look at anti- Semitic incidents just in the last couple of years, up 34 percent from 2020. We're looking at assaults, attacks against Jewish institutions, schools. This week, we're going to mark the very somber anniversary of the attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh.
 
When you look at all of this, is there enough being done to counter this hateful rhetoric? Where are we missing the mark?
 
YEBRI:  Yes. So, in Los Angeles, it has gone especially bad. There has been a 217 percent increase in the last five years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, and it's led to violence as well, as Jewish diners last summer at a sushi restaurant were assaulted simply for being Jewish.
 
So, there is a few things that we have to do. One is the prosecution and we have to find ways to hold people accountable who are doing these things and terrorizing people in communities, and then there needs to be education and need to be cross community collaboration. I think the fact that, according to studies, half of the young people in America have never heard of the Holocaust or Auschwitz is really quite damning in American society today.
 
And I think we also need to point, it is not just the Jewish community, the increase in crime against Asian-American community, LGBTQ, Muslims, obviously, racism, Racism reared its ugly head in the city council, the highest levels of the government of Los Angeles in the recent weeks. We have to link arms with other communities and condemn racism and bigotry of all types against all people more forcefully than we are doing right now.
 
HILL:  We need to link arms, we need to do that, and yet, as you point out, we are seeing this rise in hate, sadly, across the board. Why?
 
YEBRI:  I think there is a lack of leadership when people have platforms, like Kanye, are using it to spread hate, when some leaders are slow to condemn hatred when it is on their side of the party, because we have to be honest. The rise in hate and bigotry and anti- Semitism is happening on the far-right and on the far-left.
 
And I'm a proud Democrat. I'm willing to call it out on the left and colleagues who are on the right politically have to do the same. And it is not happening, it's not happening forcefully, it's not happening fast enough and it is giving air to people who think they can get away with these hateful ideas and they're looking for attention and, unfortunately, we're giving that to them now. I'm glad we're not sharing some of the hateful ideas that they were spreading.
 
But it is time for our leaders to do more forcefully and to talk about this not just as a Jewish community issue but it is about people, minorities all throughout America. Communities feel terrorized right now and we need to do more to keep people safe and make them know that they're welcome in the America of 2022.
 
HILL:  Yes, they're excellent points and so important, and I'd like to keep that conversation going with you as well. Sam, I appreciate your time today. Thank you.
 
YEBRI:  Thank you, Erica. A pleasure being with you.
 
HILL:  Just ahead, remembering beloved actor and Instagram superstar Leslie Jordan. I'll be joined by one of his closest friends, Country Singer Fancy Hagood. Stay tuned.

LESLIE JORDAN, ACTOR:  Well, (BLEEP). What are you all doing?
 
Pillow talk from Leslie Allen Jordan.
 
He would come home from work and I'd be in the front yard, he'd be with all of his army buddies. He was a career army man. Daddy, daddy, watch me twirl.
 
I'm short, I'm gay and everybody is quarantine homie, you might find me on the back of my pretty short pony.
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
It is exhausting being viral.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Exhausting being viral, the one and only Leslie Jordan, who brought so much joy to so many people during the pandemic. Of course, he was well-known before that. His role on Will and Grace, of course, but he really found this second act after sharing his infectious personality on Instagram. The news of his death after a car accident yesterday at the age of 67 sparking an outpouring of grief and appreciation from those who knew and loved him, including our next guest, Fancy Hagood, a country singer who had the chance to who perform on stage with Jordan last year and also joined Jordan as a guest co-host for his Apple music show, Hunker Down Radio. Fancy, we really appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. I'm so sorry for the loss of your dear friend.
 
I know how much he meant to you and I was struck on social media, you thanked him for, quote, being yourself in such a large way that a queer kid in Arkansas could believe in himself too. He was a friend and a role model. Talk to us. Who is the Leslie Jordan who you know?
 
FANCY HAGOOD, FRIEND OF LESLIE JORDAN:  Listen, the Leslie Jordan you all saw on Instagram is the Leslie Jordan in real life. He is a joy. He brought so much laughter and he just cared so much about everyone. We would be out in Nashville and anyone who stopped him, you know, to show their appreciation, he just ate it up and gave everyone exactly what they wanted. And I just think that doesn't happen all of the time. And I just think he's so got to enjoy the height of his career and I just am so thankful for that.
 
HILL:  And what a great -- I mean, what a great observation, too, what a wonderful person to be around, to just that genuine and to stop for people like that. He did bring so much joy.
 
I know you two became quick friends after you first met and I have a great clip. I think it is a great clip of the two of you joking about starting your own Real Housewives franchise, so I just want to play that for folks watching.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HAGOOD:  I don't just stir the pot. I smoke it.
 
JORDAN:  I may be a bite size snack but I have bold flavor.
 
HAGOOD:  I might not be into fitness but I run in tight circles.
 
JORDAN:  Well, I might be from the south, but when I spill the tea, it ain't sweet.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  I just -- I laugh and I smile every time and I love seeing you do the same. What are some of your favorite memories of times you spent with Leslie Jordan, anything on the cutting room floor that didn't make it that you want to share with us?
 
HAGOOD:  Well, I have to say, I have been a huge fan of Leslie Jordan since Will and Grace. That was a show I watched. I say that on my Instagram, like you said, growing up in Arkansas, being able to visually see queer men on T.V. was such an important thing for me.
 
And so Leslie has been a hero of mine. So, getting to meet him within last two years has just been such an honor. And he's just always so down for a laugh. There is just not much he would not do to make someone laugh and he's just always down for a good time, always trying to make a skit, always trying to make a performance out of something. And I just -- I've learned so much from him about show business and what it takes and I just -- he's my idol turned friend. And it is just -- they say don't meet your heroes but I got to meet mine. And it was very special.
 
HILL:  The story you told about walking down the street with him, too, yes, he was there for the laughs, yes, you could find a laugh, but also just being such an incredible role model for you with both the spoken and the unspoken gestures. How much did that mean for him?
 
HAGOOD:  Man, I think someone like Leslie knows how hard it is in this business, to catch a break, to find the moment. And I think that is the best thing about him. He's an actor. He came to Nashville to throw his hat in the ring for music thing. And he made an album with some iconic artists, Dolly Parton, Chris Stapleton, Brandi Carlile, I mean, so many amazing artists rushed to record a song with Leslie. So, I think that speaks volumes of who he is.
 
And what was the most impactful for me is the way he brought other people along with him in these moments of success and the spotlight. He did a lot for me. I got to perform at the Ryman. I got to be on the Grand Ole Opry.
 
Being queer in Nashville, that is not always -- you don't always know if those opportunities are going to find you. And the fact that Leslie came and paved the way and made things like that happen for me, I'm forever grateful.
 
HILL:  Well, we are grateful for your time and for your memories and your remembrances as well. Fancy Hagood, again, my sincere condolences and I hope those memories continue to bring you joy as you think about your dear friend in those tough moments. Thank you.
 
HAGOOD:  Thank you for having me.
 
HILL:  And we'll be right back.

 <br>[10:55:00]
 
HILL:  A member of the Texas ranger has been suspended and is under investigation for his inaction during the Uvalde school massacre when the shooter went unchallenged for more than an hour, this according to sources close to investigation, who say, Christopher Kindell told investigators he focused on supplying updates to his bosses on the day of the shooting in May. But he had no discussions about options to breach the classroom, as someone in his position would have been expected to do.
