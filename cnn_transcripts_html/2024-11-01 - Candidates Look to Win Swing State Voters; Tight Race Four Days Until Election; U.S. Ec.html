ERICA HILL, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Thanks for joining me here for the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Erica Hill. It is 10:00 a.m. here in 
 
 New York. 
 
Ahead this hour, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump barnstorming Wisconsin today. We'll take you live to Milwaukee for a look at how voters are 
 
 feeling four days out from the election. Plus. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENNIFER LOPEZ, SINGER AND ACTRESS: Ladies, where are my ladies at? Let me hear you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: The Harris campaign working to build momentum with Latino voters with none other than J. Lo herself. 
 
And more images coming in of the destruction. The widespread destruction near Valencia in Spain. The death toll there now over 200 after that 
 
 disastrous flash flooding. 
 
As I noted four days to go now until election day in the U.S., and the focus is squarely on those battleground states as the candidates sprint to 
 
 the finish line. Today, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are focusing on one of those key prizes, Wisconsin. Each candidate has various events in 
 
 the state. Wisconsin is also, remember, one of these so-called blue wall states, states that Donald Trump won in 2016 but lost to Joe Biden in 2020. 
 
Recent polling from CNN shows Harris with a slight lead. Both candidates are following some fairly similar travel plans. They'll be in Wisconsin 
 
 today as I noted. Yesterday, they were both out west, both of them in Nevada at one point where Harris reiterated one of her main messages in 
 
 these closing days, her view that a second Trump presidency would bring chaos. 
 
Donald Trump sitting down in Arizona with former FOX News host Tucker Carlson, where he attacked outspoken Republican former congresswoman, Liz 
 
 Cheney, with some pretty violent rhetoric. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrel shooting at her. OK? 
 
 Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Liz Cheney responding this morning on X, writing, "This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them 
 
 with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man." She also added the hashtag "women will 
 
 not be silenced," which we have seen others pick up on Twitter. 
 
CNN's Jeff Zeleny joining me now from Milwaukee. Things are going to be very busy in Wisconsin today. 
 
Jeff, as we look at this, you know, the vitriol, the violent rhetoric, the name calling, there is a sense that -- there are questions about how much 
 
 of an impact can this have in the waning days of election, which is tempered with the idea that for many people any shock value, any outrage 
 
 when it comes to comments made by Donald Trump and his supporters, the outrage kind of left the building a long time ago? 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Erica, there's no doubt about it. I mean, there may be a ceiling on the outrage, but I'm sort 
 
 of struck by the difference in tone of the former president as he, you know, reaches the end of his third bid for the presidency. In 2016 he was 
 
 talking about the inappropriate nature, and he was laughing about how it's OK to grab women. That of course was a big controversy. He was elected 
 
 anyway. 
 
But think of the -- how the rhetoric has changed over eight years. Now he's calling for a firing squad, essentially executing one of his most outspoken 
 
 critics. And as Donald Trump comes back to Milwaukee, he'll be speaking in the rally tonight in the same arena where he accepted the Republican 
 
 nomination just four months ago. 
 <br>[10:05:08]
 
And I was thinking back to that this morning. It was at that rally where he said, it's time to end the divisiveness. It's time to, you know, allow 
 
 political disagreement, but not be disagreeable. Of course, his rhetoric has darkened since then, but the closing arguments of this campaign, the 
 
 closing message from Vice President Harris's side and former president Donald Trump's side could not be more different. 
 
I do expect to hear from Vice President Harris responding to those comments overnight from the former president about Liz Cheney. Liz Cheney has 
 
 emerged as one of the biggest supporters of Vice President Harris. But you mentioned women and that hashtag on Liz Cheney's post on X. That is so 
 
 striking. One of the biggest sort of factors in this election is how women are going to vote. 
 
Well, Jennifer Lopez is one of the many celebrities appearing at these campaign rallies. She had this to say last night in Nevada. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LOPEZ: I believe in the power of women. Ladies, where are my ladies at? Let me hear you. Yes. I believe that women, women have the power to make the 
 
 difference in this election. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENY: So women, of course, are not a monolith. You don't need to have me say that. But it is a striking sort of difference in this election. The 
 
 first presidential election in the wake of the Dobbs decision by the Supreme Court. So that is one of the things we'll be looking for certainly 
 
 next Tuesday, when the votes are counted. But for now, at least, these seven battleground states and today their paths essentially cross here in 
 
 Wisconsin -- Erica. 
 
HILL: Yes, they certainly will. I know you've been speaking to a number of voters there in Wisconsin, some of whom you've been checking in with over 
 
 the course of the last year or so. They're feeling a little fed up. Tell us more, or show us more, I should say. 
 
ZELENY: No doubt. I mean, no doubt the exhaustion certainly is hanging over all of, you know, our conversations with voters. It's very clear right here 
 
 in Wisconsin. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVE FLANNERY, WISCONSIN VOTER: I'm ready for it to be over. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Dave Flannery is exhausted by the election. 
 
FLANNERY: It's getting more and more difficult to listen to all the vitriol and that sort of thing. 
 
ZELENY: From his apple orchard in battleground Wisconsin, he's had a front row seat to the caustic campaign. When we met earlier this year, Flannery 
 
 was fed up with the political division and dysfunction. 
 
FLANNERY: What else can you think about it? It's a mess. 
 
ZELENY: How does it get fixed? 
 
FLANNERY: I wish I knew. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): With the election days away, we paid another visit. He said he's voting for Kamala Harris. 
 
Is it a vote for Vice President Harris or against Donald Trump? 
 
FLANNERY: For Harris. No, let me rephrase that. Both. Both, yes. 
 
ZELENY: It's a vote against Trump and for Harris. 
 
FLANNERY: Yes. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): The fight is on for Wisconsin. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Are we ready to win? 
 
ZELENY: With Harris and Trump set to make dueling visits Friday. 
 
TRUMP: We're winning. We're winning. 
 
ZELENY: For the second time in three days. 
 
CAROLINE QUINLAN, WISCONSIN VOTER FOR TRUMP: I don't want to make any predictions because I think it's that close. 
 
ZELENY: Caroline Quinlan does not see a perfect option on either ticket. When we spoke this summer her frustrations were clear. 
 
QUINLAN: Both parties have their extreme side and no one's in the middle. 
 
ZELENY: From her vantage point in the critical suburbs of Milwaukee, no longer dominated by Republicans alone, she said issues are driving her 
 
 decision. 
 
QUINLAN: I'm going to vote for Trump. You know, when he talks in the big arena sometimes I'm like I wish he would tone down his rhetoric and 
 
 everything. But at the end of the day I want a person that's going to fix the economy, border, and then national security. 
 
ZELENY: A yearlong conversation with voters paints a more nuanced picture of the electorate. For one, the gender gap is hardly absolute. 
 
BRUCE NEAD, WISCONSIN VOTER: January 6th which was a direct threat against our democracy. Trying to overthrow a legal election. That was it for me. 
 
ZELENY: To win, the Harris coalition depends upon people like Bruce Nead, raised in a Republican family whose front yard makes his disdain for the 
 
 former president clear. And Tiffany Koehler, a Republican who is casting a rare vote for the Democratic presidential candidate. 
 
TIFFANY KOEHLER, WISCONSIN REPUBLICAN VOTER FOR HARRIS: We used to be the party of limited government. We used to be the party of fiscal 
 
 responsibility. I know there's a lot of Republicans voting for the vice president because we really want to close this chapter in history. 
 
ZELENY: For Trump, the path to victory not only depends on strength in deep red rural areas but whether he diminishes Democratic margins in the suburbs 
 
 outside Madison. Brandon Maly leads the Republican Party in fast-growing Dane County. 
 
BRANDON MALY, CHAIR, DANE COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY: People think of Madison as such a traditional liberal bastion, but you get outside of Madison, Dane 
 
 County is the second most populated county. 
 <br>[10:10:06]
 
If he does not get at least 23 percent of the vote in Dane County he will not win Wisconsin. If he gets 25 percent or above, he wins, guaranteed. 
 
ZELENY: The campaign draws to a close with many wild cards, including third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. whose name remains on the 
 
 ballot. 
 
ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., POLITICIAN: I don't want your vote. I want you to vote for Donald Trump. 
 
ZELENY: Back at the Apple Holler Orchard, Flannery sees a hopeful light at the end of a dark campaign. 
 
FLANNERY: It's more than about politics. The future of the country is more important than whether you're a Republican or Democrat. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ZELENY (on-camera): So more than one million Wisconsin voters have already cast their ballots early. The deadline for doing that is Sunday. And of 
 
 course, even more will vote on Tuesday. 
 
So, Erica, the outcome of this race no doubt depends on Wisconsin and the other pieces of the puzzle known as the blue wall -- Erica. 
 
HILL: Absolutely., Jeff, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
So we've been talking now for weeks and as jeff just laid out, we see it there in Wisconsin, this race is neck and neck. And there are a handful of 
 
 states including Wisconsin that could decide the winner. But it's not just that one. 
 
CNN's Harry Enten now has a closer look at some new CNN polling focused on Georgia and North Carolina, and the paths those states could provide to 
 
 those key 270 electoral votes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: The big blue wall runs through the Great Lake battleground states. That's Kamala Harris's best path. You know, 
 
 Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, that would get Kamala Harris to 270 electoral votes. 
 
But let's just say there's some leakage in that great big blue wall. Let's just say that Kamala Harris loses in Michigan, well, then she drops below 
 
 270 electoral votes. But you know what get her right back over it? Let's just say we give her the state of North Carolina. She gets up to 271 
 
 electoral votes. 
 
So the bottom line is the southeast states can very much sort of prove as a backup path potentially for Kamala Harris. Let's just say we're going to 
 
 put Michigan back in the blue but we give Pennsylvania away to Donald Trump. Now Kamala is again south of 270 electoral votes. Well, what can sub 
 
 in? Well, why don't we give her the state of Georgia. Right? It went blue last time. That gets Kamala Harris well above 270 electoral votes. 
 
The bottom line is this, look, Kamala Harris's best path to 270 electoral votes still runs through that great big blue wall up here in the Great 
 
 Lakes states. But the southeast provides this backup to her. 
 
One little last nugget I'll sort of point out to you, you know, we're talking about the importance of Georgia and North Carolina, when was the 
 
 last time a Republican won without Georgia? You've got to go all the way back to 1980. Of course, Jimmy Carter was the Democratic nominee, not a big 
 
 surprise. He carried his home state. How about North Carolina? You have to go all the way back to 1956. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: And our thanks to Harry for that. Let's get a closer look at the economy now. U.S. jobs taking a bit of a hit in October. We were warned it 
 
 could happen thanks to the extreme weather, Hurricanes Helene and Milton here in the U.S., and also those labor strikes we've been covering. 
 
This is the final economic report before election day. And as you can see, there just 12,000 jobs were created last month, far fewer than the initial 
 
 estimates. But as I noted there were some warnings ahead of time, which means that headline does not tell the full story. 
 
For that, let's turn to my colleague Julia Chatterley, who has more. 
 
So take us beyond that headline, Julia, and those sort of caveats that had been put out ahead of this report. 
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: And they were big caveats. To your point, strikes and storms absolutely key to this report. The strikes 
 
 that we've been witnessing Boeing were expected to take around 40,000 jobs net off the overall number. And what the Bureau of Labor Statistics has 
 
 said to us today is, look, they literally can't quantify the net impact of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton but they know that it was severe. 
 
So with that information in mind, then you look at the number that we've got. Now we've got 12,000 jobs, as you said, added net in October. It's a 
 
 fraction. It's around a 10th of what we were expecting so this is indeed a jarring report. Let's be clear. We also got revisions to both August and 
 
 September to the tune of around 112,000 jobs net. So it does again give you the sense of a cooling labor market. We knew that already. 
 
It's not collapsing which is what you could think if you looked at that number in isolation, particularly compared to the job gains that we've seen 
 
 year to date. If I give you a look at the sectors as well, this is also important because this helps tell the story. 
 
Manufacturing, that sector took a big hit. We lost around 46,000 jobs in that sector. We also saw temporary health and services, lose around 49,000 
 
 jobs. Government, though, that's where we saw hiring, 40,000 jobs added there. And healthcare was a really good addition sector as well. 
 
One thing I would draw your attention to, and Erica, you and I were talking about this last hour, the unemployment rate didn't change compared to last 
 
 month. 4.1 percent. 
 <br>[10:15:03]
 
So if anything that's what you look at here to get a sense of the relative stability and looking through some of the anomalies that we know hit this 
 
 report this month. I will say 34 days until the next one. And I hope I have more clarity for you in a month's time. But four days out from a 
 
 presidential election, this is an uncomfortable report nonetheless. 
 
HILL: Uncomfortable, although important as you point out, that unemployment rate held steady. This is also just one piece of the economic data that we 
 
 were given this week. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Right. 
 
HILL: So overall taking all of that into account, inflation, GDP, private sector payrolls, which were fairly strong earlier in the week, what is the 
 
 broader picture, the bigger picture that that paints? 
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a solid economy headed into a presidential election. I think that's what we have to keep in mind. Yes, there's been pain. 
 
 There's been high prices over the last three years, but even the data that we got this week suggests that the rise in prices that we've seen are now 
 
 virtually back to the Federal Reserve's target. 
 
The good news in all of this, I think, is that the Federal Reserve most definitely will cut a quarter of a percentage point, potentially more next 
 
 week. But I think we have to take a step back from this one data point and look at the broader jobs market, which is cooling, it's not collapsing, and 
 
 there are plenty of economies around the world that would look at the us growth rate at the moment and say, we'll have that, quite frankly, because 
 
 they're seeing it significantly weaker. 
 
Doesn't mean this report won't be politicized. But they're just going to try and ignore the noise. 
 
HILL: Yes, which is so, so important. We focus -- as we always say, my friend, we focus on the facts, Julia. Thank you. 
 
CHATTERLEY: We try. Thank you. 
 
HILL: Well, the death toll has risen sharply now in Spain. More than 200 deaths now attributed to that worst flooding that the country has seen in 
 
 decades. A year's worth of rain falling in a matter of hours this week. Primarily impacting the country's southern and eastern regions. Emergency 
 
 workers have been trying desperately to rescue trapped survivors and also to recover the dead. 500 extra soldiers have been deployed to those 
 
 affected areas to help with efforts. 
 
Here's more from CNN's Atika Shubert in Valencia. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ATIKA SHUBERT, JOURNALIST (voice-over): A dramatic rescue in Spain's Valencia region, a young baby hoisted to safety from the flood waters 
 
 below. With the country still reeling from the worst flooding in decades, emergency services are still battling to find survivors. As the water 
 
 subsides, the scale of the damage here is only starting to be revealed. 
 
The littered vehicles piled up like garbage, an indication of the ferocity of the floodwater that tore through these streets. A massive cleanup 
 
 operation now underway as many remain without power or water. Many roads are totally blocked, hampering relief efforts. 
 
As residents pick their way through what is left of their towns, now slick with mud, one question remains. How could this happen? So much water, so 
 
 fast, with seemingly very little warning from authorities. 
 
Now this area, La Torre, is actually very close to Valencia City and it is also very close to the river. The waters just swept right through here. And 
 
 many people here at Fulga say they didn't get the alert until it was too late. 
 
ADAN, RESIDENT OF LA TORRE (through translation): The problem is the alarm on the phone came really late at night. I saw on the TV the cars floating 
 
 on a nearby street and I thought the water must be coming my way. I went out onto the balcony and I saw the wave coming. 
 
SHUBERT: The death toll here is expected to rise as recovery teams scour for bodies. Many like this woman searching the streets for their loved 
 
 ones. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Adolfo. 
 
SHUBERT: The Spanish prime minister visiting the region Thursday warned the threat from the storm was not over yet. 
 
PEDRO SANCHEZ, PRIME MINISTER OF SPAIN (through translation): To the citizens who live in the provinces of Valencia and also Castellon, please, 
 
 the damage continues and please stay home. 
 
SHUBERT: The severity of the flood seemed to catch everyone out, with a year's worth of rain falling in just a few hours in some places, according 
 
 to Spain's Meteorological Office. But many still asking why in a developed and advanced country like this one couldn't more people be saved. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: And our thanks again to Atika Shubert in Valencia for that report. 
 
Dozens of buildings bombed into rubble. That is how the scene is being described in Beirut's southern suburbs from the pictures you see here. What 
 
 do today's airstrikes by Israel mean for this latest ceasefire push. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:21:39]
 
HILL: Lebanese prime minister says today's strikes in Beirut are a sign Israel is rejecting efforts toward a ceasefire. Israel pounding 
 
 neighborhoods in southern Beirut for the first time in nearly a week. The damage is being described as massive. Dozens of buildings flattened 
 
 according to a state media. The IDF says it was targeting Hezbollah sites. All of this, though, coming after a fresh round of U.S. diplomacy. 
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond joining me now from Tel Aviv. 
 
So in terms of that diplomacy, you had U.S. officials who had said yesterday the talks were, in their words, substantive and constructive. I 
 
 know there was a focus on a potential ceasefire in Lebanon. Then we see the result today and these comments from the Lebanese prime minister. What are 
 
 the Israelis saying about a possible ceasefire? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, they certainly see a clear opportunity right now to reach a ceasefire but that doesn't mean that 
 
 they're going to slow down or take their foot off the gas as it relates to their military campaign in Lebanon, and in fact, they view the intensifying 
 
 and the intensity of these airstrikes in Lebanon as part and parcel of their negotiating strategy. 
 
And that's exactly what we've seen over the course of the last week. Not only those strikes in the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight the first 
 
 that we have seen in nearly a week and very intense airstrikes at that, as we saw some of the quite striking images from Beirut overnight, but also of 
 
 course, we've seen strikes in the northeastern city of Baalbek that killed 19 people. We've seen continued strikes in southern Lebanon as well. 
 
And that's because, as one Israeli official told me all negotiations are going to be held under fire. And that's because they believe, Israeli 
 
 government officials believe that the military gains that they have had against Hezbollah over the course of the last couple of months is what has 
 
 gotten them to this point now, where Hezbollah is entertaining ceasefire negotiations and is willing to engage in a ceasefire without Israel ending 
 
 its war in Gaza, which previously was a major condition that Hezbollah had indeed laid out. 
 
And so even as we are seeing these strikes, that's not necessarily a sign that Israel is not interested in these ceasefire talks. Indeed, they 
 
 believe that they -- these military achievements, give them the space to move in that direction. 
 
Now, we know that some of the top U.S. officials who were in Israel yesterday to have these negotiations, they've now returned to Washington 
 
 after what was effectively a last minute push before the elections to see if a ceasefire could be achieved. People on all sides are talking about 
 
 major progress in these talks and talking about them as constructive, but there's still a lot of details to work out clearly and that's likely going 
 
 to take more than just a few days. 
 
HILL: Separately, Jeremy, when it comes to Iran, there is some chatter that Iran could in fact strike Israel soon in retaliation for Israel's 
 
 retaliation. As the back and forth continues is there a time frame? 
 
DIAMOND: Well, a high level Iranian source told our colleague Fred Pleitgen, excuse me, that the Iranian military was considering a, quote, 
 
 "definitive and painful strike" against Israel and that it would probably come before the U.S. presidential election, which is, of course, just days 
 
 away. But we really don't know exactly when Iran will carry out this attack. But certainly the Israeli military is preparing for that 
 
 possibility with one military source saying that Israel is now at a, quote, "high level of readiness," but they are still assessing the decision-making 
 
 process that is happening inside of Iran. 
 <br>[10:25:09]
 
And look, it's not just about the timing. It's also about the type of response that Iran might carry out, which will determine the course of 
 
 things going forward. Will this be, you know, a tit-for-tat? Will it be escalatory or will it instead be a largely symbolic response that allows 
 
 Iran to save face without escalating the situation in the region further? 
 
All of those are very much distinctive possibilities. But depending on what they do will determine whether or not Israel feels the need to strike back 
 
 once again -- Erica. 
 
HILL: Jeremy Diamond live in Tel Aviv at this hour, thank you. 
 
Taking a look at the situation in Gaza, 13 people killed when an airstrike hit two houses near a refugee camp. It's a camp that was also hit last 
 
 week. The United Nations says vital medical supplies were destroyed when the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza was attacked on Thursday. 
 
 Supplies that had arrived just days ago. And you know, of course, how desperately needed those medical supplies are. 
 
The U.N. also says deliveries of food, medicine and other aid hit its lowest point in October. The lowest point since the war began. A new 
 
 Israeli law could further restrict the U.N. agency to help Palestinians in Gaza, making the situation on the ground increasingly dire especially for 
 
 children. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RACHAEL CUMMINGS, GAZA HUMANITARIAN DIRECTOR, SAVE THE CHILDREN: The water and sanitation supplies, the food, the essential life-saving interventions 
 
 that agencies like Save the Children would be able to provide to populations in need are being severely restricted. The cessation of UNRWA 
 
 in Gaza would be catastrophic. Gaza is reliant for obviously decades on UNRWA to provide essential services, health care, education. 
 
They are running shelters for those that are displaced, and they are also providing fuel for international organizations like Save the Children to 
 
 allow us to reach the children and the populations that are most vulnerable. So the situation is dire and any disruption to the services 
 
 that UNRWA are currently providing, again, would be catastrophic for the people and the children in Gaza. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Well, still ahead here on CONNECT THE WORLD, Spain left reeling after its worst flooding in decades. Why researchers say climate change is the 
 
 most likely reason behind the intensity of those downpours. Plus, a look at what is at stake for the environment as American voters go to the polls and 
 
 make their choice for president. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Welcome back. It is just half past the hour here in New York. We're following a developing story out of Serbia. 
 <br>[10:30:02]
 
Eight people we're learning have been killed in the town of Novi Sad. This happened when the roof of a railway station collapsed earlier today 
 
 according to the country's interior minister, Again, this was in Novi Sad in Serbia. Eight people killed when that roof collapsed at a train station. 
 
 We will continue to follow that for further developments. 
 
In Spain, we have been closely watching the developments there on the heels of this flash flooding that killed more than 200 people. It was the worst 
 
 flooding for the country in decades. Emergency workers still trying desperately to rescue trapped survivors and also to recover bodies. That 
 
 torrential rainfall was about 12 percent heavier, twice as likely, it turns out, compared to a cooler pre-industrial climate. All this coming from 
 
 climate researchers. 
 
For more, I'm joined by CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. 
 
Allison, we have been told and we have certainly seen it in this country and other places around the globe these warming temperatures, these warmer 
 
 seas, they do lead to these more frequent and more severe storms. 
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: They do. And the evidence is in the numbers. So when you look at a system like this and you see how much rain 
 
 fell, numerous locations picking up 300, 400 millimeters of rain in just a few short hours, you have to put that into context. So let's take a look. 
 
 So this town in particular that picked up 491 millimeters in just eight hours, that is more than they received in an entire year. 
 
So imagine getting a year's worth of rain in less than 12 hours. Again, when you have numbers like this, but it's spread out over 12 months, the 
 
 land can accommodate that. It can do OK with it, not when it gets it in less than 12 hours. And that's why you've seen some of those photos, the 
 
 videos, incredible images of what happened. But now let's take a different view. Let's look from space. 
 
This image is from the U.S. Geological Survey. This black area here. This is the sea, the green is the land portion. This is before the flooding took 
 
 place. Now we fast forward to afterwards and you can see all of this new blue color right through here. That is all of the excess water that is now 
 
 just sitting on the ground in what would normally be roads and villages and towns. 
 
Here's another image. This is of Valencia. You can see here this line that kind of runs just south of downtown area. Thats the Turia River. Now notice 
 
 this is before, now we fast forward to after the flooding. You can see that turning more into like a brown, muddy color for the water. And also 
 
 overflowing into some of the nearby streets as well. So all of that water having no place to go, just finds the lowest point in elevation. 
 
Here's another image of Valencia, just a different part of town. Again, you can see there all of that muddy water flowing not just in the river, but 
 
 then also out into some of the fields in the streets into people's homes and businesses. Same thing here. Now this spot right through here, this is 
 
 a very low lying area, but that's where all of that water is going to go when it has nowhere else to go especially when the groundwater is full. 
 
A lot of the sewage systems that you would have are overrun at this point. All of that water having nowhere to go just goes down to the lowest point 
 
 it can. And it just sits for prolonged periods of time. Now, the unfortunate part about this is there is still more rain on the way. Now 
 
 we're not talking 300 millimeters and 400 millimeters worth of rain, but at this point, even some of these areas that get, say, 25 millimeters, 50 
 
 millimeters when it's on top of 300 millimeters and 400 millimeters from earlier in the week, all that really does is end up exacerbating some of 
 
 the flooding that's already there. 
 
HILL: Yes, absolutely. Allison, really appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
CHINCHAR: Thank you. 
 
HILL: When we talk about the impacts of climate change or global warming on the weather, you see it in those moments. But for some people, when you 
 
 don't see it in the day to day, it's hard to really grasp the impact of those changes. A recent Gallup poll found climate change doesn't register 
 
 as an extremely important presidential campaign issue among American voters in this year's election. 
 
The top issues as we have focused on a lot the economy, immigration. Scientists, though warn that ignoring the environment could be a major 
 
 mistake as the world is facing, of course, increased severe catastrophic weather conditions. In a new analysis piece for CNN Digital, our chief 
 
 climate correspondent, Bill Weir, also echoed some of those sentiments, writing, "Scientists are warning humanity has run out of time to deal with 
 
 an existential global threat. One of the candidates wants to do something about it, the other has said the human caused climate crisis is a, 'hoax.'" 
 
And our chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir, joining me now. 
 
Bill, always good to see you. It is fascinating to me. And I know I don't need to say this to you, since you deal with this every day, but how little 
 
 oftentimes this breaks through and is it really about when I'm not seeing it, I don't feel the impact? Is it that simple? 
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it probably has to do with decades of deliberate misinformation by some of the most 
 
 powerful corporations in the world and then their friends in politics, as well, saying that the earth always changes and such and such. You've heard 
 
 all of the talking points. But now you've got every scientist at every level of American government warning about the costs of this. 
 <br>[10:35:03]
 
Even if your house hasn't burned down, insurance rates, supply chains, property values, all are being affected now in real time. There's over a 
 
 million species of plants and animals on the risk of extinction. There's a prediction for over a billion climate refugees by 2050. And we've seen it. 
 
 You can just see it in Spain today if you watch it there. 
 
And looking back through American politics, it's hard to find a more consequential and just yawning chasm between two candidates where one is 
 
 all of government approach to try to solve this, the Democrats under Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, you know, of course, was a tiebreaking vote for the 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act, which has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment. 
 
A lot in Republican red districts, most of that money is going into places like Georgia and Texas, which is the greenest state in the United States in 
 
 terms of clean energy because it is now so cheap. And on the other side, there is Donald Trump, who calls it all a hoax, who says, we may get, you 
 
 know, a few millimeters of sea level rise in 400 years, which just defies all logic and all evidence to the contrary right now. 
 
So, yes, when pollsters come out people think of climate as sort of a menu item, right, which how do you rank this when it's the whole restaurant, 
 
 everything else, the economy, foreign policy, health, housing, transportation, depends on ecosystems and balance and a sensible energy 
 
 stream. 
 
HILL: Yes. 
 
WEIR: And then there's the business side of this. I talked to Bill Gates about this. And if a Trump win, what would that mean for all of the clean 
 
 tech companies he's invested in? He just says it sends a really stupid message to the rest of the world that we're not serious about this as 
 
 hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested into power plants. It takes 30 years to plan for. So if there's sort of a waffling from the most 
 
 powerful economy, somebody will take that investment somewhere else. That's Gates' opinion. 
 
HILL: Yes. And it's, you know, you mentioned how tied climate is to everything. Immigration is a perfect example. Refugee crisis and 
 
 immigration and the impact of climate there. You talked about the differing views of the importance of climate of both candidates. But what about in 
 
 terms of platform? 
 
WEIR: Yes. Well -- 
 
HILL: What's there for me to look? 
 
WEIR: On day one, President Trump is vowing to undo everything he possibly can of the Biden administration including pulling the U.S. out of the Paris 
 
 Climate Accords and maybe severing all international ties, which would break down all those agreements there if the biggest, richest country with 
 
 the most historic pollution isn't going to be part of the cleanup there as well, and rolling back, you know, these laws on tailpipe emissions, 
 
 methane, these efficiency programs. 
 
But so much momentum is now built in that a lot of experts think it will be hard to unroll it because so much money is being spent in Republican 
 
 districts. Buddy Carter, who's a MAGA congressman from Georgia, loves EVs because the biggest battery plant in the country is being built in his 
 
 district right now. 
 
But there's also how to manage these particular disasters when they hit. You can see the differences in in the two administrations on how they 
 
 handled those disasters, those that are baked in. The Harris campaign is not really running climate front and center. I think they're probably 
 
 betting on the fact that climate voters know this stark choice and might choose her and even those voters who are upset at the Biden administration 
 
 for creating the biggest petro state in human history. 
 
U.S. is exporting more liquefied natural gas than the rest of the world. But it is there. It is just an obvious choice as to where the momentum is 
 
 going to go right now and whether or not there's enough of that sort of deliberate misinformation and doubt to buoy Trump in the swing states, that 
 
 will make all the difference. But again, in previous elections it might have affected the U.S. This one has planetary stakes involved that most 
 
 people may not wrap their heads around right now, but it's becoming obvious by the day. Just look to Spain. 
 
HILL: Yes, it's so true. Bill, appreciate it. Good to see you, my friend. Thanks. 
 
WEIR: You bet. 
 
HILL: We've been talking so much about the U.S. presidential election, how close this race is, and specifically in those key battleground states 
 
 including the state of Wisconsin, which is a major focus for both candidates today as they really hone in on those blue wall states, which 
 
 are critical to winning the election. 
 
New polling shows there is a razor thin margin in another one of those blue wall states, Michigan, a state which, like Wisconsin, Donald Trump won in 
 
 2016 but lost in 2020. 
 
John King recently spent some time in Michigan, where he spoke with college students who are expected to play a key role in determining the winner. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm calling to ask -- 
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Michigan Republican headquarters five days out. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- if President Trump can count on you in your support in this election? 
 
KING: A basement phone bank shift, Ralph Brennan among the Michigan State students helping turn out the vote. 
 
RALPH BRENNAN, CAMPUS COORDINATOR AT MICHIGAN TRUMP TEAM: I think there's a red wave coming, and especially in Michigan. And I think people will be 
 
 very surprised on how many people vote Republican in this election. 
 
KING: Brennan is 21, a junior economics major from Ohio, but he registered in Michigan for his first vote for president. 
 <br>[10:40:04]
 
BRENNAN: I was a sixth grader when Trump got elected in '16, and I watched him, you know, come to the White House. I watched the inauguration. I 
 
 watched all the great things he did. 
 
KING: Trump struggled with young voters in 2016 and 2020. Brennan predicts better numbers this time especially among young men. 
 
BRENNAN: Good-bye, boys. Thank you, guys. 
 
KING: And especially after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his campaign and backed Trump. 
 
BRENNAN: I've heard a lot of young guys say how important RFK was to their President Trump vote. You know ever since Trump kind of brought RFK onto 
 
 the team, onto the campaign, a lot of young men voters really liked that and kind of resonate with RFK and what he's done. 
 
KING: In a dead heat race organization can be the difference. 
 
JADE GRAY, DIGITAL ORGANIZING MANAGER, PROGRESS MICHIGAN: Hey, did you go vote yet? 
 
KING: Halloween spirit helps. 
 
GRAY: These cookies, too. 
 
KING: Treats as well. 
 
GRAY: Will you fill out one of our pledge to vote things? 
 
KING: Jade Gray is a progressive organizer, former co-president of the College Democrats here at the University of Michigan. Back on campus to 
 
 encourage early voting. 
 
GRAY: We know that when we vote, we win, and quite frankly, we're getting a lot of people out to vote. 
 
KING: Gray's optimism is a big shift. This is our fourth Ann Arbor visit in a year. Back at the beginning, she was down about President Biden's 
 
 prospects, and later she was worried Vice President Harris would still lose too many young voters because of student anger over the Israel-Hamas 
 
 conflict. 
 
GRAY: Have you guys voted yet? OK. Yay. Thanks. 
 
KING: But she is upbeat now and credits a mix of constant organizing and a smarter approach from the Harris campaign. 
 
GRAY: It was not just the candidate that switched but it was really their whole approach to the campaign. And leaning into this idea that memes and 
 
 internet culture is a, you know, a mode of communicating about politics has totally transformed this race, and I think will be, you know, one of the 
 
 biggest reasons to one of the biggest things we should credit, I'm saying when but if she wins. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: And our thanks again to John King for that report. 
 
You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. Just ahead here new details about the evidence the grand jury is now hearing in the criminal investigation into 
 
 music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Rapper Youn Thug is now out of jail and will not serve any more time behind bars following his racketeering trial in Atlanta, Georgia. This is 
 
 part of a plea deal. He was sentenced to time served on Thursday after pleading guilty to some charges. No contest to some others. Young Thug, 
 
 real name Jeffrey Williams, was accused of leading a violent street gang which could have put him behind bars for the rest of his life. In all, he 
 
 actually ended up serving more than 900 days behind bars and will now be on probation for 15 years. 
 
Sources tell CNN a federal grand jury which is meeting regularly in the continuing criminal trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs. Well, on 
 
 Thursday that grand jury heard from a witness who said he has evidence, video evidence of Combs victimizing celebrities. 
 <br>[10:45:02]
 
CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister spoke earlier about this with my colleagues on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Here's more of what's been happening since that initial 
 
 indictment of Combs in September. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: Since then, he has been held in custody in Brooklyn as he awaits his trial, which is set for 
 
 next year. But as he has been held in custody this investigation, this federal investigation has been ongoing. I have had sources telling me over 
 
 the past month that witnesses have been regularly meeting with federal investigators and now I have three sources who tell me that the grand jury 
 
 has been regularly convening now. 
 
Yesterday, Kate, the grand jury heard from a male witness, as you said, who does not claim that he himself was abused by Combs but he claims to have 
 
 evidence, video footage that he says contains footage of Combs allegedly victimizing celebrities. Now, we do not know the celebrities' names, and 
 
 it's unclear what exactly he testified about and what jurors have said. But his attorney tells me on the record that he did testify in front of the 
 
 grand jury yesterday. 
 
Now, this is the latest development in this ongoing saga, Kate. We know that Combs has at least two dozen civil suits against him. He denies all of 
 
 these allegations. He says that he has never sexually assaulted anyone. And I reached out to his team yesterday. They did not respond to comment about 
 
 grand jury proceedings. But in a recent filing, his team did say that they believe that attorneys and their accusers have been speaking to the media 
 
 and telling false information to the media, which they say is going to limit their client from having a fair trial. 
 
Now, one more piece of news for you, Kate, as we got this reporting about this grand jury testimony yesterday, the government this week in a filing 
 
 also says that they have obtained 60 devices from Combs that they say has more evidence that they are looking into.

HILL: Russia's foreign minister is praising Moscow's close contact with North Korea. Speaking alongside his North Korean counterpart, Sergei Lavrov 
 
 said cooperation between the two countries is helping to solve what he referred to as important tasks for both nations. 
 
All of this comes, of course, as Russia sidesteps questions on the thousands of North Korean troops that Western intelligence has detected in 
 
 Russia. Troops which could be headed into Ukraine in just a matter of days. That's coming from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who spoke 
 
 alongside U.S. and South Korean officials on Thursday, and as Oren Liebermann reports, the U.S. says it is now seeing clear signs the North 
 
 Koreans are in fact gearing up for battle. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: In a meeting between the U.S. secretaries of state and defense and their South Korean counterparts, the 
 
 U.S. went further than it's ever gone before in talking about North Korean troops and their involvement, not only with Russia but in the war in 
 
 Ukraine. 
 
In a matter of days here, the U.S. went from saying there were 3,000 North Korean troops training in Russia, to saying there are 10,000, including 
 
 8,000 of those of whom are near or in the Kursk region of Russia, where the Ukrainians have conducted a successful offensive and seized some Russian 
 
 territory there. 
 
Now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying it is only a matter of days, quote, "in the coming days" that we expect to see North Korean troops 
 
 involved in the fighting and the war in Ukraine. He also went further than that to talk about the type of training they have received, and that makes 
 
 it very clear they are becoming part of Russia's war machine. 
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Russia has been training DPRK soldiers in artillery, UAVs, basic infantry operations, including trench 
 
 clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in front line operations. 
 
LIEBERMANN: With the South Korean ministers of defense and foreign affairs here, North Korea making their displeasure obvious with a launch of an 
 
 intercontinental ballistic missile. The longest flight time we have seen nearly 90 minutes from North Korea. Here, it's about a year since they last 
 
 tested and fired off an ICBM here, so it appears they may be showing one of their more advanced missiles and advanced missile launchers here. 
 
The U.S. and South Korea are watching this very closely and making it clear there will be some form of response and a deep intelligence sharing and 
 
 cooperation on that front as well. The U.S. and South Korea carrying out a largescale aerial exercise following that launch, more than 100 advanced 
 
 fighter jets from the U.S. -- from South Korea so making it clear there will be military cooperation when North Korea carries out these sorts of 
 
 tests. 
 
With South Korean officials here, both the U.S. and South Korea here say they'd like to see more engagement from the Chinese on trying to get the 
 
 North Koreans to step back. But so far, all South Korea is saying is that China is waiting and watching.

ELENI GIOKOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What did I do wrong? 
 
JUDY SANDERSON, FASHION DESIGNER: You're making yourself look older. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[10:50:04]
 
HILL: Fashion not for the faint of heart. What happened when CNN's Eleni Giokos got a makeover from some of the top stylists in Paris at Fashion 
 
 Week. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: All right. A day after Halloween, maybe you're recovering. Packing away the Halloween costume. Let's talk a little bit about, though, your 
 
 signature style. As top designers at Paris Fashion Week told my colleague Eleni Giokos it's really all about finding your edge. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GIOKOS: Failed on this outfit. 
 
SANDERSON: You didn't fail. It's just that -- 
 
DAVID TLALE, FASHION DESIGNER: Out of 10, I'll give you five. 
 
SANDERSON: The minute I saw you, I said, that girl needs more edge. 
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): I'm Eleni Giokos. In my correspondent career, I've covered wars, natural disasters, and financial crises. But I've now been 
 
 sent to cover -- 
 
Paris Fashion Week. 
 
(Voice-over): Entering the epicenter of haute couture can be slightly intimidating, but pushing forwards like I belong. I'm here to find out how 
 
 my style holds up at Paris Fashion Week. 
 
Would you be walking with me at Paris Fashion Week? 
 
TLALE: Not in this dress. 
 
GIOKOS: But what did I do wrong? 
 
SANDERSON: You're making yourself look older. Well, let's bring some edge here. 
 
GIOKOS: Yes? Let's do it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our bestselling necklace. Yes? 
 
GIOKOS: Yes. 
 
TLALE: Imagine if you wear that. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can see it on you. 
 
GIOKOS: Yes. 
 
SANDERSON: I would introduce masculine pieces in your closet because you clearly have a lot of feminine pieces. Look at that. It's the contrast, 
 
 right, it's always the contrast. 
 
TLALE: I'd put you in this black dress quickly. Very chic. 
 
SANDERSON: This outfit that I'm wearing you would completely rock it. 
 
GIOKOS: You think so? 
 
SANDERSON: You would. 
 
GIOKOS: Got to try it on. 
 
TLALE: There we go. 
 
GIOKOS: Big reveal. 
 
SANDERSON: Accessorize with the right edgy items. My choice of sunglasses. So fashionable. 
 
GIOKOS: Yes, but I mean -- no. I look ridiculous. 
 
SANDERSON: You don't. 
 
GIOKOS: I do. 
 
SANDERSON: The boots I like. Stick with those. The shoes are the ones that are contrasting. 
 
GIOKOS: (INAUDIBLE), 
 
SANDERSON: Yes. Heels would be like, oh, we cannot be friends. Sneakers are always edgy, by the way. So when in doubt, you can put on some sneakers. 
 
 But these are my go-to. When in doubt you go for something like this. 
 
GIOKOS: Isn't it difficult to balance what you need to wear for work versus actually showing your personality and bringing that edge without it being 
 
 inappropriate? 
 
SANDERSON: It is difficult, but you need to get to a place where you are content and you know yourself. So I could easily be a news anchor and I'm 
 
 dressed like this. 
 
GIOKOS: Yes. 
 
SANDERSON: You know, I don't look inappropriate to be reading the news. But I feel edgy. 
 
TLALE: You got to work in style, my dear. Never have an off-day. Never. 
 
SANDERSON: So this is your new style, yes? 
 
GIOKOS: It's my new style. Got it. 
 
SANDERSON: I would dress you like this. You are edgy. This is it. 
 
TLALE: My job is done here, now you can conquer Paris. 
 
SERGE CARREIRA, DIRECTOR OF EMERGING BRANDS INITIATIVE, FHCM: Fashion is about all you feel. And that's the most important. And if you made that 
 
 choice, it means that you were feeling well in doing that choice, you know? And that's definitively what is important. 
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Fashion is a feeling, not about conforming your style. Right? 
 
SANDERSON: You are an amazing girl. I could totally be your friend. 
 
GIOKOS: But my outfit didn't make it -- didn't do it for your initially. 
 
SANDERSON: Initially no.

Well, James Bond movies are full of cars that often play a starring role right alongside those big named actors, including, of course, this Rolls-
 
 Royce Phantom from "Goldfinger."

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Many people have tried to involve themselves in my affairs, unsuccessfully. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Remarkable.

HILL: If you think that's remarkable, how about this new Rolls-Royce Phantom called Goldfinger? The company creating this one of a kind, modern 
 
 vehicle to honor the classic in honor of the movie's 60th anniversary. It took three years to complete for an anonymous client. The car perhaps, not 
 
 surprisingly, full of bond worthy gadgets, most of them in gold. No word, though, on just how much that ride would actually set you back. 
 
I'm going to go with priceless. 
 
That's going to do it for CONNECT THE WORLD on this Friday and this week. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend. Be sure to stay with CNN. NEWSROOM
