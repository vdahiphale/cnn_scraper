KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. Ahead on "CNN Newsroom".
 
The United States joins a growing list of countries evacuating its diplomatic personnel from Sudan. Other American citizens there, it's a different story for now. All this amid signs of ceasefire isn't holding. We'll look at how the White House is preparing for the legal fight to keep mifepristone on the market. And the Mississippi River is at a major flood stage. Ahead, we'll tell you who's in the danger zone.
 
ANNOUNCER:  Live from CNN Center, this is "CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber."
 
BRUNHUBER:  France is joining the U.S. and other countries in evacuating diplomats from Sudan as clashes erupt in the capital Khartoum. France's announcement came hours after the us pull out its own embassy staff as well as their families from the country. Washington says it intends to return to the embassy as soon as possible but the suspending operations was, "The only really feasible option."
 
U.S. also says, it doesn't foresee coordinating a government evacuation for private citizens. But the Department of Defense is looking at options to help them. CNN's Oren Liebermann has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  A successful Mission carried out in the dark of night in Sudan to evacuate the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. According to us officials, three Chinook helicopters took off from Djibouti, some 750 or 800 miles away from Khartoum flew into the country, landed, secured the embassy, and then brought out all of the embassy staff and their family members. A group of just under 100 people, according to U.S. officials, who briefed reporters on the operation and what happened around it during the operation and afterwards.
 
They were then brought out to Ethiopia. Again, a distance of some 750 or 800 miles, so the operation itself took several hours and consisted of about 100 troops, all of them special operations forces with the embassy staff successfully pulled out of the country. It is the temporary closure of the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. U.S. officials said, they do hope there's an opportunity here, a ceasefire that holds a resolution between the two warring parties there and an opportunity to reopen the embassy. But that is an enormous question as the fighting there enters its second week.
 
The U.S. was looking for a window of opportunity, a ceasefire that holds, essentially, to be able to evacuate the embassy itself. And the weekend brought that opportunity with the Eid al-Fitr Holiday. The two warring parties committed to the ceasefire even though there were reports of violations of that ceasefire. In the end, President Joe Biden made the decision to go ahead with the operation to evacuate the embassy.
 
Now, a large question. What about all the U.S. nationals? The private citizens who remain in the country, and there are thousands of them, many of them dual citizens, Sudanese-American. Right now, they have no help at the embassy with the closure of the embassy, but U.S. officials did say they are considering options for land routes there, if that's the way out of the country for many of these citizens.
 
Defense officials said, they are considering surveilling the land routes out and setting up perhaps a naval option, a maritime option at Port Sudan. And are looking at creating deconfliction lines so that to assist in the evacuation of U.S. citizens there who are trying to make their way out of the country.
 
Again, that under consideration. A very difficult question with the fighting continuing. But as we learned on Saturday, night the successful evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Khartoum, under 100 people there, the diplomatic staff and their family members brought safely out of the country via helicopter. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.

BRUNHUBER:  Earlier, CNN Military Analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton explained how a military Mission would have been conducted. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLONEL CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  The military forces engaged in this need to know what do the local commanders are doing on the ground, the local commanders in this case of the RSF and the Sudanese army. They need to know what their attitudes are. What they are going to be doing? How much control they're exercising over their own people? And whether or not they can trust them enough to, in essence, safe passage from the embassy compound to the airport, to that point of embarkation.
 
The people around that are making this happen, the intelligence operatives, the operational personnel, all of those people need to work together and, you know, in essence, make a decision whether or not these people are trustworthy and whether or not they can actually count on their guarantee of safe passage.
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
So, in this case, it worked. And they were able to, you know, get these warring factions to allow them to extricate the Americans from the embassy compound. And that, of course, is a very, very important part of this. You know, maybe they made some promises for the future. Maybe they did some other things. But it -- whatever they did, it clearly worked very well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  CNN's Stephanie Busari joins us now with more. So, Stephanie, many other countries, besides the U.S., obviously extricating their diplomats. But now, some are also trying to get their citizens out as well. So. what more can you tell us about all these efforts?
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA:  Good morning, Kim. So, in the last hour, Turkey had attempted to get its citizens out. But the -- this fragile ceasefire which has not held, you'll remember that 72-hour ceasefire period was agreed during this Muslim period of Eid to allow these evacuations to happen and people to get supplies and things like that.
 
But Turkey was forced to cancel and ask its citizens not to assemble in the area where it was going to carry out those evacuations. So, we'll -- we're still getting more information on that. But Turkey's evacuation not happening as planned. France, we heard earlier had managed to evacuate some of its diplomatic staff.
 
But the fighting, the ongoing fighting, which eyewitnesses are telling CNN is very loud and happening in the capital near the presidential palace is hampering these evacuation efforts, Kim. And it's very difficult for any, sort of, movement to go ahead.
 
But citizens are taking matters into their own hands. We're hearing of Sudanese citizens and other nationalities who are attempting to go by road to places to neighboring countries such as Egypt. Police called S1 (ph) in Southern Egypt, about 1,000 kilometers away from Khartoum, the capital by road. So. people are faced with these difficult situations. Do they stay in -- inside where supplies are dwindling. Food -- no food, no power, no water, or do they take the risk and get on the roads and face also being hit by artillery, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes, absolutely. Tough decisions there. Stephanie Busari reporting for us. Thank you so much. We appreciate that.
 
And the World Food Programme says, it's bracing for an influx of refugees from Sudan. The group estimates that between 10,000 and 20,000 people already arrived there, fleeing the violence. Beyond that, humanitarian aid has already been deployed but there is a pressing need for water, which also is said to be in short supply in Khartoum. One official adds, it's been harrowing to see so many children are crossing from Sudan into Chad.
 
The Biden administrations is looking to what's next after the Supreme Court moved to preserve access to a commonly used abortion drug. The ruling allows doctors to continue prescribing mifepristone in states that allow it, but it's ultimately unlikely to be the final word on regulation of the drug. Kevin Liptak has more from the White House.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN REPORTER:  Well, there was certainly sighs of relief here at the White House when that decision from the Supreme Court came out. And it was really sort of the best outcome that the Biden administration could have hoped for. But at the same time, what you hear from White House officials is that this is not the end of the road and they are prepared for quite a lengthy legal fight to come.
 
And you saw president Biden in his statement, which he released really within minutes of this decision being released, acknowledge that this is not the end of the road. And he said, in part, as a result of the Supreme Court's stay, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and effective use while we continue this fight in the courts. I continue to stand by FDA's evidence-based approval of mifepristone and my administration will continue to defend FDA's independent expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription drugs.
 
So, you hear him and their acknowledged that this is not the last say on this. Now, leading up to this decision, White House officials had been involved in quite an intensive effort to develop contingency options in case the restrictions on this drug remained in place. Those took place in the White House counsel's office at the Department of Justice, among the president's senior advisers, and those will continue as this continues to make its way through the courts, those options will remain on the table.
 
But at the same time, I think White House officials have been very candid that the president's authority here is fairly limited. And that if Americans want to see the abortion protections that were included in Roe versus Wade that were stripped away by the Supreme Court last year, if they want to see those restored, then they will have to elect lawmakers to Congress who will actually vote on that and make it law.
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
The president acknowledged that in his statement saying that the American people must continue to use their vote as their voice. And so, this will continue to be a very salient political issue. As the president gears up for re-election, potentially announcing as early as next week. Kevin Liptak, CNN, the White House.

BRUNHUBER:  Well, that ruling was on the minds of at least some of the declared and potential Republican candidates at a gathering in Iowa, Saturday. The Faith and Freedom Coalition spring kickoff as a way to court evangelical voters. Among those attending, Former Vice President Mike Pence, who said he wants to ban medication abortion. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  I think that chemical abortions, the mail order abortions that the Biden administration has now allowed should be banned, and I would support that view. But I also hope the Supreme Court will make the FDA do its job, a job that did not do 20 years ago. And actually, seriously examined of this medicine -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  And Pence's former boss, Donald Trump, addressed the gathering remotely. He touted the hundreds of anti-abortion rights federal judges confirmed during his administration, not to mention three Supreme Court justices. Nikki Haley, who's declared her candidacy, and Ron DeSantis, who hasn't, weren't there.
 
As water levels continue to rise on the Mississippi River, officials in the riverside city of McGregor, Iowa are urging residents to reduce water consumption until floodwaters recede. Heavy rain and rapid snow melt across the Upper Midwest has caused nine river gauges to hit major flood stage. The river is expected to rise almost three feet above that level by next week. Authorities across the region say, they're preparing for high water. McGregor say, crews have put flood walls in place, plug manholes and activated all pumps.
 
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis plans to request a major disaster declaration for the floods that devastated Southeast Florida 10 days ago. He declared a state of emergency in Broward County by executive order on April 13th. If the White House approves the request, it would provide federal assistance for public infrastructure, and also funds for more than 1,000 homes damaged by the flooding.
 
Dozens of residents of South Florida condo unit have until Tuesday to evacuate because the building isn't structurally safe. Inspection found the building has sagging floors, termite damage and a partially collapsed ceiling. About 55 people live in the Majestic Isle condominium. Residents will be allowed in their units were complete move out a day later -- at a later date, rather. The mayor of North Bay Village says, help is available for those who need it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRENT LATHAM, MAYOR, NORTH BAY VILLAGE, FLORIDA:  There is a loan for owners of apartments to be able to pay assessments without interest. There are also relocation resources in terms of finding places for residents to go to rent either short term or long term. And then we've been working directly with our friends over at Best Western for a safety that option for those who have no other option to be able to go to the Best Western Hotel for the short term until they can find other options.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Of course, two years ago, 98 people died when a condo north of Miami Beach partially collapsed in the middle of the night.
 
It was a startling scene in Utah. Have a look at this, as two houses slid from their foundations and off a cliff. The homes have been emptied for several months, a Facebook post from the city of Draper, Utah, said the buildings were deemed unfit for human habitation in October because shifting of the ground below cost cracks in the foundation. Two adjacent homes have been evacuated and the rest of the neighborhood will be evaluated for safety concerns.
 
Ukraine has received tens of billions of dollars and counting in military aid from allies. But now, Ukrainian diplomat says, that's only a start compared to what the country needs, we'll explain. And later hundreds of climate change activists mark Earth Day in London with a call for government action on global warming. We'll have details after the break coming up, please stay with us.

 <br>[04:15:00]
 
BRUNHUBER:  We're getting word of possible Russian progress in the embattled City of Bakhmut. It surrounded from three sides, with Ukrainians still holding parts of the city in a supply route to the west. One Ukrainian commander says Russian forces are now going all out to take the rest of Bakhmut. Ben Wedeman has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The battle for Bakhmut appears to have entered a critical phase with one Ukrainian commander acknowledging that, in his words, the line is not stable. Russian forces, supported by intense airstrikes, have made gains claiming to have seized three city blocks. This months-long battle has been the bloodiest since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.
 
The Ukrainians, nonetheless, insist that they are inflicting punishing losses on Russian forces. As Ukraine continues to prepare for its much-anticipated spring offensive, bolstered by hardware provided by its backers. US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, said, Friday, that the Ukraine defense contact group composed of 54 countries, including the 31 NATO member countries has, in recent months, provided Ukraine with more than 230 tanks and in excess of 1,550 armed vehicles.
 
The Ukrainians continue to press for more advanced warplanes/ But the offensive doesn't depend on weapons alone. The weather is also key. And recent heavy rains in eastern Ukraine have turned potential battlefields into seas of mud. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Ukraine says its allies need to ramp up the delivery of military aid in a major way. Kyiv has already received tens of billions of dollars-worth of military hardware, including the U.S. HIMARS missiles, that you see here.
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
But Ukraine's deputy foreign minister says, his country would need 10 times more to win the war this year. He's also urging allies to set aside one percent of their GDP towards helping Ukraine.
 
But for more, Barbie Nadeau joins us from Rome. So, Barbie, more Leopard tanks are on the way to Ukraine. But as we just heard, the refrain we keep hearing from Ukraine is they need more.
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right. And there are six Leopard 2 tanks coming from Spain and about 20 heavy military vehicles that should arrive in the next week or so, but they do want more. And also, President Zelenskyy said that he is urging countries to not go light on sanctions. A lot of these sanctions, of course, had expirations. And he wants these countries that are also offering this military hardware to not go light on sanctions because sanctions will continue to hurt Russia, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes, absolutely. And so, Barbie, Brazil's president made some comments about the conflict that raised some eyebrows. So, take us through what was said and the reaction as well.
 
NADEAU:  Yes, you know, these comments were made in Portugal during a state visit, where he was met with protesters. And he had earlier said that both sides were absolutely at fault for the war. And he said that the United States was encouraging the war by continuing the support. And so, he is -- he tweeted it, kind of walking back that a little bit saying that he did not ever equate Ukraine and Russia as equal. But it's still stirring up quite a bit of controversy here in Europe, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER:  All right. Thanks so much. Barbie Nadeau, appreciate it.
 
More than 3,000 people in the Russian City of Belgorod are returning home after a second bomb scare in a matter of days. State media says, they were evacuated on Saturday after the discovery of an unexploded bomb. Officials say, it's now been removed but there's no word on how it ended up there. But it was found in the same area that was rattled by this explosion Thursday night. State media says, it was caused by another bomb that was dropped by a Russian fighter jet during the midair emergency.
 
An image that depicts the sheer brutality of the war in Ukraine has won the World Press Photo of the Year award. The photo was taken by the associated press in the City of Mariupol last year, and it shows a pregnant woman being taken out of a bombed out maternity ward. Ukrainian surgeon said Kryna Kalinina and her baby later died. The jury that decided on the awards that it shows this image because it showed the absurdity and horror of the war. The picture was taken by Ukrainian war photographer Evgeniy Maloletka.
 
All right. Still ahead, tens of thousands of Israelis continue to protest against the government's plan to overhaul the judicial system. We'll have the latest after the break, stay with us.

BRUNHUBER:  Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber, this is "CNN Newsroom."
 
France has announced that it is evacuating diplomatic staff from Sudan as fighting rages between the military and paramilitary forces. It comes hours after the U.S. also pulled out American diplomats from the region. Witnesses say, the embassy workers were evacuated in six helicopters early Sunday morning. Now, all this comes as more fighting has erupted in the Sudanese capital Khartoum despite a 72-hour ceasefire.
 
Earlier CNN spoke with Justin Lynch, a researcher and co-author of the book "Sudan's Unfinished Democracy" about the chance of escalation. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTIN LYNCH, CO-AUTHOR, "SUDAN'S UNFINISHED DEMOCRACY":  What will really make this conflict worse is if regional states, particularly Egypt, which supports the Sudanese armed forces, and the United Arab Emirates which support the Rapid Support Forces. If they get involved at a significant scale, that's going to turn this into something that will be just even more catastrophic.

BRUNHUBER:  Prosecutors in Georgia have been investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in that state. And now, we're learning that Trump operatives also considered using breached voting data to decertified Georgia's 2021 Senate runoff. CNN Zachary Cohen has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Text messages between two men working for Trump's lawyers revealing for the first time that they considered using data from a breach of voting systems in Coffee County, Georgia to try to decertify the State Senate runoff. We now know that Trump allies not only tried to overturn the presidential election results in Georgia, but also weighed plans to upend the Senate runoff as well.
 
And at the center of those discussions was data related to voting software breach and other election systems used in Coffee County. A team of Trump allies managed to get their hands on that data in January 2021 after getting unauthorized access to the county's election office one day after the U.S. capitol riot on January 6th. And we now know how they plan on using the data and that Trump himself may have been at least aware of the effort.
 
In December 2020, Trump's then-attorney, Rudy Giuliani, outlined a similar plan during a meeting in the Oval Office that was attended by Trump. And the Coffee County breach is part of the broader criminal investigation in Georgia, looking at efforts to influence or overturn the election results there. And a source telling CNN, prosecutors have evidence that Trump allies discussed plans for decertifying the Senate runoff, in addition to efforts focused on upending the presidential election results.
 
Prosecutors are considering a RICO and conspiracy case that could result in multiple indictments, and the text between Trump operatives related to the Coffee County breach and new details about Trump's knowledge of plans to access voting systems in Georgia could factor into those potential charges.

BRUNHUBER:  Demonstrators took to the streets in Bogota, Colombia on Saturday to protest social and economic changes proposed by the President Gustavo Petro. Among the proposals, reducing the work week from 48 hours to 42 hours, a guaranteed monthly income for the poor, and a centralized healthcare payment system. Critics say, the changes will hurt job creation, capital markets and public finances. The reforms are currently under review by Colombia's Congress.
 
Footage obtained exclusively by CNN Brazil is raising new and disturbing questions about the police response to the riot in Brazil's capital on January 8th. Even though pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators smashed their way through the presidential palace, the police were either in retreat or nowhere to be found. CNN's Isa Soares has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR (voiceover): It was the darkest of days in Brazilian democratic history. Supporters of Former President Jair Bolsonaro taking the capital Brasilia by storm.
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
Breaking into the presidential palace and other government buildings. Now, new CCTV footage exclusively obtained by CNN affiliate CNN Brazil of what transpired inside the presidential palace appears to bolster the claims of people who have accused the police of failing to act. Chief among them, current President Lula da Silva.
 
LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  There were a lot of people colluding, it's important to say, there were a lot of conniving people from the military police and there are a lot of conniving people from the armed forces.
 
SOARES (voiceover):  The hours of CCTV footage show police forces seemingly retreating as protesters marched on the palace. And leaving their post as rioters entered the building. Once inside, the ransacking begins, priceless antiquities, tables, phones almost nothing is left untouched.
 
At the time, former policeman Cassio Thyone told me some of the criticism wasn't warranted.
 
CASSIO THYONE, FORMER BRAZILIAN POLICE OFFICER (through translator): Some policemen ended up not acting because they didn't think there was a risk of invasion. I don't think it was incompetence.
 
SOARES (voiceover):  The institutional security office or GSI, which handles security for the presidential palaces has also defended its officers. Saying, they evacuated some areas, concentrated demonstrators on the second floor, and waited for reinforcements to arrest them.
 
Despite those assertions, the bureau acknowledging its offices are being investigated and those proven to have collaborated with rioters will be held responsible. But heads have started rolling. General Goncalves Dias, Lula's government minister, in charge of security has resigned. CCTV footage shows him walking with some of the rioters, just feet away from the presidential office. He says, he was trying to lead them away so they could be arrested. But critics say, his demeanor was complacent and complicit.
 
Back in Brazil after three months in self-imposed exile in the United States, Bolsonaro is enjoying some respite. The video leak seen as a momentary win as he continues to dodge blame for the January riots. Yet doubt remains. The new footage raising more questions than the answers it provides.

BRUNHUBER:  In Israel, tens of thousands turn out to protests for a 16th consecutive week against the government's plans to overhaul the judicial system. Carrying flags and banners, they vented their opposition to the plan, which they see as an attack on democracy. The weekly protests have continued across Israel despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing a pause on the reforms last month. Saturday's demonstrations come just before Israel marks it's Memorial Day and Independence Day this week.
 
As thousands worldwide mark Earth Day, we'll see how one major U.S. city is trying to combat climate change. I'll speak with its chief heat officer, coming up. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
BRUNHUBER:  Hundreds of climate change activists gathered outside Britain's parliament building in London to mark Earth Day on Saturday and to urge government action on global warming. A so-called Extinction Rebellion group known for blocking roads, smashing windows and other disruptive tactics change things up a bit. It signed up thousands of people for family friendly rallies and marches instead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's been great. It's been, you know, that's one of the best things about coming to these events. You know, it has -- it has positive outlook on, you know, it's portrayed often as like, you know, demongering, but it's not. As, you know, it has -- it'll drive a positive change. I think is -- you know, which is one of the key things about these events.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Climate change activists have warned the average global temperatures could hit all-time highs this year or in 2024. And the World Meteorological Organization just released its annual state of the global climate report, and not surprisingly, the report found that climate change continued to increase last year.
 
Have a look here, so the report showed that drought, floods and heatwaves are affecting large parts of the world and the costs arising. Global mean temperatures for the past eight years have been the highest on record. Sea levels and ocean heat are now record levels. It showed that Antarctic sea ice has fallen to its lowest level ever. And the melting of some European glaciers also broke records.
 
So, what does this mean for individual cities trying to slow climate change? I'm joined now by Marta Segura, chief heat officer for the City of Los Angeles and director of Climate Emergency Mobilization. Thanks so much for being here with us. So, since the first Earth Day in 1970, according to a recent survey, all 50 states and at least 241 U.S. cities have warmed, Los Angeles is among them. So, how much is that city been warming?
 
MARTA SEGURA, CHIEF HEAT OFFICER, CITY OF LOS ANGELES:  Significantly, unfortunately, even though we've gotten our air pollution under control, it's the collective greenhouse gas emissions that impact cities like Los Angeles. And we also have what's called the urban heat island, every city does with concrete buildings and pavement, it exacerbates the heat and the climate change in those cities. So, it warms us that quite a much faster than you would have in a forest or a rural area. So, we definitely have our challenges cut up for us in the City of Los Angeles.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes, and hence your position, right? The job of a heat officer, it's a relatively new one. Your position was created, you know about a year, a year and a half ago because heat waves are becoming more common. They're lasting longer. So, you're dealing with the acute effects of this. I mean, in this country, I know it's killed -- you know, kills more people every year than any other weather- related phenomenon. But only a handful of cities in this country have these heat officers. It's still a relatively new area of focus, right?
 
SEGURA:  It is. I think there are now 10 worldwide, but I'm the -- still the only one in the west coast. And heat is Los Angeles' primary climate hazard. And it's really unacceptable to have these preventable deaths and preventable hospitalizations that occur mostly in the -- not just the hottest areas of L.A., but the areas with greatest pollution burden.
 
The historically disinvested areas of L.A. where we have less shade equity, less street canopy, less open space. And actually, also, less air conditioning or thermal comfort in the homes of those very same communities. So, we have this, you know this disparity.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
BRUNHUBER:  So, since we're celebrating Earth Day this weekend, I just -- I want to focus not just on the problem but on the solutions. Now, states have already reduced emissions by an average of 19 percent over the last 15 years, but that's not fast enough to meet the national targets. So, when you look at what works in terms of local solutions, share some examples of what people are doing at a local level that that's making a difference.
 
SEGURA:  Yes, at a local level, we've been working on increasing green and open spaces for over a decade now. In fact, I was also a staffer at the Los Angeles Neighborhood Lancaster. And we first opened with the very bold vision of creating more equitable open space. And also, ensuring that when we do that, we have more permeable land and soil to act as aquifers for our storm water. So, that's one really interesting solution.
 
We've also recently conducted several tree canopy studies and shade equity studies to see where we are lacking in tree canopy and shade structures so that we can be guided by the strategic mapping of where we must invest most -- first and foremost to provide that level of shade that other communities have. And they thrive from, right? Because shade isn't only there to ensure. We have thermal comfort while we're walking about, but it also reduces pollution. And if it's over your home, it reduces your utility bill.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes, I mean, these big, you know, federal initiatives and even the municipal ones are hugely important. But in terms of getting people behind these initiatives, a recent Meta study looked at what actually fuels, you know, fuels people to follow environmental practices. And it turns out finance incentives and social pressure worked better at changing behavior than education.
 
So, obviously, awareness, you know, what we're talking about is obviously very important. But these other things, people's self- interest, especially when it comes to the bottom line, that's the big driver. So, how do you harness people to get more people to act?
 
SEGURA:  That's right. Well, in Los Angeles, were fortunate to have what's called the Environmental Justice Community. So, there's a coalition of environmental justice organizations that have been advocating and invested in for a few decades now. And that has catalyzed, I think, these policies that we're talking about. But in addition to that, we have organization called LACI, and it's an incubator for environmental entrepreneurship and green jobs.
 
And the City of Los Angeles has been investing in this nonprofit organization to be the bridge between economic investments for the green transition, but also to create a more equitable transition for these low-income communities to be a part of the overall green transition.
 
BRUNHUBER:  When you talk about climate change, the challenge can seem overwhelming, but it's great to hear about some solutions that are making a difference. I really appreciate your time, Marta Segura. Thank you so much.
 
SEGURA:  Thank you very much. I really appreciate yours.
 
BRUNHUBER:  In California, around 250,000 gallons of sewage has spilled into the Los Angeles River, prompting closure of seven miles of public beaches. County officials say the spill was caused by a malfunction in equipment used by sanitation maintenance crews and are urging residents to stay away.

CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's unclear exactly when the beach will be open again. Officials say, they're going to be testing the water and will let people know as soon as it's safe to get back in the water. But it is a beautiful day in Southern California. So, many people out on the beach. A lot of them do not even know that the beach is closed. There is a lifeguard walking up and down the beach, telling people, look, you should not be in the water.
 
There's a number of signs that tell you that the beach is closed. But some people just came here without knowing and maybe missed the sign. Officials saying, it is not safe. And we've spoken to people who got in the water and we're told, hey, maybe you should get out of the water. Here's one of these California residents.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Soon that we found out, we were kind of disgusted but what can we do now? Just walk all the way to get to the car and go home and take a shower.
 
BERNAL:  And this spill happened on Thursday. The waste overflowed into the streets, eventually going into the L.A. River. They were able to clean that up on Thursday, but all of that went into the L.A. River and eventually made it here to the ocean, which is why officials say you should not be in the water at least until they say it is safe to do so. Camila Bernal, CNN, Long Beach, California.

For a little soccer team from a small town, it's a moment that could only come from Hollywood. Wrexham AFC, marooned for 15 years at the bottom of British soccer, gets bought by two celebrities and has now won a championship and a promotion to the English Football League. World Sports Don Riddell explains why this is a really big deal.

DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  If you're a fan of the television show, "Welcome to Wrexham," here's a spoiler alert, season two is going to have a very happy ending. Wrexham have been promoted back into the football league. Now, CNN Sports wouldn't normally focus on a team that plays in the fifth tier of English football. But this team now has a global fanbase. thanks to the involvement of their celebrity owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.
 
On Saturday, Wrexham went home to Borehamwood knowing that promotion was within their grasp, but they made a disastrous start, conceding a goal within the very first minute. But Wrexham have been brilliant this season, especially at home, and the equally (ph) shortly afterwards when Elliot Lee was given a free header. The Welsh club knew that they had to pick up three points from one of their last two games of the season to guarantee promotion. And it was fitting that their talismanic star, Paul Mullin, delivered the result with a couple of brilliant second half strikes.
 
That's how they did it. A Hollywood ending. A three-one win which unleashed scenes of unbridled joy at the Racecourse Ground. The owners were emotional, the fans were just delirious, and everybody here senses that this could be just the beginning of a wonderful story for this club and for this community.
 
RYAN REYNOLDS, ACTOR, CO-OWNER OF WREXHAM:  I'm not sure I can actually process what happened tonight. I'm still a little speechless. I know that one thing that's running through my head over and over again as people said at the beginning, why Wrexham? Why Wrexham? This is exactly why Wrexham. Happening right now is why.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You've put so much into this project. How does it feel when it finally feels like it's paying off?
 
ROB MCELHENNEY, ACTOR, CO-OWNER OF WREXHAM:  Well, I think we can hear how it feels to the town, and that's what's most important to us. That I think this is a moment of catharsis for them and celebration, and for us to be welcomed into their community and to be welcomed into this experience has been the honor of my life.
 
RIDDELL:  You know, Rob McElhenney has always said that the goal is to get this team into the premier league. And it might be rather difficult for some American sports fans to understand that. It would be like a single A baseball team working their way up into the majors.
 
The always sunny in Philadelphia star told me that. He knows people laugh at him when he says it. He knows they raised their eyebrows. But he is deadly serious. That's the goal. And now, fans all over the world must believe that anything is possible with this team. Back to you.
