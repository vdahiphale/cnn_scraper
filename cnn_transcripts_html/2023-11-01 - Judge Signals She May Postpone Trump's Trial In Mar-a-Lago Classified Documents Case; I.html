BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: This just in to CNN. The judge in former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago classified documents case just signaled she made delay the trial date. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now. Katelyn, this trial originally set for May of 2024, but she apparently said in the courtroom that she is not -- she does not believe this work can be accomplished realistically in this period of time. 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Boris, that is the quote from Judge Aileen Cannon here at the federal courthouse in Florida at a hearing this afternoon. At this hearing, Donald Trump's lawyers were telling her that they have so much work to do and there is so much evidence to go through. And they are handling so many things for their client Donald Trump, who has trial after trial scheduled for the spring, including this trial still on the books to begin at the end of May next year, here in Florida. That they can't possibly meet the deadlines that she set in this case. And she needs to move them back. 
 
Now Judge Cannon at this hearing, she did not say she was moving the dates right now. She said she was going to consider it and she would let them know in pretty short order. But within two minutes of the Justice Department prosecutor standing up at this hearing and arguing to keep the dates the same for this trial, Donald Trump should go to trial in May. It's totally possible to do that, especially because you don't know what's going to happen with these other cases he's facing. The judge responded to that prosecutor saying, I'm having a hard time seeing how this works. Meaning the work in this case, can be accomplished realistically at time. 
 
And then she told the Justice Department I'm not seeing your position, a level of understanding, to these realities that the defense team is working through in this case. As they get ready, not just for this trial on national security issues, Donald Trump is being accused of the handling of classified records after his presidency, possible obstruction of justice, how they could possibly get through that. And also the same legal team taking him to trial in March in federal court in Washington, DC. There was a lot of talk about that federal court case in Washington, DC that does not appear to be moving. That's around January 6, and the 2020 election. And so now we wait to see exactly what the judge does here. [15:35:00]
 
And if the trial here in Florida takes place before the election of next year. 
 
SANCHEZ: Katelyn Polantz from Fort Pierce, Florida. Thanks so much. 
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: For the second time in just six months, embattled Republican Congressman George Santos will face the possibility of being ousted from Congress. The New Yorker just pleaded not guilty to multiple criminal charges, including wire fraud and identity theft. And just hours from now, the House will take up a vote to expel him from Congress. 
 
A group of vulnerable New York Republicans are urging their colleagues to make it happen, saying quote, this issue is not a political one but a moral one. 
 
Joining me now to discuss this is one of those Republicans from New York State Congressman Anthony D'Esposito. Congressman, thanks so much for making time, we're glad to have you on. I'm curious, why do this now? There was a censure motion that failed. Your party wanted in its leadership, wanted to refer this to the Ethics Committee. It is now going through the Ethics Committee and they have said that they will have an update on or before the 17th. Why do this now? 
 
REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY): So yes, so we only found out that the Ethics Committee was going to rule on November 17th just a couple days ago. The reason why we pushed this motion right before we lost our speaker was because there was another indictment that came down with dozens of charges. And I think one of the things that's very important is the fact that his campaign treasurer pled guilty. And one of the charges with conspiracy and as we all know, it takes more than one person to commit conspiracy. 
 
And this isn't about, you know, people keep saying that there's a precedent here. The precedent we should find a new one. People of America, the American people, want us to hold accountable and us to be held to a higher standard. And the fact that we have someone like George Santos who completely lied and fabricated his way to the House of Representatives, he doesn't belong here. He's admitted to those lies. 
 
DEAN: And I want to ask you too about reports that you've been fundraising off this push. That you and some other Republicans that are in swing districts are pushing this. Some critics have said for that reason because you're in a swing district. What do you say to those people and people who say this isn't an appropriate avenue to raise money? 
 
D'ESPOSITO: So I won a district that was in Democrat hands for over 25 years. whether I was in an R plus 40 district or I represented a D plus 40 district, I would be carrying this resolution to the House floor. I think that George Santos has embarrassed this institution. He's a stain on New York and Nassau County. And the fact is that he keeps saying that we're going to leave this to the people of the third Congressional District. They voted for someone who is not George Santos. He lied about everything, his education, his faith, the fact that his mother was a victim of 911. The fact that his grandparents were victims of the Holocaust. Everything that he ran on was a complete lie and he doesn't deserve to be in this House. 
 
DEAN: And where do you stand at this moment? This is going to happen in several hours. Where are the votes? This is a really high bar to expel somebody from Congress. It's hard to do and it is a high bar. Where do you think you are with the votes? 
 
D'ESPOSITO: I think we'll see. You know, obviously the fact that the Ethics Committee came out just a couple days ago and said that they will release their findings on the 17th. I think that lends to a lot of people to say let's wait it out. But I do think that there's going to be a group of individuals who see right through this and understand that George Santos since day one has been a complete fraud. He's not representing the people of the third Congressional District. And the members of this House of this institution that represent people that sent them here. They shouldn't stand for it. The fact that, again, that he lied and completely fabricated his way to the floor of the House of Representatives is a complete sham. 
 
And tonight we have the opportunity to rid him of this institution. And I really hope that there are some members of my conference and others who have said they've come here. They've come here to, quote, drain the swamp. Well, tonight's an opportunity to set a new precedent to show the American people that we were held to a different standard, a higher standard. And let's rid George Santos of the House. 
 
DEAN: Have you spoken to him at all through all of this? 
 
D'ESPOSITO: I have not. He deleted me from his favorites list. 
 
DEAN: All right, before I let you go. I do want to ask you about this ongoing funding battle in the House over Israel funding, Ukraine funding. That's what you all are going to turn to after these votes on your various members this evening. Do you believe that speaker Mike Johnson is treating this aid to Israel as a political pawn? Just to remind our viewers, the Biden administration and Senate Republicans had pushed to link Ukraine and Israel funding together. The House Speaker has chosen to go forward with Israel funding, but linking it to taking away money from the IRS to pay for it. What do you make of all of that? 
 
D'ESPOSITO: I don't think it's a political move. 
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
I think the fact is that we need to provide aid to our greatest ally, Israel, in the most expedient fashion. And if this is the way to do it, well, then I trust that this is the way we're going to get it across the floor and get it over to the Senate. And that's what the Senate should be focused on. They claim that, you know, we need to assist Israel, that she is our greatest ally. Well, let's get this across the floor of the House. Let's get it over to the Senate and let's get the funding over to Israel so that they can continue to defend themselves and crush Hamas. 
 
DEAN: And -- but does it frustrate you at all that the speaker decided to add that other layer on to it with the IRS funding versus just a clean bill? 
 
D'ESPOSITO: It doesn't frustrate me. I'm willing to vote in favor of this in order to again get this funding over to Israel as quick as possible. 
 
DEAN: All right, Congressman Anthony D'Esposito, thanks so much for making time. We appreciate it very much. 
 
D'ESPOSITO: Thank you. 
 
DEAN: And up next, holding steady, the Federal Reserve is choosing not to raise interest rates. What that decision signals about the state of the U.S. economy. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:45:31]
 
DEAN: And this just into NEW CENTRAL. One of the former Memphis officers accused in the deadly beating of Tyre Nichols has signaled he plans to change his plea in the federal case against him. The attorney for Desmond Mills has scheduled a hearing for tomorrow, but will not say why it's been set. Mills also faces state charges for Nichols death, including second degree murder. You'll remember five officers were seen on surveillance video and body cams pummeling and kicking Nichols to death in January -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: The Federal Reserve today announced that it will not raise interest rates, holding them steady for the second time in a row, touting the strong pace of economic activity last quarter. Of course, that's despite inflation staying above the central bank's target of two percent. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is here to explain. Vanessa, chairman Powell just wrapped up a press conference. What did he say about the state of the economy? 
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: He said that the Feds fight against inflation has come in lumps, and that progress has been bumpy. But language is really important to the Federal Reserve and they have sort of upgraded their language about the economy. Saying that economic activity is expanding at a strong pace. That's a change in language from solid pace. Also saying that job gains have moderated instead of slowed. But he says despite that, the job is not done. But it's also not enough to have raised rates this time around. Listen to what he said just moments ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: Inflation has moderated since the middle of last year and readings over the summer were quite favorable. But a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. (END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
YURKEVICH: He also spoke about some risk factors. One of those that the Fed has identified is the war between Israel and Hamas. But he says that that's not on track to have a significant economic impact at the moment. However, he did address the past eleven rate hikes that the Fed has made since March of 2022 impacting borrowing costs for Americans. Specifically, mortgage rates that are nearly topping 8 percent. Borrowing costs for Americans who are taking out new credit cards, new student loans, new car loans. He talked about that pain and that pain actually shows up a little bit, Boris, in consumer confidence. Which has fallen for the past three months. Consumers, Americans not feeling so rosy about the economy, despite some of those really better than expected numbers that we saw in the third quarter -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, notably, markets appear to be responding well to this news. The Dow up nearly 240 points, Nasdaq up to 10. Vanessa, what are we anticipating might come from the Feds December meeting? 
 
YURKEVICH: He was asked about this and he said that everything is on the table in terms of a pause or a hike. However, he said what is not being discussed is any rate cuts. That's not on the table at the moment. Remember the Fed is still trying to target that 2 percent inflation rate. He says we are still well above that. But come December, still very much TBD. The door is open on either a pause or another hike by the end of the year. 
 
SANCHEZ: A lumpy and bumpy Road to get to 2 percent as Vanessa said. Vanessa Yurkevich, thank you so much. 
 
Still, plenty more news to come. Including a harrowing incident inside the cockpit while a pilot allegedly threatened to shoot the captain on a Delta plane in the air, mid flight. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:53:41]
 
DEAN: A commercial airline pilot is now facing federal charges for allegedly pulling a gun on the captain sitting right next to him in the middle of a flight. Prosecutors say he threatened to shoot the captain if the captain diverted their flight over a possible medical issue involving a passenger. CNN's Pete Muntean is here with more on what I think we can only describe as a bizarre incident. This is really weird.
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, really bizarre. And you know, we're learning more about this all the time and getting new details about this. Even though this happened, this incident happened back in August of 2022. What is really interesting here is that we're learning about this from a Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General report and the man at the center of all of this, a first officer for Delta Airlines by the name of Jonathan Dunn. And a Utah grand jury essentially handed down these charges just now, essentially saying that Dunn tried to interfere with the flight crew. He was authorized to carry a gun on board -- more on that in a second -- and threatened the captain sitting next to him by showing him his gun. This is the statement from the DOT OIG. It says: 
 
Dunn told the captain that they would be shot multiple times if the captain diverted the flight. 
 
There was clearly this disagreement. According to this Utah grand jury report in these federal court charges that essentially lay out that there was this disagreement about a medical emergency in the back of the airplane. And that clearly Dunn, wanted to get some place and this is what took place. 
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
So what is also really interesting about this is that we're learning about this not from the FAA, not from the TSA, which administers this carry a gun on board program. And also not from the FBI. This is coming out from a third party. Delta Airlines has released a statement saying out of the respect for the Aviation Authority, investigating Delta will refrain from commenting on the matter, but we'll confirm that this first officer is no longer employed at Delta. We've also reached out of the TSA. They say that this pilot is no longer involved in this carry a gun on board program, something that came about after the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- Jessica. 
 
DEAN: Wow. I mean, we were just saying in the break, like at first it was unruly passengers. Yes, and now we have a trend of -- 
 
MUNTEAN: Unruly pilots, I mean, that's the thing that sort of keeps happening. And we just saw last week Joseph Emerson. This case of an off duty Alaska Airlines pilot on board an Alaska Airlines flight sitting in the jump seat in the cockpit tried to shut off the planes engines. Ultimately charged with trying to attempt murder on 83 people on board. So really something that has sort of happened over and over again here and there's a bit of a theme. 
 
DEAN: Bizarre. All right, Pete Muntean, thanks so much. 
 
Thanks so much for watching today. "THE LEAD" with Jake Tapper starts right after this short break.</pre>
