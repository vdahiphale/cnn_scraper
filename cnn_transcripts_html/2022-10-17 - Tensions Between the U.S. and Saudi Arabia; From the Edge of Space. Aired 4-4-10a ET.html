COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Welcome back. I hope you had a great weekend. I`m Coy. I`m here to help you start your week off right, 
 
 fuel your mind with important thought-provoking news while having a little bit of fun, too, right here on CNN 10.
 
Let`s start with a quick look at the news out of Saudi Arabia. Tensions between the Middle Eastern nation and the United States increased last 
 
 week. This comes after the Saudi-led OPEC the organization responsible for exporting petroleum announced that they would cut the output of oil by 
 
 million barrels per day and that would, of course, increase the price per gallon ultimately hurting our pockets. The U.S. had been pressuring Saudi 
 
 Arabia to postpone that move. 
 
The timing is difficult for President Biden because the midterm elections in the U.S. are only weeks away and inflation and the price of the gas pump 
 
 will be at the top of many voters` minds. The Biden administration asked Saudi Arabia to postpone the decision to cut gas production until after the 
 
 midterms, a decision for which many are criticizing Biden. 
 
The U.S. has suggested that the increased prices could help Russian President Vladimir Putin continue to fund his war in Ukraine. In response, 
 
 Saudi officials have said the decision to cut production was designed to stabilize the markets, not for political reasons. 
 
The White House has now said that it would look for additional ways to reduce Saudi Arabia`s control over energy prices. The U.S.-Saudi 
 
 relationship is viewed as a key pillar for regional stability in the Middle East.

WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:
 
While not constant, the speed of sound is typically how fast?
 
Ten thousand miles per hour, 760 miles per hour, 86 miles per hour, or 186,000 miles per second?
 
Air temperature changes this, but the sound barrier can typically be broken at around 760 miles per hour.

WIRE:  Next, we introduce you to Felix Baumgartner. He`s celebrating the 10-year anniversary of his record-breaking skydive. He was on top of the 
 
 world, an unbelievable 135 feet, that`s four and a half Mount Everest high and he became the first person ever to skydive at a supersonic speed. 
 
 That`s a long way since the inventor of the parachute Frenchman Andre- Jacques Garnerin used a canvas canopy in a small basket to drop from beneath a hot air balloon in 1797. 
 
Meet Felix Baumgartner speaking with CNN "World Sport" anchor Patrick Snell. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FELIX BAUMGARTNER, SET RECORD FOR HIGHEST SKYDIVE:  On the 14th of October 2012, I was all the way up in a capsule, you know, 135,000 feet above the 
 
 ground, not knowing what this journey is going to go. But it was such a breathtaking moment, once I opened that capsule door and stepped outside, 
 
 you know, and then I looked around and I could see black sky, and also saw the curvature of the Earth, you know, knowing now I have to do the speed 
 
 leap into the unknown because nobody ever did a skydive at supersonic speed. I was the first one and it brings back a lot of good memories.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  Let`s get to that special moment that historic moment. We see that jaw-dropping image, Felix. We see when 
 
 the door slides open, that amazing view. You say, at one point, I think you say you wish you could have actually had more time up there --  
 
BAUMGARTNER:  Yeah.
 
SNELL:  -- before you jumped on reflection. I mean, to those of us who can only ever dream of being in that place where you were, can you even begin 
 
 to describe what it`s like?
 
BAUMGARTNER:  First of all, believe it or not, I was super happy that the door opened, you know, because it could also be that the door is freezing 
 
 so I cannot out that door. And once I was outside, I was really trying to inhale that moment because we have been working so hard. 
 
Just think about it, when I started skydiving at the age of 16, this is where my journey already started without knowing where it goes, you know? 
 
 But 35 years later, I`m standing there on top of the world outside of a capsule in the stratosphere, and I say what I had to say sometimes, you 
 
 have to go up to understand how small you are. And then I said, I`m coming home now.
 
I`m coming home now.
 
And then I was on my way -- accelerating to 890 miles an hour in just a little bit more than seconds. It was a very breathtaking moment.
 
SNELL:  Look, it wasn`t all smooth, was it, though because despite breaking the sound barrier, you`re then spinning out of control, right? At that 
 
 point, how alarming was it all and how helpless did you feel?
 
BAUMGARTNER:  That was a very alarming moment because there is no protocol, there`s nothing that they teach you even if we did a perfect preparation 
 
 for all those years so I had to find out on myself. How did I do this? By trial and error, you know? I was moving my arms and legs around trying to 
 
 figure out what will stop that spin. But you have to keep in mind at that altitude, it`s almost a vacuum so there`s no air. It`s like sailing without 
 
 wind means your skills do not work. 
 
And that at around 90,000 feet, there`s a thicker layer of air that helps you a lot. I was able to use the thick layer of air to control myself. Once 
 
 I turned around, I was stabilized as a rock, and from that moment on, this was actually the first moment where I started to enjoy my skydive. 
 
And once I opened my parachute and I opened my visor, this was the first moment after seven hours where I was breathing outside air. So it was 
 
 reconnected to the outside world and that was a very happy moment.
 
SNELL:  And then we see you make this perfect, perfect landing and we know that was so important to you. But, of course, the realization at that 
 
 moment that your life changed forever as well at that point, right?
 
BAUMGARTNER:  As a skydiver, you never worry about your landing. You just land, you know? But knowing that the whole world is watching, you want to 
 
 have the perfect landing, you know? That`s why I was so worried about my landing.
 
But I nailed it. You know, I was happy when I landed. The only thing that I didn`t know when I landed is did I break the speed of sound, because you 
 
 know once you`re in free fall, you know you`re fast but you have absolutely no indication of how fast you actually are. 
 
So when I landed, the record verification guy showed up, he took my chest peg off. This was this big white box that I was wearing part of my chest 
 
 and inside, that was the record verification device. 
 
He took it. He disappeared in a tent. He plugged it in the computer. It took about 10 minutes. I was waiting outside and after 10 minutes, he came 
 
 out and said, hey, thumbs up. You were even faster than the speed of sound.
 
And at that moment, I was really happy and satisfied because to me, breaking the speed of sound as the first human in history, that was 
 
 definitely something.

WIRE:  Now for today`s 10 out of 10. A pup that deserves a round of a-paws, a black Lab named Maverick in South Texas was stopped dead in his tracks 
 
 for more than a minute when he ran into some -- wait for it -- cats. But not real cats. We`re talking Halloween decoration cats. I`m not kitten. 
 
The question is, was he frozen because he was ready for the hunt or because he was afraid that he was being hunted? 
 
More now from CNN`s Jeanne Moos. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This may look like a decorative dog standing in bed five Halloween decoration cats. But the dog 
 
 is real, a lab by the name of Maverick. 
 
ADAM FLORES, MAVERICK`S OWNER:  He was just like frozen. I mean, it`s like somebody just like frozen in place.
 
MOOS:  Maverick`s owner Adam Flores says it was the first time the dog saw the cats. He stopped in his tracks -- in their south Texas front yard as 
 
 Adam, his wife and even his five-year-old daughter cracked up.
 
FLORES:  Maverick --  
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
MOOS:  He looks like you paused him, commented one TikToker. Joked another, I think your dog is broken to do a hard reset refer to owner`s manual. 
 
And only after more than a minute of paralysis did Adam manage to break the spell. 
 
FLORES:  Hey, it`s okay, dude.
 
MOOS:  His catatonic tail woke up first. 
 
Someone pointed out Lab thinks he`s a pointer. 
 
So we showed the video to Justin McGill (ph) who breeds pointing labs at Hunter`s Point Kennel in, Iowa.
 
Was Maverick pointing or was he petrified?
 
JUSTIN MCGILL, HUNTER`S POINT KENNEL:  I don`t know if he was pointing. He wasn`t scared. His body language, his tail was medium. He wasn`t tucked 
 
 between his legs. 
 
He didn`t have any control over that. That`s just total instincts. He walked out the door, saw that and locked up.
 
MOOS:  Unlike an English pointer, labs are not known as pretty pointers when they spot prey. The point is, don`t call Maverick a scaredy cat. 
 
Jeanne Moos, CNN --  
 
FLORES:  It`s okay, dude.
 
MOOS:  -- New York.

WIRE:  Poor maverick, had a rough day.
 
Hey y`all, hey, we love your positive cattitudes and all the love you`re giving us in the comment section of our YouTube page. So we`re showing you 
 
 some love right back.
 
Special shout-out to Priceville Junior High School in Decatur, Alabama. We see you and we thank you. 
 
Now go on out and do the little things that make this world a better place.
 
I`m Coy and this is CNN 10.
