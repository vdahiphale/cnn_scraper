MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Cyclone Remal has killed at least 17 people in India and Bangladesh. The storm hit West Bengal in India, where low- lying areas were flooded after the storm dumped several inches of rain. Powerful winds downed trees and power lines. Millions are still without electricity and mobile phone service.
 
North Korea has failed to send a second spy satellite into orbit. According to state media, the rocket carrying the military reconnaissance satellite exploded during the first stage of flight. Pyongyang had warned that Japan -- had warned Japan that it would be deploying a satellite sometime this week. 
 
Parts of Texas have been hit by tornadoes and severe storms, but the state is also dealing with scorching temperatures. Heat advisories are in place today for western Texas, as temperatures there could reach triple digits. CNN's Rosa Flores has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The extreme heat is dangerous, it is deadly, and it can be a public health hazard, especially when millions of Americans are impacted at one point in time. Take a look at the national picture here. This is a heat risk map, and you can see that Americans are being impacted from coast to coast.
 
The colors in this map, you can see that there is a shade of tan and all the way to a deep red on that map. And those are the ranges of risk, from minor risk to extreme heat risk. We're expecting that OSHA issue regulatory framework in the next few months.
 
This is after OSHA issued a 2022 initiative that inspected thousands of workplaces already in relation to heat-related injuries. Now, one of the data points that OSHA looks at is the number of deaths that are heat related. 
 
Now, the number that I'm about to share with you is not just for work- related deaths. These are overall deaths in the United States that are related to the heat. And you'll see that these numbers are staggering and they have been increasing. In 2021, the number of heat-related deaths was about 1,600. That number increased a year later to about 1,700, and last year it increased to about 2,300. 
 
Now, these risks don't stop people from working out and or doing activities outside. You can see some of them out here in Houston. I talked to them about some of the precautions that they take to make sure that they can do it safely. Take a listen. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hydration, that's the most important thing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I make sure that I drink water and then I walk for about 30 minutes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So I always make sure that I use sunscreen. I put on bug spray because mosquitoes are for real out here.
 
FLORES: On Memorial Day, one of the states that's going to see the highest temperatures is Texas, right here where I am. Take a look at some of the cities across this state that are breaking records today. Del Rio at 110, Laredo, 109, San Antonio, 102. And then down there you see Houston at 98 degrees. 
 
But here's the thing. Houston is a little swampy. If you add the humidity, the heat index, according to the National Weather Service, is expected to be between 108 and 113 degrees.

FOSTER: Los Angeles police are searching for suspects linked to the fatal shooting of soap opera actor Johnny Wactor. He was shot early on Saturday morning after interrupting a group of men trying to steal parts from his car. CNN's Camila Bernal has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHNNY WACTOR, SOAP OPERA ACTOR: She said she was pretty worried about you. She ended up in the hospital.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The "General Hospital" and soap opera community heartbroken and shocked after the fatal shooting of actor Johnny Wactor.
 
WACTOR: Is it true?
 
BERNAL (voice-over): Authorities are still searching for the person that killed the 37-year-old who was best known for his role as Brando Corbin. Early Saturday morning, he was working at a rooftop bar in downtown Los Angeles.
 
His mother, speaking to CNN affiliate KABC, says that after leaving work around three in the morning, he thought someone was working on his car or towing it. The Los Angeles police department says three people were trying to steal the car's catalytic converter when they were interrupted. As Wactor approached the car to talk, one of the suspects looked up and shot him, according to his mom. His former fiancee also speaking out.
 
TESSA FARRELL, FORMERLY ENGAGED TO WACTOR: He, I guess, was seeing them do it in the act and was standing up for what he believed was right and, you know, protecting his vehicle and his car and he was being brave and it, you know, you never anticipate someone would kill someone for that.
 
BERNAL (voice-over): Wactor was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
 
The entire "General Hospital" family is heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor's untimely passing. The show said in a statement: He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time.
 <br>[04:35:02]
 
Wactor was on "General Hospital" from 2020 to 2022, appearing in more than 150 episodes.
 
WACTOR: Because you're incredible.
 
BERNAL (voice-over): His on-screen wife saying: Johnny was the absolute best. So genuine, so caring, incredibly hard-working and humble with a huge heart that spread so much kindness and joy.
 
The actor also appeared on "Criminal Minds," "Siberia" and "NCIS".
 
FARRELL: I will actually always think of him as this spirit that loved to celebrate life and be alive and push the limits of experience and be -- he was an amazing actor. He was really funny.
 
BERNAL: And the Los Angeles Police Department says that the three suspects got in a car and escaped. They have not released details or a description of the suspects or the vehicle, but they do say they're looking for the people responsible. 
 
Now, in terms of catalytic converter thefts, they have skyrocketed since 2019, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, by 900 percent. They steal these for the precious metals. And in this case, it was not just theft, but also murder.

FOSTER: Protests growing outside Taiwan's legislature, with lawmakers once again debating controversial reforms aimed at the presidency. Opposition leaders are pushing for tighter scrutiny of the island's new president and his administration. Protesters warn the bill could undermine Taiwan's democratic institutions and lead to greater influence from China. The measure has sparked heated debate inside Parliament, with a brawl breaking out earlier this month. 
 
CNN's Mike Valerio is following developments live for us from Hong Kong. So, Mike, what are we expecting in the next few hours as these things play out?
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, it's likely that we're going to see the number of demonstrators grow. And the themes that we're watching at this hour are protesters saying, in their view, this is an overreach of Parliament, something that could endanger Taiwan's national security. So it's worth talking about how critics got to this dire warning.
 
Well, the bill would strengthen the powers of the legislature, which would allow lawmakers to demand sensitive information from, let's say, the president or the military, for example. Things like that, Max, happen all the time in the United States and the U.K. It's a check and balance of government.
 
But the protesters here are saying this bill is incredibly vague, very broad, and the party supporting it, the Kuomintang and the Taiwan People's Party, advocate closer ties to China. Critics are concerned that sensitive information -- we're talking about state secrets, for example -- could be demanded, then leaked from lawmakers who support closer China ties and end up in Chinese hands themselves. Listen to what some of the protesters are telling us.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIU YAN CHENG, JOB SEEKER (through translator): The process does not reflect our democratic value. I will slowly lose my trust in Taiwan's democracy if they continue to pass new laws in this manner. I hope through this protest, we can stop, slow down, and improve the process.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALERIO: So, Max, this bill is likely to pass later today. Advocates are saying this is simply a check and balance. But protesters say this is being totally rushed, very similar to the sound bite we just heard from a couple seconds ago and has minimal debate.
 
And this could, from their point of view, see the island's secrets falling into the wrong hands -- Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Mike Valerio in Hong Kong. Thank you.
 
The Vatican has yet to respond to reports that Pope Francis used an anti-gay slur in a recent meeting with Italian bishops. Two Italian newspapers reported on May the 20th at a closed-door meeting in which the Pope allegedly said gay men should not be allowed to train for the priesthood. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb. Christopher, we're speaking to an Italian today, and she said this word can be more offensive. CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, these reports that the Pope used this anti-gay slur are really causing a big stir. The Vatican, though, has not yet commented on them. They were reported to have been made during a behind-the-closed-doors meeting with the Italian bishops, where the Pope and the bishops were discussing proposals around admitting gay men to seminaries to train for the priesthood.
 
Now Pope Francis has upheld the Vatican ruling, which goes back to 2005, that says that gay men should not be admitted to the priesthood. 
 
And in this meeting the Pope reportedly said no to gay men being allowed to train for the priesthood. Allegedly, he said that there's a danger that they could live a double life if there are gay men in the seminaries. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
And it should be stated, though, that when the Pope made this slur, which was effectively to say that there's too much of a gay climate in the seminaries, that he wasn't fully aware of the offensive nature of the term. He was speaking in Italian. Of course, the Pope's mother tongue is Spanish, and he has made mistakes in Italian in the past. 
 
Nevertheless, if the Pope was to have intentionally made this homophobic slur, then it would undercut the Pope's attempts to be more welcoming to LGBTQ+ Catholics. That's something that he has tried to do throughout his pontificate.
 
In 2013, he famously said, who am I to judge when asked about gay priests? He, a few months ago, opened the possibility of blessings for same-sex couples and has called for the decriminalization of homosexuality. 
 
So these remarks really would jar with what the Pope has been trying to do when it comes to welcoming gay Catholics -- Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Christopher Lamb in Cumbria, England. Thank you. 
 
South Africa's ruling ANC party is hoping it can win enough votes to stay in power, even as the country endures blackouts, unemployment and stark inequality. The case it's making to voters next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: South Africans will head to the polls on Wednesday in what could be a momentous general election. The African National Congress party is facing serious challenges to its 30-year rule as the country suffers from high unemployment, economic stagnation, power cuts, and rampant corruption. David McKenzie joins me now from Johannesburg.
 
What are you looking out for in particular, David?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Max, we're looking out for whether the ANC will slip below a 50 percent majority. Now that would have been unthinkable some years ago. For three decades, the party of Nelson Mandela has been really the powerhouse of South African politics.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
In recent years, though, they seem to be trading more on their legacy than their policy achievements. The question will be, how will South Africans vote? 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): IT worker Malian Bata knows how to gin up a crowd. He's volunteered for the ANC since he was just 15. But now it's crunch time. 
 
MALIAN BATA, AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS VOLUNTEER: We want to show the support to the ANC because ANC has been supporting us.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): The party of Nelson Mandela needs their voices and it really needs their votes. 30 years in power and the party that has defined South African politics faces its strongest challenge yet.
 
MCKENZIE: This could be the most closely contested election since the dawn of South Africa's democracy. And many believe that the ruling ANC could lose its majority. But their supporters say don't count them out yet.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): The ANC can fill stadiums, yes, but it also has a formidable ground game. Spending vast sums on this campaign, getting right into neighborhoods with senior leaders.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Voting for ANC until now.
 
MCKENZIE: Why do you still want to vote for the ANC?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to vote because my ANC works for me.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Millions of South Africans like Tuli Gwala depend on modest government social grants to survive. For decades, these grants have been the party's trump card.
 
But South Africans want more. Breathtaking unemployment, sustained electricity blackouts and stark inequalities have left many feeling betrayed by the promises of the ANC.
 
Once loyal supporters are abandoning the ANC, even forming their own parties, there are more than 50 on the national ballot.
 
HERMAN MASHABA, LEADER, ACTIONSA PARTY: I voted for the ANC twice. All these people here before, majority of them used to vote for the ANC. Look at the ANC's electoral support, every year it's going down.
 
MCKENZIE: The ANC government has presided over huge allegations of corruption and there is a very significant problem with unemployment. Why should people this time vote for this party given that record?
 
FIKILE MBALULA, SECRETARY-GENERAL, ANC: We are a party that have made strides in terms of renewal and fighting the stigma, so to say, of being associated with corruption.
 
MCKENZIE: Is it enough to win this election? Are you feeling confident?
 
MBALULA: The elections will be won on the basis of the work we do among our people and as you can see we are not idling.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Never idle. Not during campaign season. But on election day, will voters be singing a different tune?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): Now, Max, polls in South Africa can be pretty unreliable -- opinion polls, that is. But there is a sense that they could dip below that 50 percent threshold in a parliamentary system. That will mean the ANC will be forced to join up with an opposition party or several to remain in power -- Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, and in terms of the opposition parties, you know, what are the chances of them forming a government bloc without the ANC?
 
MCKENZIE: Well, it's certainly not impossible, statistically, should they get collectively more than 50 percent. But there are very wide ideological differences, Max, between some of the key opposition parties. You have the classically liberal Democratic Alliance, which is a pro-business, pro-rule of law, official opposition.
 
And then on the other end of the spectrum, you have groups like the Economic Freedom Fighters under Julius Malema, which is very much a populist party that is looking to have more radical change for those they believe have been underserved by the ANC government. So I think from a political standpoint, it'd be unlikely for those two groupings to band together. 
 
It really depends how well the ANC does. It could squeak over 50 percent. But if it drops below that key threshold by a significant margin, it will have to do some serious negotiating with these parties to see who, in fact, is going to rule this country over the next five years -- Max.
 
FOSTER: David McKenzie in Johannesburg. Thank you so much. 
 
Now, remembering a college and pro basketball legend, the life and legacy of Hall of Famer Bill Walton. Just ahead.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Tributes pouring in for one of the true giants of basketball. Hall of Fame player turned broadcaster Bill Walton died on Monday of cancer. He led UCLA to national championships in 1972 and 73.
 
He was an outspoken activist against the Vietnam War and was even arrested at a campus protest in 1972. Walton went on to win NBA championships with two teams, the Portland Trail Blazers and the Boston Celtics. He was named the league's most valuable player in 1978.
 
A series of injuries derailed his basketball career, so he moved into broadcasting. Bill Walton was 71. 
 
Spanish tennis great Rafael Nadal has been knocked out of the tournament he loves the most. The king of clay was ousted in the first round of the French Open during his first match at Roland Garros in two years. 37-year-old Nadal has been struggling with injuries and was an unseeded player for the first time at the event. He lost in straight sets to world number four Germany's Alexander Zverev, who didn't celebrate out of respect for Nadal.
 
It's unclear whether this French Open will actually be his last.

RAFAEL NADAL, 22-TIME GRAND SLAM SINGLES CHAMPION: It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's going to be the last time that I'm going to be here in front of all of you. For me, it's so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most.

FOSTER: And all the crowd behind him, of course.
 
Late night host Jimmy Kimmel says his son is recovering from his third open heart surgery. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
He shared this photo online, writing: Billy, you are the toughest and funniest seven-year-old we know. 
 
Billy was born with congenital heart disease, but Kimmel hopes this will be the last surgery, saying his son is happy and healthy.
 
Now, if you're going to join a regatta, make sure your vessel is seaworthy, unless it's part of the joke, like it is in Key West, Florida. On Sunday, participants in the Schooner Wharf Minimal Regatta, sailboats made of plywood and duct tape, joining the race was a mini pirate ship and a boat modelled after the Titanic. Like its namesake, that one broke apart in the water. The awards for this regatta are given for design, costumes, sportsmanship and for the least seaworthy boat. 
 
Monday was quite a day for foodie thrill-seekers. You're looking at the annual cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire, England. Hundreds of competitors from around the world barrel down a very steep hill, chasing a wheel of double Gloucester cheese. The first to the bottom wins the cheese. An estimated 5,000 people watched as racers tumbled, flipped and slid down the muddy hill. And despite some bumps and bruises along the way, several of this year's winners say they managed to walk away relatively unscathed.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBY LAMPE, WINNER, WOMEN'S DOWNHILL RACE: I got some scratches on my face, but that's to be expected when you're really rolling down the hill.
 
DYLAN TWISS, WINNER, MEN'S SECOND DOWNHILL RACE: It's a little bit daunting. I just knew that I had to relax and go with it, not fight the hill. I had a slight expectation that this is the sort of thing I could win, but was very surprised when they singled me out and said, come on, Gloucestershire.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: They don't sound like they're from Gloucestershire. Must be getting more international. 
 
Thanks for joining me here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London. CNN "THIS MORNING" up next after a quick break.
