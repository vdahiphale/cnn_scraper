MAX FOSTER, CNN HOST: Hello and welcome to CNN "Newsroom", I'm Max Foster in London, just ahead. French President Emmanuel Macron meets China's President Xi in Beijing top of the agenda, ending Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Under fire Ukrainian soldiers tell CNN about their life inside the gruesome frontline trenches, and Israeli forces stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque for the second time. In 24 hours we're live in Jerusalem.
 
We begin in Beijing where the French President Emmanuel Macron is on a three-day visit. He met earlier with Chinese President Xi Jinping and urged him to "reason" with Russia and helped negotiate peace in Ukraine. The two leaders were then being joined by the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, who is also visiting China.
 
CNN Correspondent Selina Wang joins us live from Beijing. This is a very strong message, isn't it? Coming from Europe effectively with these two leaders in place there and reaching out to a real authority when it comes to Russia.
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And Max Macron is just the latest EU leader to be coming to Beijing and urging China to do more when it comes to peace over Ukraine just days before the Spanish Prime Minister had been in Beijing as well. And these are the words that Macron had to say to Xi Jinping, he said, "I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses, and everyone to the negotiating table."
 
Xi Jinping said to Macron that China is willing to work with France to call on the international community to "maintain reason and restraint, and avoid taking actions that will further aggravate the crisis". Now there is skepticism over how much progress Macron can make here with Xi Jinping.
 
Although China has claimed neutrality over the conflict in Ukraine we have seen China refuse to condemn the invasion to refuse to even call it an invasion. Instead, Xi Jinping has threat has strengthened ties with Vladimir Putin and recently traveled to Moscow to reaffirm their partnership.
 
Now, during these opening remarks, Xi Jinping also touted growing and strengthening France, China ties also talked about rapid growth in bilateral trade. And that really speaks to sort of the dual purposes of Macron's visit in Beijing. Yes, he wants to drive forward peace talks and the role that China could play but also the economic issues here loom large.
 
China is a critical trading partner for the EU, for France, and Macron is in Beijing with roughly 50 top business leaders from France. They need to maintain this business economic relationship after Europe's economy has been hit so hard. Meanwhile, Beijing also would like to shore up this relationship with France with the EU.
 
They don't want to see European and China ties go the way that China and U.S. ties have. They would like to have a different relationship with the European Union. They don't want Europe to follow what they see as a U.S. led effort to contain China, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Selina, thank you so much. We'll keep watching those meetings just into CNN Sirens are sounding across Northern Israel. As it appears a barrage of rockets have been fired from Lebanon into Israel this comes just hours after Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites for a second day, second time rather.
 
Late Wednesday video from social media shows armed Israeli forces approaching the mosque there. They then enter new stun grenades and force worshippers inside to leave. CNN's Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem is really worrying the way this seems to be continuing it's not escalating.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, what happens in Jerusalem has reverberations across, of course across the world. And what we're seeing just in the last few minutes is I'm just getting kind of nonstop alerts on my phone about sirens going off in the Western part of Northern Israel.
 
This means that the Israeli home front believes that there are rockets incoming and that calls for people to go into their bomb shelters immediately in the north. Now, the north is particularly concerning for the Israeli Military, of course, because of the presence of Hezbollah.
 
But that area of the Western part of Southern Lebanon, there are a lot of Palestinian refugee camps. So these could be rockets from Palestinian militant factions. However, the Israeli Military always says that nothing happens in Southern Lebanon without Hezbollah's tacit approval.
 
So the big question now will be we're seeing this barrage of rockets, how many rockets were fired? Will they cause any damage or injury in Northern Israel? And then, of course, what will be the Israeli military responses? There will be a lot of pressure, especially on the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his right wing government to respond very forcefully.
 
But all of the security officials I've ever spoken to hear one of their biggest concerns about security escalation. Here is the north is what happens on the Northern border, because Hezbollah is very well armed the types of missiles and rockets that Hezbollah has.
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
They're on a completely different level than what we normally see from militant groups like Hamas. This is incredibly concerning for the Israeli Military. Big question will be who will take responsibility for this? Of course, all of this is stemming from what's happening here in Jerusalem.
 
As you noted the Israeli police for the second time in less than 24 hours entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, this is the third holiest site for Islam. They say that they had to enter because groups of juveniles were barricaded themselves inside setting off fireworks, throwing stones and block and they wanted to clear out the mosque.
 
But this is incredibly provocative seen as incredibly offensive across the Muslim and Arab world, no matter sort of the situation what's ever happening inside the mosque, just having Israeli police entered the mosque itself. Let alone entering with force that is seen as incredibly provocative and offensive and that's why we're seeing this escalation.
 
Keep in mind there was similar scenes here in Jerusalem at Al-Aqsa that led to that 2021 war between Hamas and militants in Gaza and Israel. Hezbollah essentially stayed out of a fight the question right now is Hezbollah stepping into this fight this year, Max?
 
FOSTER: OK Hadas, thanks for watching that for us. China is going to take resolute and strong measures following a meeting between Taiwan's Presidents in the U.S. House Speaker in California.
 
Tsai Ing-wen said she felt heartened by America's strong support for Taiwan after speaking with Kevin McCarthy and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Wednesday, Beijing denounced the landmark visit. McCarthy said it was not intended to escalate tensions, but he was also defiant.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Well, my first message to China, there's no need for retaliation. But the one thing I would say to China too at no time, I am the Speaker of the House. There is no place that China is going to tell me where I can go or who I can speak to whether you be foe or whether you be friend.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: CNN's Lauren Fox joins us live from Capitol Hill. He's a Republican, obviously but he's got bipartisan support hasn't he on this meeting and the way he's presenting it?
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN POLITICS CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: Yes, Max. I mean, this was a rare moment of bipartisan force. Here in California, there was a lot of discussion yesterday about the importance of that. At the summit you saw Kevin McCarthy standing with Peter Aguilar, who is a member of the Democratic leadership, and someone who also hails from the state of California.
 
But one of the things that was underscored by McCarthy yesterday was the fact that the U.S. has to be united in its relationship with Taiwan, in part to strike back against some of the rhetoric you're hearing coming out of China. This has been a very important piece of Kevin McCarthy speakership.
 
He created a select committee to deal with China specifically to deal with issues on a bipartisan basis. And he wanted that meeting yesterday to come off with this idea and perception that this was the United States speaking as one and not just Republicans, talking with the President from Taiwan.
 
So that was a very important issue for Kevin McCarthy. You also saw yesterday that he reasserted the importance of transferring weapons to Taiwan and to do that in a quick manner. He also argued that the trade relationship with Taiwan needed to remain strong and whatever those on Capitol Hill could do to make sure that that was the situation moving forward.
 
He wanted to make sure that that happened. So a couple of things, you know, in terms of the symbolic importance of this, but also there were logistics that were discussed in that meeting yesterday another important element to make clear.
 
FOSTER: OK, Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill I appreciate that, thank you. Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko are holding a second day of talks in Moscow. Today they are meeting as part of the Union state of Russia and Belarus.
 
The Kremlin says the two men had a lengthy and meaningful meeting on Wednesday; the two-day summit is focused on deepening ties between the two countries. - Matthew Chance is in Moscow, in terms of what Putin is hoping to get out of this meeting. What do you think that is?
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, perhaps hoping to tighten his grip over neighboring Belarus. I mean, this is an address to a council that was set up by the two countries who have expressed an intention over the longer term to form what they call a union state to bring their two countries together.
 
But obviously, it's Russia that is driving that. Putin didn't say very much in the opening remarks ahead of these behind closed door talks, but Alexander Lukashenko spoke for quite some time, talking about how the two countries should form a joint media company about how they should cooperate more on anti-terrorism strategies and smuggling strategies and things like that.
 
And of course, it comes a couple of weeks now, after it was announced by Vladimir Putin that he intended to deploy a tactical nuclear weapons to the territory of Belarus as well.
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
And even though that's alarming because it sorts of raises the nuclear stakes a little bit. It also means that Russia would be sending more and more rich troops to Belarus to oversee the command and control of those weapons as well.
 
And so that was interpreted widely as being you know another step towards Russia. Yes, not so much Russia and Belarus uniting in a union state more, you know, kind of Russia tightening its hold over. It's much smaller, much weaker neighbor.
 
FOSTER: OK, Matthew, thank you. The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. is accusing Russia of spreading disinformation at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday. Diplomats from the U.S., U.K., Albania and Malta walked out in protest at Russia's Commissioner for Children's Rights.
 
Maria Lvova-Belova the speaking via video about the plight of Ukrainian children. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for her last month over an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Coming up Frances trade unions have failed to keep up their fight against controversial pension reform making people work longer, but will the strikes be effective? We'll be live in Paris, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: New day of protests and strike action beginning in France workers are demonstrating against government reforms increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64. The legislation was pushed through Parliament last month bypassing France's lower house. Now Wednesday talks between the government and trade unions collapse.
 
But France isn't the only European country dealing with nationwide strikes across the U.K. here teachers are striking in a pay dispute with the government. In England junior doctors are striking over pay conditions last month. German Transport Workers staged a strike halting planes and trains across that country.
 
CNN's Melissa Bell now joins us from Paris. And Melissa, this will be the 11th day since January that people are taking to the streets.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: That's right with another large day of strike action here in France, Max, what we're seeing so far is the strike action, slightly less well followed than it had been in the past just 10 percent of teachers on strike today compared to 20 percent last week.
 
And you're quite right, the 11th day, this is what it looks like Max. Shortly this March will get underway and they will head to the plus - since that we've seen repeated you're right in other European countries. Here the particularity is of course that purchased over a pension reform.
 
But you mentioned Germany and the strikes that we saw United Kingdom as well, Max, in a sense, they're all linked. This has become about much more than pension reform. It is also about inflation, the high cost of living exactly what we've seen behind those other protests in other European countries. One of the big questions is whether they can keep the momentum going.
 <br>[08:15:00] So we're looking to see how many of you people get out on the street today and just how violent they become that's another factor we see in the last couple of weeks as these strikes that had been largely peaceful, Max, really getting a lot more violent between far left protesters and the police trying to keep order but themselves accused of times of excess.
 
But the unions are right vowing that they will continue. We'll find out later tonight, what the next big day of strike action and protests will be, Max.
 
FOSTER: There are always extremists on in these events. But in terms of France, it's very clear that there is a lot of general support for these strikes, because so many people are getting involved in them.
 
BELL: That's right and I think one thing that's remarkable, Max, is that polls show that the majority of the French public is still in favor of this strike and protest action. They're opposed to the reform and it was really that pushing through of parliament that ended up making the reform already pretty unpopular, even more unpopular still.
 
So a lot of support for this action so far we have a couple of weeks before we find out whether the constitutional court deems it to be constitutional. For now, the union saying they're going to continue until the government backs down. Those talks you mentioned last night collapsing, Max, because the government said precisely it was not intending to do so.
 
FOSTER: Governments across Europe taking a similar approach really aren't they? They're very standing firm in their positions, basically saying they can't afford to increase pay un conditions for striking workers. Even though there's this huge amount of sympathy for the workers. The government's hands are tied and they're being tough.
 
BELL: That's right, the government saying it's simply a matter of public finances that need to be addressed. Now, a lot of the union representatives contest that. They say that the government's exaggerated the need, or the way that the fact that this was the only way to address that problem.
 
And they're really wound up about the President Emmanuel Macron, Max. I think it's important to remember that this happens in a particular context. It wasn't so long ago, the yellow vest protest, things for a lot of people have only gotten worse. And a lot of that anger, really crystallized on the President fact.
 
When you look around the signs, you hear the chunks, a lot of them focused on a President that has only grown less popular with the unions and this particular base that he sees out on the street today, Max.
 
FOSTER: Do you think Macron will eventually buckle because obviously it's going to be doing huge amounts of harm to the economy, when most of it isn't working due to the strikes?
 
BELL: So far, the message has been unilaterally the same that they intend to continue that the violence that we've seen in the street the last couple of weeks, will not make them back down, but they are determined to see that's true.
 
And the fact is that once it gets through the Constitutional Council, it will become law by the end of the year. Very difficult to see that at this particular stage having put so much political capital into it, Macron would choose to back down, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Melissa, thank you, wait to see how that later strike goes. Silvio Berlusconi in Italy diagnosed with leukemia meanwhile, that's according to a leading Italian newspaper. The Former Italian Prime Minister was hospitalized in Milan on Wednesday with breathing problems.
 
Two spokes people declined to comment but did or rather didn't deny basically the report. Finland's left wing Prime Minister has resigned following a loss in the country's parliamentary election last week. Sanna Marin conceded defeat on Sunday after the opposition right wing party claim victory in a tightly fought contest.
 
Marin has also said she had stepped down as the Leader of her Social Democrat Party but she won't be replaced until the party's Congress, which will be in September. Police in San Francisco are hunting for the killer of a well-known tech executive. Family and colleagues say Bob Lee, the Founder of mobile payments service Cash App died early on Tuesday.
 
Reports say he was the victim of a stabbing attack in San Francisco. Police transported him to the hospital where he later died. Police have made no arrests in his killing and there's been no word on a motive either. The city's Mayor is calling his killing a horrible tragedy.
 
Brazil's Former President is in potential trouble over pieces of jewelry. Jair Bolsonaro arrived at a federal police station in the Brazilian Capitol on Wednesday to answer questions about it. The investigation involves millions of dollars, worth of jewels. He received from Saudi Arabia whilst he was in office and why he still has it.
 
He's also under a separate investigation to whether he instigated the riots in Brasilia in January that followed his election loss. Now still to come, the hard fought frontlines of Russia and the war on Ukraine. CNN goes inside the trenches with Ukrainian forces. We'll hear from soldiers about what life is like there now.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
FOSTER: Ukrainian troops continue to fight back as Russia keeps up the pressure on the city Bakhmut. Ukraine sent his troops repelled 20 Russian attacks in the past day, and that all roads in and out of Bakhmut were under Russian fire. Much of the grinding war in Ukraine is being fought from dark and muddy trenches that seemed to be a throwback to a Bygone war. CNN's Ben Wedeman travel to Eastern Ukraine to show us what Ukrainian soldiers are facing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In the trenches, the deeper you dig the better. The front lines in the open plains of Eastern Ukraine are a zigzag of earthworks in this area positions have been static for a while. Alexei from the first tank brigade has been here for six months.
 
Sometimes it's quiet, he says and sometimes it's loud. Sometimes they the Russians tried to break through. So far they haven't succeeded.
 
WEDEMAN: OK, I want to get down. OK, we are told that Russian lines are just one kilometer. From here we're hearing occasional shelling, but nothing coming on this position yet.
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): This soldier also named Alexei peers through binoculars across no man's land, but only briefly to avoid drawing sniper fire. To be honest, at first I was scared he says, but humans can get used to everything. They're yet to get used to one threat hovering overhead.
 
WEDEMAN: All right, we've now taken cover because the soldiers say there's a drone flying over in the area which they tell us occasionally drop grenades on their trenches.
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): But not this time. To the rear Sergeant Oleg checks that is Soviet Era T-64 tanks are in good working order. It's like an old car easy to repair Oleg tells me. With new cars, you have to take them to the mechanic. These are like a simple tractor, but these tractors may soon be replaced by newer models.
 
He says some of his comrades are in Poland being trained to use German made leopard tanks. Spring has arrived in these parts and with it growing anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive. New more modern weapons and this old hoax could make all the difference.
 
Back in the trenches, all is quiet, but as we leave a drone appears above us. Then our ride out arrives 30 seconds OK and artillery no time to waste Ben Wedeman, CNN Eastern Ukraine.

FOSTER: Prince William of the U.K. says he's grateful he was exposed to the issue of homelessness at a young age. The Duke of Cambridge is featured in a podcast episode speaking to two volunteers with a U.K. charity groundswell. In it the Prince describes the stories of the homeless are both powerful and inspirational.
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
He says he's trying to work towards the goal that homelessness is rare brief and non-recurrent. MTV has announced the nominees for its 2023 Movie and TV awards.
