BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Our response will come and it will be severe. The Israeli Prime Minister speaks out on the deadly rocket 
 
 attacks. Fears of a wider escalation as Lebanon and Israel trade strikes over the weekend.
 
And also ahead, the latest from the campaign trail. Donald Trump has a brand-new strategy.
 
And later, box office smash, Marvel's "Deadpool &amp; Wolverine" make Hollywood history.
 
Hello, everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD.
 
Israel is vowing, Hezbollah will pay the price after a deadly rocket attack put the already tense region further on edge.

GOLODRYGA: Israel blames Lebanese militant group for a rocket attack Saturday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also stating that there's 
 
 every indication that the rocket was from Hezbollah.
 
Hezbollah, meantime, denies that it was behind the strike, which killed 12 children in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.

(CHANTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: As you see there, funerals were held Sunday for the children who were playing on a soccer field at the time of the attack.
 
Israel's military conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanese territory and along the border overnight Saturday into 
 
 Sunday.
 
And earlier today, Lebanese media reported two people were killed in a double-drone strike in South Lebanon.
 
The Israeli Prime Minister held a security cabinet meeting Sunday to discuss the situation. Benjamin Netanyahu is promising a severe response.
 
Meantime, Lebanon's caretaker government tells -- the Foreign Minister tells CNN he's been assured that the response will be limited and would not 
 
 lead to war.
 
So let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman, who joins us now live from Beirut as we await this response from Israel.
 
What did the Foreign Minister tell you?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Foreign Minister, I spoke to him several times yesterday as well as today.
 
Yesterday, he really stressed that Lebanon's worry is that if Israel launches a full-scale attack on Hezbollah, that it will draw in other 
 
 actors, particularly Iran and the Houthis and various militias backed by Iran and Syria and Iraq. So their concern is that.
 
And second of all, they really feel that the way to diffuse the tensions that are really boiling between Israel and Hezbollah is to somehow reach a 
 
 ceasefire in Gaza itself. This is what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WEDEMAN: I'm going to ask you the same question everybody here in Beirut asks me, is there going to be war?
 
ABDALLAH BOU HABIB, LEBANESE FOREIGN MINISTER: We don't want war. We don't want what's going on now. We want peace really. We really are people of 
 
 peace. And we'd like to have a ceasefire as soon as possible.
 
And we're waiting for Gaza -- to have a ceasefire in Gaza. And therefore automatically here.
 
We don't think this is -- Hezbollah did it, but I don't know, because a war against Lebanon is a regional war. It's not going to be Hezbollah against 
 
 Israel. And Hezbollah is not Hamas also. It's more than Hamas.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WEDEMAN: And, of course, the worry here is that if the war does break out, that it won't be limited, for instance, to the area around the border, that 
 
 it could be focused on areas, for instance, Beirut.
 
So what we've seen, for instance, is that many countries, Germany and Italy, for instance, have urged their nationals to leave Lebanon as soon as 
 
 possible.
 
The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, who is in Lebanon, at the moment, put out a video urging Americans to leave now 
 
 before a crisis begins.
 
One would suggest actually that crisis is well underway. She also went on to say that those American nationals who decide to stay in Lebanon should 
 
 be prepared, in her words, to shelter in place for a very long time.
 
Now, other airlines, if they were thinking of leaving on airlines, many of them are canceling their flights.
 
Lufthansa, the German airline, has canceled flights to and from Lebanon until the 5th of August. Air France stopped flying to Lebanon today and 
 
 tomorrow.
 <br>[12:05:05]
 
And the concern is, if these tensions continue, more airlines will be canceling their flights from Lebanon.
 
And, at the same time, more countries are going to be urging their nationals to leave. So, we're really in a situation where it seems 
 
 inevitable at this point, Bianna, that Israel will launch an attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 
It's merely a question of how big that attack is going to be, if it includes strikes on targets in Lebanon and Beirut, on the airport, for 
 
 instance.
 
It is clear Hezbollah has warned in the past that if Beirut is struck, if the airport is struck, Hezbollah will strike similar targets in Israel 
 
 itself, which, if that is the case, that could very well lead to a very rapid downward slope to a, indeed, full-scale regional war.
 
Bianna.
 
GOLODRYGA: And we do know that Hezbollah has the capability of striking deep inside Israel, which made it notable that the foreign minister, as he 
 
 told you, that Hezbollah is not Hamas, obviously, implying that the organization is much, much stronger and has a much larger arsenal.
 
Ben Wedeman, reporting to us live. Thank you so much.
 
What seems hard to believe that Kamala Harris' campaign to be president is really just one week old. Harris is gaining in the polls and has raised a 
 
 staggering $200 million in just her first week in the race.
 
Race. Her supporters staged a golf carts for Kamala rally in the huge Florida retirement community of the villages over the weekend.
 
It's known for being very conservative and pro-Trump. About 500 golf carts took part in the Harris parade. It's the latest sign of how Harris seems to 
 
 have reinvigorated the Democratic Party.
 
Right now, the Harris campaign is making a huge push to young voters as well.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Just over 100 days stand between us and a fundamental 
 
 choice about the future of the United States of America.
 
So if we want to live up to the promise of America, the promise of freedom opportunity and justice, and we have to organize.
 
Your enthusiasm and grassroots support have made history.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: We can tell that Donald Trump is feeling the heat from Harris' rise. His attacks, over the weekend, were especially personal, mocking 
 
 Harris' laugh and again mispronouncing her name.
 
He called her evil and dangerous and said, she is even worse than Joe Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She was a bum three weeks ago. She was a bum. A failed vice president and a failed 
 
 administration.
 
We have a new victim now, Kamala. We have a brand new victim.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, any day now, we could learn Kamala Harris' pick as running mate and she certainly hopes it goes smoother than the rollout of Donald 
 
 Trump's choice of J.D. Vance.
 
Vance has spent much of the past week defending his past controversial comments about women and families.
 
Harris' campaign also said he is not fit to be a heartbeat away from the presidency with a top Harris aide calling Vance, quote, one of the most 
 
 unprepared people to ever be tapped for vice president.
 
It has forced Vance's Republican colleagues to rush to his defense.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): You should never say anything to hurt anybody's feelings, but when you look at all these interviews by J.D., he was talking 
 
 about how the Democratic Party has abandoned the traditional family.
 
This idea of trying to marginalize J.D. and make him some kind of bad person is not going to work because he's not a bad person, he's a good 
 
 person.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN's Steve Contorno is tracking the Trump campaign for us. It's never a good sign when your Republican allies have to defend the integrity 
 
 of a vice presidential pick.
 
It was just a couple of weeks ago when it seemed this was a referendum on Joe Biden. Now the tables have turned to Donald Trump.
 
How are they reacting and what are their plans going forward in terms of responding aggressively to this now Harris-led campaign?
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Yes. Well, what you're seeing, Bianna, is a campaign that is having a bit of a scattershot approach to going after 
 
 their new opponent. They had built a campaign that was ready to go up against an 81-year-old unpopular incumbent.
 
Instead, they find themselves up against a much more energetic and opponent with a lot more enthusiasm behind her.
 
And you're seeing the Trump campaign adjust some of its messaging. Yes, they continue to attack her on immigration, on the border, on inflation, on 
 
 crime, on the economy, similar items that they went after President Biden after, but you're also sort of seeing them test out new attack lines, 
 
 suggesting that they're not yet sure what avenues are best to criticize her.
 
They know they want to criticize her. They know that she is well recognized, but not well known. And they have this period and this 
 
 opportunity to define her to the public, but they're not sure what the approach should be.
 <br>[12:10:09]
 
And so over the weekend, for example, they had -- Trump was at three different events and to Christian conservatives on Friday, he attacked her 
 
 as insufficiently pro-Israel. He said that, quote, she doesn't like Jewish people, which is quite an odd statement to make it and then that her 
 
 husband is Jewish. And they attacked her abortion positions.
 
Then at a bitcoin conference, she was anti cryptocurrency and anti- innovation. Later in the weekend, in Minnesota, he said of Vice President Harris if she is elected, quote, the American dream is dead.
 
So you're really getting a sense of a campaign that is trying to find the right approach to this ground, quickly shifting underneath its feet. And 
 
 that's why you're seeing such a scatter shot of attacks coming from that campaign.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Steve Contorno reporting to us from St. Petersburg, Florida. Thank you.
 
Well, many world leaders are calling for transparency. And some nations are threatening not to recognize the results after Nicolas Maduro was declared 
 
 the winner in Venezuela's presidential election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(MUSIC)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: In the middle of the night announcement, the government controlled national electoral council proclaimed the longtime strongman 
 
 victorious with 51 percent of the vote.
 
President Maduro described his victory as a triumph of peace and stability.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Monday, 12:27, at dawn, I break the news of the triumph of the national independence of 
 
 the people of Venezuela's dignity. They couldn't win despite sanctions. They couldn't win despite aggressions. They couldn't win despite threats. 
 
 They couldn't now and they will never do so against the dignity of the people of Venezuela.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, the opposition dismissed the announcement as fraudulent and is vowing to challenge the results.
 
Stefano Pozzebon joins me now live from the capital Caracas. And, Stefano, we've been talking about this election in the days ahead. A lot of concern 
 
 about whether it would be free and fair.
 
And a lot of people scratching their heads now in regards to that point, given that we saw a 30 percent lead in the polls just days before for the 
 
 opposition candidate.
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, exactly. I think nobody could call that election as either free or fair now. We know, for example, the main 
 
 opposition candidate Maria Corina Machado was barred from running.
 
There have been reports or more than 70 detentions of opposition activists just in the month of July.
 
However, what the opposition was hoping for, and what the international community was hoping for, was a competitive election, was an election that 
 
 could bring an end to the impasse that Venezuela has been living through in the last decade with an authoritarian government that day-after-day lacks 
 
 most of the international legitimacy.
 
Well, yesterday's results, Bianna, unfortunately do not give any sense of legitimacy with most South American and Latin American countries all asking 
 
 for an audition, all asking to see the full results.
 
The ballot papers that the electoral authorities have said grant that victory to Nicolas Maduro just because, as you said, there is that 
 
 discrepancy between the latest numbers from before the vote and some informal exit polls that we have collected in Venezuela.
 
It's illegal to share any exit polls. The electoral authority is the only authority allowed by the law to give results. But there is, of course, a 
 
 lot of concern.
 
It's interesting that the only countries, at least in Latin America, that have already celebrated Nicolas Maduro's victory are Cuba, Nicaragua, and 
 
 Bolivia.
 
Even left wing democracies here such as Chile, and especially the president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, have shown a lot of -- have shown a 
 
 lot of urgency to and demanded to see those act.
 
The opposition has, so far, stepped short of calling for in -- for widespread mass protests on the street like the ones that we used to see in 
 
 2017 or 2019.
 
But, of course, tension is rising very rapidly here in Venezuela, Bianna. And in the next few days, you could see some of those clashes taking back 
 
 place on the streets of Caracas.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. You mentioned the calls of skepticism and condemnation from neighboring countries.
 
We should also note the congratulatory calls, no surprise, coming from the leaders of China and Russia as well
 
Stefano Pozzebon, thank you so much.
 
Well, Miriam Kornblith is the Senior Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the National Endowment for Democracy. And she joins me now 
 
 live in Bethesda, Maryland.
 <br>[12:15:08]
 
Miriam, if we're speaking frankly with each other, I think it's fair to say that this isn't much of a surprise in terms of the results of these 
 
 elections. I guess just now the question is what happens next?
 
The opposition said that they are still -- or they will soon announce how they're planning to challenge the results.
 
But what options do they really have?
 
MIRIAM KORNBLITH, SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY: Hi. How are you doing?
 
Yes. Well, basically, I think the burden of the proof is on the side of the government. The government has to come up with some kind of demonstration 
 
 that those figures that they fabricated last night have any kind of support.
 
So far, the government or the Electoral Council, which is a branch of the government, has not provided the CD that contains all the results, has not 
 
 of the, you know, the full tally of the -- of the -- of the tally sheets around the country.
 
They have -- they suspended the audit of the process. They haven't published in their portal the information, which is what they usually do 
 
 and they have done in past processes.
 
And so it's basically the government that has to prove that those numbers, those figures, have any kind of, say, real basis.
 
And that is what the governments around the region have been asking for. Maduro has come out of this much weaker than what he -- than what he 
 
 entered in this process because he was looking for legitimacy and so far has not obtained that legitimacy.
 
On the other hand, the opposition has come up very strong. The figure, the support of the opposition candidate that, Edmundo Gonzalez is really 
 
 astonishing. It's beyond it. It's higher than what the poll -- the poll had predicted.
 
So the opposition is now in the -- in the -- in the process of first consolidating the diplomatic support that it has received throughout the 
 
 region is also in the process of just pushing, pressing the government to come up with these figures. And is also carefully but reliably counting on 
 
 the people in Venezuela that know what the results were to usher their opinions and their views.
 
GOLODRYGA: But Miriam, Miriam, a lot to unpack here, because we know Maduro has already survived an 11-year regime, overseeing the country when the 
 
 economy, if one could believe, was even worse than it is right now.
 
And, yes, we've seen condemnation in terms of statements from neighboring countries and harsh words from the United States as well as terms -- in 
 
 terms of the legality and process here for the election.
 
But you've got a U.S. election coming up here. I don't know that there's much appetite in neighboring countries to do anything more than issue 
 
 statements.
 
And it's a real risk for the opposition to push the people and really try to generate riots and protests on the street knowing that given what we've 
 
 seen in the past can result in a lot of tragic deaths and injuries.
 
KORNBLITH: Well, I never said that the opposition is pushing the people to riot in the streets and to promote demonstrations and less so violent 
 
 demonstrations.
 
I'm just saying that -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: or even to protest.
 
KORNBLITH: -- the people will express their will -- the people will express their will, their views through peaceful means as they did yesterday.
 
This is -- the people in Venezuela have been doing that throughout the whole year. It's not only an electoral event.
 
One of the -- one of the reasons why Maduro engaged in this election trying to seek legitimacy was to lift the sanctions. I don't see in any shape or 
 
 form that these sanctions will be lifted. And this is something that the people are feeling very deeply in terms of their economic well-being and 
 
 are constantly demonstrating, not only for electoral reasons, but for every day matters.
 
This is -- Maduro has lost the little support that he had domestically in terms of the people because this has uncovered the real -- say, the 
 
 fraudulent nature, not only of the elections, but also of the whole regime.
 <br>[12:20:05]
 
So, again, I think of we -- the opposition has always thought of this election as part of a process. The election itself is very important, but 
 
 it's part of the process of transitioning to a democratic regime.
 
So this is one of the step stones in this process whereby the opposition has demonstrated in an extremely clear, peaceful, electoral institutional 
 
 fashion that Maduro no longer has the support of the people, that the opposition has the support of the people, that the opposition is playing by 
 
 the democratic and principle rules. And that has weakened Maduro's position in the country before Venezuelans, before the international community, and 
 
 this will be part of the process of regaining democracy in Venezuela.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. The Maduro regime appears to be making a mockery of the democratic process, given how they've handled the election over the 
 
 weekend. We'll continue to follow this story very closely, obviously, because we know that it has implications far beyond Venezuela's borders.
 
Miriam Kornblith, thank you so much for joining us.
 
Well, doctors in Northern England are treating at least eight people for knife injuries. Police in the town of Southport, near Liverpool, have 
 
 arrested a man and seized a knife.
 
The local ambulance service says some of the injured were taken to a children's hospital. The U.K. Home Secretary responded to the attack in 
 
 Parliament earlier on Monday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YVETTE COOPER, BRITISH HOME SECRETARY: I know the whole House will be very concerned at the extremely serious incidents that has taken place in 
 
 Southport.
 
We -- all of our thoughts will be with the family and loved ones of those who are affected. I have been in contact with the Merseyside Police and 
 
 Crime Commissioner and the Merseyside Mayor to convey my support to the police and our thanks to the police and emergency services for their swift 
 
 and courageous response.

GOLODRYGA: A nearby business owner tells local media that he believed several young girls had been stabbed.
 
Well, still to come for us, firefighters are trying to get a handle on a huge fire in California. After the break, how investigators believe it 
 
 started and who they think is responsible.
 
Plus, training for Olympic swimmers in the River Seine has been canceled for yet another day. Second day in a row, actually, due to poor water 
 
 quality. We'll have a live report just ahead.
 
Also ahead, the Olympics just started, but one American team of gymnasts is already making history. How and why ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:25:26]
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, the park fire in Northern California has burned more than 145,000 hectares. That's 360,000 acres, making it the seventh largest 
 
 wildfire ever recorded in the state.
 
At the last check, firefighters say it's just 12 percent contained. Officials say the fire has destroyed at least 100 structures. Evacuation 
 
 orders are still in place for four counties.
 
Meanwhile, the man accused of starting the massive fire is due in court in the coming hours. Police say he pushed a burning car into a ravine which 
 
 ignited the fire.
 
Well, spectators were holding their breath Sunday as U.S. gymnast, Simone Biles, fought through an apparent ankle injury to produce an impressive 
 
 performance on her Olympic return.
 
She ended up on the top of the leaderboard in the all-around rankings and with Team USA in first place in team standings.
 
Biles will compete in four events, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise in Tuesday's women's team final.
 
Now it's important for us to know that Biles is part of the most racially diverse U.S. women's gymnastics team in the team's Olympic history.
 
CNN's Coy Wire shows us the significance of this milestone.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIMON BILES, AMERICAN-BELIZEAN GYMNAST: I know what it's like being the only black girl on the team and not having a role model.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Sometimes you have to see it before you can truly believe it.
 
CORRINNE TARVER, FORMER GYMNAST: It is so gratifying to see such a diverse group of women who are going to represent this country. And it truly shows 
 
 that as a sport, we have come a long way.
 
WIRE: Four-time Olympic medalist, Dominique Dawes, was the first black female gymnast to ever win an individual medal at the Olympics at the 
 
 Atlanta Games in 1996.
 
At the 2012 London Games, Gabby Douglas became the first black gymnast to win an Olympic all-around competition.
 
Fast forward to today, and four of the five U.S. women's Olympic gymnastics team competing in Paris, are women of color, is their most racially diverse 
 
 team in history.
 
TARVER: I was trying not to cry, honestly. When I saw the makeup of the team, I just kind of felt like in my heart, I truly felt, wow, we finally 
 
 got in somewhere. We're finally able to truly show the talent that we had. And it has nothing to do with the color of one's skin. It has to do with 
 
 what they do on the mat.
 
WIRE: This year's squad, seven-time Olympic medalist, Simone Biles, reigning all-around Olympic champ, Suni Lee, reigning Olympic floor champ, 
 
 Jade Carey, 2020 Olympic team silver medalist, Jordan Chiles, and rookie, Hezly Rivera, the youngest member of the entire team USA delegation.
 
The next generation of kids growing up, that's not a question anymore if they can do gymnastics because they don't see anybody else that looks like 
 
 them.
 
You look at our team, our national team, and you see diversity across the board, not only black and brown girls, but you see all of the different 
 
 colors.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you see yourself and somebody else and somebody else can see themselves in you, like I think it only makes you feel, wow, 
 
 like I've done something in this world.
 
I've been able to change the culture in something or the diversity in something. So I just hope I can continue to, you know, meet that little 
 
 light for them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: I love it. Really, truly the best of America.
 
Well, Olympic organizers say the men's and women's triathlons will go on as planned in the River Seine.
 
Earlier on Monday, however, officials canceled training in the river after the water was deemed unhealthy for athletes.
 
Officials say if the swimmers can't race on Tuesday and Wednesday, they should be able to do it on Thursday and Friday.
 
Oh boy, swimming in the Seine had been illegal for a century, but organizers say it's been cleaned up enough for swimming.
 
Our Melissa Bell swam in the Seine a few days ago, and she joins us now live from Paris.
 
So, first, Melissa, I guess the good news is you survived to tell about your experience. But is it -- is it worrisome at all that what you were 
 
 allowed to do, these Olympians are not?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Now, I am still standing at least report at, Bianna, that I haven't been hospitalized. I 
 
 have nothing to show for my swim in terms of ill effects.
 
But the point is that when we swam that day with the mayor of Paris, conditions had been good enough that the bacteria levels, including E. 
 
 coli, were at acceptable levels.
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
One of the big gambles at the very heart of these games has been all along that even if as they managed to, they got the levels down just ahead of the 
 
 games, would conditions hold so that both the triathlon and the marathon swimming events could put in the water behind me? So it's a massive gamble.
 
And there are those triathletes, frankly, who haven't been not pleased at the idea that their triathlon might yet become a biathlon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEANNE LEHAIR, TRIATHLON COMPETITOR: It's a complicated subject, but it's more like there were things to do before than one month before the games 
 
 be, oh, maybe no swim, but you had like seven years to find another way, so that's it. That's why I'm a bit mad.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BELL: Now the worrisome thing, as you mentioned, Bianna, is the fact that the training sessions had to be cancelled at the course of we can remember 
 
 that extraordinary opening ceremony we had, that was, in many respects, a washout. Those rainy conditions continued on Saturday and that, of course, 
 
 affects the water levels.
 
Now, what we understand is that testings happen today ahead of the men's event, the day after. We will find out very early in the morning whether it 
 
 will be shifted because Paris organizers have planned for these contingency days or whether it will go ahead as planned.
 
But again for the athletes this is a huge part of their event. So if the -- if on the subsequent contingency days it's found that the swimming isn't 
 
 possible yet in the river, it becomes a biathlon. So you're looking at run, bike, run rather than the swimming event.
 
Of course, for those athletes who've been preparing and who specialized in the swimming events, that would be a disaster.
 
GOLODRYGA: And they prepare and prepare and train for this very moment. So it would be devastating if they're not allowed to participate fingers 
 
 crossed that they will be.
 
Melissa Bell, thank you.
 
And still to come for us, the sound of protest greet the Israeli prime ministers, as he visits the town of the Golan Heights, which was the site 
 
 of a Hezbollah rocket attack over the weekend. Details and analysis of the situation straight ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga. More now on our top story.
 <br>[12:35:44]
 
Israel's Prime Minister visited the Israeli occupied Golan Heights earlier Monday. Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing that his country's response to 
 
 Saturday's deadly rocket attack there will be severe.
 
Israel blames Hezbollah. The militant group is denying responsibility. His visit sparked protests.
 
Demonstrators lined the streets of the town in Golan Heights where the attack took place. They shouted that the government is not welcome here.
 
Well, time now for The Exchange. We want to take a closer look at the Golan Heights rocket attack and the implications for the region.
 
CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger, joins me now. He's also a White House and national security correspondent for "The New 
 
 York Times."
 
David, it's good to see you and quite a tragic miscalculation, one would assume that this was not the intention of Hezbollah to target these 
 
 children.
 
That having been said, they have been sending rockets into Israel since October 8th of last year. And this was the concern all along about this 
 
 going from a regional heated conflict to something that would impact a much larger scale and swath of both countries there, Lebanon and Israel.
 
How concerned are you right now as we're expecting to see a larger scale response from Israel?
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Bianna, as you suggest, we're sort of right on the edge here ever since October 8th, 
 
 when Hezbollah began attacks the day after the terror attack on Israel, we have been worried that this would be the much larger conflict.
 
Remember, Hezbollah is far better armed than Hamas is. The U.S. intelligence estimates are that they probably have 150,000 rockets, drones, 
 
 others in storage so they could overwhelm the Israeli defenses.
 
And, of course, Israel is stretched thin here now. So it's a really hard calculation for Prime Minister Netanyahu who got a very mixed welcome when 
 
 he went up to visit this Druze community whose children were tragically killed in this attack.
 
And he's got to decide between an overwhelming response and then thinking about how Hezbollah would respond in return.
 
It's why the U.S. is urging him and President Herzog to do a very limited response.
 
GOLODRYGA: He's mentioned a limited response, but one would imagine that they also want to send a message of reestablishing deterrence, as far as 
 
 their response goes.
 
And that is where things become very complicated because as we've been reporting, neither side appears to want to full-on war, we still remember 
 
 what happened.
 
In 2006, Hezbollah had been saying that their fighting and their rockets would stop once the fighting in Gaza stopped.
 
Is all of that change now given what we're expecting to see from the Israelis in response to that deadly attack Saturday?
 
SANGER: We just don't know, Bianna. I mean, it depends on how the Israelis respond. Hezbollah miscalculated in 2006, and there was an overwhelming 
 
 response.
 
And right now, we have, on both sides of the border, tens of thousands of displaced people who have had to move out of their homes because of the 
 
 sort of low-level rocket exchange that we've seen.
 
This incident raises the possibility that that would escalate dramatically. The Israelis could try to go hit Beirut. I think if they did, that would be 
 
 a significant escalation.
 
We saw Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the phone to President Herzog from his travels in Japan and the Philippines, the Secretary's travels, 
 
 urging that they do this with a scalpel, not with that overwhelming response.
 
But you're absolutely right. Restoring deterrence is the key here, but if you overreact, you may be undercutting your effort to restore deterrence.
 <br>[12:40:09]
 
GOLODRYGA: How does this impact in your view, the potential ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza?
 
SANGER: Well, we thought that deal was going to come weeks and weeks ago. We had moments a few months ago when President Biden said he thought it was 
 
 just days away.
 
We've seen the CIA director, Bill Burns, back in the region over the weekend, which suggests that there is, you know, something coming together 
 
 here.
 
Secretary of State Blinken was in Aspen a week ago Friday, and said he thought they were on the 10-yard line. That did not mean that they would 
 
 necessarily get it.
 
If they got it, I would think that that would go a long way toward calming what's happening on the Northern border here.
 
But if they don't get it and there's a big Israeli response and reaction to that, it could undermine the deal.
 
GOLODRYGA: What role is it on?
 
SANGER: Because these are all interlocked -- 
 
GOLDORYGA: Yes.
 
SANGER: Yes. All interlocked chess pieces, right? I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. I was going to ask. I mean, let's go to that. The head of the octopus and the tentacles -- 
 
SANGER: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- of the, you know, the axis of resistance there now in the region and that is Iran.
 
How does Iran factor into this? In terms, obviously, Nasrallah has the authority to do a lot of things, but ultimately, I would imagine Iran has a 
 
 say here too as far as what a Hezbollah response would look like.
 
SANGER: That's exactly right. And there are a couple of factors to that. One is we have a new Iranian government coming in. They don't usually have 
 
 that bigger voice in this, but clearly it's a more reform-oriented set of individuals who were hoping would be a voice of calm here, but we don't 
 
 know what their role is.
 
The second big factor is the Iranians did step back a little bit after their missile attacks back in April on Israel and Israel's counter 
 
 response. We thought that could escalate. It did not. And that would be pretty much the model that you'd want to follow here.
 
I think the Iranians are being cautious for the same reason Hezbollah is. They've got more to lose from an all-out war than they do from a limited 
 
 response.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. But as always, David, we're just one miscalculation away from another front opening.
 
SANGER: As we saw the other day. I mean, yes, absolutely. I mean, the chances here for accidental war are so high. And that's the fear.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And it's something we're watching closely here as we're just months away from a presidential election as well.
 
David Sanger, a lot to talk about. Thank you so much for your expertise. We appreciate it.
 
SANGER: Great.
 
GOLODRYGA: And we'll be right back with more.

GOLDORYGA: At the Paris Olympics, Kenyan superstar, Faith Kipyegon, is favored to win a third consecutive gold medal in the 1,500 meters. And the 
 
 run up to the games, CNN visited her in Kenya as she prepared for Paris.
 
Watch as she discusses the impact her daughter has had on her life and career.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FAITH KIPYEGON, KENYAN TWO-TIME OLYMPIC CHAMPION: My name is Faith. I can start with that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good afternoon.
 
KIPYOGEN: Did you say hi to Yuris (ph)?
 
And I have my cow there that we just keep for milk for Alyn.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In 2018, Faith Kipyegon gave birth to her daughter, Alyn.
 
Since then, she's won an Olympic gold, three world titles, and broken three world records.
 
KIPYEGON: Being an elite athlete and being on the top, everybody expects you to perform well and be on top of the world.
 
After giving birth to Alyn, it was not easy task to come back, because you have to reduce weight. You have to work for the baby. You have to look 
 
 after the baby.
 
After maternity leave, I was doing abdominal exercise to reduce my tummy. Because of her pregnancy, you have to do a little exercise to build up the 
 
 stomach. And also to stay strong when you come back to athletics.
 
She changed my life, and she changed my mindset and my mentality to realize that now I have somebody who is looking up to me and as a role model.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Having overcome her humble upbringings Kipyegon is seen as a leader in her sport. And is helping to reshape the future of 
 
 women's track and field whilst changing the perception around elite sport and motherhood.
 
KIPYEGON: When Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Allyson Felix came back after maternity leave, we met in Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games.
 
I think we motivated young women to know that that you can go on maternity leave and come strong -- become stronger than before.
 
So I think they realize that it's not the end of your life but it can be the beginning of your life.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kipyegon stands poised to etch her name into the history box as she hopes to become the first Kenyan to win gold at three 
 
 consecutive Olympic Games.
 
KIPYEGON: It's a history. It's history I'm looking for, especially when Olympic season approaching. And, you know, it's a big event and everybody 
 
 is dreaming of getting that gold medal.
 
And Faith is also dreaming of getting that gold medal.

GOLODRYGA: Well, comic book movies, which have been in a real slump lately, got a huge boost over the weekend.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you ready?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm the Wolverine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Marvel's "Deadpool &amp; Wolverine" has earned more than $200 million of U.S. box offices and close to $440 million worldwide.
 
It is the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated film and the eighth biggest opening for any film in Hollywood history.
 
The film brings back Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character, who was killed off in 2017.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUGH JACKMAN, ACTOR: It was something in here. It was -- I really thought I was done. And then when I saw Deadpool One, I was like, hang on a sec.
 
And then I, five or six years later, I was driving, and I just knew in my bones I wanted to do that. I knew for fans it would be the thing that 
 
 waited for. I knew it would be a kind of dynamic that we'd never seen before.
 
I had no idea how hard it would be physically at age 55 to do it, but it's absolutely worth it. I loved it. I had loved every second of it.
 
RYAN REYNOLDS, ACTOR: Yes. It's been there. I feel like I've waited my entire life to do this one movie. So I don't -- the only -- the only 
 
 problem that poses is I don't know what the hell we're supposed to do next.
 
JACKMAN: Right.
 
REYNOLDS: So we'll see.
 
JACKMAN: I could retire again.
 
REYNOLDS: Yes. You could retire again. I could -- I could try it this time.
 
JACKMAN: You could try it.
 
REYNOLDS: It sounds nice.
 
JACKMAN: You don't have to stick to it.
 
REYNOLDS: No, that's true.
 
JACKMAN: You can say whatever you want.
 
REYNOLDS: Very flexible.
 
JACKMAN: No one's believing you any way.
 
REYNOLDS: No.

GOLODRYGA: They're so funny together.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Oliver Darcy with more on this. So is this the movie that saved the box office, Oliver, given last year all the rave was 
 
 "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer?"
 
OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: Yes. And this smashed-pass "Barbie's" total ad in the box office in the opening weekend, it earned 
 
 $211 million in the opening weekend at the domestic box office. That's putting in number six of all-time openings, just behind the two "Star Wars" 
 
 movies and the "Avengers" films.
 
So really incredible showing. We knew this was going to be a big box office opening for "Deadpool &amp; Wolverine," but no one I think anticipated it was 
 
 going to be this big.
 
And it comes as Marvel crossed the $30 billion mark across all of its movies at the box office. So a really great weekend for Marvel, which also 
 
 announced that Robert Downey Jr. is going to be coming back for the next Avengers films to play a villain this time.
 
A big shot in the arm for this franchise, which has been struggling in recent years after the "Avengers: Endgame" movie.
 
And so I'm sure there are old smiles over at Disney looking at these box office receipts.
 
GOLODRYGA: Oliver Darcy, thank you so much.
 
DARCY: Thank you.
 
GOLDORYGA: And while Marvel, let's now see what talked more about what Oliver just mentioned.
 
The directors of the next big Avengers movie introduced the villain for that film, a character named Dr. Doom. And they shocked fans by revealing 
 
 the actor who will play him as we just heard from Oliver.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE RUSSO, DIRECTOR "AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY": Ladies and gentlemen, as proof of the unimaginable possibilities in the Marvel multi-universe, we give you 
 
 the one person who could play Victor Von Doom.
 
(CHEERS)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: The raptors roars there. Actor Robert Downey Jr., who played the hero, Iron Man, in previous Marvel films and who was killed off in 
 
 "Avengers: Endgame," was revealed as the big bad guy for the next Avengers movie. That film is expected to hit theaters in 2026. So a lot to 
 
 anticipate and look forward to there.
 <br>[12:55:06]
 
And finally, Taylor Swift fans took tailgating or Taylor-gating as it's become known to the next level in Munich, Germany.
 
Those on the hill outside the open roof stadium were able to hear Swift's performance for free.
 
Police estimate that 40,000 people camped there on Saturday. That's in addition to the 75,000 fans who had tickets for the show. They got a good 
 
 show indeed.
 
Swift is on the European leg of her Eras Tour. After two nights in Munich, she is headed to the Polish capital of Warsaw for three concerts there.
 
Well, that does it for this hour of ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Thanks so much for watching. Don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with 
 
 "AMANPOUR" after the break.
