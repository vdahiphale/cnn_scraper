FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.
 
And we begin with a frigid final stretch before the first vote of the 2024 presidential election. Freezing weather causing major disruptions at the Iowa caucus campaign trail. They are now just two days until caucus goers make their picks, but today, much of Iowa is under a blizzard warning. Temperatures dropping into the single digits. And that's cooling off what's typically a fiery final blitz for campaigns.
 
Candidates are scaling back in-person events across the Hawkeye State, even as they tried to lower those still undecided voters.
 
CNN's. Jeff Zeleny and Jessica Dean are braving the elements on the Iowa campaign trail. Good to see both of you. Jeff, you first. How much of an impact is the weather expected to make leading up to Monday's caucuses?
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fredricka, there is no doubt that it will impact the number of Republicans who turn out to the caucuses on Monday night.
 
All campaigns are scrambling to sort of assess how it is exactly going to affect it. But the reality here, the winds, the punishing winds. You can feel them as they hit your face here. That is the issue. And this is the warm spot. It will be colder tomorrow and even colder on Monday night.
 
So, the campaigns are doing a variety of things behind the scenes to really try and make sure their supporters get to the Iowa caucuses.
 
One of the challenges is, in some of the rural counties across Iowa, there is only a couple precinct locations for the whole county. So, some people may be driving a great distance to try and get to their caucus location. So, former President Donald Trump has canceled his in-person rallies today. He was supposed to be having a couple of rallies. One in Atlantic, Iowa, which is in the western central part of the state, and then, one in Sioux City. He's canceled those, he's been unable to fly here.
 
His rivals, though have been on the campaign trail. Ron DeSantis this morning, Nikki Haley as well.
 
But Fredricka, there is no doubt the expectations for high turnout have certainly been revised by Republican officials. Now, it's just a question of who turns out?
 
So, the campaigns are certainly going through their paces here. But the weather absolutely could impact things Monday night. The cold is not that uncommon. The snow is not, but it's the punishing winds, and that dangerous winds chill that has worried so many here, Fredricka.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. And Jessica, you're with the DeSantis campaign. What's the message in his final stretch?
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fredricka, it's been interesting to see how they have zigged and zagged, around the weather situation that Jeff just laid out here in Iowa.
 
DeSantis was one of the only candidates that continued forward with a few of his in-person events yesterday, and he is moving forward with his full slate of events today.
 
So, we're going to see him all across the state of Iowa. He's already had one event in the state this morning, I'll let you listen to his pitch to voters leading up to caucus day.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDATE: I'm a Florida boy, born and bred. And yet, here I am in negative temperatures, I am not going to be canceled. If people are willing to come out and hear from me, I'm going to show up all the way until the end of this caucus, you're going to see me everywhere.
 
I can tell you this, if you're willing to go out there, and you're willing to brave the elements on a cold, windy, snowy January night for me, and do that for a few hours, I'll fight for you for the next eight years, and we will turn this country around.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: And Fredricka, you could say that no candidate in this GOP primary has more on the line here in Iowa than Ron DeSantis. He and his campaign have gone all in on this state. Their theory of the case is that if they can post even a very strong second place finish here, that, that will be enough to make him -- to put him on the path to being the alternative to Trump.
 
Now, of course, nipping at his heels and right there next to him is Florida's -- former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who has had a lot of momentum heading into these final days. And the dynamic that we've seen playing out on the ground here in Iowa in the last few days is really, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis just going at each other both in all of their events on hour debate stage earlier this week, over the airwaves.
 
So, that is what we're watching as we head into Monday is exactly what the margin will be between Donald Trump, and then, whoever comes in second and whoever comes in third, but DeSantis can Continuing to go all across the state tomorrow -- today, and then, also tomorrow. Fredricka.
 <br>[12:05:05]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Jessica Dean and Jeff Zeleny, thanks to both of you, appreciate it.
 
All right. So, let's check the barometer on all things, Iowa politics right now with editor in chief of the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Kathie Obradovich. I hope I said that right.
 
Kathie, good to see you. I'm glad to see that you're inside, staying warm. But I mean, the headline is the weather. And I wonder how it is going to impact turnout? I mean, how diehard are these Iowans?
 
KATHIE OBRADOVICH, EDITOR IN CHIEF, IOWA CAPITAL DISPATCH: Yes. Well, Fredricka, Iowans are hardy, but we're not foolhardy. And I will tell you this weather right now, for example, is dangerous. The roads are icy, people are sliding off the roads. And you combine that with below-zero temperatures. It will have an effect on turnout on Monday night.
 
Now, you -- first of all, you're going to see older voters, you know, decide not to go out and freeze their buttons and possibly break a hip in or getting out to the caucuses.
 
And so, you know, the candidates that benefit are the ones who can really mobilize the younger voters, and also the ones who have a robust ground organization, who can get their four-wheel drives out -- drive people to their caucuses, clear out their driveways, if necessary.
 
And you really do those things to kind of facilitate getting people to the caucuses safely.
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, that's very interesting. So, the younger voters are more likely to, you know, get out to those who have the transportation. And then, when you try to break that down into the appeal of certain candidates, who has the advantage when you talk about that demographic in terms of the frameworks?
 
OBRADOVICH: Yes. I mean, Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has a lot of advantages. And we'll see. So, the Des Moines register has a new poll out tonight. It will be interesting to see how that support breaks down. They haven't had a poll out for a month.
 
But Donald Trump in the last poll was doing very well with young voters, as well as older voters.
 
So, if he loses some on the -- on the older scale, he might pick up younger voters, as we -- as we go along. The other -- you know, he also does very well on the enthusiasm. They -- he -- you often hear him say that his supporters are the most enthusiastic of anyone's, and actually, the polls have borne that out.
 
So, enthusiasm combined with younger voters, he does have an advantage if the weather continues to be bad.
 
WHITFIELD: So, Trump has, you know, those many advantages that you just spelled out. He's obviously as the name recognition given that he was once in the White House as well, too. But when you talk about like Ron DeSantis, he has canvas that state unlike anybody else.
 
He is -- there has become a familiarity with him in just about every county.
 
He is hoping that will bode well from -- for him. Is that what might make a difference if it pertains to that second-place finish?
 
OBRADOVICH: Yes. So, in the -- in the races, you know, the second place is what we're all watching on caucus night, right? That, you know, at 9:00, the winner is going to be called and it's going to be Donald Trump. But we'll still be battling it out, I think to see who else might go on from Iowa.
 
Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley are the ones who have the best opportunity. And Ron DeSantis, the amount of time he spent on the ground, he is traveling to all 99 counties. He has built up a more robust ground organization.
 
And like I said, you know, when the weather is bad, that ground organization is what's going to help Ron DeSantis get his people out to the caucuses.
 
Now, Nikki Haley, they have an advantage also of people who might be supporting her who don't necessarily show up in all the poll., People who might change their voter registration, for example, at the caucus, or people who might be Democrats who change their voter registration to support her.
 
So, she also might have an opportunity to do better than expected. But I think Ron DeSantis, with the time he spent in Iowa and the ground game with the bad weather does have an advantage over her.
 
WHITFIELD: You know, on the campaign trail, Nikki Haley has received a whole lot of compliments as being very poised, very knowledgeable, very personable. How are you hearing voters describe her or perhaps all the candidates? Are they looking for the -- you know, something about the candidate of their choice? Is it a relatability? Is it the poise? Is it you know, global knowledge? What are the things that -- what's the criteria, I guess, in which voters are judging these candidates?
 
OBRADOVICH: Yes. I mean, I think a lot of those things that you just mentioned are important, but what it comes down to for most Republican voters is their estimation of who can beat Joe Biden in November?
 <br>[12:10:12]
 
I think that's what drives a lot of the, especially the Trump voters, but it is also driving voters for other candidates who don't think Trump can win. So, ultimately, you know, regardless of where candidates stand on the issues, if a candidate doesn't, you know, check all the boxes for you, a lot of the Republicans are just looking at, OK, who is most likely to win in November because that's what we really care about.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Kathie Obradovich, thank you so much. Stay toasty and warm in there.
 
OBRADOVICH: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Take care.
 
All right. So, overall, Iowans are used to some pretty tough weather conditions, but this is on track to being record breaking. Back-to- back storms hitting the Midwest, abrupt the snowiest week for Des Moines, Iowa since 1942. And state officials are warning travelers to stay off the roads during dangerous whiteout conditions and slick roads.
 
Meteorologist Elisa Raffa joining me now from the CNN Weather Center with the very latest. Elisa, what are the -- what are Iowans, you know, facing likely in the next couple of days?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: We are talking about wind chills that are dangerous, that are life threatening. Officials urging people to stay home because if you spend more than 10 minutes outside, you can have frostbite.
 
We are ready finding these wind chills right now down to 22 degrees below zero in Des Moines, with still a couple of lingering snow showers. That we still have blizzard warnings in effect for a lot of northwest Iowa, including Des Moines, up towards Spencer and Sioux City.
 
And it's not really because we're getting that much more snow today. It's because we have all the snow on the ground, you might get another inch or two. But we still have gusts up to 45 miles per hour.
 
So, it could create what we call a ground blizzard where just the blowing snow could still drop visibility and make things very dangerous, even if you're not seeing too much snow fall out of the sky.
 
Then, we're looking at the wind chill warning that's in effect through Tuesday, because we can find those wind chills up to 45 degrees below zero. That is dangerously cold. When you put the frostbite time on here, it's 10 minutes.
 
Frostbite in 10 minutes in Des Moines, Iowa. Overnight Sunday going into going into Sunday. Just incredibly cold. And then, even as we get towards caucus day, we're going to still find these wind chills.
 
You know, as you're headed out in the evening to the polls, you are looking at them as cold as 25 to 30 to 35 degrees below zero. So, again frostbite in 15 minutes or less.
 
These are all the high temperatures for all the past caucuses in Des Moines and most of them are in the 30s and 40s. 2004 is when we had high 16 degrees and we are looking at that high, the National Weather Service is forecasting minus two for the high temperature on Monday. So, it would be, by far, one of the coldest caucuses on record. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, my gosh. All right. Thank you so much. Elisa Raffa.
 
All right. And as the first major test of the 2024 presidential election, and the stakes in Iowa are very high. Who will come out on top? The "2024 IOWA CAUCUSES" coverage starts Monday, 4:00 p.m. Eastern, right here on CNN.
 
All right, the U.S. has launched a second round of attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Is it enough to stop attacks in the Red Sea? We'll go live to the region next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:17:44]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. The U.S. carried out a second round of strikes overnight against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The attack launched by the U.S. alone was much smaller in scale than attacks carried out earlier in the week with multiple allies.
 
In a statement a short time ago, a spokesman for the Houthis said they will retaliate for the latest assault by the U.S. Houthi forces fired at least one anti-ship ballistic missile on Friday after the first round of strikes.
 
For weeks, Houthi rebels have been carrying out drone and missile attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
 
CNN's Nic Robertson is following developments from the region. Nic, I mean, these new attacks were focused on a very specific facility. Right?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: They were and this is an indication that after the battle damage assessment there, there was a view taken that there were -- there were additional targets that were necessary to be hit, as far as we know, was a radar type installation, which would be designed to prevent the Houthis from being able to get a good view of A, what was coming to strike them; but B, what should -- you know give them a clue their view, if you will, of the shipping in the Red Sea, which has been mostly their intentional target, although they did late yesterday trying to hit, it seems, a ship in the Gulf of Aden, just outside of the Red Sea.
 
But the Houthis have been through airstrikes over many, many years when they were fighting with the Saudis and the internationally recognized government of Yemen. And I think, most analysts at the moment think that's going to give them some resilience.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Allahu Akbar -- 
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Iran back Houthis whipping up anti-American and anti-Israeli anger, chanting death to America, death to Israel curse the Jews.
 
We condemn the criminal terrorist strikes on the Yemeni people by Israel, America and Britain, he says. We have been at war for eight years. The strikes don't frighten us.
 
Familiar with war, because a decade ago, the Houthis, a minority religious sect and this, the poorest country in the Arab world overthrew the internationally recognized government.
 <br>[12:20:05]
 
Seizing army weapons stockpiles, triggering a festering civil war and famine. Drawing in Saudi and the UAE, backing the real government, hitting Houthis with airstrikes. I've been witness to some of it.
 
ROBERTSON: The positioning of these valves on the side of the missile that convinced the Saudis, this is Iranian manufactured.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): The Houthis, backed by Iran, targeted Saudi with Iranian made cruise missiles, and hit the UAE with drones.
 
Inside Yemen, ragtag Saudi-backed government troops failed to oust the Houthis from the capital.
 
ROBERTSON: We're keeping low here because we've been told the Houthis might be able to see us.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Government lines, often on demand, fighters hired from local tribes. Without money, few fought. April 2022, a fragile truce agreed.
 
Backed by Iran, the Houthis could afford more fighters, had ready supplies of sophisticated drones, cruise missiles, and more. As recently as last year, putting thousands of uniformed troops and weapons on parade.
 
Their truce and pause in regional aggression, ending 12 days after Hamas's brutal October 7th attack, launching missiles at Israel.
 
Weeks later, escalating attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea, that they falsely claim is connected to Israel. And now, threatening more in support of Gazans.
 
REAR ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: And this has nothing to do with the war on Gaza. This has to do with them using Iranian supplied munitions -- Iranian supplied weapons to go after international shipping in the Red Sea. ROBERTSON (voice over): Iran and its regional proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, accusing the U.S. and the U.K. of escalating regional tensions to help Israel.
 
While America's regional partners, Saudi and the UAE worry about escalation, a potential return to Houthi attacks on them.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROBERTSON (on camera): So, that's really the potential danger for the United States and its partners in the region that this becomes a drawn-out conflict. The United States, the U.K. and others in the coalition get drawn in for the long haul. And as the Houthis is saying that they are doing these strikes -- that the United States is doing these strikes to get essentially in support of Israel against the people of Gaza. And that narrative is amplified by Iran.
 
It serves Iran's purposes for the United States to stay engaged for a long time, because Iran wants to drive the United States out of the region. And to be able to maintain that narrative that United States is there against Arab interests and supporting Israel's interests. It's a narrative that's clearly doesn't hold water.
 
But it's a narrative that successful for Iran, and that really will hurt the United States and its allies in the region.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Nic Robertson, thanks so much.
 
All right. Straight ahead back in this country, a brutal blast of arctic air is spreading through much of the nation over 250 daily cold records could be broken in the next couple of days. We'll bringing the latest forecast.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:27:36]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Welcome back. A United Airlines extended its cancellations of its Boeing 737 Max 9 flights for the next few days. The airline company is trying to accommodate its passengers after canceling about 200 scheduled Max 9 flights every day.
 
United says the extended cancelation period gives them more time to work with the FAA and ensure their planes are safe for travel. And this comes after an Alaska Airlines flight with the same plane model had its door plug blown off midflight, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
 
And now, we are just two days away from the first votes being cast in the 2024 election as Iowa prepares to hold this Republican presidential caucus on Monday. And most of the GOP candidates are now being forced to scale back on their last-minute pitches to voters today, as much of the state is under a blizzard warning.
 
On Monday, an arctic blast is expected to make for the coldest caucus day ever in Iowa already braving near whiteout conditions at least, it looks that way in the background. Eva McKend is there for us in Des Moines.
 
All right. So, Eva, besides giving us the forecast there. I mean, how are these candidates kind of adjusting their schedule since? I mean, we're talking about, you know, potentially dangerous weather and conditions to get out there, crisscrossing every county in the state.
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: Fred, it's a little cold, little windy, the snow is falling. But I have to tell you, the Iowans that I speak to, they are still very determined to turn out and participate in the caucus Monday.
 
They take their role as the first in the nation very seriously. And they say that past winter weather has not deterred them and these conditions won't deter them either.
 
Governor DeSantis, Nikki Haley back on the trail today after being stymied earlier this week by these are conditions -- of the blizzard- like conditions have made for impassable roads.
 
So, even if they were to hold their events, it's very difficult for Iowans to be able to traverse these roads and physically get there.
 
And although Donald Trump, the former president enters the caucus, as the clear front runner, there are some Iowans that are still making up their mind right up until caucus day. And there are some Iowans who are looking for some alternatives. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that it's time for this country to come together. I think it's time to put a leader in there that can bring us together and move us forward, and heal some of the past. We've had too much chaos.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With the way the country is going right now, I think people are looking for something else.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKEND: So Governor DeSantis, Nikki Haley on the trail this morning, Vivek Ramaswamy, Asa Hutchinson having to switch gears, he canceled one of them but will be able to make another. And that is just the reality of what is happening on the ground.
 
Still, Iowans have shown great resolve in recent days before the events got canceled. We heard -- we saw voters turning up in frigid temperatures, asking these candidates about a range of issues, the future of social security, foreign policy, the economy, immigration. And so Iowans are really taking their role seriously vetting these candidates, up until the moment on caucus day for him.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, the countdown is on. All right, thank you so much and you stay warm and cozy as best you can there in Des Moines. All right, still to come, the same advice for football fans, bundle up. Temperatures at kickoff for tonight's Kansas City Chiefs home game versus the Miami Dolphins are forecast to hover around zero. Wind chill, a bone chilling 22 below. The temperature in Miami right now by the way, 80 degrees. Next, how the teams are preparing for one of the coldest NFL games ever.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:35:47]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, voters in Taiwan shrugged off warnings from China and reelected the ruling party for a third consecutive presidential term. It's a vote that could have major consequences for U.S. relations with China. CNN's Will Ripley has more.
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: History on the streets of the Taiwanese Capitol tonight, thousands of people are out here listening to the first words of their new president-elect Lai Ching-te and his -- the vice president-elect Hsiao Bi-khim. This is their first press conference after confirming that they have accepted their election win, the two opposition parties the parties that were considered friendlier to China both conceded earlier in the evening on Saturday.
 
The election results came through relatively quickly just a few hours after the polls closed here in Taiwan. This island democracy has a reputation for being very efficient when it comes to tallying the election results, partially because there are just under 24 million people living here and nobody can vote with absentee ballots. So everybody who cast their ballots, the millions of Taiwanese who voted actually had to do so in person in their hometowns.
 
But a lot of people turned out there were just under 2,000 polling sites here in Taipei alone, and there were lines that a lot of them throughout the day, because of what is at stake in this election. China had told the Taiwanese people warning them in the run up to this election, that this was a choice between peace and war, prosperity and decline, implying that the Democratic Progressive Party, which is openly loathed by Beijing's communist leaders, is the wrong choice in China's view, to lead Taiwan for the next four years.
 
And they've been making their point, not only with bellicose statements, but also with actions including just in recent days sending spy balloons over Taiwan, unveiling imagery of their third most advanced aircraft carrier, one of the most advanced in the world that experts say once it completes the trials will play a vital role in any potential invasion of Taiwan, which China has never ruled out, as they say that they will eventually reabsorbed this island as part of their territory, even though the communist rulers in Beijing have never actually controlled it.
 
And of course, there's always the looming threat. But people here, the supporters of the Democratic Progressive Party, see that's exactly why they have decided to give the DPP four more years in Taiwan because they believe that the party's strategy of a close alignment with the United States prioritizing military, diplomatic and economic ties with the U.S. is the way to protect Taiwan from a Chinese attack as opposed to the opposition's argument that in fact, remending fences with China. Rebuilding that relationship and recalibrating the U.S. relationship would have been the way to dial down the temperature and avoid cross strait conflict.
 
But Taiwan has made its decision a third historic, consecutive presidential term for the ruling party, the DPP.
 
WHITFIELD: Will Ripley, thank you so much. And just a short time ago, China responded to the election results. The foreign ministry saying the election does not change their view that Taiwan is part of China. Let's get more now on this historic election. Bonnie Glaser is the director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund. So great to see you. So with China's response there, I mean, are they signposting something about what they believe should be next.
 
BONNIE GLASER, DIRECTOR, ASIA PROGRAM, GERMAN MARSHALL FUND: I thought Beijing's response was relatively moderate. They reiterated that unification is inevitable, but also said that they look forward to working with some political parties in Taiwan, of course, that means probably every political party other than the winning Democratic Progressive Party.
 
But there were really no new threats in the statement that was issued by the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing. It's probably a placeholder, so we'll have to see what steps they can -- that they take in the weeks and months to come.
 
WHITFIELD: And the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, you know, says he's looking forward to working with Dr. Lai Ching-te, you know, after Lai won the presidential election. What does that say? Or how was that received if you are China?
 
GLASER: I think that China expects nothing less than that the United States will continue to strengthen ties with of Taiwan. I would also note that President Biden had a statement as well and what he said was a reaffirmation of U.S. policy that the United States does not support Taiwan independence. And that's a message that China has heard before, doesn't necessarily think that it is credible, but it's important for them to hear.
 <br>[12:40:23]
 
And I think that it does, to some extent, reduce the possibility that they will react very strongly in the near term. And I think it was intended to reassure.
 
WHITFIELD: In what way might it be an obstacle between the U.S. and China as it tries to, you know, resume operations and relations?
 
GLASER: I think that Taiwan, of course, has long been a issue in the U.S.-China relationship where we've had very sharp differences. And the two presidents Xi Jinping and President Biden speak very directly to each other about Taiwan. And they met November at the Woodside Summit. And my understanding is that they had a very candid exchange. I believe that Xi Jinping wants to preserve the fragile stability that has been achieved in the U.S.-China relationship. He is probably focused on the economic headwinds and corruption in the PLA. I just don't think he wants a conflict with Taiwan at this point. And he doesn't really want to upset the improving relationship with the United States, even though we probably has lower expectations.
 
WHITFIELD: Do you feel like Taiwanese feel more emboldened now? We heard our Will Ripley there saying that, you know, voters say that this was a choice of peace over war. And now that this is a historic third consecutive win, what does that say for Taiwan's posture?
 
GLASER: I don't think that the new President Lai Ching-te and his Vice President-elect, of course, Bi-khim Hsiao has been the representative from Taiwan, in the United States for several years. I don't think that they are going to be emboldened to pursue independence. We have really heard both of them reaffirm that they will continue the policies of the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, that is preserving the cross street status quo.
 
And I think they both realize that they only won 40 percent of the vote. That means that 60 percent of the people in Taiwan voted for one of the other candidates. The DPP ruling party also lost its majority in the legislature. And so it will be more difficult to pass laws going forward as a result. Hence, so this is going to be, I think, a challenge for the DPP. But I think their priority will be continuing to strengthen ties with the United States with the rest of the world and I don't think they want to rock the boat in relations with Beijing.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Bonnie Glaser, we'll leave it there for now. Thank you so much.
 
GLASER: Thank you.
 <br>[12:43:06]
 
WHITFIELD: We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right up and down the East Coast potentially dangerous severe weather. Let's go to Maine first take a look. The Maine coast there will see potentially historic storm surge, inundating coastal communities that are already swamped as you see right there. Water levels in Portland are expected to set a new record projected to hit 14 feet.
 
And authorities in parts of New York State are warned of extensive road closures because of coastal flooding, while on New Jersey's Passaic River, flooding is expected where communities are still reeling from rising waters. It's unbelievable, the damage and there could be more on the horizon. Our Polo Sandoval is in Paterson, New Jersey. Is there a way that people can brace for what's to come?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It really is incredible, Fred. Since December, we've seen wave after wave of wicked weather affecting millions of Americans up and down the Northeastern seaboard. And now the more immediate threat at least here in Paterson, New Jersey, flooding. All of this water, the source of it is actually the Passaic River that you mentioned a little while ago, the river about maybe 90 or 100 yards away from where I'm standing.
 
According to New Jersey's governor, the Passaic has already been at flood level for the last several days, so any additional rain could lead to even more flooding potentially worse than what we experienced in December. These neighborhoods that you're looking at right now here in Paterson, these are some of the low lying areas. So the folks who live and work in this part of the neighborhood are quite familiar with the flooding potential of the Passaic.
 
So authorities have been closely monitoring the forecast and calls for another two feet above what we're seeing right now, which is why authorities has actually set up these sort of barricades throughout the neighborhood. We've been here for quite some time here, Fred, that people who are taking their chances, choosing to actually drive in while others are simply just shifting into reverse, which is perhaps the wisest thing.
 
In neighboring New York, a flood warning, coastal flood warning in effect for another hour and a half or so. So it really does speak to the advisories, the warnings, the watches that are in place for so many people who live and work in the Northeast. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Polo Sandoval, thank you so much.
 
And speaking of New York, I mean this breaking news in the NFL playoffs. Now that game, that highly anticipated game where feet of snow expected in Buffalo Bills territory, that game has now been postponed and those are two hardy teams the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers. The game has now been postponed until Monday because of the severe weather. CNN's sports Patrick Snell joining us now with details on this. You know, it's bad when even the Buffalo Bills home game is going to be postponed.
 <br>[12:50:14]
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You know when it's getting really bad --
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
SNELL: -- and really concerning. But I think based on the information we're still getting, and we're still processing, Fred, I think almost certainly without question, the right decision, given the conditions. This is literally just developing within the last few minutes. So I think fair to say I step very rarely seen in terms of NFL history, but a very necessary one. As I was saying, you got the gusty winds there, and just look at these images here, Fred, they kind of speak for themselves, really.
 
The blowing snow as well that's expected in Buffalo Sunday afternoon. New York's Governor making the announcement at a press conference a very short while ago. Let's hear and let's listen to exactly to what she had to say.

GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): And that is why I'm pleased to announce that in the interest of keeping both Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh fans safe. I just spoke with Commissioner Roger Goodell who shares our concern that safety should be the top priority. I've also spoken to the mayor and our county executive about keeping our fans safe. The NFL has agree with our assessment that we need to postpone tomorrow's playoff game until 4:30 p.m. Monday afternoon.

SNELL: Yes. Safety the top priority. Heavy snow is in the forecast along with winds over 25 miles an hour at Highmark Stadium. The bills had also been actually asking fans in the build up to the game, Fred, to help come -- help clear the field in the stands before kickoff. The postponement meaning now, what does it mean actually for Monday? It means we got two games on Monday. We got the Bills and Steelers at 4:30 p.m. and the Eagles and Buccaneers in Tampa at 8:15 p.m. So really significant details on this day -- on this weekend is highly important weekend in the National Football League.
 
WHITFIELD: It really is. There's another playoff game today on one team. Miami Dolphins are not going to be able to avoid the snow because that Kansas City Chiefs home game there is still underway, right?
 
SNELL: Yes. Absolutely. We got the Browns-Texans on this day as well. We got all eyes on the Dolphins-Chiefs as well. Of course the Kansas City Chiefs, the reigning Super Bowl champs. We do have images there of Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs hosting the Dolphins. Let's just say Fred, it is extremely frigid weather there, no question, one of the coldest settings and postseason history.
 
Again speaking volumes are the images that are Kansas City at this hour, live images of arrow head stadium there. Watching it very close indeed because, it is a huge weekend --
 
WHITFIELD: Of course, I mean, contrast that with the 80 degrees in Miami.
 
SNELL: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: So the Dolphins, I mean they're going to be wearing gloves or not because, you know, the Kansas City Chiefs, some of them are going to be a little hardy and try to send some intimidating messages. We don't do gloves here.
 
SNELL: It's a big weekend.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. It is. It's going to be exciting.
 
SNELL: Much to look forward to and now we got as I say, those two games on Monday. WHITFIELD: Yes. OK. We'll be watching. We'll be watching today. We'll be watching Monday, all of it. Patrick Snell, great to see you. Thank you so much.
 <br>[12:53:30]
 
All right, we'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the gunmen responsible for killing 10 black people at the Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York. This will be the first capital punishment case for the U.S. Justice Department under the Biden administration. And the families of the victims are having mixed reactions to the news. CNN's Miguel Marquez has more.
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Look, this was a very difficult case for the federal government to seek the death penalty. This decision came down to the Attorney General himself and it was explained to the victims, the families of the victims of that Buffalo massacre which was just it was such a vile, such a hideous act. It is hard to even use words to describe it. It was just so horrific.
 
This is an individual who planned this out who became radicalized, plan this out, drove 200 miles, researched the place that would have the highest number of African Americans went to a store, grocery store that he knew there would be people at that store at that time, went in with a helmet and body armor. He was live streaming it at the same time, hoping to start a race war.
 
This is somebody who has already gone through the legal process in the state of New York. But it does not have the death penalty. He's already going to serve a lifetime in prison. Many of the families are happy that the government is seeking the death penalty, some families are not. Mark Talley spoke to cameras shortly after they were informed of the government's decision.
 
And he spoke out about his mother, Geraldine Talley, who died at that Tops friendly supermarket in Buffalo on 514, 514 is what they call it in Buffalo. And it is etched into their memories there. He spoke about his mother and his feelings about the death penalty.

MARK TALLEY, SON OF VICTIM GERALDINE TALLEY: I thought about my mom a lot, mainly those first six months. I still have a lot of, you know, just a lot of dreams in which I'm crying in the dream most of my emotions that are what I dream and I see her, think about her. No smell, I've still got up. I took two clothes of hers, and I can still smell their scent. That's when I really think about it the most.
 <br>[13:00:21]
 
As far as I'm concerned, I think he's getting off the hook getting the death penalty, because he won't get that suffering that I want. As long as I'm alive whether God gives me 20, 30 or 60 years, I want to be able to see him to suffer.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUEZ: There's also a hearing where the government indicated its intent to pursue the death penalty. Many, many family members were in that hearing, the defendant was not. But many family members saying that they will be in court every day to watch this process play out. The next court date is February 2nd. Back to you.</pre>
