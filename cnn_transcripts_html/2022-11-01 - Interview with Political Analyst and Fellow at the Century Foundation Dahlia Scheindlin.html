ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (on camera): Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church.
 
Just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM:
 
CHURCH (voice-over): Russian missiles bombard Ukraine's capital, leaving much of the city without electricity and water. We are live in key with the latest.
 
South Korea mourns the victims of Saturday's crowd crashes. Attention turns to why the authorities failed to keep the event safe.
 
And voting is underway in Israel. A critical election that could make or break Benjamin Netanyahu and save the country shift to far-right extremism.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM WITH ROSEMARY CHURCH.
 
CHURCH: Thanks for being with us.
 
Well, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says work is now underway to repair critical infrastructure across the country after Russia's latest barrage of missiles took aim at Ukraine's energy and water supply.
 
In Kyiv, a city with a pre-war population of some 3 million people, the mayor says 80 percent of residents were left without water on Monday. And while power is gradually being restored, one Ukrainian energy company warns it's running out of equipment to make repairs.
 
Ukraine's military says it was able to shoot down 45 of the 55 cruise missiles fired by Russia on Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin says those strikes are not all his military can do. But Mr. Zelenskyy says Ukrainians will not be intimidated.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Russian terrorists do not have such missiles that can hit the Ukrainian desire to live, live in a civilized manner, and take care of each other.
 
And if someone over there in the Kremlin listen to their crazy propagandists and decided that the darkness in Ukraine would help put pressure on Ukrainians, then let them not be surprised that their losses when they see how Ukrainians conduct negotiations in the dark.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: CNN is Clare Sebastian is standing by for us in London. But we want to begin with Salma Abdelaziz, who's following developments in Kyiv.
 
Salma, even though 90 percent or so of these Russian missiles were apparently stopped by Ukraine, the damage to power and water supplies has been extensive. What is the latest on this?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER: Absolutely devastating impact Rosemary, after this barrage of missiles fired over 50 cruise missiles. 44 of them shot down, as you mentioned, the majority of them taking down, but of course, several of them hitting their targets across 10 different regions in Ukraine, hitting 18 different facilities, most of them energy related here in Kyiv.
 
That meant that some 80 percent of residents did not have access to water at the start of the day. Yesterday, was around this time that, that missile attack started right in the morning. Russia are sending people into bomb shelter, sending families that were taking their kids to school absolutely terrified.
 
And after, of course, that station situation was stabilized, Ukrainian authorities were able to bring up a majority of those water services back up.
 
But what's important to note here, Rosemary, is that Ukraine's infrastructure has now, for weeks, been targeted by Russian missiles. That has been the intention behind this barrage of missile attacks. And what that's left in its wake is an infrastructure system across the country that is extremely fragile, that is extremely damaged, that is extremely precarious.
 
So, yes, although a majority of those missiles are intercepted, it only takes a couple to get through, and the impact is massive.
 
We heard from Ukrainians yesterday that they're actually running out of the equipment they need to repair power grids, to repair the water supply. The mayor of Kyiv, telling families, they need to store water at home, because inevitably, Russia will fire these missiles again.
 
There is been power cuts across the country, ways to conserve electricity wherever they can by running the trains a little later by cutting off streetlights, whatever ways they can. And as they head into the winter, President Zelenskyy has appealed to his allies and partners for more equipment to help repair the power grids. We often talk about Ukraine, asking for weapons, asking for help on the front lines.
 
They're now asking for help in civilian areas to be able to repair the very basic infrastructure that people need. All of this coming just a couple of days, of course, after Russia pulled out of that all imported grain deal.
 
And again, Rosemary, we're just talking about the basics here: Food, water, electricity, and that's why Ukraine is accusing Russia of turning all of these into essentially leverage in this war, into targeting civilians.
 <br>[12:05:07]
 
They say they're using water, gas, as a weapon.
 
CHURCH: All right. Many thanks to our Salma Abdelaziz, joining us live from Kyiv.
 
Well, the European Union is condemning Russia's decision to suspend its participation in a U.N. brokered grain export deal. Russia made that move after blaming Ukraine for an attack in Crimea.
 
CHURCH (voice-over): Russia claims movement on the Black Sea grain corridor is now suspended and warns using it would be risky.
 
Still, about a dozen ships could be seen using it on Monday. The E.U. is calling on Russia to reverse its decision over fears it will affect the global food crisis.
 
CHURCH (on camera): And for more on this story, I'm joined now by Clare Sebastian, joining us live from London. Good morning to you Clare.
 
So, the E.U. condemns Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the Black Sea grain initiative, but Ukraine is sending grain ships to sea anyway.
 
So, what is the latest on this? And of course, what are the risks involved for those ships?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Yes, Rosemary. The latest is that Russia says that it has suspended its participation. It has not fully exited the deal, clearly leaving the door open in order to provide itself with leverage against Ukraine.
 
It is still allowing these diplomatic overtures to try and change its mind to go ahead. There was a call late Monday between foreign minister -- Russian Prime Minister Lavrov and his Turkish counterpart. The Turkish side clearly wants to salvage this deal. It has been a key broker in this really only diplomatic achievement of this war, so far.
 
So, that call went ahead. But meanwhile, both Sergey Lavrov and President Putin are claiming that the reason why they have had to sort of temporarily, in their words, pull out of this deal is because they say that Ukraine has violated the safe maritime corridor that was created for ships under this deal through this alleged drone attack on Crimea over the weekend.
 
This is something that President Putin is sticking with. Have a listen to what he said on Monday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): Those drones, both undersea and air drones happen to be partly in corridor, through which the grain from the Ukraine has exported.
 
They created risks for both our ships, we should provide security for the grain export as several ships who are taking care of it. But we've made commitment to provide security.
 
But if pardon me for the expression, Ukraine here, so ships will be the ones to blame.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: Well, Ukraine, of course, denies this. And it should be noted that Russia had been making it clear for really several months before suspending as much information in this deal that it had problems with it, it was complaining that the grain was not going to the third world as promised. And it said that it was having trouble exporting its own food and fertilizer onto the world markets.
 
Of course, the risky situation now is that the other parties want to keep this going despite Russia not providing security guarantees.
 
CHURCH: All right, Clare Sebastian, many thanks for that report. Appreciate it.
 
We're joined now by Arif Husain in Rome. He is the chief economist of the World Food Program. Thank you, sir, for being with us.
 
ARIF HUSAIN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME: Thank you for having me, Rosemary. Thank you.
 
CHURCH: So, how concerned are you about Russia pulling out of the grain deal for now, at least, and the impact that will likely have on grain supplies the nations' most in need?
 
HUSAIN: Yes, this is -- this is very troubling, you know, because it's not about one or two countries, it is about the world. As you know, there -- I mean, even before this, I mean, the number of people who are in food crisis that right now stands at about 345 million people. That's more than the population of entire United States.
 
And of these 345 million, there are about 50 million people who we call are in hunger emergencies, meaning one step away from famine.
 
And there, in fact, about a million people in famine like conditions. And all of this is happening in the -- you know, not in one or two countries, but in dozens of countries.
 
So, at this time, if this deal gets suspended, or you know, there is uncertainty, that raises prices, and that raises prices of food commodities, not only in rich countries, but also in the poor countries.
 
So, what we really truly want is that not only that we don't stop talking about the suspension, but in fact, the continuation of this deal because according to the original agreement, this is going to expire. The first 120 days are going to expire on November 19th, which is not that far away.
 
So, what we want is that this deal continues until we see a political solution to this war, and markets, and trade, comes back to normal as it should be.
 <br>[02:10:04]
 
CHURCH: Right. We know, of course, that Turkey, Germany, and other nations are urging Russia to rejoin the U.N. brokered grain shipment deal. How much hope do you have that they can convince Russia to do that sooner rather than later?
 
Because we know that Russia was saying, well, you know, the door isn't closed on this. They're using it as leverage. But, in the meantime, there's a food crisis in the world.
 
HUSAIN: Exactly. I mean, you know, and like I said, you know, it's not about Russia, it's not about only Ukraine, it is really truly about the world. And at a time, when you know, the world is already reeling from the after effects of COVID, we are dealing with climatic shocks, we are dealing with conflicts, we are dealing with food, high food prices, high fertilizer prices, high energy prices, inflation at levels not seen in decades.
 
I mean, you know, so this is not happening. And if this was the only problem, it would be bad enough. But this thing happening at a time that the world is in turmoil is terrible.
 
Let me just say one other thing that, you know, with all its issues and problems right now, what we are dealing with is an affordability crisis. What that means is that food is there, but it maybe it's not at the right place, maybe it's not at the right cause or right price, but it is there.
 
But the problem is that if we don't sort out the fertilizer issue, which also comes or should come from this corridor, and from Russia and from other countries, today's affordability crisis will turn into tomorrow's availability crisis, meaning there would not be enough food.
 
Imagine what that would do to the prices, and in this particular environment.
 
So this is, this is not only about today, it is also about tomorrow. And you know, growing food takes time. So, this is very serious business.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CHURCH: It's only dozen (PH). So, what happens then, if Russia continues to suspend its participation in the Black Sea grain initiative? What other options are available to get that grain safely out of Ukraine to those countries most in need? Are there other viable routes apart from by sea?
 
HUSAIN: Well, it's going to be tough. And it's not only about moving it, it is about moving at what cost, right?
 
So, you can -- you can move it, but if it is at a cost, which you know, vast majority of people cannot afford, Imagine that, you know, literally millions of -- millions of people, they spend upwards of 50 to 60 percent of their income on buying food.
 
So, when the prices of food go up, there is not that much upside.
 
What are they supposed to do? Take their children out of school, not take them to health clinics, eat inferior quality food, skip meals, all of this is happening as we see right now.
 
And then, you get to a point where you start to see riots, you start to see destabilization, you start to see migration out of destitution. And that doesn't only hurt those people, it hurts the entire world. And then we spend 1,000, you know, 1,000 times more sorting those problems out.
 
And this is not just me saying, we have seen this in so many places, and so many times. And people need to realize this is why it is so very necessary that we sort this out and sort this out now.
 
CHURCH: Arif Husain, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.
 
HUSAIN: Thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: South Korea has been plunged into mourning for the victims of Saturday's deadly crowd surge.
 
At these memorial sites in Seoul, dozens of people have laid flowers and bow their heads in memory and respect for the 156 people who were crushed to death.
 
It happened in these narrow alleyways as crowds of party goers grew too large.
 
South Korea's police chief says the response from authorities ahead of the crowd surge was quote, inadequate.
 
CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us now from Seoul.
 
And Paula, so many families and friends experiencing this excruciating loss of loved ones with many asking how this tragedy was allowed to happen, or what more are you learning about this? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Rosemary, this is a nation in shock. But the anguish is turning in some places to anger. How was this able to happen? How were so many people in such a confined space? Now we're seeing many people coming to memorial sites like this one behind me to pay their respects, to lay a white flower as is customary here at funerals, and to show their condolences for those 156 victims.
 
Now, we have seen and heard from the police chief today, he apologized, he bowed deeply, and he also said that there had been a number of emergency calls just before the event took place.
 <br>[02:15:06]
 
And clearly the response was inadequate. It is clear that the investigation will be looking at that very closely.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over): A once thriving nightlife hub now the site have endless grief and loss. South Korea is in a period of national mourning. The more than 150 lives lost in a crowd surge on Saturday.

TAVERNITI: This is like the middle of town.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
TAVERNITI: So, waves are coming in from both sides.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
TAVERNITI: And more people fell, and that I lost my friend. There is so many people. When you get -- then people -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
TAVERNITI: And I like turn around, and I told the crowd, you can't come this way. People are dying.
 
HANCOCKS: South Korean officials now admitting there were no guidelines for dealing with the Halloween festivities in Seoul that took a deadly turn.
 
KIM SEONG-HO, SOUTH KKOREANN MINISTRY OOF THE INTERIOR AND SAFETY (through translator): An event without an organizer was actually an unprecedented situation.
 
OH SEUNG-JIN, DIRECTOR, VIOLENT CRIME INVESTIGATION DIVISION, NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY (through translator): There is no separate preparation manual for a situation where there is no organizer and where a crowd is expected. HANCOCKS: Survivors who managed to escape recount the horror.
 
OLIVIA JACOVIC, CRUSH SURVIVOR: It was about like, you know, you, versus other people. I just wanted to get out of there. I was using my arms, squishing out like I don't care that my clothes were getting ripped or had like, you know, I had bruises on my arms and stuff from trying to maneuver out, it was just shoulder to shoulder, people just couldn't breathe.
 
The shorter people were just trying to look up in the air to get some sort of air.
 
The deadly tragedy sent shockwaves across the world. The victims, many teenagers and in their 20s. Included, 20-year-old American college students Steven Blesi from Marietta, Georgia. He'd only been in South Korea for two months.
 
STEVE BLESI, FATHER OF STEVEN BLESI: I feel like I have a hole in me, a big hole in my chest. I can't tell you the pain that is. I wish I would have not let him go.
 
And Anne Gieske, a nursing student from Kentucky who was studying abroad in Seoul. Blesi and Gieske's families are just two of the hundreds who received life changing news that night, grieving with a nation in shock and demanding answers.

HANCOCKS: Officials have also opened up and Lost and Found. We are seeing heartbreaking images of rows of shoes, of Halloween costumes that loved ones can go and retrieve. Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: Impossible to understand the heartbreak there. Paula Hancocks, bringing us that report. Many thanks.
 
For Israel, this is feeling like a song on repeat. Yet, another general election is underway in a country that's very divided and a familiar face is attempting a comeback.
 
Plus, Brazil on edge. President Jair Bolsonaro has yet to publicly acknowledge his defeat in Sunday's election runoff, and that's led his supporters to protest in the streets. We'll have more on that in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:20:25]
 
CHURCH: Welcome back everyone.
 
Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered all public roads and highways to be cleared of protesting Bolsonaro supporters.
 
The far right president has not yet publicly acknowledged his defeat in the election runoff by a razor thin margin.
 
Meanwhile, his supporters set up hundreds of roadblocks across the country, protesting the election result.
 
CNN's Paula Newton is on the scene at one protest in Sao Paulo.
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The results of this election in Brazil maybe in, but the protesters here, they are not having any of it.
 
NEWTON (voice-over): All over Brazil, there have been these kinds of protests going on, on roads, and highways from one end of the country to the other.
 
We are in Sao Paulo. This is a major highway leading into the downtown area and through to the airport. Have a look here. We have protesters that are encroaching on a major highway. They are looking for support and they are getting it here as well.
 
The issue for them is they are saying it doesn't matter Bolsonaro concedes. They are saying they will stay out here as long as necessary, creating chaos for the country. Because as far as they are concerned, Bolsonaro won. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a president that won at the ballot box. And they diverted the ballot boxes and put the other candidate ahead, and we're against that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even if Bolsonaro accepts, the people will not accept it. Because the power comes from the people. The people were the ones who put Bolsonaro there, and we're the ones who would remove them as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: The division that we heard throughout this campaign is now being rented on the streets. If you look here, they will, at times, pull into traffic, continue to block traffic, and then come back to the barriers.
 
Police are here, and they're trying to be here in force. But what they are saying is that they want to try and de-escalate the situation. And we're hearing this from authorities right across the country.
 
They are negotiating a way to keep them safe, to let them protest.
 
NEWTON (voice-over): But also not to come in, in a forceful way, as they do not want to motivate people to escalate this protest further, and continue to block more roads.
 
This will be a tense situation, though in days to come, especially as they are saying it does not matter what Bolsonaro says at this point or the international community. They are determined.
 
NEWTON (on camera): They will be out here having these protests as long as it takes. Paula Newton, CNN, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
 
CHURCH: Polls are now open in Israel for its fifth parliamentary or Knesset election in less than four years.
 
CHURCH (voice-over): And these are live pictures from Jerusalem where it's now after 8:00 a.m. and we've seen a trickle of voters moving through.
 
This is an election that could make or break former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is eyeing a comeback. And that is after the ideologically diverse cobble together coalition of Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett crumbled.
 
Now, acting Prime Minister Lapid is hoping his centrist party can finish in a strong second place.
 
But Israel is dealing with political gridlock and fears of growing apathy. CNN's Hadas Gold ask voters which issues they care about most.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN POLITICS, MEDIA AND BUSINESS REPORTER (voice-over): By now, Israelis are experts at voting. Never before in the country's history. Have Israelis gone to the polls so often in such a short period. The fifth round in just over three years, as no stable government has managed to take hold.
 
Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping to make a comeback, while the current caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid hopes to stay in place.
 
We head at Jerusalem's Machaneh Yehudah Market to see what the voters really care about. Security in the Israeli Palestinian conflict is top of mind for many voters. As 2022 has seen some of the deadliest levels of violence in years.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The first issue is the occupation because it's just -- it's everywhere. And it's -- and it's just, it affects everything, everything. The situation in Gaza, the violence in the West Bank, the militarization of the society.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): First of all, we need 50,000 more police and border guards, and need to let them operate freely.
 
GOLD: Other side of the soaring cost of living.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I want someone who will look after the younger generation
 <br>[02:25:01]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we can get a house to live in and security which is the most important thing in the country.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I am thinking about security. I'm thinking of a good economy, good education.
 
But like the previous four elections, many votes rests on one question. Do you want Netanyahu back or not? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't want Bibi to be prime minister. So, I hope he won't get in. So, that's also on my mind.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I would be very happy if Bibi is elected. Bibi is the best for us. With Bibi, the Messiah will come.
 
GOLD (on camera): Many Israeli voters here in the market and across the country so that they are exhausted by the repeat election.
 
But what's different in this round and what's at stake is not just the return of Benjamin Netanyahu, but the possibility that the far-right politicians will have power.
 
GOLD (voice-over): Any coalition that would bring Netanyahu back to power will likely need to rely on the growing right-wing religious Zionism, Jewish power (INAUDIBLE).
 
Partly led by the extremist Itamar Ben-Gvir, once convicted for inciting racism, and supporting terrorism. And idea that either delights or terrifies the voters in the market.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): He is the Zionist. And the Arabs will know exactly where they stand with him. They are guests here, and we are the owners of this land, and not them.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Itamar Ben-Gvir is, he says and he does. He will do anything to show who is the boss.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's very scary, because I think it needs disaster, even more so than now.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We think he's very bad for the country.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because he kind of bring us 2oo to 30 years -- the last 20 to 30 years with the intifada and the problems with Arabs. We want to live by peace. And it will be very, very difficult with Ben- Gvir.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLD (on camera): A veritable market of use, as Israelis wait to see whether the fifth time is the charm. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.
 
CHURCH: Joining us now from Tel Aviv is political analyst Dahlia Scheindlin. She is a fellow at the Century Foundation, who has consulted on Israeli political campaigns.
 
Thank you so much for being with us.
 
DAHLIA SCHEINDLIN, POLITICAL ANALYST AND POLICY FELLOW, THE CENTURY FOUNDATION: Thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: So, voting for Israel's fifth election in less than four years is now underway. And we could very well see the return of Benjamin Netanyahu, despite his corruption charges.
 
How likely is a Netanyahu come back, do you think? And if he's able to pull that off, what would his coalition government look like, if he has to reach out inevitably to the far right?
 
SCHEINDLIN: I think of all the various scenarios, it is certainly one of the more likely scenarios that we have in place right now. And that's because Netanyahu has basically four parties, including his own, and three others who are very loyal to him, and have already agreed that they would go into a coalition with him.
 
We don't know if we can completely trust them. Anything could happen after the elections. But he still has the best possibility to reach what Israelis now consider the magic number of a bare majority of 61 parliamentary seats out of 120.
 
The average of all of his parties in the polls over the last campaign cycle has been around 59, creeping up over the 60 seat mark out of 120 seats. If that trend continues, it's not impossible that he would get 61 or even more.
 
That would be a surprise, it would go beyond what we're seeing in the polls. But he does have that block. The problem is that the parties who are running against him, who want to form a coalition that he does not lead, they're not sufficiently united.
 
So, at present, the blocs appear to be even. Those other parties representing -- many of them representing the outgoing government have about 60 seats themselves, but they are not sufficiently united. That's one of the reasons the government fell apart.
 
So, it is certainly a possible scenario, he would be going in with the Religious Zionist Party that you mentioned in your report, which is very extremist, nationalist, supremacist, Ukcratic Party (PH), and to ultra-orthodox parties who often sit in Israel's coalition. So that's what the government would look like.
 
CHURCH: So, let's look at that alternative. Because while Netanyahu works on his comeback, Acting Prime Minister Yair Lapid is doing all that he can to keep Netanyahu out of power. Do you think it's possible Lapid could do then, recreate the surprise he pulled off after the last election?
 
SCHEINDLIN: It's a very uphill battle. Again, because the number of seats they have at 60 or if they're lucky, 61, includes parties that, you know, they either don't want to go in or won't be invited in.
 
And those primarily, the two parties, if they crossed the threshold representing mostly Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel.
 
And there was a great controversy over the United Arab list joining the previous government. The other party called Hadash Ta'al, probably nobody would invite them.
 
And they have been taking a very hard line against doing (PH) a government. And so, it's you wouldn't have an easy path to building a coalition.
 <br>[02:30:01]
 
He would have to pull off some very significant and masterful negotiations in order to price somebody away from the block of parties currently supporting Netanyahu or even individual members of one of the parties of one of the parties, we could certainly -- the immediate option, if there are people who are willing to defect in order to join your Yair led -- Yair Lapid led block.
 
The other option is that the other party in that block, the party of the current defense minister, outgoing defense minister, Benny Gantz, the party is called National Unity, they are claiming that even though they are only polling at around 12 to 13 seats, that they would have a better chance of breaking the Netanyahu block and pulling one of the parties over, and that maybe they could form a coalition. Of course, you don't have to be the biggest party in Israel, as you know from the outgoing government.
 
And so, all of those scenarios are on the table. There are many permutations of each scenario and there's a great deal of uncertainty.
 
CHURCH:  So, what is the voter turnout likely to be in various parts of Israel, and what are the main issues on voters' minds right now?
 
SCHEINDLIN:  Well, it -- voter turnout is a very interesting thing. As your report pointed out, people are fatigued, but from everything we can see in the surveys, overall, voter turnout looks set to be typically high. Israel generally has high voter turnout. Last time, it was over 67 percent.
 
As far as we can see, it will probably be in that range. But the big concern is that the Arab citizens of Israel have been indicating that they will vote at a much lower rate than the Jews, which is a typical pattern also in recent years. It could be anywhere as low as the mid to upper 30 percent range or as high as 50 percent, but very few predicted it will go above 50 percent, and that will be a critical distinction.
 
You know, in terms of the issues of the campaign, it's complicated because, of course, Israelis are worried about cost of living, dealing with the price hikes like everybody else in the world, but they don't really distinguish between the parties based on economic themes. It's much more about -- in Israeli it's much more -- in terms of issues, it's about the Israeli Palestinian conflict and security. And we have seen serious escalations over the last number of months. That's very top of mind, including attacks and ongoing raids of Israelis in Palestinian cities and attacks of Israelis.
 
So, all of that certainly -- generally helps the right-wing, pushes people to vote for more right-wing parties. But I really think that, ultimately, at this point, fifth election in less than four years, most people are choosing based on which block, The Netanyahu supporting block or those who are opposed to Netanyahu. They see the same issues but just believe whichever side they support will resolve them better. CHURCH:  All right. We will see what happens. Dahlia Scheindlin, thank you so much for joining us, appreciate it.
 
SCHEINDLIN:  My pleasure.
 
CHURCH:  Well, still to, come Indian police make multiple arrests after a tragic beverage collapse. We are live in New Delhi with the latest on the investigation and who they are holding responsible.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
CHURCH:  Well, the death toll from a tragic bridge collapse in India has risen to 135 according to officials. This dramatic video showing the moment that the bridge fell apart and plunged into the water. The bridge had only recently reopened from scheduled maintenance. Police have arrested nine people in connection with the accident. Funerals and cremations began Monday for some of those who died in the accident. The Indian government has agreed to compensate families of the victims.
 
And CNN's Vedika Sud joins me now from New Delhi. So, Vedika, what were you learning about these nine people arrested in connection with this tragic bridge collapse Sunday?
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER:  Rosemary, most of them are connected or rather affiliated with the company that was given the contract to maintain this bridge. Now, like you pointed out, this bridge was under maintenance and repairs for more than six months and had just reopened last week. One would imagine that this bridge obviously would be foolproof in terms of any kind of weakness in terms of the way they had repaired it. But in this case, it just collapsed.
 
You had at least 200 people on the bridge when the incident took place. It was holiday season. India has just completed its celebration Diwali, one of the biggest Hindu festivals which is on the 24th. And then, there was the Ugadi new year, celebrated in that state, particularly where people are in holiday spirit, more than -- they take their children to different places within Gujarat to celebrate the occasion. And that's the reason why you see more than 30 children dead in this mishap. Most of them were with their families.
 
Some lost their friends, some lost as many as 12 family members. And they are all asking, Rosemary, who should be hold accountable? It's all very well to arrest nine people on day two of the incident. What we know is that these are junior officers from that company that was given the contract. But what about the owners? What about the administration who gave the go ahead for this bridge to be reopened? Was it given a (INAUDIBLE) certificate and what is the government doing to investigate? All of these questions.
 
It took just 20 cents for these people to get onto that bridge, but it has cost them their lives, or the lives of their dear ones, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  Yes. Hopefully, we will have some answers to those valid questions you raised their. Vedika Sud, many thanks for that live report.
 
Halloween celebrations in China interrupted for many on Monday when Shanghai's Disneyland Resort was suddenly closed. Crowds were stuck inside of the theme park until they tested negative for the coronavirus. The resort says it suspended operations to comply with COVID prevention measures. Shanghai officials say anyone who visited the park since the Thursday must complete a series of COVID tests. It's the fourth time since the start of the pandemic the park has shut its gates.
 
And just ahead here on CNN, Iran says it will hold public trials for some people charged with taking part in antigovernment protests. We will have details in a live report. That is next.

CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. Iran says it's indicted about 1,000 people in Tehran for their alleged roles in the countries nationwide anti-government protest, this according to state media. Their trials will reportedly be held in public later this week. It's part of a massive effort by authorities to end the weeks-long protests demanding basic women rights and an end to government brutality.
 
CNN's Anna Coren is tracking developments. She joins me now from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Anna. So, what more are you learning about these public trials linked to anti-government protests across the country?
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Rosemary, it seems like a desperate attempt by the regime to try to stamp out this protest movement, which, as we know, is now in its seventh week. I guess the concern is, what sort of sentences will be handed out to these protesters? More than 1,000 according to the chief justice of the judiciary will be publicly tried this week. He said that these trials will be for people who "have carried out acts of sabotage in recent events, including assaulting or marching (ph) security guards, setting fire to public property.
 
Now, these protests, as we know, were sparked by the death of 22-year- old Mahsa Amini back in mid-September after she was arrested by the Morality Police for wearing an improper hijab. As a result, you know, people week after week, you know, very much a student-led, very much female-led have taken to the streets.
 
And we saw those violent clashes over the weekend when there were protests staged at university campuses right around the country. Police firing tear gas. There were reports of live bullets as well, Rosemary. We know that according to human rights groups and activist, more than 200 people have been killed over the past seven weeks, thousands have been arrested, and that is a very conservative number.
 
Now, we have also heard from a mother of a 22-year-old protester who says that her son has been sentenced to death. She is pleading that he be saved, Rosemary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MASOUHMEH AHMADI, MOTHER OF MAN GIVEN DEATH SENTENCE (through translator):  They are treating my child unfairly. They have interrogated him without an attorney present. And in that very first session of the court, they have sentenced him to death. Is this Islamic justice? In what court do they issue an execution sentence in the first session? And they want to execute the sentence equally quickly. Please, please, help and support us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  The head of the Revolutionary Guard said that Saturday were last protests. The protesters are still, Rosemary, taking to the streets despite this crackdown.
 
CHURCH:  Incredibly brave and defiant. Anna Coren, many thanks for bringing us up to date on that.
 
And thank you so much for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church. World Sport is up next. And I will be back in 15 minutes with more "CNN Newsroom." Do stay with us.

COATES:  Tonight is, what, the day before early decision for many students across this country, and it's not going to impact those students, but the idea of college admissions top of mind, year in and year out, in perpetuity.
 
CAMEROTA:  Oh, we know it well at my house. We are in the throes of it right now. There's no one getting any sleep at my house. But I love it -- I mean, I really appreciated who you spelled it out, Laura, because it was suppose to level the playing field and there was a hope that it would level the playing field in 20 or 25 years, but that seems to have been a very optimistic hope.
 
COATES:  Yes.
 
CAMEROTA:  But it's complicated and I really appreciated how your panel discussed it. All right. Meanwhile, ever wonder how much your co-worker's make? Well, New York City is about let you know. We'll tell you what's changing, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:50:00]
 
CAMEROTA:  So, Laura, you and I have talked before about this very delicate topic, how much the people around us are paid. And, of course, it's a hot question in a lot of workplaces. Should you know your co-workers' salaries?
 
COATES:  Well, now, you know, now, New York City, as you know, as upping the ante because starting tomorrow, most employers in New York are required by law to give salary ranges to people that are applying for jobs. And I know that you think the transparency is key. You've got to be able to have it. I think it bodes well for the people. But I wonder if it causes more tension in the workplace than anything else.
 
CAMEROTA:  Both. It is super helpful if you're negotiating your salary or asking for a raise and it also can really piss people off.
 
COATES:  Yes. I think the latter is probably infinitely true.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes. So, it's both.
 
COATES:  But everyone out there -- yes. It's probably both. But you know what, let's -- while we plug that for a moment, put a little pin in it, we're not going to skip Halloween, are we? Because we're not. It's nights Halloween and we're going to tell you which states report the most hauntings after this. It might coincide with who reports their salaries. We'll talk about it.
 
CAMEROTA:  Maybe. We'll find the time. Yes.
 
COATES:  There we go.
 
CAMEROTA:  Fantastic.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
COATES:  Happy Halloween, everyone. You got a few hours left and Americans are putting on their costumes and leaving out candy, and getting into the Halloween spirit. And while we are here, sadly not in costume, I will add, Alisyn, we -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  I mean, we're dressed as anchors. Go ahead.
 
COATES:  I mean, we should -- yes. We are dressed as people on TV. It's wonderful. He wanted to -- we got to tell you about which states are reporting, get this, the most hauntings.
 
CAMEROTA:  Right. So, there are haunted states. And thanks to our friends at Axios and The Shadowlands website, we know the most haunted states. It turns out Wyoming is number one. The most haunted state. Meaning, it has the most "unexplained noises and screams." OK? Who's doing all the screaming in Wyoming? Vermont is number two, and South Dakota is number three.
 
COATES:  You know, that shocks me because you think about -- maybe open spaces, there's an echo chamber happening? I don't know. But also, where I'm from, by the way, is Minnesota, and we ranked number 36. So -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  Here's something curious --
 
COATES:  -- not bragging. CAMEROTA:  -- New York, where I'm from, we're far down on the haunted list. We're at number 43, which is weird because I hear a lot of unexplained screams around here.
 
COATES:  I do too, coming from our building, coming from other places.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes.
 
COATES:  Actually in D.C., I think we might hear a lot more screams for whatever reason any days. And they'll be explained. We'll explain why these -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes. So, that's different.
 
COATES:  One way or the other.
 
CAMEROTA:  That's a little different.
 
COATES:  One way.
 
CAMEROTA:  OK. Tell us what you think, have you ever witnessed a haunting? What's the spookiest place you've ever been? You can tweet us @AlisynCamerota or @thelauracoates and we'll tell you what everyone is saying later in the program.
