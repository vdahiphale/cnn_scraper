(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNNI HOST: This hour a surprise caught in oil production by OPEC Plus members I'm going to speak to leading energy analysts from this 
 
 region about why and the impacts?
 
First up though, Former President Donald Trump is expected to arrive in New York in the next few hours. Tomorrow he will be arraigned in Manhattan for 
 
 criminal charges. Russia has arrested a suspect in connection to the explosion in St. Petersburg over the weekend blasts killed a well-known pro 
 
 Kremlin military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky.
 
Two women in Iran have been arrested for not wearing the hijab, after a man threw yogurts at them, hitting them in the head. And Israel's cabinet has 
 
 approved the formation of a National Guard to be led by far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir that follows another weekend of massive 
 
 protests.
 
All right! Welcome to the second hour of "Connect the World" wherever you are watching, you are more than welcome. In about an hour's time we are 
 
 expecting the Former President of the United States to travel to New York City, where he has been charged with a crime.
 
This is historic never before has the U.S. President been indicted on criminal charges. These are live pictures of the Trump branded plane that 
 
 he will make the journey on. Well, after arriving is scheduled to travel to his New York building Trump Tower. Tomorrow Tuesday he is set to go before 
 
 a judge to be formally charged. And those charges are tied to alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.
 
Well, outside the courtroom security is extremely tight the Secret Service the New York police and court officers all coordinating security 
 
 arrangements. So at some point today, the judge hearing that case should rule on request from media outlets including CNN to allow cameras in the 
 
 courtroom and to unseal the indictment.
 
Meanwhile, a new CNN poll shows that 60 percent of Americans questioned approve of the decision to indict Donald Trump. CNN's Katelyn Polantz 
 
 standing by! What can you tell us at this point?
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Becky, there's two things we're watching here. The first is how Donald Trump 
 
 response as a political figure, someone who's campaigning to be reelected to the presidency in 2024.
 
We know that we're watching his plane. He's going to be taking off at some point today to get into New York City and have that big day in court 
 
 tomorrow. And then he is planning on making a speech after he returns back to Florida after his court appearance.
 
But then on the legal side, there's much to be awaited there. We do not know exactly what charges Donald Trump faces at this time? We know they are 
 
 numerous 30 or more that they're very, extremely likely to include felony charges, serious counts, in that case.
 
And we are also waiting to see when we will learn if those charges could the judge unsealed them today and allow a little bit of lead time into that 
 
 or will they be read to Donald Trump formally when he's before the judge for the first time, ready to plead not guilty?
 
So a lot were waiting for there over the weekend. Donald Trump's lawyers were out there trying to set the table on how they're going to fight this 
 
 case. They indicated they want to challenge the law. They want to entertain they want to challenge the timing of what may be charged here.
 
We believe this is about 2016 hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and business falsification possibly records that were falsified to cover up 
 
 those hush money payments with the Trump Organization that all dates back to 2016 a long time ago.
 
We know that Trump lawyers are looking to maybe get it thrown out. Because of how long ago that was. We also know that there are questions about the 
 
 judge because at the end of the day, what happens here how this case progresses to trial, much will be in the hands of the judge.
 
We know Trump has already criticized the judge publicly saying he hates him, or that the judge hates him. But his lawyer yesterday on CNN was 
 
 saying that he has no reason to believe that this judge has any bias tomorrow that's going to be a crucial thing to look for.
 
Are these statements Donald Trump is making about the judge do those come into play and how a timeline is set? And what does the judge ultimately do 
 
 in setting a timetable for when this case could be going to trial does it happen before the election next year or after Becky?
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you on board. Details to be relieved of course, we are keeping one eye on what is going on in Florida. Mr. Trump expected to 
 
 leave on his jet for Manhattan in the next hour.
 
Right, let's get to the major shakeup in global energy markets now. OPEC Plus members will implement a voluntary reduction in crude oil output 
 
 slashing production by more than 1 million barrels a day. Well, oil prices jumped over 8 percent initially on Monday on that news.
 
They are up now around or can we see here, round five and three quarter percent. The move led by Saudi Arabia which maintains that the decision is 
 
 to support market stability. But the International Energy Agency is expecting a surge in demand later this year leading to fears that this will 
 
 add inflationary pressures to an already sluggish global economy.
 
So tonight we ask is this decision short sighted. Well, joining us now to break all of this down for us is the CEO of Qamar Energy Robin Mills. 
 
 Before I get to that question, let's start with why you believe this decision was made now and by those who jumped on board? These were 
 
 voluntary decisions after all?
 
ROBIN MILLS, CEO, QAMAR ENERGY: Yes, absolutely. Look, I think one thing that's interesting about this decision, as you say, you know, the 
 
 International Energy Agency sees a surge in demand later in the year. But so does OPEC itself. You know, it's in its official numbers. And yet 
 
 they've decided to cut production--
 
ANDERSON: Which doesn't make sense on the surface?
 
MILLS: It is puzzling, OK. We had a bit of weakness the past month and in prices, banking worries and so on. Fingers crossed, we seem to be through 
 
 that now. The outlook for demand is reasonably good. We see quite strong demand in products, U.S. inventories are down.
 
Chinese economy seems to be picking up and Chinese demand picking up. So it's not obvious that there was a cut needed right now. You know, and as 
 
 late as Friday, we were hearing that now it'll be there'll be no change.
 
And then, of course, suddenly on Sunday, just before the OPEC meeting, the official meeting, the announcement comes out of this cut, and the various 
 
 members are coming out with volunteers, so called voluntary cuts, right? So they're each, each putting forward their own figures one by one.
 
ANDERSON: So I guess that is the question again - we can talk about whether you believe this is short sighted on the part of those OPEC members who 
 
 have decided to cut and the biggest cuts, of course coming from Saudi Arabia, Russia, to a certain extent already priced in 144,000 barrels, for 
 
 example, from the UAE, where we are. But again, if it's not about macroeconomic, sort of, you know, macroeconomic story, then why?
 
MILLS: Well look, because there's a couple of possible elements fit into that. I think one is that these countries and their national oil companies 
 
 have seen weaker demand coming this. They're in the physical market. And they're seeing that the next couple of months, their customers are not too 
 
 optimistic, not demanding too much.
 
And that's led them to change their mind at rather late date. That's one I think the other side is, you know, why is this such a surprise, like out of 
 
 the 14 analysts who were quoted on the newsletter, none of them are expecting a cut, right?
 
So I think that tells me also, there's some element here of let's that's as Prince Abdulaziz the Saudi Energy Minister often says he doesn't make the 
 
 speculators out let's spring this on them at the last minute.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, that's fascinating. You bring that up, there has been taught that you know this is a slight knock by the Saudis to Washington and to the 
 
 Biden Administration, who had promised to replenish the reserves that have been drawn down on of course last year.
 
And that, you know, the speculation goes that there was a promise made, but that actually hasn't happened, and they haven't taken oil out of the 
 
 market. And this is a kind of, you know, this is a sort of retort to that. What do you make of that?
 
MILLS: I think it was a missed opportunity. There was some price weakness, there was definitely was a chance to jump in there and refill the Strategic 
 
 Petroleum Reserve a bit. They couldn't have done much in a month, but they could have done something. There was a missed opportunity, yes. But it was 
 
 really the big issue that changed this decision. I don't think so.
 
ANDERSON: So when we ask, is this short sighted on the part of the Saudis, and the others who have made this decision, you say what?
 
MILLS: I think, look, it's a bit of a risky decision, because, you know, the economy seems maybe we're through the worst for now. Inflation has been 
 
 falling. You know, we thought we're at the end of - we're getting close to the end of the rate rising cycle.
 
Now if there's more pressure on inflation, there'll be more need for rate rises and slower economy down the line, less demand. I mean, there's always 
 
 that the balance of how high do you do you risk going with prices before it hits the general economy?
 
ANDERSON: Of course, that's the kind of, you know, the Rubik's Cube sort of spinning around, isn't it because we are looking at what now seems to be a 
 
 floor in the oil market that at least the Gulf producers are looking for at around 80 to $85 from the barrel if that's what they want to see that's 
 
 their choice, right?
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
Yes, I mean, ultimately, the markets will work that way if they weren't the supply and demand equation accordingly. Does that sound like a figure that 
 
 is reasonable, given what we know about what's going on with vision 2030 in Saudi, and what we understand to be a sort of a reasonable oil price for 
 
 these great oil producing countries?
 
MILLS: Well, you know, these price floors, that they're pretty elastic. I mean, they're more like trampolines, right? And as when things get better, 
 
 and the prices are higher people's flip floors go up, right, but $80 a barrel for now sounds reasonable.
 
And you know that's not that high in historic terms, particularly when you allow for inflation. It's a bit above the historic average, but not much. 
 
 It's not something that you would sell is $140 a barrel it's going to crash the economy.
 
ANDERSON: $100 on the barrel is what everybody's saying, now, where are we headed? Is that where we're headed? Well, we know we've already blown 
 
 through that in the recent past. Are we headed back that way?
 
MILLS: I think there's a very good chance that your third quarter will be at $100 or more. We were kind of looking that way anyway, to be honest. And 
 
 I think this cut adds to that.
 
ANDERSON: Americans have criticized this response. And let me just stick up what the U.S. response has been. We don't think cuts are advisable at this 
 
 moment, given market uncertainty. And we've made that clear. We're focused on prices for American consumers, not barrels.
 
Clearly OPEC Plus operating completely independently of U.S. concerns right now. And that is certainly a less aggressive position from a U.S. 
 
 administration that was absolutely catatonic back in October, when the OPEC Plus cartel originally cut production by 2 million barrels a day at a point 
 
 at which gas prices at the pump were really worrying U.S. investors and really worrying the Democrats around the midterms.
 
Now, at the time, the Saudis said this has got nothing to do with politics, read our lips. This is not a political decision. Frankly, there is politics 
 
 going on when these decisions are made, isn't it?
 
MILLS: I think it's a pretty mild U.S. response to the mildest response you could have gotten. Yes, OK, fine. There's no immediate political trouble on 
 
 the calendar. So yes, I think it was unexpected, but not catastrophic from the U.S. point of view, or the administration's point of view.
 
However, you know, what I do think this is not a politically motivated move in itself. But what it does show is that Saudi Arabia in particular, isn't 
 
 too worried about the U.S. response in general. And this is not just in the oil market, but in various other actions the past few weeks.
 
ANDERSON: I'm not worried at this point about market share. That's the sort of done deal, is it?
 
MILLS: I don't know, where's the competition for them in production coming from? It's not from Russia, in which is in the OPEC Plus group anyway. The 
 
 U.S. shale has really slowed down doesn't seem that they're too worried about that. You've got little bits and pieces from Brazil and places like 
 
 that, but not something that seriously challenges the OPEC Plus group,
 
ANDERSON: It's always good to have you, really important to get your insight and analysis as a big story for the world big story that's coming 
 
 out of this region of course and this is all about how we sort of connect the dots between what's going on here and the rest of the world? Thank you 
 
 very much indeed, for joining us.
 
Let's, before you go get reaction to this from Washington, as we've been saying the U.S. has called output cuts, and I quote them here unadvisable. 
 
 Jeremy Diamond is at the White House with more.
 
I mean, unadvisable is a very much more sort of a weaker response, let's say or a less robust response and that which we got back in October, when 
 
 the talk was that the U.S. needed to completely sort of reorganize its relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They were furious at that 
 
 point with the production cuts. So what should we make of this response Jeremy?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right Becky. Back in October, even before that decision was made, you'll recall, I'm 
 
 sure that, you know, U.S. officials were lobbying members of OPEC to try and prevent them to try and sway them away from putting these that 2 
 
 million barrels per day production cut into place in October, those efforts failed.
 
And U.S. officials, including President Biden himself were apoplectic; you heard the President at the time vowed that there would be consequences for 
 
 Saudi Arabia as a result of that move. And U.S. officials said that they saw that production cut at the time as an effort to help Russia mitigate 
 
 some of the economic pain that it was dealing with as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.
 
Now, what we're seeing now, look, U.S. officials certainly are not pleased. It appears that they were like the markets were too caught off guard by 
 
 this surprise decision that didn't come at one of those regular OPEC meetings.
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
But what they said was we don't think that these cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty. Saudi Arabia for its part said that it was 
 
 simply working as a precautionary move to try and stabilize those markets.
 
Of course, they're also defending and trying to protect a floor here in terms of the price of a barrel of oil. The bottom line here is that, look, 
 
 there's not much that the White House can do to counter this move. But they're certainly not pleased because cutting oil production leads to 
 
 higher prices in crude oil, which we've already started to see in the market, which could lead to higher gas prices here in the United States.
 
And Becky, as you know, gas prices have been a substantial driver of inflation here in the United States. And at a time when it seems like 
 
 inflation may be cooling off, we're not quite at the end of the line. But we appear to be making progress towards that the potential for gas prices 
 
 to rise further, they already have risen about 10 cents per gallon over the last month. That certainly is concerning to officials here who see 
 
 combating inflation, really as a number one challenge for this administration.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you on board Jeremy thank you very much indeed! The time there is quarter past 11 in the morning time here in the UAE and Abu 
 
 Dhabi is quarter past seven. Within the hour Former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to leave Florida for New York.
 
This is a live look at his plane on the tarmac in West Palm Beach. The latest on the case against Trump and his historic court appearance is up 
 
 next. Plus, Russia makes an arrest in the blast that killed a pro military blogger in St. Petersburg who officials claimed she worked with to plan the 
 
 attack is up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Now let's get you back to Florida a live look at Former U.S. President Donald Trump's plane in West Palm Beach. He is expected to board 
 
 that in the next hour or so. He's going to fly to New York where he is facing criminal charges.
 
Now the Former President is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday but over the weekend he was spotted waving and giving supporters thumbs up. 
 
 This will be the first time in U.S. history that an Ex-President will be arraigned in court.
 
Sometime today the judge hearing the case is expected to decide if he'll allow cameras into the courtroom? Well, Donald Trump may be the first 
 
 American Former President charged in court but in other countries it's not an unusual occurrence.
 
My next guest writes prosecuting a former leader for wrongdoing isn't sand in the gears of democracy. It's a feature that keeps in check future 
 
 leaders and reassures a nation that no one person no matter his or her rank and influence is above the law nor immunized from accountability.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
Well, you'll find the rest of that article@cnn.com. Let's bring in the author right now on "Connect the World". Arick Wierson is a Media Advisor 
 
 for former New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg is now an opinion columnist for several outlets, including CNN, it's good to have you. Arick, just 
 
 expand on that, you don't see this indictment as a cause for concern then for the U.S. political system, explain.
 
ARICK WIERSON, FORMER MEDIA ADVISER FOR NEW YORK MAYOR BLOOMBERG: It's nice to be here, Becky. You know, I think that Americans tend to be very 
 
 parochial sometimes and how they view the world. Obviously, this is unprecedented in this country although historical fun fact, U.S. President 
 
 Ulysses Grant was arrested for speeding his buggy back in 1872. But other than that, we've really never jailed a U.S. president before, or prosecuted 
 
 or indicted one.
 
And I think this is going to be sort of really - quinine moment in U.S. history. But I think that the point I was trying to get across to readers 
 
 at CNN is the fact that although this is unprecedented in this country, worldwide, this is actually a fairly regular occurrence.
 
I think that AXIOS did a report that said that since 2000, over 75 countries around the world have indicted, charged, prosecuted even jailed 
 
 or imprisoned former heads of state prime ministers, presidents et cetera. So, this really isn't that remarkable when you look at it through the lens 
 
 of a worldwide scale.
 
ANDERSON: Never something to be proud of, I don't think but you suggest that that is a kind of, you know, Democracy at Work in the peace you make 
 
 the comparison to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces legal problems of his own. Mr. Netanyahu charged with fraud and breach of trust 
 
 in 2019.
 
He is now back in charge in Israel at the helm and facing a crisis over his judicial overhaul plans that people fear will dismantle that democracy. So, 
 
 I guess, I guess the question is does this indictment actually point to broader risks in the U.S. system?
 
WIERSON: I don't think so. You know, I think that the U.S. has come pretty close on several occasions and obviously, probably the best example that 
 
 would be Watergate. Whereas I think that the thinking and the prevailing thinking back then, when President Ford took over, pardoned Nixon. I think 
 
 the idea was to not to further divide the country and just move on.
 
I think, but the sort of the indirect or maybe unintentional consequence of doing that is it sort of created this mythos around the idea that, you 
 
 know, because the U.S. president is the leader of the free world, so to speak, that we need to be kind of above and beyond this type of action. But 
 
 I think that, you know, like so many other occasions, Donald Trump threw norms and traditions out the window.
 
And so, I kind of see this as a deviation. I think that what you know, the fact that, you know, we're headed down this road doesn't necessarily mean 
 
 that the U.S. system is more fragile than it was in the past, or it will be going forward.
 
I do think, though, however, this will probably set in motion a set of circumstances in which this type of activity becomes much more common in 
 
 the future going forward. So, it's something that future politicians, people that are eyeing the presidency will always have to keep in the back 
 
 of their mind.
 
ANDERSON: The former president's team tells CNN, they raised over $5 million since Trump was indicted on Thursday. I wonder what you make of all 
 
 of this excitement sort of around this, and whether that is actually playing into the hands of Donald Trump.
 
WIERSON: Well, look, Donald Trump's never been a guy that gives up a great opportunity to make a fast buck. So, I'm not at all surprised that they're 
 
 fundraising off of this. There's certainly in this country, there's 25 percent or so of the U.S. population, that what I would call is Trump's 
 
 hard base that Trump could never do anything wrong, no matter what.
 
And they're taking advantage of this. And Trump is ultimately the ultimate entertainer. You know, he was a celebrity, you know, a reality celebrity 
 
 before he became president. That's how most of America got to know and people like me, who worked in New York for many years knew him, as you 
 
 know, for what he was.
 
And I think that's part of the reason that a lot of New Yorkers are not at all surprised by what's happening to him. But I do think that, you know, he 
 
 is really taken advantage of this for maximizing political gain, because I think that, you know, it still remains to be seen, you know, by the merits 
 
 of the case, what's going to happen when he gets in front of a jury of his peers.
 
But I do think, though, in the court of public opinion, Trump is using this, you know, for political, political fundraising and sort of pushing 
 
 aside his potential competitors in the Republican field.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, we don't even have the details of indictment, of course, at this point, we will though tomorrow. It's good to have you, Sir, we'll have 
 
 you back. Thank you, Arick.
 
WIERSON: Thank you, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: And more from this @cnn.com of course. Well, Russia has made an arrest in connection with the deadly explosion of St. Petersburg cafe. 
 
 Officials say, 26-year-old anti-war activist Darya Trepova was behind that blast which killed prominent military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky and injured 
 
 at least 32 others.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
Authorities claimed that she worked with Ukrainian agents and associates of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Her husband says she was set 
 
 up. CNN's Matthew Chance has more from Moscow.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Russian authorities are calling it terrorism and accusing Ukraine of organizing the 
 
 explosion that killed one of Russia's most prominent pro war military bloggers at the weekend.
 
At least one arrest has been made at a woman named as Darya Trepova who was alleged to have handed the blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, a small statue at a 
 
 speaking event in St. Petersburg. Eyewitnesses say the explosion took place soon afterwards.
 
The implication being that a bomb was hidden inside the figurine, extraordinary. The Kremlin has called it terrorism, Russia's anti-terrorism 
 
 committee saying Ukrainian special services planned it using agents get this from Navalny's anti-corruption campaign. Alexei Navalny, the poison 
 
 jailed critic of the Kremlin.
 
Drop of other women with the statue they say was an "active supporter". Well, both Ukraine and the Navalny organization have denied involvement, so 
 
 both casting the killing as an internal Russian dispute. But of course, Tatarsky is now the second hard line pro-activist to be targeted and killed 
 
 in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine last year.
 
In August Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist was killed in a car bomb outside Moscow. Russian officials back then accusing 
 
 Ukrainian saboteurs of that attack as well, Ukraine insists it had nothing to do with that either. Matthew Chance, CNN Moscow.
 
ANDERSON: Ukrainian officials are rejecting claims by the head of the Wagner group who says Russian forces are now legally holding the city of 
 
 Bakhmut. In this video over the weekend, Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that Bakhmut have been taken, well there's no evidence a group has 
 
 taken over the city.
 
Ukrainian military spokesman says the video is and I quote him here "incomprehensible". Well, elsewhere on the front lines in eastern Ukraine, 
 
 one pastor is helping residents keep up their hope Ben Wedeman with this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Donning his flak jacket Pastor Igor Yershov at the Protestant Bethlehem Christian 
 
 Church prepares for his rounds. Today he's conducting services in the village of - just a few miles from Russian lines.
 
Church is a hurried affair, just 45 minutes of no frill sermon and prayer to terry is dangerous. A Russian artillery shell recently landed next door 
 
 spraying shrapnel on the walls, destroying the roof, shattering the windows. Yet when the faithful emerge, there is momentarily a sense of 
 
 serenity.
 
It calms your soul, says Natalia, we feel that we're with God and that he protects us. But for the handful of residents - is ghost town. The few 
 
 still here depend upon the kindness of others for their sustenance, including bread brought by Pastor Igor, one loaf per person.
 
WEDEMAN (on camera): Once a week, every Sunday, this is the only time these people can get fresh bread, fresh bread. It's still warm.
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): But man cannot live on bread alone. Today says Pastor Igor; hope is the most precious thing for people here on the front lines. 
 
 Afterwards, we went with the pastor to a nearby bomb shelter and abandoned tuberculosis sanatorium. At the shelter entrance, Alexey shows us where 
 
 parts of the rocket struck a month ago.
 
That day he recalls when rain began to fall and others went below, then the rocket hit. If it had been five minutes earlier he says no one would have 
 
 survived. Down below they have electricity, even satellite television.
 
Anna distracts herself by cooking. She never leaves the shelter. It's horrible, she tells me, three times shells exploded next to me once when I 
 
 was at home when exploded nearby, I was alone. Everything was smashed. Now I can't go outside even for five minutes. Here there is shelter, but no 
 
 peace of mind Ben Wedeman, CNN, Ukraine.

ANDERSON: Well, just ahead, why some Iranian women say they can - the way that the government is treating the victims of an attack on.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson. These are your headlines this hour and a live look at the former 
 
 U.S. President Donald Trump's plane in West Palm Beach in Florida.
 
Now, he is expected to board that plane in the next half hour or so and fly to New York where he is facing criminal charges related to alleged hush 
 
 money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.
 
Trump is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday. Oil prices surging after OPEC members said they would cut production in a surprise move led by Saudi 
 
 Arabia the group announced what Riyadh calls a voluntary reduction in crude output starting next month. And let's say that could mean inflation remains 
 
 higher for longer.
 
Finland's left wing Prime Minister Sanna Marin has conceded defeat in Sunday's parliamentary election. She had one global notoriety for being a 
 
 role model for a new generation of female leaders, face criticism at home over public spending and leaked videos showing her partying. And the leader 
 
 of the party that won the most seats say he will work to form a ruling coalition and become the next prime minister.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PETTERI ORPO, FINNISH NATIONAL COALITION PARTY LEADER: This was great victory for - I think that Finnish people won't change. They won't change 
 
 and now I will start negotiations, open negotiations with all parties. I want to build trust and co-operation between parties and build up the 
 
 strong minority government.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Iranian officials are reportedly telling universities to ban women not wearing a hijab and to clamp down on dissent. This comes 
 
 after an attack on two women that has gone viral. This CCTV video shows the moment when a man enters a shop in the north-eastern city of Shandiz and 
 
 proceeds to dump yogurt on these women's heads.
 
Iranian media report the two women have been arrested for not covering their hair. The man has also been detained. Let's bring in CNN's Nada 
 
 Bashir who was live from London for you that video sadly, not on all the events in that video, as I understand it, sadly, not an isolated event.
 
We've seen the protest movement of course now for months and those protests continue. Just talk to us about the sort of the litany of events that we 
 
 have seen which quite frankly has been disturbing.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Absolutely, Becky. I mean, from the beginning and the outset of these protests, we have seen women bravely removing their 
 
 mandatory hijabs in solidarity with this protest movement, which was sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in September. Women's rights at the 
 
 forefront of this movement, which has grown to become an anti-regime protest movement.
 
But women's rights certainly still at the very center of these protests. But as these demonstrations across the country have somewhat slowed down in 
 
 recent weeks in comparison to what we saw at the end of last year, we are still seeing women bravely defined the strict regulations.
 
And dress code rules put in place by the government, not only removing their hijabs in a show of protests, but now many simply choosing not to 
 
 cover their hair in public spaces going about their day-to-day activities, go to shopping malls to universities to train stations, without wearing the 
 
 hijab.
 
But of course, as we've seen with those protests, there has been a brutal crackdown by Iran's morality police and Iran's security forces. But also, 
 
 there has been a response from other locals who have taken the side of the regime of the government.
 
As you saw there in that video, that confrontation between the man throwing yogurts at two women who chose to enter the store with their hair 
 
 uncovered. But of course, you also see the shopkeeper there appearing to push the male suspect in question out of the store and off camera.
 
Now, of course, as you laid out that the two women have now been arrested for their decision to contravene Iranian law. And that is the key here 
 
 according to the Iranian authorities. We heard over the weekend, which Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi saying, regardless of one's beliefs when it 
 
 comes to wearing the hijab, this is a matter of Iranian law, take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT: But the important matter is that today we have a legal mandate, the legal mandate makes it mandatory for everyone to 
 
 follow the law.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: Now, of course, this is mandated in Iran for all women and those who choose to contravene that law often face harsh penalties by the Iranian 
 
 security forces. And indeed, the morality police under whose custody Mahsa Amini died in September. We have seen that heavy handed tactic being used 
 
 across the country by the Iranian authorities.
 
And despite that, we are still almost every day seeing women taking to the streets going about their lives in a show of solidarity with the movement 
 
 and in protest of the strict regulations without the hijab, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Nada, thank you. Nada Bashir is out of London for you. While Iran blaming Israel for the killing of a second Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
 
 officer, he died of his wounds after Friday's alleged Israeli airstrikes in Syria and the Iranian government vowing to respond to what he calls state 
 
 terrorism.
 
This airstrike near Damascus also killed another IRGC officer. Iranian influence of course has grown in Syria since its civil war broke out more 
 
 than a decade ago. Palestinian authorities say two Palestinians were killed during an operation by Israeli military forces in the occupied West Bank.
 
Israel's defense forces confirmed they did conduct an operation in Nablus, they say they exchanged fire with armed gunman who allegedly fired at them. 
 
 Palestinian militant group Lion's Den claims, two killed were their members. And in Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has 
 
 agreed to create National Guard as part of a deal with the country's far right security minister.
 
Critics fear it will target Israeli Arabs and become an extremist militia. CNN's Hadas Gold is standing by in Jerusalem. And those critics were 
 
 extremely noisy about the concern for this sort of private armed militia being established. At this point, do we know who will run it?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: So, what we know so far is Ben Gvir has said publicly that this will not be a private militia. And the 
 
 government has undertaken a 90 day consultation period on exactly how this National Guard will work out and who it will be under. So, if it ends up 
 
 being another unit of the Israeli police, it will probably get less criticism.
 
Then it becomes something that responds directly or reports directly to the Minister of National Security who himself has been convicted of crimes. And 
 
 so, I think right now everyone is just waiting to see what this consultation will result in and where and how this National Guard will be 
 
 reported you because that will really control what kind of work it will be able to do.

GOLD (voice over): Yiftach Golov may look like one of the hundreds of thousands of Israeli protesters, but a Special Forces veteran from the 
 
 Second Intifada injured on the front lines. He now helps lead a group of Israeli veterans. Brothers and Sisters in Arms who've become a backbone of 
 
 the protest movement against the Israeli government's plan judicial overhaul.
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
YIFTACH GOLOV, BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN ARMS: We are again in the front-line defending Israel, but not from external forces from within from here from 
 
 Tel Aviv to defend our own democracy. We're fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story. That's the values that that are 
 
 being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag.
 
GOLD (voice over): Golov says he had never been particularly political, but he translated his experience from the battlefield to a new arena.
 
GOLD (on camera): Give us your experience in organizing and running missions as helped you organize and run this.
 
GOLOV: 100 percent, yes.
 
GOLD (on camera): How's that?
 
GOLOV: First of all, the motivation, the very deep feel that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that you allow sacrificing anything that 
 
 is needed.
 
GOLD (voice over): Israel's protest movement is made up of many disparate groups. But the pressure from Israel's much volunteer veterans has been 
 
 seen as a key to moving the needle. Thousands of - have threatened not to keep the culture serve if the reform process.
 
GOLD (on camera): Even though last week, Israeli government and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that they were going to pass 
 
 legislation, these protests essentially, they don't believe that this pause is a real pause. What will satisfy you, when will you stop marching?
 
GOLOV: Only we as the Brothers and Sisters in Arms, we will start doing the activation only when we will know 100 percent that we can assure, that 
 
 Israel state will stay a functional democratic country and the story, whatever needs to be done for that.
 
GOLD (on camera): Would you be willing to take up arms, real arms for this fight?
 
GOLOV: So, I don't really want to imagine that situation that I need to hold, to carry any arm nothing. I don't believe that will go to the 
 
 situation.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLD: Now these veterans and military reservists say that they will continue in these protests despite this pause. And meanwhile Defense 
 
 Minister Yoav Gallant who was technically dismissed by Benjamin Netanyahu last week that helped sparks that massive general strike and those 
 
 protests. He actually has not been fired.
 
We are hearing now from sources close to the Prime Minister that due to the security situation a decision on the dismissal of the Defense Minister will 
 
 be taken at a later date. And as we speak, the Defence Minister and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sitting side by side on an event for Israeli 
 
 soldiers, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Hadas, thank you. Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem for you. Well, French politician's new magazine cover is getting a lot of attention.

ANDERSON: Throughout this week "Call to Earth" is turning a spotlight on our oceans. And today we are headed to a majestic place in the heart of 
 
 British Columbia's Central Coast as part of our Rolex perpetual planet initiative.
 
Guest Editor and Conservation Photographer, Cristina Mittermeier introduces us to a First Nation community that has declared its own marine protected 
 
 area. They are residents of the Great Bear Rainforest, trying to put a stop to overfishing and to preserve the fish stock that is so vital to their 
 
 livelihoods, have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DOUGLAS NEASLOSS, CHIEF COUNCILLOR, KITASOO/XAI, XAI'S FIRST NATION: The Great Bear Rainforest is extremely special. I mean, I think it's probably 
 
 one of the most bio diverse places on the planet. You still get wild things like bears on the walls and abundance of salmon and a bunch of different 
 
 sea life, you still have old growth forests.
 
And these areas in a large way are untouched by industry. And so, we want to keep it like that. My name is Muqvas Glaw, which my language means a 
 
 white bear. My other name is Douglas Neasloss.
 
CRISTINA MITTERMEIER, CONSERVATION PHOTOGRAPHER: Douglas Neasloss is one of those extraordinary leaders. He's been advocating for conservation for the 
 
 sovereign management of the coastal waters of his nation, which is the Kitasoo Xaixais nation.
 
So, they have created the Kitasu Bay MPA. And it's amazing because that is their breadbasket. And he's done an incredible job of not just leading his 
 
 people, but bringing the rest of Canada to his point of view.
 
NEASLOSS: So right now, we're just getting ready to enter Kitasu Bay, and that's the area is probably the most important area, it's a holding area 
 
 for hearings. So that's where they all gather. I think indigenous knowledge is super important.
 
And I think it needs to be integrated. And all of the management that's out there, whether it's wildlife management, fisheries management, ocean 
 
 management, we have a belief that if you take care of the land, the land will take care of you. And so that's ingrained in all of our work here.
 
It doesn't matter if it's in stewardship, if it's in tourism, if it's an economic development; we want to make sure that we have a place that the 
 
 world can enjoy. And if we don't have protection, we know that we're going to be in trouble.
 
Kitasu Bay was declared by the - chiefs as supported by the community, and it was launched. So, the rest of the world knows about it. We've engaged 
 
 provincial governments, federal governments; we've engaged stakeholders, letting everyone know that it's closed.
 
We've left the document open to collaborate, we're in this era of reconciliation, and how do we work together, there's laws and practices 
 
 that we practice for thousands of years. And those practices are geared toward conservation and sustainability and stewardship. And so, I think 
 
 when we are writing our management plan, like the Kitasu Bay manager plan, that is our opportunity to indigenize some of these policies.
 
This island is called - Island, this is probably one of the most important seasonal harvesting areas we have. And so, herring eggs is super important 
 
 for the community, it's one of the first foods you would have access to after a long winter. What happens is when the herring come in and lay all 
 
 their eggs, people harvest the eggs and they would prepare them here, right here on the island.
 
MITTERMEIER: There are about 400 million indigenous people on this planet; they belong to about 5000 different tribes. And they're the largest 
 
 minority in the world. Together, they live in less than 20 percent of the land surface of planet Earth, but they manage 80 percent of the 
 
 biodiversity. So, should we be letting them make more decisions about how their territories are managed absolutely?
 
NEASLOSS: I think just by designating Kitasu Bay in a digitally protected area, and enforcing that making sure that the conservation is there, 
 
 sustainability is there, that stocks have a chance to rebuild. And that our people will continue to have access to that, that base sustains this 
 
 community for thousands of years. So, it's really important that that base survives.
 
But I also hope that this provides a model for all these other protected areas all over the world. I think Kitasu Bay is a very strong example of 
 
 what we can do.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: And do watch the special half hour program "Call to Earth" protectors of the sea airing Saturday and Sunday here on CNN. Listen, I'll

ANDERSON: A French government Junior Minister being criticized for her appearance on a magazine cover. Marlene Schiappa posed for French Playboy 
 
 to accompany the 12-page interview; she gave about women's rights and LGBT rights. Schiappa is the Secretary of State for the social economy and 
 
 French associations.
 
But members of her own party have similar appearance isn't appropriate, especially as France is in the middle of protests over pension reforms. 
 
 Well, joining me now, with more on this controversy is our Paris Correspondent Melissa Bell. Controversy, I guess it is controversy because 
 
 there are those who were those who are complaining about it. Why so much backlash, Melissa?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think originally there is the surprise that this is generated amongst many people here in France, 
 
 it's not due to be published until Thursday. But the fact that a woman is so closely associated with the feminist because women's issues should 
 
 choose to appear on the cover of a magazine that may have changed over the course of the last few years.
 
And that is the defense being provided today by the editor of the French version of Playboy that it is no longer the soft porn magazine we think of. 
 
 But it's hardly been associated with the promotion of women's rights over the course of the decades, Becky. And I think beyond the question of her 
 
 decision, and whether or not she should have made that choice on moral grounds to have appeared on the front cover of that magazine.
 
It is much more to do with the timing of this decision. Coming as it does, as you say, in the middle of those protest that have so shaken France, 
 
 they're set to continue this week, Becky, on Thursday, we're going to have another massive day of strikes and protests.
 
I think it is that it is in that context, the decision she should have made to appear on the cover of a glossy magazine that many think is out of step 
 
 and badly times she's been criticized, we hear from sources close to the prime minister's office by the prime minister herself and a phone call, 
 
 telling her that she thought it had been ill-advised.
 
She though has chosen to defend it, tweeting that the defense of women's bodies was something that needed to be done all the time and everywhere, 
 
 and also explaining that this was a decision of hers. Her defense also, Becky, is that this is an interview about an article that's been written 
 
 about women's rights and gay rights and that, therefore, this is about promoting those very ideas.
 
She says she's always stood by, but it is it is definitely the timing that is being considered ill-advice. Bear in mind also that here in France, 
 
 we're expecting some kind of reshuffle in the next few weeks as a result of what we've seen over the course of the last few weeks in terms of the 
 
 social unrest, and all the fallout there's been here over that pension reform bill.
 
And at a time like that the daggers tend to be out for members even of one's own party. And that's definitely a bit of what's been happening here, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, absolutely. All right, Melissa, good to have you back at the bureau in what an assuming to be a relatively peaceful Paris after the 
 
 events of the last couple of weeks. Thank you always a pleasure. Well, just moments ago, NASA unveiled the names of the astronauts who will get to fly 
 
 around the moon for the Artemis II mission. Onboard will be Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor Glover, along with Mission Specialist Jeremy Hansen 
 
 and Christina Koch.
 
Now, Artemis II will be NASA's first crewed mission to orbit the moon since the Apollo program more than five decades ago. And this could potentially 
 
 take the crew further into our solar system than any human has ever traveled. Well, if this all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off in 
 
 November of 2024 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA's administrator spoke about it all a little bit earlier today, have a listen.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR: We're going back to the moon but just the beginning, because we're going back to learn to live to create event in 
 
 order to go to Mars and then beyond. So, this is mankind, humankind's further quest to reach out and explore this vastness of the cosmos. And to 
 
 understand better who we are, where we are, what we are.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Hurray, during the plan 10-day trip, the crew will test out new technology untold and critical life support systems. In our parting shots 
 
 tonight, we witness life at depths never seen before. Over 8000 meters below the surface of the Northern Pacific Ocean, sea robots managed to 
 
 capture the deepest fish ever filmed on camera, a snail fish.
 
The exact depth you see here is about 8300 meters. But let me put that into context view. At that depth, the weight of the water per square inch is a 
 
 crushing 12,000 pounds. That's more than 2800 bricks stacked on top of each other, which makes the grid just coasting that low, all the more 
 
 impressive. That's it from us. If you've missed any of our interviews today, we'll be posting them on my social platforms @beckycnn.
