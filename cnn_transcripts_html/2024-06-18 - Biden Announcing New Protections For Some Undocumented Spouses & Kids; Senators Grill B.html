BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: President Biden's big move on immigration offering a pathway to citizenship for some of the undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens. A move that could be cheered by hundreds of thousands of families but a political gamble for his reelection campaign.
 
And lawmakers have questions and Boeing CEO is struggling a bit to come up with answers, Dave Calhoun is on Capitol Hill. But after a string of safety incidents and an alarming new whistleblower report. Is there anything he can say to persuade Americans that Boeing has a handle on its safety issues?
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: And just a brutal day from coast to coast, fires in the West and an unrelenting heat wave in the east. An ominous outlook with summer still two days away.
 
We are following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
SANCHEZ: We're following major developments from the White House this afternoon. President Biden set to unveil this sweeping new executive action that would immediately protect hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants from being deported. It provides legal protection for about half a million spouses of current U.S. citizens and roughly 50,000 children.
 
KEILAR: This is an action aimed to appeal to Hispanic voters in key battleground states. And it comes at a critical moment in the 2024 race. Next week, Biden and Trump will of course be facing off in a historic presidential debate right here on CNN where immigration will no doubt be one of the big topics.
 
Let's begin now with Rosa Flores in Texas.
 
Rosa, walk us through what this new executive action means.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brianna and Boris, what you see behind me is actually a watch party here in Houston hosted by an immigrant advocacy organization and some of the families that are benefiting are sitting in the room behind me. They're waiting for the President's remarks.
 
And we are here because we're here to talk to them as well. But let me show you what the big picture of this executive action actually is because this impacts what's called mixed status families. And all that means is that for example a parent could be a U.S. citizen and the other parent might be undocumented. And maybe some children are U.S. citizens and others are undocumented.
 
But as a whole this family unit is in fear of deportation and family separation. And that is exactly what this executive action by the President is going to do. It is going to protect these mixed status families from deportation and family separation. So how is this executive action going to do that?
 
Let me explain: Because the individuals who qualify under this executive action are the undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens and the undocumented children. Now before this executive action these families could indeed apply for green cards. However, in many cases these families had to separate. These families had to go to their home country while the process was in place, so it led to family separation and it also led to a lot of these families who qualified for this relief not to apply because they feared family separation and so they lived in the shadows.
 
What this executive action does is going to take a lot of those people out of the shadows. Why? Two things. They're going to be able to apply for a green card which means a legal pathway, which means they will not be deported. And also they will be able to do it from the United States which protects them from family separation.
 <br>[15:05:00]
 
Now these undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens would have had to be in the United States for at least 10 years and be married as of yesterday. So they can't wake up today, listen to this announcement, go get married and - for them to qualify. It doesn't work that way. They would have had to be married as of yesterday.
 
And according to the White House and DHS about 500,000 undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens would qualify in about 50,000 children. As I mentioned some of them are sitting behind me in this watch party. That is happening right now. They're waiting for the President to speak.
 
And I can tell you if I'm talking to the executive director of this organization, he says that he is - he's gotten calls with people sobbing, crying, very emotional because this is a life altering announcement for them. And I'll tell you and explain why.
 
Imagine being a child who your entire life you've been in fear that your parents are going to be deported, that one of your parents is going to be deported and that, you know, you're going to go to school and you're going to come back home and that your parent is not going to be at home. Those children that are sitting behind me will no longer have that fear because of this executive order.
 
That parents that couldn't drive their child to school because they were in fear that they could be caught by immigration on the way to school, that parent will be able to drive their child to school without fear. That is the actual effect in America once this executive action goes into effect. And there is some fear though, however, because as we know, a lot of these executive actions are also challenged in court. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CESAR ESPINOSA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FIEL: We know that it may be challenged in the courts by people like Gov. Abbott and other folks who are just very anti-immigrant for their own political gain. But we're hoping that at the end of the day justice will prevail.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLORES: Now, of course, this is an election year and I asked the executive director, Boris and Brianna, if he thought that this could lead to votes for President Biden. And he said, you know, some people might be swayed. But as we know Latinos don't vote just on immigration. They also care a lot of the things like the economy and so it just depends. But again the people behind me still waiting for the President's remarks. Back to you, guys.
 
KEILAR: All right. Rosa we'll be waiting for those as well. Thank you so much for that report. Let's talk more about this executive action now. We're joined by Chad Wolf. He is the former acting Homeland Security secretary from the Trump administration.
 
Thank you so much for spending part of your afternoon with us, sir. I know capping asylum. That was an executive action Biden took a couple of weeks ago. And then you have today these allowances to keep families of mixed immigration status together.
 
It's kind of evoking a little bit Ronald Reagan maybe some compassionate conservatism to me, but what do you think?
 
CHAD WOLF, FORMER ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP: Well, here's how I look at it. Look, the immigration issue has a lot of passion on it from both sides, but I just try to look at the facts here and try to look at an executive order intuitively tries to solve a problem. So I'm trying to understand what the problem is that the Biden administration is solving for.
 
They talk about two different things. They talk about keeping families together and then shielding this group of individuals from removal or deportation. The - I'll take the second one first, which is under the Biden administration, no one's being removed. And even if they were removing individuals this group of individuals would not be an enforcement priority, so that that kind of argument goes out the window.
 
KEILAR: Wait, you're saying - you're trying to say they're ...
 
WOLF: This idea though of keeping families together ...
 
KEILAR: ... can I just - wait, Chad, are you saying they're deporting no one.
 
WOLF: Sure.
 
KEILAR: Is that what you're alleging?
 
WOLF: From the interior of the country, they are hardly removing any of any individuals. They were removing some individuals that show up coming across that border in border states and along that southwest border.
 
KEILAR: Okay. I just ...
 
WOLF: But if you look at ERO removal numbers that's in - yes, because that's ICE enforcement removal officers ...
 
KEILAR: I just want to be clear, because there have been record deportations. But I understand what you're saying about this particular set of individuals.
 
WOLF: Yes.
 
KEILAR: I understand what you're saying. I just wanted to make sure we were clear on that. Sorry. Please keep going.
 
WOLF: Yes. These are individuals - yes, these are individuals by DHS's only - own fact sheet have been here on average of 23 years. So obviously they're not coming across the border. These are folks in American communities and throughout the country.
 
And so removals from those communities are at an all time low. So there's no chance that they would be deported under this administration or removed. But this idea of keeping families together, again, they've been here in the country for 23 years. There is a waiver process in place administered by the department over the past decades through both Republican and Democratic administrations that allows an illegal alien spouse to cure their unlawful presence here in the U.S. through a waiver in their home country.
 
It doesn't take years. It takes months. And over the course of 23 years, they could make that a priority to cure that unlawful status.
 <br>[15:10:00]
 
So I'm trying to understand the problem that the Biden administration is trying to solve here and I just don't see it. I don't understand the issue that they're trying to resolve.
 
KEILAR: We certainly know of instances where it has taken significantly longer than that. I think in practice we've seen from spouses who are here illegally and have tried to go back. It has not been an easily and quickly rectifiable situation. But you mentioned that this is something they're not obviously deporting this set of individuals. But it's possible that there will be a new administration in town here in just a matter of months. So you know perhaps protecting this set of individuals in the incident that former President Trump takes office again. What do you say to that. WOLF: Well, first I think it's important to remember, these individuals came into the country illegally. So they broke U.S. law to begin with. Regardless of that fact though, they have the ability to adjust status through existing mechanisms. You know, that the department has administered across multiple administrations. And so it feels like the administration ...
 
KEILAR: Chad it's not as ...
 
WOLF: ... the Biden administration - the action today ...
 
KEILAR: You're making it sound like ...
 
WOLF: ... is really searching for a problem that doesn't exist.
 
KEILAR: Sir, no that's not true. You're making it sound like it's a you go back to your home country. It's a snap of the fingers. It's not. We know it doesn't move that quickly. We know it doesn't. It just - it doesn't. So let me ask you this, this executive action ...
 
WOLF: It does not take years to do this. And so it, you know, again, the average individual again by DHS' own fact sheet has been here 23 years. If this was a priority for them if they were concerned about being removed or deported, if they were concerned ...
 
KEILAR: Okay, I just want to be clear ...
 
WOLF: ... about all these different things that we're talking about ...
 
KEILAR: ... we know many instances where it does ...
 
WOLF: ... they have the ability to cure their unlawful presence in the U.S.
 
KEILAR: ... we know many instances where it takes a lot longer.
 
WOLF: We've had that ability to 23 years.
 
KEILAR: And it does take years to cure that unlawful presence. It's not a matter of snapping the fingers. But let me ask you this. This executive action.
 
WOLF: Yes.
 
KEILAR: It's no doubt going to be challenged, right? The ACLU is already challenging ...
 
WOLF: Yes.
 
KEILAR: ... the June 4th, that other executive action ...
 
WOLF: Right.
 
KEILAR: ... that limits asylum. And they were successful when they did that with Trump's EO that used the same authority. Voters want action, as you said. The polls show it.
 
So if say Trump does win in November, what responsibility does he have to actually address this because he didn't even negotiate a immigration bill, let alone pass anything.
 
WOLF: Yes. Look, what I think most of the majority of Americans want, they want the crisis along the border to end or at least to come under some type of control. So I think they're looking for a variety of different actions to address the individuals, the cartels, the fentanyl, all the illegal activity and all the things that are killing Americans every single day. So I think that's where the priority will be in any new administration and there's a variety of different things that you can put in place to address that issue first and foremost.
 
I will say that I served all four years in the Trump administration and we did negotiate with Congress. We were not successful in both 17 and 18 in both the border security and immigration bill. So there is precedent for, you know, obviously negotiating and looking at different actions that work.
 
But I think first and foremost you've got to deal with the border and you've got to stop these hundreds of thousands and - millions of individuals coming across the border illegally. You've got to address that issue. Otherwise the law enforcement officers of DHS will never be able to get their arms around it, will never be able to fully vet individuals coming into the country. And you're going to have unfortunate situations like we've seen recently where it's really impacting American communities and families here in the U.S.
 
KEILAR: Yes, certainly this is an issue that so many Americans want dealt with. Former acting Homeland Security secretary, Chad Wolf, we certainly appreciate your time on what is a very big day. Thank you.
 
WOLF: All right, thanks.
 
KEILAR: You see there at the White House we're keeping an eye on this as President Biden is expected to be on stage here shortly. We'll get in a quick break and be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:18:41]
 
SANCHEZ: Happening now on Capitol Hill, the CEO of Boeing is facing his first congressional reckoning. Dave Calhoun is getting grilled on Capitol Hill for the first time after a series of major incidents and issues.
 
KEILAR: Yes, it seems the list kind of goes on and on here.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
KEILAR: And moments ago Republican senator, Josh Hawley, ripped into Calhoun accusing him of putting profits above safety.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): I think the truth is Mr. Calhoun you're not focused on safety. You're not focused on quality. You're not focused on transparency. All of this is in the record. But I think actually you're focused on exactly what you were hired to do which is that you're cutting corners. You are eliminating safety procedures. You are sticking it to your employees. You are cutting back jobs because you're trying to squeeze every piece of profit you can out of this country, you're - this company - you're strip mining it. You're strip mining Boeing.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: And joining us now is pilot and CNN Aviation Analyst Miles O'Brien. He is also science correspondent for PBS NewsHour.
 
Miles, what do you think so far of what you're hearing and just sort of this moment where Boeing is having to account for itself.
 
MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Yes, Brianna.
 <br>[15:20:00]
 
Dave Calhoun came in and turned his back to the committee and to the crowd, many family members of those who lost loved ones on those two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, apologized to them and then turned back to the committee and seemed to not offer enough for it. He is a little bit short on specifics as to what the company is doing to rectify the safety issues which have come up.
 
The most recent notable one being that January incident where a door plug pull - fell off of an Alaska Airlines' aircraft. And he is finding himself on his back foot as the committee addresses the fundamental issue here, which to all appearances Boeing has been cutting corners to look better for that quarterly balance sheet and cutting corners on safety. And that doesn't work well in the aviation business. I don't think I have to tell many people of that.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. I want to play some sound from the chair of the committee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal. He said this at the start of the hearing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): In fact there is near overwhelming evidence in my view as a former prosecutor that prosecution should be pursued.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: Boeing struck a deal as you know, Miles, to defer prosecution after incidents in 2018 and 2019. Do you think the manufacturer is going to be prosecuted this time around?
 
O'BRIEN: Well, I can't say for certain but on paper at least from where we all sit, it looks as like they were in violation out of the - of that agreement, that deferred prosecution agreement. It's kind of common in white collar crimes where essentially you get amnesty for the crime so long as you clean up your act over a certain period of time.
 
But what it looks like is the act - cleaning did not work. We've seen plenty of evidence of that. So it will be interesting to see if the Department of Justice goes on a criminal direction. I should note, Boris, that in the aviation world, it is kind of famously not criminal when it comes to safety. The idea is that we want to have everybody in the community willing to speak out and identify a safety problem without fear of any recriminations.
 
But some of the allegations and what has been proven in the midst of those two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 step over the line into the area of what you would say would be more willful disregard. And so it's quite possible we could see that happen.
 
KEILAR: That - talk a little bit about that Myles. That's really - the thing is, you know, he's there trying to project that they value safety that they want to be accountable. And yet when you get down to the factory floor and the management and whatever incentives there are for getting planes done on time and what kind of parts you're using and whether you can pipe up and say something is the matter, there doesn't seem to be that kind of culture there.
 
O'BRIEN: Yes. And we've heard from whistleblower after whistleblower exactly that, Brianna, that there is almost this sweatshop mentality on the Boeing factory floor as they try to match the pace of Airbus and meet those quarterly earnings reports.
 
You hear stories of parts that are not properly documented, being put on the aircraft and put in service. And when those whistleblowers attempt to raise concerns on the factory floor, they are ruthlessly intimidated by superiors.
 
In one case today, they told the account of one whistleblower being called dozens of times by a supervisor and threatened by the supervisor that he will break him. Ultimately, he did. So that's not conducive to safety by any stretch. And what is happening also is they have this idea of stations for the aircraft as it moves along the line.
 
And there are many open issues which kind of travel with the aircraft. And so the process of putting the airplane together is put out of order, so there's a lot to look at here.
 
SANCHEZ: Miles, great to get your perspective on this. Thank you so much for joining us. We're going to keep an eye on this hearing, but we want to go straight to the White House where President Biden is speaking, unveiling this new executive action on immigration. Let's listen.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: First bill introduced when as president an immigration bill that included this provision, but it never got off the ground. It needs a little more help. But now today a significant portion of this is being passed or being by executive order. Javier (ph), thank you for the introduction and for sharing your family story. You know I've often said doctors - we've been a significant consumer of health care in my family.
 <br>[15:25:02]
 
We spent a lot of time in hospitals and - for our family, my - anyway.
 
And I always said that doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live, not a joke. A lot of time in ICU, a lot of time with my son, a lot of time - and, you know, it's - if there's any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, men and women, not a joke.
 
So thank you for what you did to help us get through the pandemic, pal, and for all you're doing for our country.
 
My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. Thanks to all the members of Congress and Homeland Security Secretary. I'm not sure I'm going to do so (INAUDIBLE) but all kidding aside Secretary Mayorkas Marcus as well as Secretary Becerra and advocates, and families, law enforcement, faith leaders, everybody is here.
 
Two weeks ago, I did what Republicans in Congress refused to do: I took action to secure our border. That included restricting unlawful crossings at our southern border, making decision on asylum more quickly and so much more. And so far it's working.
 
Since we implemented my order, encounters have dropped 25 percent at the border and we're seeing the lowest number we've seen in a long time. But folks, it took this step after the bipartisan agreement. One of the most conservative Republican senators had helped work through and over a four or five week period. The strongest bipartisan security agreement that's ever been seen.
 
But we were about to move forward when Republicans walked away from the deal for the most pathetic and petty of reasons: Donald Trump got on the phone, literally and started - and the press can confirm this - and calling them - calling senators saying, don't. Don't go ahead and do this. Don't support this legislation that had bipartisan support.
 
And what he asked - when you ask why, he said it wouldn't - it would hurt him politically and help me instead. So much for Republicans caring about the border. I also know - many people in this room also had concerns about the steps I'd taken.
 
I heard and respected from many of you and many people behind me of the concerns you felt and as president and I had to take these actions. Every nation must secure its borders it's just that simple. And if Trump and the Republicans wouldn't do it working with me then I would do it on my own and I did.
 
At the time I took these steps to secure the border. I also said that I would move to fix problems that made our immigration system unfair, unjust and provisions that simply made it no sense at all. Specifically, steps that will be good for dreamers, married couples and for Americans. That's why we're here today. A few days ago we marked the 12th anniversary taking care of dreamers as President Obama and I put in place. There are a few of these immigrant - of these immigration areas that have had most positive area impact and got more support from the American people across the board.
 
These young people known as dreamers, Hispanics, South Asians and more who came to America as children only know America as their home and been able to live and learn out of the shadow - out of the shadows. So many of them have graduated from high school and college and are starting families on their own building successful careers serving our nation in uniform and so, so much more.
 
We're much better and stronger nation because of dreamers like Javier who just introduced me. So today I'm announcing new measures to clarify and speed up work visas to help people including dreamers have graduated from U.S. colleges and universities, landed jobs and high- demand, high-skilled professions that we need to have to grow - to see our economy grow. It's the right thing to do.
 
I want those who've been educated in U.S. college universities to put their skills and knowledge to work here in America. I want to keep building the strongest economy in the world with the best workforce in the world. We've already created 15 million new jobs, a record. We're seeing record economic growth, a record of small business growth. And I doubt why the action we're taking today matters, if you wonder about that, just ask business leaders, ask labor leaders, ask economists, ask elected officials.
 
They know it's good for American business. They know it's good for the American economy. They know it's good for America, period. This step builds on other actions we've taken to support dreamers from defending dreamers in the courts and expressing - expanding access to health care for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act including for dreamers.</pre>
