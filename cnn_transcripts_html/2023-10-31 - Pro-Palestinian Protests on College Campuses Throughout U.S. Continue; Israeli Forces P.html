TED DEUTCH, CEO, AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE: On October 7th as a military action, the slaughter of 1,400 people, men, women, children, women raped, bodies desecrated, children burned alive. There's a problem on too many college campuses of trying to figure out if there's some way to thread a needle here that somehow maybe we don't have to talk about this horrific terror attack, that maybe we can help Jewish students without coming full square behind them in saying that we will not tolerate antisemitism on our campus, period, end of story. You cannot thread a needle. You have to be as full-throated in defense of Jewish students as you are in defense of every other student on campus. 
 
But if I can just explain why this makes so much sense, why when campuses have people protesting, chanting "from the river to the sea," which is a chant that envisions Israel without Jews in it, which is Hamas's goal, or intifada, intifada. This century the second intifada in Israel killed 1,000 civilians with bombings at bus stops, on buses, at cafes, at pizza places. 
 
The language, the rhetoric being used in support of Hamas is dangerous and must be called out everywhere by university presidents, by elected officials, by everyone who understands that we have an obligation not just to protect the Jewish community but to stand squarely against terrorism, the kind that we experienced in our own country not that long ago, and that we need to stand against wherever it occurs, especially when there are Americans who were killed and Americans who are still being held hostage. We have got to come together on this issue. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  Former Congressman Ted Deutch, I wish we had more time. We'll have you back soon, and thank you for that. 
 
DEUTCH:  Thank you. 
 
HARLOW:  We do have breaking news. Israeli forces say an air strike has killed a Hamas commander, the commander that helped direct the massacre on two areas right near the Gaza border on October 7th. This comes as Israeli troops push deeper into Gaza and Prime Minister Netanyahu rejects calls for a ceasefire. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER:  Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen. The Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR:  Israel's military announcing the first rescue of a hostage held in Gaza, the IDF telling CNN a special forces operation was able to free an Israeli soldier who was abducted during the October 7th terror attack. This is a video from the emotional reunion with her grandmother. 
 
Meanwhile, on the ground in Gaza, the IDF says troops have been battling terrorist cells armed with machine guns and anti-tank missiles. 
 
HARLOW:  Also, Israeli forces as they advance, Hamas has released a new hostage video, this is of three Israeli women, one of them was held captive is begging Netanyahu to secure their release this morning. We spoke with her cousin. 
 
So we are also this morning seeing Israeli forces on the move in the occupied West Bank today. I want to show you some of that. That's in Arura (ph) in the West Bank. It's video obtained by CNN of the IDF demolishing the house of a Hamas leader in the West Bank. Let's start our coverage this hour with Jeremy Diamond. He joins us. Jeremy, what can you tell us? We just showed you some of the new advances that Israel is making both from the air and on the ground. 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well, we have been hearing the study thud of artillery continuing this morning as this expanded ground operation now enters its fifth day. What is clear is that there is still on going and intense fighting inside the northern part of the Gaza Strip between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. We have been hearing machine gunfire all throughout the morning as well as yesterday as Israeli forces make advances on Gaza City through several different axes. 
 
What is clear is that Israeli troops have been spotted south of Gaza City at a main junction entering the city. They have also been spotted behind me near the city of Beit Hanoun in the northeastern most part of Gaza as well as at least two miles into Gaza on the coastline, the western part of the Gaza Strip. So clearly advancing on several different axes. And what's clear is they're proceeding quite deliberately, quite slowly as they try and take out some of those reinforced positions of Hamas fighters. 
 <br>[08:05:01]
 
And what's also interesting is that Israeli forces on the ground appear to be making pretty significant use of close air support, more so than in previous operations as Israeli troops on the ground spot reinforced Hamas positions and then call in air strikes. We have also seen several helicopters, Apachi gunships being used to fire missiles at various targets inside of the Gaza Strip. All of this as Israel's prime minister vows that this is not the time for a ceasefire, saying that this is a time for war. 
 
Israel's military and political leadership all appear to be united in taking out Hamas, removing it from control of the Gaza Strip, and also making very clear to the Israeli public that this will come at a cost. It will be a long battle in order to achieve those objectives. 
 
HARLOW:  Jeremy what do we know about the Hamas commander the IDF says they killed, because this was one of the commanders who led the attack on Kibbutz Erez on the 7th of October? 
 
DIAMOND:  Yes, Poppy. Even as Israel's military operations have been heavily focused here in the Gaza Strip, they have also been trying to essentially tamp down on any potential outbursts of fighting inside the West Bank. They have arrested over 1,500 Palestinians in recent weeks. And now we're learning that the IDF has also demolished the house of Saleh al-Aruri, who is effectively the de facto commander of Hamas in the West Bank, although he is believed to be living in Lebanon. 
 
But in new video that you can see here, the Israeli military demolishing that home, that is a tactic that the Israeli military has used in the past, typically with terrorists who carry out attacks. They then go ahead and demolish their homes. That's something that's been done in the West Bank over recent years. So you can see them doing that as they try and avoid a broader conflagration happening in the West Bank. 
 
And we know that as the Israeli military has focused its efforts here in the Gaza Strip, they're also very weary of this turning into a broader conflict, whether that is in the West Bank, in east Jerusalem, in northern Israel with Hezbollah in the north, and also, of course, carrying out airstrikes on weapons depots and supply lines in Syria which Iran has used to supply its proxies in the region. So we are actively monitoring all these different fronts. As of now, the hottest front is right here in Gaza. But of course, there is a risk of it turning into a broader conflict. 
 
HARLOW:  There certainly is. Jeremy Diamond, thanks for all the reporting. Phil? 
 
MATTINGLY:  Joining us now is Mark Regev, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We appreciate your time. I want to start with the breaking news that we just learned from the IDF that a senior Hamas commander who allegedly was directed and was behind the massacre at Kibbutz Erez had been killed. What more can you tell us about that? 
 
MARK REGEV, SENIOR ADVISER TO ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU:  I can't go beyond the official statement. But I can tell you what our policy, that all the people involved in the massacre of our people, all the people involved in the terrible atrocities of September (sic) 7th, when they stormed the border, they slaughtered our people, they raped, they beheaded, they burnt people alive so badly we still can't identify some of the bodies, anyone involved in those atrocities, we will find them, we will punish them, and anyone involved whatsoever, we will take them out. 
 
MATTINGLY:  As part of the ongoing ground operation, the air strikes, or is there a separate assassination effort, program underway? 
 
REGEV:  I can't go into specific details precisely because the operation is still ongoing, and I don't want to give any information to our enemy. Hamas is a fanatical and brutal enemy. We have seen that in their behavior. We see that in the way they conduct themselves. We see that in the way they're holding, what is it, 238 hostages. We will bring justice to Hamas, and that means taking out their leadership, their command, and the people responsible for the terrible atrocities we saw on October 7th. 
 
MATTINGLY:  You note the hostages. There was a hostage that was recovered in a special operation by Israeli forces, I believe the first of its kind, at least we are aware of. Does this indicate that your forces are getting better visibility into where the hostages may be right now? 
 
REGEV:  So, obviously, we're making a maximum effort to free hostages. There are two parallel tracks going on. On the one hand, of course, where we can locate a hostage, we will act to free them. That's our commitment to each and every one of the hostages. And of course, at the same time, we're beefing up the overall military pressure on Hamas, making them feel the pain. We believe pressure is the way to get our hostages out. They're not going to suddenly become Boy Scouts. They're not going to become a humanitarian organization. They cynically have taken people hostages after abducting them. 
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
We believe the only way we're going to get our people out is to ratchet up that pressure together with diplomatic pressure on their allies in the Gulf. We think that's the key to getting people out. 
 
MATTINGLY:  How would you assess Qatar's efforts as a mediator or as a partner in trying to negotiate the release of hostages the last several weeks? 
 
REGEV:  Well, so far we got four out. I mean, we released -- we rescued one of our own. So far through that sort of framework, we got four out of 238. 
 
MATTINGLY:  So they should be doing more? 
 
REGEV:  That could be higher. We don't know. Let's just say this, if they want to say they're doing a good job, I think the proof of the pudding remains to be in the eating, and we have to see what happens. 
 
MATTINGLY:  I want to ask, there's been a lot of discussion about humanitarian aid, the availability of humanitarian aid from U.S. officials especially. We had the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs yesterday at the U.N. called for the opening at a different border crossing which has been closed, saying that that would significantly affect the ability to send trucks through. That has been closed. Is that something that Israel would consider? 
 
REGEV:  The truth is the Rafah closing, we're expediting the massive increase from that crossing. I think yesterday we had double the number of trucks we had. We're expecting that number to go up again and again. So we've got a network that is working, and we now have to just put in more trucks through that network. And Israel is willing for that to happen. And it works well from that particular crossing point. Because the safe zone that we're suggesting that the internally displaced Palestinian civilians go to is precisely by there. It's in the southern end of the Gaza Strip right near the Rafah crossing, close to the coast. That's the goal. And we're working with the international community to make that happen. 
 
MATTINGLY:  Just last one on the ground operation. There are estimates that there are about 10,000 troops perhaps in Gaza. Some estimates have been as much as double that. Can you give us a rough estimate of how many troops are actually on the ground in Gaza, and if this is kind of the full scale of the ground operation in terms of size and personnel? 
 
REGEV:  I'm sorry but I'm not at liberty to go into that sort of detail. But I can tell you who else is in Gaza. I understand there are some 600 American passport holders who America has asked for them to leave, and we're willing for that to happen, and I understand the Egyptians are, too. But Hamas is holding them. 
 
MATTINGLY:  How so? Can you explain that, actually, sir? I'm sorry to interrupt. What is Hamas doing? This has been something we have heard constantly from U.S. officials. Hamas is the one that's holding -- what are they doing? Because U.S. -- those passport holders on the ground say they don't hear from Hamas. So what is happening? 
 
REGEV:  It's clear that Hamas is preventing them from leaving. Hamas controls the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing. And no one can leave Gaza without Hamas's OK, without Hamas's permission. And they're denying permission to those American passport holders, they're denying permission to other dual nationals who we OKed. We don't have any problem with them leaving. And Egypt has no problem receiving them. 
 
But Hamas wants to keep them as also as hostages. It's a dangerous game. They're not being held in dungeons like the Israelis are held underground. Yes, they are free to walk around. But they can't leave Gaza, and that is because Hamas has made a decision that they can't. 
 
MATTINGLY:  Mark Regev, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Thank you, sir, for your time. 
 
HARLOW:  Phil, thank you. 
 
REGEV:  My pleasure. 
 
HARLOW:  Thank you for that, Phil, in trying to get really important clarity on why they cannot get out. 
 
This morning also politics in the U.S., there is a longshot trial that resumes in Colorado that could get President Trump off the ballot. 
 
MATTINGLY:  And with Mike Pence dropping out of the White House race, are other GOP candidates feeling better about their chances with less competition? Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie joins us live on set to discuss. Stay with us. 
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ERIC OLSON, ATTORNEY FOR THE PETITIONERS: Our constitution prevents people who betrayed their solemn oath, as Trump did here, from serving in office again. Trump engaged in insurrection and therefore cannot appear on the ballot. No person, not even the former president, is above the law. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: That was attorney Eric Olson speaking in a Colorado courtroom on Monday. Olson is representing a group of Colorado voters who are challenging whether former president Trump is eligible to be president again. The longshot trial resumes this morning. 
 
It centers on a section of the 14th amendment that disqualifies anyone who engaged in a quote, "Insurrection or rebellion from holding federal office." HARLOW: Challengers used Trump's own words against him on the first
 
 day of this trial, playing clips from his speech on election night 2020, when he falsely claimed victory, and from January 6, where he urged his supporters to, quote, "Fight like hell at the Capitol." 
 
With us this morning in the studio, Republican Presidential Candidate Chris Christie. Governor, good to have you. You said it was that night, election night 2020, you're sitting on the set at ABC News, you're a contributor, and that's the moment when you decide, no longer can I back this guy. 
 
Do you think -- you're a lawyer, as you read section three of the 14th Amendment, do you think that that precludes Trump from serving as President? 
 
FMR. GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R-NJ) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't. I think you'd have to be convicted of insurrection or rebellion, not just accused of it. And so, I don't think it does it. 
 
HARLOW: Okay, can we play this out? If convicted because this has been used against two convicted people from the insurrection both in, I think it's New Mexico and West Virginia, and they have been removed from lower offices, though, because of this, would that hold for convicted Trump? CHRISTIE: Sure, it would if he were convicted of it. But the problem
 
 is, even in the January 6 federal case, he hasn't been charged with insurrection or rebellion. 
 
HARLOW: That's right. 
 
CHRISTIE: So, there's not going to be a verdict against him on that. And I think in a bigger way, I think it would be bad for the country for him to be removed from the ballot on what would be seen by a lot of people as an illegal technicality. 
 
I think the much better way to go about it is to beat him. I don't think he has any business being president of the United States again. And I think we have to defeat him at the ballot box because you see the way he was when he was defeated at the ballot box. He wouldn't accept it. 
 
Can you imagine if a judge or a group of judges kicked him off the ballot? It would cause such tumult in this country that I would much rather have him defeated in an election than this way. And because of the way he's charged, I don't think it could happen. 
 
MATTINGLY: We want to talk about policy, in particular foreign policy. Obviously, given what we've been covering the last several weeks, there have been, I think, almost two dozen attacks on the US. bases or U.S. troops deployed in the region by Iranian proxies, over the course of the last several weeks. The U.S. has struck back in at least one case in Syria. 
 
Is that enough? Do you believe that President Biden's response to those proxy attacks meets where it should be right now? 
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
CHRISTIE: Look, I think that we have to make really clear to Iran any more of these games and things are going to get a lot heavier for them. And I think the President needs to use that language. I think he has to let them know that these types of attacks, while maybe not directly connected to what's going on in Gaza, we know the game they're playing, and they're trying to incite regional war. 
 
So, it's a very fine line to walk when you are president. But you can't allow any other country, even though surrogates, to indiscriminately attack American men and women in uniform. So, they continue to do that kind of stuff and it causes death or injury, then you got to strike back harder. 
 
MATTINGLY: But what more -- so they've sent two carrier groups. Obviously, they have a rapid response force of Marines that have all moved into the region precisely to try and stop regional actors from acting. There have been airstrikes hitting Syrian, and Iranian proxies. 
 
What more would you do? 
 
CHRISTIE: You have to do more of it. Look, I think the carriers are a deterrence for everybody, but it's not a response to attacks on American fighting men and women. So, what you're going to need to do is, if this continues, you're going to have to increase the level of airstrikes and increase drone strikes and do that to continue to let them know that, if they do this, there's going to be a price to pay with their personnel. 
 
We don't want to do that, but we will have to do it, if they go and they hurt American men and fighting men and women who are fighting for our country. 
 
HARLOW: Where though, John Bolton, who served while you were in the Trump Administration, you know, has for a long time been saying to stop Iran bomber -- I mean, he even wrote a piece as such. Are you talking about more strikes like the Syria strikes on Iran proxies or are you talking about in Iran? Because if you were President, it'd be your call. 
 
CHRISTIE: Sure. No, I'm talking about Iran proxies. Look, if the attacks are from Iran proxies, then you attack those Iran proxies and debilitate them from being able to do that. Again, I don't think you escalate it given what's happened so far. 
 
Now, if there were to be a significant loss of life, then it becomes -- and you can directly connect that to Iran, then it becomes a different story. But based on what we're doing right now, I think you still go back at the Iran proxies. But what you do is you increase the lethality of that. You make it more lethal for them in terms of destroying their capability to attack us and hurting or injuring their folks, if that's what they're doing. 
 
MATTINGLY: House Republicans have proposed $14 billion for Israel, the number that President Biden asked for, but they're not including Ukraine funding, and they're proposing to pay for it by rescissions to the IRS, which would actually end up costing more money to some degree. 
 
Do you agree with their approach right now? 
 
CHRISTIE: What I think is that it's a typical negotiating tactic when you have a divided Congress, right? So, they know that the Democrats in the Senate are not going to agree to exactly that proposal.
 
MATTINGLY: Do they?
 
CHRISTIE: Yeah, they do. 
 
MATTINGLY: All of them? 
 
CHRISTIE: Well, it doesn't matter if all of them -- a majority of them know, and I think the speaker certainly knows that that's not going to happen. So, you set out a marker in a negotiation. This is what we would like on our best day. The Democrats in the Senate are going to do that, and then you've got to negotiate what's going to happen in between. 
 
And I think the President needs to get involved in that because of the importance of the Israel aid package. Now, in Ukraine, I would support it being done together, but I'm encouraged by the fact that the new speaker has said he supports aid to Ukraine. 
 
And so, I assume that what he wants to do to try to keep peace inside his own caucus that he just barely got elected to lead, is to have separate votes on that. And I think what you'll see is a majority of Republicans voting yes within the caucus and an overwhelming majority of Democrats voting yes on that, and I believe it'll ultimately pass. 
 
HARLOW: Before you go, if you were President and you were on the phone with Bibi Netanyahu, would you tell him we need humanitarian pauses? John Kirby at the White House told us yesterday we may need multiple humanitarian pauses. Do you think so, I know you don't want to ceasefire, but does there need to be a pause to get some of these folks out, get Americans out, help the children? 
 
CHRISTIE: Look, I would think if we could get Americans out, that would be a goal for us to reach, but I don't think that would happen. I think what Hamas would want is not a pause. They would want a guarantee that Israel would not invade Gaza at all. 
 
And we can't give them that guarantee because of the attack they perpetrated on October 7. They killed 1,400 civilians. It's not right, it's not fair, and Israel needs to degrade their capability to do it again. 
 
So, and secondly, I wouldn't be telling the Prime Minister of Israel how to respond to the worst attack and murder of Jews since the Holocaust. I would say to him three things. One, you have the absolute obligation to protect the territorial integrity and safety and security of your citizens. Two, you have to degrade Hamas's ability to ever do this to you again. But three, keep your eye on the ball at the end of this.
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
What we want is the ability to isolate Iran by making more agreements with other Arab countries. So, keep that goal in mind without me micromanaging how he's going to do a pause, no pause, to keep those principles in mind.
 
HARLOW: And those would be my conversations with notable on your last point that the Saudi Defense Minister was at the White House this week having those discussions. Thank you very much. 
 
CHRISTIE: Well, thank you guys for having me. It's good to be on, thanks.
 
MATTINGLY: Well, there are new details surrounding the shocking red flags. The main shooter, what police and the military knew before the attack. 
 
HARLOW: Also, what we were just talking about was House Republicans revealing those details of the $14.3 billion aid package for Israel, and why their plan still faces that uphill battle in their own conference. MATTINGLY: Before we go to a break, we do want to show from Gaza as
 
 the air strikes the ground, incursion continues, and the conflict shows no signs of ending anytime soon. Stay with us.
