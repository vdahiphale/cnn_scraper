THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[17:00:01]
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's an interesting question, Jake, and it's a one so many people are asking right now. Officially, DeSantis, his people and his team not saying exactly why they chose this. But I will tell you, if you talk to those people who work with him, they really believe that he is an unconventional candidate. 
 
They, as you mentioned, want this unconventional campaign that really matches up with him, they want to reach people in different ways and go about this very differently. So clearly, this is one way to get attention and to do something quite different, right out of the gate.
 
So what we know is that he will sit down with Elon Musk tomorrow and talk through some of this. Elon Musk confirming that at a Wall Street Journal event earlier today, but stopping short of endorsing him in any way, or saying that he has plans to endorse. 
 
So all eyes will turn to that well. They will also turn here to Miami, Jake, where he is going to gather his donors to talk to them about his presidential bid, and really try to maximize this moment.
 
Again, going back to what his team wants, they want to really go on the offensive, they want a big blitz coming out of this announcement. So they want a lot of media attention, they also want a lot of money, they want to really have a strong showing with millions and millions of dollars right out of the gate. So you can bet that that's what they're going to be leaning on their donors to do to really bundle up that money and then move toward the next phase of this campaign.
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: And Jessica, so the event in Twitter spaces is 6:00 p.m. Eastern tomorrow, I believe. What is DeSantis going to do after that? DEAN: Right. So after that we look ahead to next week. And you mentioned that a lot of candidates mostly announced with a big formal announcement in a speech maybe in their hometown, we are expecting that that will be the case in the week to follow, that we will see a more traditional speech in person from him with a crowd, perhaps in his hometown here in Florida, that he will do that. 
 
And then we are expecting him to really hit the campaign trail hard. Again, this is a place where his team thinks he can really differentiate himself from especially two key rivals, President Biden and former President Donald Trump, they're both of course, a much older than Governor DeSantis.
 
That's where they think they can really contrast the younger governor with them that he can be out and about moving around, really going at a quick fast pace. And we expect to see a lot of that in the weeks to come, Jake.
 
TAPPER: All right. Jessica Dean in Miami, thanks so much. Here to discuss CNN Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny and Ryan Mac, Technology Reporter for the "New York Times."
 
Jeff, let me start with you. What do you make of Governor DeSantis doing this with Elon Musk, who is obviously a controversial figure who has leaned heavily into culture wars himself, has been boosting and tweeting some really fringe elements on Twitter?
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: In a way it's somewhat of a perfect marriage. I mean, the reality is Elon Musk as he's been taking over Twitter, he's been looking for the exact kind of audience that watched Tucker Carlson that supported a governor DeSantis. So, I'm not sure it's much of a risk for the DeSantis team. Everything that they've done is carefully scripted. We're told this is likely to be scripted tomorrow evening as well.
 
Yes, they may take questions, it'll be an audio format. But this is not designed to set the governor up or be a game of a gotcha in any respect, is designed to elevate him. So we will see how it goes.
 
But I think that, you know, the most important part is not the announcement tomorrow on Twitter, it is what his announcement does for the race. And the Trump team is aggressively waiting for him. So that is what the big sort of moment is for Ron DeSantis. It's not Elon Musk, it's Donald Trump.
 
TAPPER: Yes, but you pointed something out, Twitter spaces is audio only. That's unusual. I mean, you could do video.
 
ZELENY: And he'll be doing a Fox interview in the hour afterwards.
 
TAPPER: OK.
 
ZELENY: So, perfect opportunity to clean up. He'll be doing a Trey Gowdy interview tomorrow evening. So it's a one to hit for -- 
 
TAPPER: OK. ZELENY: -- the governor.
 
TAPPER: Trey Gowdy, former Republican congressman.
 
Ryan, since Musk took over Twitter, the company has obviously been playing, I think, it's fair to say like a lot of PR problems and some technical problems. Are you surprised that Elon Musk is now waiting into the presidential waters?
 
RYAN MAC, TECHNOLOGY REPORTER, "NEW YORK TIMES": Well, you know, it -- the presidential campaign is a great opportunity for Twitter to kind of show that it's back in the game. I mean, obviously, there's -- the company's taking a lot of hits under his ownership, like he himself has, you know, marked the valuation of the company down from 44 billion to 20 billion is what he's valuing the company at now. 
 
And it's been hit with, you know, advertisers leaving the platform, multiple outages. So, you know, he's seeing this as an opportunity to perhaps, you know, bring people back to gain interest in Twitter again and, you know, this is that opportunity for him.
 
TAPPER: Yes, I can see that. And Jeff, Musk says he voted for Joe Biden in 2020. But in a recent interview, I think was CNBC, I might be wrong, he said, I wish we could just have a normal human being as president. Do you think this signals that he is essentially, and maybe I'm going too far here, but essentially endorsing Ron DeSantis, he says I wish we could have a normal human being for president, didn't vote for Trump, and then kind of like welcomes Ron DeSantis in.
 <br>[17:05:14]
 
ZELENY: He's certainly showing what his interest is. But he said today in The Wall Street Journal event, he has no plans of endorsing tomorrow at this event. But look, he's clearly moving beyond Joe Biden. 
 
And Elon Musk is not the same Elon Musk, he was back in the 2020 campaign, he has, you know, changed his platform dramatically, he has been at odds with the Biden administration over several things, even though his Tesla car company is going to benefit from some of these electric vehicle things, et cetera. But he seems to be concerned about the age, as Jessica was saying earlier, of these two candidates, of Trump versus Biden campaign.
 
So, look, I think it'll be interesting to see if he holds other forms with other presidential candidates. But this is the first one he of course, is doing. But he says he's not going to endorse at all. We'll see where it goes from there.
 
It's, you know, tipping his thumb on the scale, I guess, a little bit here. But I think again, it's a friendly forum for Ron DeSantis.
 
TAPPER: Yes. Ryan, what kind of role do you see Twitter playing in 2024? Do you think that Musk and DeSantis and this alliance, whatever it is, could force Trump back onto the platform? Obviously, Elon Musk unbanned Trump, Trump's got his own social media site, Truth Social -- MAC: Right.
 
TAPPER: -- do you think this will beckon him back in a way?
 
MAC: I think it's hard to say. I mean, obviously, you know, Elon would probably love for Trump to be back on the platform. You know, he's obviously unblocked him. The account is just sitting there waiting for Trump to tweet again.
 
I don't know, I also see this potentially could make Trump more resistant to come back to the platform, you know, his now main competitor is going to do this Twitter space, it seems like you know, in some ways, he is marking that territory for himself and maybe he doesn't want to come back and fight that battle there. But yes, it remains to be seen.
 
TAPPER: And Jeff, we can't ignore the fact that Ron DeSantis has emerged as really taking on some very controversial positions, a six week abortion ban, which is, I mean, six weeks is before a lot of women even know they're pregnant -- 
 
ZELENY: Right.
 
TAPPER: -- really targeting the trans community in a very, very aggressive way, you know, getting a lot of African Americans very upset with the way he treated the AP course, et cetera. He's really leaned into the culture wars.
 
ZELENY: He has and that's what he believes his calling card will be in the Republican primary states like Iowa, like South Carolina. The bigger question for him is he talks about electability a lot. What has all this done for his electability down the road? Should he become the Republican nominee? That's very, very much an open question.
 
He said on a donor call last week, as reported in the "New York Times" that it's Trump, Biden or me. That is not necessarily clear that he is as strong in a general election, but he must win that primary first. And you can tell when I traveled to Iowa, other conservative states, these Republican primary voters like what they've seen in Florida, he calls it the Florida blueprint. But that is about to get, you know, inspected much more carefully. He's about to face something he has never done.
 
He's a very confident man.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
ZELENY: But running for President. As you know, we've covered so many campaigns, it's an entirely different ballgame starting tomorrow. So we'll see how much that blueprint actually holds up as he travels around from state to state.
 
TAPPER: Yes, and I also just think that there's a question about whether or not those positions which will intuitively help him in a Republican primary could hurt him in the general -- 
 
ZELENY: With the midterms of 18 and 22.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
ZELENY: These suburban voters are the ones he needs, for Republican's need to win the White House.
 
TAPPER: Exactly. Jeff Zeleny, Ryan Mac, thanks so much.
 
Russians allegedly attacking Russians inside Russia, just over the Ukrainian border. And now top Ukrainian officials weighing in. Then, the horrific moment a four year old has dropped over the fence at the U.S. Mexico border and gunshots are fired as Border Patrol agents try to help the child. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:12:49]
 
TAPPER: In our world lead, a Russian court has ordered Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich be held in jail for another three months. Gershkovich, who has been designated by the U.S. State Department is wrongfully detained was arrested in late March while on a reporting trip in Central Russia. CNN's Matthew Chance joins us live.
 
Matthew, reporters were barred from today's hearing. It appears the Russia is going to drag this farce out as long as possible.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes, I mean, quite the FSB who are leading the prosecution in this case, it's an espionage case, they asked for a three month extension to Evan Gershkovich's pretrial detention. And that was granted, it seems you know, very quickly by the court in central Moscow. 
 
And that's been condemned by, you know, roundly, first of all by The Wall Street Journal, the newspaper that employs Evan Gershkovich, they said they're deeply disappointed with that having taken place. The State Department's in the US calling for Mr. Gershkovich's immediate release. John Kirby of the U.S. National Security Council said he shouldn't have been detained in the first place.
 
The courtroom was essentially closed, journalists weren't allowed in. You're right. The parents of Evan Gershkovich were there, as were representatives of the, yes, U.S. diplomats from the embassy in Moscow. But it's not clear they were actually allowed in the courtroom. They went into the courthouse, but it's not clear they were able to actually go into the courtroom where Evan Gershkovich himself appeared in front of the judge.
 
And so, yes, I mean, very procedural, but it seems that Evan Gershkovich is now having to sit in Moscow even longer before his trial even begins. And of course, efforts are being made by the U.S. government to try and look for creative ways to try and work out how Gershkovich can be swapped along with his fellow American Paul Whelan, is also being held in Russia for espionage.
 
TAPPER: Matthew Chance, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
 
Also on our world lead, Russia today claimed its forces liquidated an incursion into its territory around the city of Belgorod, Russia is blaming Ukraine. But as CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports for us, now the invaders actually appear to be separatist Russian forces who oppose Vladimir Putin and are allied with Ukraine.
 <br>[17:15:15]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The Russian military allegedly fighting back, the defense ministry showing video of what it says are strikes against fighters who allegedly crossed the border from Ukraine.
 
LT. GEN. IGOR KONASHENKOV, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY (through translator): The remaining nationalists were thrown out to the territory of Ukraine where they were shelled until they were fully liquidated.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): The fighters are anti-Putin Russians calling themselves the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom for Russia Legion. Still, the Kremlin says it holds Ukraine responsible for the incursion. But in an exclusive interview with CNN, Ukraine's national security adviser brushed off those claims.
 
OLEKSIY DANILOV, UKRAINIAN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER (through translator): There is a part of Russians who are on the side of light and who went to deal with the darkness that exists in Russia now. What are the questions to us? I don't understand at all.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia claims Ukraine ordered the raid to distract from the situation in Bakhmut, where Moscow now claims its forces controlled all of the city that has essentially been reduced to rubble as these aerial views show. The national security adviser insists Ukrainian forces still hold part of the town and that the decision to stand and fight despite overwhelming numbers of Russians was right.
 
DANILOV (through translator): It was our strategic defense operation, which was successful for us, given that we held the territory for 10 months where we were destroying them every day.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Forcing the Russians into a battle of attrition here allowed Ukraine to prepare for a massive counter offensive he says could begin anytime.
 
DANILOV (through translator): We are clearly aware of when, where, how and what should start. The final decision is up to the president and the security staff. When the decision is made, Russia will definitely feel it.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Greetings from Bakhmut, a graffiti in one of the videos from the cross border raid into Russia reads and the Kremlin already using the incident to try and justify Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Putin himself portraying Moscow as the victim.
 
PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA: We are often told that Russia has started some kind of war, no, Russia with a special military operation is trying to stop this war being waged against us.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): But clearly, not all Russians agree. The groups who say they're behind the cross border attacks are vowing to battle on defending Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
PLEITGEN: And Jake, I also ask the national security adviser whether he now fears that there could be some big retaliation coming from the Russians after this humiliation of this cross border raid, like for instance, some sort of large missile attack by the Russians. Once again, he said, look, the Russians have already hit us with more than 1,400 missiles already, how much worse can it get? Jake.
 
TAPPER: Yes. Fred Pleitgen in Kyiv, thank you so much.
 
With us now, Democratic Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. She's a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
 
Congresswoman, thanks for joining us.
 
REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI), ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Sure.
 
TAPPER: What are you hearing about this incursion into Russia by anti- Putin Russian fighters from Ukraine?
 
SLOTKIN: Yes, I mean, look, we're still trying to get ground truth on it. But it's a pretty momentous thing to happen if the reports are true, that it's from a group that's, you know, disaffected Russians against Putin. 
 
I mean, it's not something I've ever seen in my time as a national security person for the past 20 years. And I just think it shows like how weak Putin is becoming if these things are popping up, he can't stop them, and now he's playing the victim card. That's pretty amazing.
 
TAPPER: So, the situation in eastern Ukraine does seem rather tenuous, there's fighting in and around the city of Bakhmut, we're waiting for a major Ukrainian counter offensive against the Russians. How long do you think Ukraine can afford to wait before launching a momentous counter offensive?
 
SLOTKIN: Well, I don't know. I think the frame needs to just be reflected here. The -- this is the Russian army who took months and months to take a city that's smaller than Lansing, Michigan. They've destroyed it. In the meantime, there's no civilians barely there, living there anymore.
 
So, this great victory that they're touting to me is just actually a reflection of their weakness that they have to celebrate, you know, this liberation after all these years. They've lost, my estimates, 100,000 people, and I've seen like, how it's changed what they can do, even along their own borders. 
 
I was in Norway in December, and the border guards in Norway were saying, look, there used to be all these border guards on the Russian side, but now they've all been sent to fight in Ukraine, and they haven't come back.
 
So, I don't think it's some amazing victory. I actually think it reflects the weakness that they have to celebrate this particular victory.
 
TAPPER: What does Ukraine, do you think, need to accomplish in a, let's say, summer offensive to assure continued support by the West?
 <br>[17:20:05]
 
SLOTKIN: Yes. I mean look I think we've done a lot of work to support the Ukrainians with material, with military support. We can't keep doing that in perpetuity for 10 years, 20 years. So we really need to aid their fight this summer to punch Putin a few times in the mouth, change the status quo, help them with the summer offensive, make sure they have the amount of weapons they need, the type of weapons they need, so that it changes the status quo. I think that's what we're all aiming for.
 
As Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians feel like things have changed, they have an upper hand, and they can call the shots on a negotiation or a conversation after that. But it all happens by having some serious military victories this summer. So time is of the essence.
 
TAPPER: Over the weekend, the Biden administration, President Biden reversed himself and said he's going to allow allies to send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets. Of course, Ukrainians have been asking for this for a long time. Why does it seem as though President Biden always has to be dragged kicking and screaming to these decisions? It's a criticism that I've heard from not only Republicans but Democrats.
 
SLOTKIN: Yes, I mean, look, I was part of a bipartisan group that has been writing to the President and encouraging him to allow this training. We know that the Ukrainians take to this training, we had some leaks over the weekend that show that Ukrainians take like four months to get trained up on these weapons or on these airframes, and that we know we have allies from NATO who are ready to supply F-16 in similar platforms.
 
I can't speak, all I can say is, if you're the president of the United States, you do have a responsibility to minimize escalation. And the President does not want American sons and daughters getting pulled into a war. So I understand the instinct.
 
I think, for me, given how far Putin has gone, given what he's done, the dynamic has changed. He is not capable of escalation beyond what he's done. We've seen that. And so we want to make sure that we're giving, again, the Ukrainians that advantage this summer. So, I support what's been done.
 
You know, look, we've -- this developed a process here in Washington where pressure does help get us to the right place, but the President does have a responsibility to always be measured about dragging us into a conflict.
 
TAPPER: Right, Democratic Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin from Michigan, thanks so much. Good to see you again.
 
SLOTKIN: Thank you.
 
TAPPER: Horror at the southern border as a small child has dropped over a fence and the agents who rushed to help were caught in the middle of gunfire. Plus, we're talking to the Republican and Democratic congresswoman who are pushing a new bipartisan Immigration Reform bill. Working together, wow. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:27:07]
 
TAPPER: In our national lead, a shocking moment captured on surveillance video, a four-year-old boy was dropped over a border wall in San Diego, California last week. Gunshots were reportedly fired from the Mexican side of the border as agents tried to help the boy. Helicopter even had to provide cover. Border officials say, thankfully the child is doing OK. Both the U.S. and Mexico are investigating how this happened and who might be responsible.
 
We've covered this for a long time now, and time and time again, immigration reform has proven to be a third rail of American politics. Democratic and Republican administrations repeatedly have tried and failed to enact meaningful reforms or what is universally agreed to be a broken system. But I bring good news, a bipartisan duo of Hispanic women are looking to break that trend by introducing what's called the Dignity Act. 
 
Overview here, it would provide billions of dollars for additional border security, it would create pathways to citizenship for some of the undocumented immigrants who are already in the U.S. It would change the legal immigration process and it would establish a special zones on the border where asylum claims would be processed within two months.
 
And joining us now for an exclusive bipartisan interview are the co- authors of that legislation, Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of Texas, and Republican Congresswoman Maria Salazar of Florida.
 
First of all, let me just say, thank you. Thank you for working bipartisan. Thank you for doing this more of this please. More of this, please.
 
REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR (D-TX), CO-SPONSOR, DIGNITY ACT: Yes.
 
REP. MARIA SALAZR (R-FL), CO-SPONSOR, DIGNITY ACT: Yes.
 
TAPPER: Congresswoman Escobar, let me start with you. Why do you believe this legislation will succeed when so many other attempts have failed? ESCOBAR: Jake, this legislation addresses the challenges that we're facing today in a really smart, strategic, common sense way. It represents true compromise. Neither side is getting everything that they want. And it is, frankly, what the American people want.
 
Also, I think it's important for us to maintain hope and optimism, because we passed an historic infrastructure bill in the last Congress, we took action on guns in the last Congress, on CHIPS and Science innovation. We can do this and we have to do this.
 
TAPPER: Congresswoman Salazar, first of all, welcome to The Lead, I hope it's the first of many visits. Creating pathways for citizenship for undocumented migrants who are already in the U.S. So it's something that many Republicans have been historically unwilling to support. Why do you think you can get more of your colleagues on board with that provision?
 
REP. MARIA SALAZAR (R-FL), CO-SPONSOR, DIGNITY ACT: That's a great question. And thank you for welcoming me. Because that we are creating the dignity path, that dignity status, and that status is basically you could be there for seven years, if you're undocumented, you've been here for more than five years and do not have a criminal record, then we give you the dignity status, come out of the shadows.
 <br>[17:30:00]
 
One of the things that I want to tell the public is that most undocumented do not necessarily want that path to citizenship. That is something that we have been hearing around, but no I think that if you give them dignity they are very happy. And then after that, if they do really want to create, they want to become American citizens, then they go into the redemption path. 
 
So we're talking about almost 15 years before you become an American, I we are Hispanics. I was on television, I serve those undocumented, and I know that they want -- they would rather live a dignified life in the Promised Land than wait for their path to citizenship that never comes.
 
TAPPER: Congresswoman Escobar, your legislation would create what you're calling humanitarian campuses on the border. This is where individuals who are seeking asylum can go, and they would have two months to get some sort of resolution, walk us through how this would work.
 
ESCOBAR: What is happening today on the border, and frankly, in communities, far away from the border communities like New York, Chicago, other communities, is we are having NGOs and local governments assume what is a federal responsibility in sheltering migrants, offering humanitarian care, that really should be under a federal under the auspices of the federal government.
 
And so during the 60 days, while someone's asylum claim is adjudicated, families stay together, NGOs are allowed on site. In fact, we will need NGOs on site. It will be a civilian workforce, allowing Border Patrol to get back to their job and their functions and responsibilities.
 
And at the same time, while yes, we are shortening the time for the adjudication process. We are doing something that does not exist today, which is allowing for legal representation, we have a creative way that we're addressing that in the bill. But due process will happen during these 60 days --
 
SALAZAR: Let me just add to that. We stopped catch and release. That's what we're doing.
 
TAPPER: You're stopping catch and release.
 
SALAZAR: Don't game the system anymore.
 
TAPPER: Right. And we know --
 
SALAZAR: Yes, asylum system has been gamed by millions of people for 35 years, it's time to stop it. You go to a humanitarian campus. We're going to treat you well in a very humanitarian way, like my colleague would love to. And then we're going to we're going to say, yes, no, or maybe to you in 60 days. No more giving you a seven years that will never finding you again. You know that's what's happening.
 
TAPPER: Yes. And one of the things we've heard from -- we had the mayor of Denver on last week, I believe, and he was saying, as you were just saying, Congresswoman Escobar, this is a federal responsibility and it's the cities and the and the mayors. And the counties out there, not just in the -- in Texas, but all over the country that are being forced to deal with this issue. And they're very frustrated with the well, it's the Biden administration now. But you know, the same situation existed before.
 
Congresswoman Salazar --
 
SALAZAR: Because the federal system, I mean because, you know, the Biden administration, and I'm not going to be bipartisan here, because this has been a 35-year problem that Republicans and Democrats have committed, they have not been able to solve it. 
 
So now we're coming together to see if we can open the Red Sea, because we understand that this is very difficult. But we do have hope that because the border is the way it is it's time for both parties to come together and do now what's perfect, but something that is good enough.
 
And what we're saying is that we're going to give you, we're going to stop, catch and release, we're going to seal the border, we're going to create all that to put to all the technology that it's out there, I don't care whether it's a barrier, a levee, a tower, a drone, and infrared camera, we're not experts, but we do know that the border needs to be sealed.
 
ESCOBAR: I would disagree with the term sealed. It is better managed.
 
SALAZAR: And then it secured. Secure the border. Don't stop catch and release and then bring out of the shadows, those millions of people that are doing jobs that no one else wants to do. Let's strict them with dignity, not citizenship necessarily at the beginning. 
 
And you know, we know that we are going to be able to create a -- millions of jobs for the economic for the business sector, because you know very well that right now the business sector is dying to our hands.
 
TAPPER: Yes. And there's a huge labor shortage. Huge labor shortage.
 
SALAZAR: Yes. So then it is -- this is an economic bill, more than anything else.
 
TAPPER: Congresswoman Maria Salazar, come back, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, come back, separate together and we love the attempt to work across the aisle. It's what the American people need.
 
SALAZAR: That what we are here for. So why are we doing -- why we're doing at the halls of Congress.
 
TAPPER: Exactly. Exactly.
 
SALAZAR: Let's work for the American people, not for Democrats or for Republicans.
 
TAPPER: Love it.
 
SALAZAR: Thank you.
 
TAPPER: Thank you so much, guys. Good to see both of you.
 <br>[17:34:45]
 
Coming up, a sharp warning from America's top doctor about how much access kids and teens should have to social media. That story is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
TAPPER: The U.S. Surgeon General today warned that social media can have a quote profound risk on the mental health of your children and he is putting the pressure on lawmakers and big tech companies to actually try to do something to protect kids here. Here is CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A new warning from the highest level of youth mental health crisis unfolding before our eyes, social media can pose a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. That's according to a 25 page advisory from the U.S. Surgeon General. Earlier this year, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned of the unfair matchup.
 
DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: You're pitting a child against the world's greatest product designers and that's just not a fair fight. YURKEVICH (voice-over): Nearly every U.S. teenager is on social media up to 95 percent of kids ages 13 to 17, report using social media with more than a third using it all the time. Kids must typically be 13 to register on social media apps but nearly 40 percent of children ages eight to 12 use it anyway.
 <br>[17:40:09]
 
MURTHY: I think that it's a time, you know, early adolescence where kids are developing their identity, their sense of self and the skewed and often distorted environment of social media often does a disservice to many of those children.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): The advisory concluded, we do not yet have enough evidence to determine if social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents calling for more research. But it did cite studies which found increased risk of anxiety and depression, poor sleep, online harassment and low self-esteem.
 
JEROME YANKEY, DELETED TIKTOK IN 2021: The time I spent looking at all these attractive people doing amazing things and amazing places, getting disappointed by my own life is never something I want to be doing, especially when I have the power to change it when but I just wasn't because I was spending hours on this app.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Some experts say TikTok has the stickiest and most addicting algorithm keeping people on the app longer. Last year TikTok users spent an hour and a half per day on the app on average, more than any other social media platform. This as Montana becomes the first state to ban the social media app on all devices, prompting TikTok to sue.
 
SHOU CHEW, CEO OF TIKTOK: I don't want to speak for all parents. I think it's very important that parents make the individual decisions with their children. But for me personally, I'm very comfortable with my children getting more involved with understanding technology at an early age.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram have parental controls that can monitor teens screen time and content. But experts say the oversight should begin at home.
 
DR. REBECCA BERRY, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST: It's important when possible for parents and caregivers to really model how they would like their children to utilize social media.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH: And the report goes on to give parents tips about how to keep their children safe against social media like creating tech free zones in the home. The Surgeon General also calling out legislators calling on them to do more like creating higher standards for data privacy for children. 
 
And Jake there is about a half a page dedicated to the benefits of social media connectivity, community support and self-expression, but the other 24 and a half pages, Jake, dedicated to the threats that social media is having on the mental health and well-being of children and teens. Jake?
 
TAPPER: Yes. Vanessa Yurkevich great report. Thank you so much. And be sure to tune in, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy is going to be interviewed by my bestie Erin Burnett, that's tonight at 7:00 p.m. Eastern. Do not miss it.
 
Joining us now is Andrea Bonior. She is a clinical psychologist. She's the leads in house clinical psychologist. She's been helping us talking to our viewers throughout COVID. And now you're here to talk about the effects of social media, the surgeon general wants lawmakers of big tech to take action protect kids from the harmful effects. Parents can't wait for Congress and big tech to take action. People watching at home right now parents, caregivers, what should they do?
 
ANDREA BONIOR, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: I think we have to start small. I think as a parent myself, it feels so overwhelming. It feels like the ship has already sailed, that it's so impossible to set limits with our kids because of what their friends are doing and what the schools expect. 
 
Oh, you got to have a smartphone for this app. I think we have to start small and say we can make small changes. OK, no phones at dinner. OK, you're not going to sleep with your phone in your room. OK, we're going to have a two-hour period at night where everybody is screen free. And we've got to practice what we preach as well, because our kids are looking at our own behavior.
 
TAPPER: Yes. I'm the worst. I'm the absolute worst, but it's for work. It's for work. It's different. It's different.
 
BONIOR: It's true. And I always try to tell my kids hey, this is why I know it's so hard. Because you see how I struggle with it as well. We're in this together. But it's particularly hard for young brains to be taking all this in.
 
TAPPER: So what do you tell a kid who says that social media is making them feel worse about themselves either because of body image or whatever, whatever the reasons are, but they can't wean themselves from it. They just can't because they feel left out.
 
BONIOR: Yes, I think it's really important that we validate that that we say it's kind of designed to make you compare yourself, to make you feel like you're missing out. So if you feel worse, that's normal, that actually means that things probably are working right with you. So let's take some concrete steps, let's say make it a goal just tomorrow, that after dinner, when you do your homework, you're going to keep your screen aside, or you could get them to observe themselves even more.
 
So not just I feel worse, but why? Because not all on screen behavior is created equal, right? So we really need to get these kids thinking about what they notice, OK? When I do this online, it makes me feel maybe more connected. But when I do this, or I follow this person or I'm exposed to this
 
 account, it makes me feel more lonely and more stressed. So get them to observe and then again, it's about those small concrete steps they can make a difference if they're sustainable.
 
TAPPER: Dr. Bonior, it's always great to have you thank you so much. Really appreciate it. And good to see you in person.
 
BONIOR: Yes.
 <br>[17:45:00]

Coming up, will the City of Brotherly Love get its first woman mayor, we're going to talk to the Democratic candidate who defied the odds and is now poised to make history in the greatest city in the world. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
TAPPER: In our Politics Lead, former Philadelphia City Councilwoman Cherelle Parker won the Democratic nomination to be the 100th Mayor of the City of Brotherly Love that was one week ago today, define what many thought would be a very close race and putting her on track to become the city's first woman mayor. 
 
She joins us live for her first national interview since winning the Democratic primary. Congratulations Ms. Parker. It's a -- it was -- I read a lot about the race. And a lot of people thought a lot of other candidates were going to get there and it wasn't really even particularly close.
 <br>[17:50:20]
 
CHERELLE PARKER (D), PHILADELPHIA MAYORAL CANDIDATE: Well, listen, I'm excited to be here, Jake, because this is my first appearance. And I was not able to celebrate with many of my supporters on election night, I had a dental emergency picture that one, I want to say that together, we did it, Philadelphia, and I'm excited to be here.
 
TAPPER: Winning the nomination, the Democratic nomination in a city that's like seven to one Democrats means you're very likely to be elected mayor. Why do you think you were able to win decisively in this crowded field against candidates that were better funded, more progressive, et cetera?
 
PARKER: Well, Jacob, I'll tell you, I've really leaned heavily into my real life, lived experience and people often hurt me state that my lived experience is closest to the people who are feeling the most pain in our city the most pain of gun violence and neighborhood blighted, struggling schools and lack of opportunity. But now, Jake, without win, in me, these communities are now closest to the power.
 
TAPPER: Well, as you know, a better than I, crime is a real issue in Philly. And you talked about it a lot on the campaign trail. And you've actually been compared to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, in some ways. Do you think politically that you and Mayor Adams are getting Democrats a blueprint on how to talk about crime and issue that a lot of Democrats have been criticized for playing defense on?
 
PARKER: Well, Jake, listen, I let the nation be the judge of that. What I can tell you is that I was adamant about not allowing anyone to put me in an ideological box relative to what I believe was the prescription that we needed to employ to ensure that Philadelphia was the safest, cleanest and greenest big city in the nation. And the reason why we were able to do that is because our message was developed from the ground up.
 
You know, it wasn't, you know, I know what's best for use people policymaking. It was the people saying we deserve to have police accountability. But we also want a proactive law enforcement presence in our community with people who are sworn to protect and serve us get to know us. And they are not there simply in response to a 911 call. They wanted a comprehensive approach. And that's the message that we deliver.
 
TAPPER: You've an -- you've expressed an openness to the controversial policing tactic called Stop and Frisk. Critics say it allows police to target minorities, it doesn't work. Why are you willing to consider it?
 
PARKER: Let me first, Jake, state for the record that Philadelphia is not legally allowed to engage in unconstitutional stop and frisk. I am the author of the legislation that formally and officially gave Philadelphians a voice in that issue. What I do support are called Terry Stops. It means that law enforcement must know that a crime has been committed will be committed or is actively taking place. And they must have just calls and reasonable suspicion in order to stop someone.
 
Listen, I am a black woman who's lived my life at the intersection of race and gender. I am a working mother working single mother to a 10- year-old black boy. We will never go back to the days where law enforcement thinks that they could just stop me or a black man randomly just because of our race and our ethnicity. 
 
We will have zero tolerance for any misuse and abuse of authority by law enforcement. But we will make sure that our police department has every tool necessary to make our public safety, our number one priority.
 
TAPPER: Well, congratulations on your victory hard fought. And if you do win, maybe I'll talk to you before then. But if you do win, please take care of my sweet, sweet city, Philadelphia. It's such a special place. Philadelphia --
 
PARKER: Jake, listen, you have to come back. Come back. Jake. TAPPER: I was just there a couple of weekends ago. My mom's there. I'm there all the time. I'll see you there in person, Democratic Mayoral Candidate Cherelle Parker, thank you so much and congratulations again.
 
Coming up, Ford won't kill the radio star after all. We'll explain next. But first your CNN's Wolf Blitzer with what's next in this Situation Room. Wolf?
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Jake, we're following some major developments right now out of Russia and Ukraine. I'll ask the former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta about Moscow's latest claim that its fighter jets intercepted two U.S. military aircraft approaching the Russian border.
 <br>[17:55:09]
 
All of this comes amid attacks on Russian soil, which are causing a lot of anger and confusion inside the Kremlin. Local officials are blaming Ukraine, but anti-Putin to Russian nationals are taking credit for the latest incursion all of that much more coming up right at the top of the hour right here in the situation.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
TAPPER: From Cherelle Parker to Joel Embiid, everyone in Philly knows that jingle. It's an A.M. jingle. And now that sound will still be available in new Ford vehicles. Ford is going to keep A.M. radio in its 2023 Mustang Mach-E and F-150 lightning electric pickups earlier. The carmaker said it was going to drop A.M. radio because it interferes with its electric vehicles. 
 
And because data showed fewer than 5 percent of Ford drivers listens to A.M. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed the A.M. for Every Vehicle Act mandating the car manufacturers include A.M. radio in new cars at no extra cost because A.M. radio is vital to public safety. Will KYW News Radio is sure. I'll say that.
