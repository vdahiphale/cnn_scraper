MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN ANCHOR: Another one, what else do we have? "I'm unaffiliated voted for reasons you stated. But the fact that you are taking Sinema's party change at face value is laughable. She's playing the Rs while trying to pretend she's not."
 
Look, even if she's cynical and just wants to survive primary season. I think it's a great thing. We need more Is. I can't wait to say the Is have it. See you next week.
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. It is Saturday, December 10. I'm Amara Walker.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, Amara. I'm Boris Sanchez. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. And we're grateful to have you.
 
WALKER: And this morning, we begin with shock and grief in the sports world. Prominent journalist Grant Wahl, a beloved ambassador for soccer has passed away while covering the World Cup in Qatar.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. We still don't know the exact cause of his death. But witnesses say that he collapsed during yesterday's match between Argentina and the Netherlands. Qatari officials say that he fell inside the press area and immediately received medical treatment.
 
WALKER: Just a few weeks ago, Wahl made headlines after being detained and briefly refused entry to a World Cup match because he was wearing a rainbow t-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights. Earlier this morning, we spoke with Dave Zirin, sports editor for The Nation who says while wasn't being content -- wasn't content, just being a journalist.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVE ZIRIN, SPORTS EDITOR, THE NATION: He believed in advocacy. You know, he didn't believe in the idea that you just sort of, you know, stayed on the side of the room and, you know, wrote down everybody's point of view. And we're basically a stenographer for power, particularly in a structure like soccer, which is so vertical and so dominated by FIFA, and so dominated by corruption and secrecy.
 
That Grant, despite his love of soccer, was never content to just love the beautiful game or be a violin player for the beautiful game. He was somebody who always wanted the game to be better. And he wanted to root out corruption.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: Grant Wahl's wife is someone you may recognize, Dr. Celine Gounder, she's a former CNN Contributor and Infectious Disease Specialist. And she posted this on Twitter writing, quote, "I am so thankful for the support of my husband, Grant Wahl's soccer family, and have so many friends who've reached out tonight. I am in complete shock."
 
Let's take you to Doha, Qatar now with CNN Sports Anchor, Amanda Davies. She joins us now live. Amanda, what more do we know about the circumstances surrounding Grant Wahl's death?
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes, I mean, that shock that you're talking about absolutely reverberating around the tournament here in Doha. And really what is emerging is that we knew Grant had said on his podcast during a number of interviews that when he arrived here in Doha, somewhat three weeks ago, he wasn't at the top of his health, he was struggling with the tightness of his chest and chest pains.
 
Got to the point he had gone to a medical center where he had received some antibiotics. He thought that we're going to be treating him for bronchitis and he felt a little bit better. But ultimately, as we know, as has been reported, into extra time of the quarterfinal last night at the Lusail Stadium between the Netherlands and Argentina.
 
He collapsed. Medical help treated him for 20 to 25 minutes. He ultimately was then taken to hospital via an ambulance and it was there. He was declared dead. The FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the FIFA Director of Communications Bryan Swanson, a former journalist who himself has known Grant over the years, were at the hospital with another couple of members of the press community who Grant had been sharing a house with here in Doha, that was at about 4:00 this morning.
 
FIFA offering their support as have the Qatar 2022 Organizing Committee as well. But really, really that the shock waves being felt not only here in the football -- 
 
WALKER: All right. I think we lost Amanda Davies.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
WALKER: But really as he was a beloved figure, and there's been so much outpouring of support and really grief for this man who everyone said was a preeminent American soccer journalist, but someone who also embraced many other causes and use his platform in that way. Amanda Davies, thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, we'll definitely hear from those close to Grant Wahl as the day goes on. So stay tuned to CNN for that.
 
Meantime, focusing on news out of the United States, a federal judge has refused a request by the Department of Justice to hold former President Donald Trump in contempt of court for failing to turn over classified documents.
 <br>[10:05:09]
 
Sources tell CNN that after a 90-minute closed door hearing, the judge urged members of Trump's team and the DOJ to resolve the matter themselves. That decision comes as a special prosecutor waste charges against Donald Trump.
 
Here with us to share his legal insights is former federal prosecutor Shan Wu. Shan, good morning. Always great to see you on a Saturday. What do you make of this decision, this request by the Justice Department to hold Donald Trump in contempt of court? Is that a typical request and what do you make of the judge's decision?
 
SHAN WU, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: There's nothing about any of this that has been typical, Boris. It was a sealed hearing, so we don't really have any public understanding of exactly what kind of colloquies went on. But here's what's unusual about it. This was a contempt request, because Trump and his team hadn't complied with a grand jury subpoena issued months ago.
 
And then not only had there been a grand jury subpoena issued, but there'd been a search warrant on top of that. So you can infer from this that these two sides are the great impasse and the Justice Department is in quite a predicament. They are, obviously, very concerned about safeguarding these very sensitive materials.
 
So one can understand that they don't know where to look, because the Trump team doesn't even have someone they'll designate as the Custodian of Records. And it really just indicates that there's no custody of these records. No one knows where they are, and that's a tough situation. The department was asking the judge to try and do some work for them. And the judge said, up to you folks to figure it out.
 
SANCHEZ: So what do you think the next moves will be from the DOJ?
 
WU: They could try to do additional search warrants. They probably would have probable cause in my estimate, I mean, I'm not privy to what they know. But certainly, a normal situation where you have probable cause to search somebody's one residence for things they may have stolen, you'd naturally look in other places, too.
 
They could also just decide, OK, do we have enough to charge somebody right now and see if they might flip somebody once they charge them. But right now, if they're really on a hunt to secure those documents, they don't know where to look. I mean, just recently, they're having -- Trump's own attorneys doing the searching for them a little bit unusual at this stage of the game.
 
And apparently two more documents turned up at a GSA warehouse facility that Trump had been using. So looking from the outside, it seems like they're really at a difficult situation in terms of trying to locate and safeguard any remaining missing documents.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, like you said, not much of this is usual. On the January 6 committee front tomorrow, the panel's meeting to discuss criminal referrals, which could include Donald Trump, but CNN is also reporting that a number of other officials could see referrals as well. Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump lawyer John Eastman, former DOJ Official Jeffrey Clark, Rudy Giuliani, also under consideration. How serious do you think the DOJ would take these referrals if they're made by the committee?
 
WU: Well, I think that will take them very seriously. I mean, as a legal matter, the committee doesn't have any leverage on DOJ. And sometimes DOJ looks at referrals from members of Congress with a slight grain of salt. But obviously, this committee has done an enormous amount of substantive work.
 
And what I'm looking for is whether the committee's referral itself may give DOJ more of a roadmap in trying to shepherd their way through the enormous amount of evidence that the committee has put together. And that could be quite valuable for the department because, frankly, they were a little bit late to this dance.
 
SANCHEZ: And Shan, one more question about something that happened overnight. The defeated Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, she filed a lawsuit in Arizona Superior Court challenging the certification of the state's election. As we all know, Kari Lake is an unrepentant election denier. Is there any merit that you see to this lawsuit?
 
WU: I really doubt that. As with many of these sort of Trump enabling type people parroting his law stolen from the type of lie, she was someone who was willing to say that any outcome except one in which she wins is going to be fraudulent. So like many of these suits, I think this is going to go down in flames to a quick defeat. There just doesn't seem to be any merit to it whatsoever.
 
SANCHEZ: Appreciate all your perspective. Shan Wu, thanks so much.
 
WU: Good to see you.
 
WALKER: Interest rates are headed higher as the Federal Reserve keeps up its effort to tame inflation. The Fed meets this coming week and it is the last meeting of the year. CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans has a preview.
 <br>[10:10:05]
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Amara and Boris, a big week is in store for the U.S. economy, the final Federal Reserve Board meeting of the year. The central bank is expected to raise rates one more time before the new year. So far, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rates six times this year in its fight to control inflation, inflation running at a 40-year high.
 
Inflation is still issue number one for the Fed and for consumers. Gas prices are down almost 50 cents over the past month. It's about 10 bucks less to fill up an SUV, for example. And Adobe Analytics reports online prices actually fell in November, huge price cutting for Black Friday and Cyber week sales.
 
But it is too early to declare victory over inflation. Wholesale prices in November rose 7.4 percent compared to a year earlier. That's down from the revised 8.1 percent in October. Fed Chief Jerome Powell has indicated that smaller interest rate increases may be on the horizon. The Fed is committed to raising interest rates and keeping them there until inflation is under control.
 
Boris, Amara?
 
WALKER: Christine, thank you.
 
So a major winter storm, it is moving across the western United States. And it's expected to bring heavy coastal rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest in California.
 
SANCHEZ: Let's get a look at your forecast now with CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar. She's live at the CNN Weather Center with more. Allison, it's not just the West Coast that's going to be impacted, a big chunk of the country could see pieces of the storm.
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, this system will eventually make its way all across from coast to coast. So even if you don't live in the West per se, you are going to end up having some impacts from the storm in the coming days.
 
But let's begin where the storm is right now. You can see some heavy rains settling in across areas of Washington including Seattle, also areas of Portland. And then we're also taking a look at Northern California because we're really starting to see a lot of that inundation of the very heavy rainfall, specifically around Crescent City. And then once you get into those higher elevations, you've got the snow coming down.
 
And in some places, it's coming down in 3 inches per hour, which is going to lead to incredibly high amounts of snow totals once the system is all said and done. That's why you've got all these winter weather alerts not only in the western states, but also some in the central U.S. because that's where the storm is going to be headed in the coming days.
 
When it's all said and done, this system is going to start to shift down to the south by the latter half of the weekend, and then gradually begin to make its way across the U.S., crossing into the central portion eventually into the Midwest and then into the Northeast. In the short term, however, we talked about the impressive snowfall amounts.
 
Most of these areas when you talk about the intermountain west, the Rockies, the Cascades you're likely talking 6 to 12 inches of snow. But the Sierras now you're talking 3 to 5 feet of snow in total before this system finally exits.
 
Here's a look at that system as it continues to make its way towards the central U.S., and by Monday, Tuesday looking at potential blizzard conditions in the northern plains and severe storms in the South.
 
SANCHEZ: Allison Chinchar, thank you so much for the update.
 
Up next, as a Democratic senator leaves the party, it is a critical week that lies ahead for Congress. We have details on the sticking points that could lead to a partial government shutdown.
 
WALKER: Plus, some cities are now recommending masks again as flu, RSV and COVID combine to push hospitals near capacity. Plus, the coast of California is about to be home to some massive offshore wind farms. It could generate enough power from more than 1.5 million homes, but there are some critics of the project, we'll explain.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:17:42]
 
SANCHEZ: President Biden is set to sign the Respect for Marriage Act into law soon after it passed the House this week. It takes steps to protect same sex marriage as well as interracial marriage. CNN's Jason Carroll sat down with one couple to discuss the importance of this step and the fight for equality that still lies ahead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Now that the Respect for Marriage Act will become law of the land., Marcia Kadish and her wife Kristin Sawyer say they finally have cause to celebrate.
 
MARCIA KADISH, WIFE: Hurray.
 
KRISTIN SAWYER, WIFE: Hurray. To tell the truth. I never thought I would see gay marriage legalized in our lifetime.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You may kiss.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): The two have been married now for about two years, but Kadish earned a place in U.S. history for her previous marriage in 2004.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I now pronounce that you are married.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): That's the year she wed Tanya McCloskey at Cambridge City Hall in Massachusetts. And in doing so, the two became the first same sex couples to be legally married in the United States. McCloskey died in 2016 after battling cancer.
 
(on-camera): Do you recognize your place in history, being really the first?
 
KADISH: You guys remind me a lot? I don't think about it until it's brought up. I'm proud of it.
 
CARROLL (on-camera): OK.
 
KADISH: Very. And I'm glad that I can speak out whenever about, you know, gay marriage and just being gay.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): It wasn't that long ago when speaking out about gay marriage was an unpopular idea. Kadish remembers the mood of the country back in 2004.
 
KADISH: You know, my business where I worked, how many disapproving faces I saw once I got married.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): No surprise, polling in 2004 showed most disapproved of gay marriage, with just 40 percent supporting it. Now 70 percent of Americans are behind it.
 
(on-camera): What kind of a road has it been to get to where you are now?
 
SAWYER: The long one.
 
KADISH: Yes.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): A road marked by numerous events over several decades. The Stonewall Riots back in 1969, led by gay and trans people of color like Marsha P. Johnson, the push for same civil unions during the 90s. States striking down laws opposing same unions in the early 2000s
 <br>[10:20:11]
 
CARROLL (voice-over): People like Edith Windsor, who in 2013, successfully challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Even as gay people cheered, each milestone, some such as Wyoming Republican Dan Zwonitzer wasn't sure the country would get to where it is.
 
DAN ZWONITZER (R), WYOMING STATE LEGISLATOR: We've just seen I think, some partisan divides and splits. And if you're a Republican, you have to believe this. If you're a Democrat, you have to believe that.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): Zwonitzer has been married to his husband for four years. They have two children. He's been in office representing Eastern Cheyenne since 2005. And has defeated several anti-LGBTQ bills in the state.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): I do think marriage is a state right. And so, in my perfect world, right, every state would take that step to codify same sex marriage, and it shouldn't have to be a federal issue.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): There is still concern among those who support gay rights. This after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade this past summer. They now worry gay marriage could be next. And while the Respect for Marriage Act legally protects same sex marriage, gay Americans, including younger ones, such as Leighton Jordan, say there is still a lot of work ahead.
 
LATEN JORDAN, LGBTQ + ACTIVIST, HOWARD UNIVERSITY: I definitely do not think the fight is over. There is so much more to be done to protect rights more broadly, just beyond same sex marriage.
 
CARROLL (voice-over): Marcia Kadish and Kristin Sawyer say they know the fight is not over. But they also know how far they have come.
 
Jason Carroll, CNN, Boston.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WALKER: All right on Capitol Hill, the deadline to avoid a government shutdown is just six days away. And to keep bill to fund the military is also on the negotiating table. The National Defense Authorization Act accounts for $858 billion in funding including aid to Ukraine, NATO and Taiwan. And House Republicans got a provision included in their version to resend the COVID vaccine mandate for members of the military. It is up for a vote in the Senate this week.
 
All right, joining us now to talk more about the big political picture here is CNN Political Commentator, Bakari Sellers and Kristin Davison, who is a Republican Strategist. Welcome to you both. All right, so let's start with, you know, the immediate Kristin, because we've seen this movie over and over every year right on time, the last minute scrambled to pass government spending bills, and they often end in the stop gap measures. What are the risks of a short-term extension this time around?
 
KRISTIN DAVISON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, I think it's frustrating for Americans who elect leaders to go to Washington to legislate and lead and not have that constant Christmas surprise at the end of the year hoping to keep the government funding. And really the leadership comes from the top. It comes from President Biden. He's really seen a lack of leadership from the White House so far in his term, and from Democrats in the Senate and in the House.
 
And I think that's why Americans in this midterm election, flip the House to give Republicans power. And I think the risk here is that the leaders who are in charge don't actually deliver and get things done to keep this constant anxiety of, you know, government funding and last-minute bills to try to keep the lights on.
 
WALKER: Bakari, I'm sure you agree with the lack of leadership comment from the top?
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: No, that was the first time I've heard anybody have a rosy outlook on the way that Republicans performed this past November 8, I believe it was, because everybody knows they will wholeheartedly reject it for the most part. Look, the fact is, I think we have to do this pretty quickly. And the reason we have to do this quickly is because you have a Republican House Majority coming in that many people are unsure and uneasy about the way that they will lead.
 
We know that Kevin McCarthy doesn't even have, you know, the full number of votes necessary to become Speaker of the House and has a fraction of the -- of his own caucus that is going to prove to be quite difficult. And so, I think there's going to be a great deal of angst about getting this done as soon as you possibly can.
 
And I don't disagree. Many Americans do have an R. They don't understand the inside, the beltway politics, that is the debt limit. They don't understand, you know, raising the debt ceiling and things of that sort. And so it's incumbent upon our leaders in Washington, D.C. to get these things done. That's why they're sent there.
 
WALKER: You know, I do want to switch gears quickly and Bakari, you know, talk about Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, as you know, was dropping the Democratic Party and registering as an independent and obviously that means that she won't have a Democratic primary challenger in 2024 if she runs again.
 
An analysis by CNN Zachary Wolf calls it a defection without a difference. In practicality that seems true. But should the Democrats learn something from Sinema leaving the party?
 <br>[10:25:01]
 
SELLERS: No, absolutely nothing to learn from that. It is a defection without a difference, it's still 51-49 for those individuals who are concerned. Kyrsten Sinema did this for one reason, one reason, I don't think that's Kyrsten Sinema. I think everybody understands that Ruben Gallego was going to challenge her in a democratic primary in Arizona when she was going to have a great deal of difficulty winning.
 
And so what do you do to avoid a Democratic primary challenge, you turn the independents, so maybe you can make it straight to the general. The problem though is that, you know, now that gives somebody like a Kari Lake an opportunity, a chance to swing through and maybe make it to the United States ended in the 2024 elections. We shall see how that shakes out. But Kyrsten Sinema, I want to be extremely clear did this for one reason, and one reason only, and that is for Kyrsten Sinema.
 
WALKER: Got it. And Kristin, we were just talking about this, that the speakership bid by Kevin McCarthy, and if you just look at the big pictures for the Republicans, I mean, it seems like things seem to be in disarray, at least intraparty wise, right, especially after coming off the heels of Walker's loss to Warnock here in Georgia.
 
Now you've got this battle playing out between, you know, hardline conservatives and those who are pro-Kevin McCarthy. Can you talk big picture here in terms of, you know, what's happening in terms of the finger pointing and, you know, where Republicans see the direction of the party going in?
 
DAVISON: Sure. You know, I think we can say disarray, Republicans, but let's just be clear, Kyrsten Sinema was it -- she didn't leave the party, she was chased out. So the far progressive wing of the Democrat Party, not only chased the senator into the bathroom over the Build Back Better bill to, you know, strong arm her into supporting a progressive agenda. They're really going to chase her out of the party.
 
And so I think when we talk about disarray, everyone likes to say that Republicans are the only ones that have family dinner table arguments, but this has happened on both sides. And I think what the broader message here is, is that extremes on both sides are not palatable for the American people. It's not good for the long-term health of either party.
 
But on the Republican side, we talked about Walker losing to Warnock but let's look at the entire election. You had Governor Brian Kemp have a dominating win over the Democrat star, Stacey Abrams. And so, when we want to say, what does the Herschel Walker defeat mean for the future of the Republican Party, I'd rather say what is the Brian Kemp win mean?
 
How does that that grow our base in, you know, Governor Kemp did better in the suburban counties between five and eight points, versus the Republican nominee for Senate? And so, I think, well, you know, when you bring people together, it's really -- you want to bring people into the tent, not kick them out, like we just saw in Arizona.
 
WALKER: Quickly, we do have to go but Bakari, do want to give your - the last word? I saw you reacting to what Kristin had to say.
 
SELLERS: No, I just -- No, I think that's amazing spin. I have to give kudos for that. I mean, look, Herschel Walker, Dr. Oz, you have Blake Masters, and no one's going to say they were great candidates. Democrats had an amazing showing. And if Republicans don't want to learn any lessons from their Senate candidates and the way they ran this cycle, then so be it.
 
Please, I always say we want Romney, Ronna Romney. McDaniel and we want Donald Trump in 2024. Keep them as long as possible.
 
WALKER: Was it candidate quality? Was it the money? Yes, a lot of things to think about moving forward. Kristin Davidson, Bakari Sellers. Thank you both.
 
DAVISON: Thanks.
 
SANCHEZ: Still ahead, a powering America using floating wind turbines. Up next, a closer look at an idea that five companies are paying big bucks to make a reality.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:33:03]
 
SANCHEZ: Five companies have agreed to pay the federal government more than $750 million for the right to build floating wind turbines off the coast of California. The White House auctioned off these rights this week in a major step toward the administration's goal of promoting renewable energy sources. WALKER: And we are now joined by CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir. It's great to see you this morning, Bill. I mean, it sounds like there was quite a lot of interest in this auction that's, I would think, a good sign. Walk us through these developments.
 
 BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so just for context, when the Biden administration announced all of these lease sales, there were about 5,000 offshore wind turbines in Europe, and the United States had seven. So we're barely out of the Wright Brothers garage in this country when it comes to offshore wind.
 
There was a $4 billion plus sale earlier this year for New Jersey and New York sites that'll generate enough electricity for about 1.5 million people. But what's happening on the West Coast is sort of a bigger investment upfront, because they're talking about floating turbines. And this is next generation that you don't have to mount to the seafloor, which is hugely expensive. And there are other prototypes that might be able to actually as they float capture wave energy at the same time, as it captures wind energy.
 
But again, this is -- we're just at the beginning, the cusp of this. And the International Energy Agency, not exactly a bunch of, you know, tree hugging liberals who have long sort of underplayed renewables as an energy source put out a report this week that says it's going to explode. Solar and wind is now so cheap, that more will be put online in the next five years than in the last 15.
 
SANCHEZ: That's fascinating and great news for the environment as well. Bill, while we have you, I wanted to ask about this. Bipartisan group of senators sending a letter to the USDA asking for more help to mitigate the drought crisis for western farmers, a subject you've reported extensively on. The population out west though, continues to boom. It's not slowing down and that's straining resources that have already been depleted.
 <br>[10:35:03]
 
WEIR: Yes, it's interesting. A new study looked at migration and a lot of folks are sort of fleeing the hot, stifling, persistent temperatures, but they're moving to the wildfire zones in the West, and Hurricane Alley down in Florida. Because I think, especially for retirees, if you're really thinking about sunshine and low taxes, if you're moving to Florida, not sort of once in a lifetime events. But until you've touched that hot stove, you don't know how painful it's going to be.
 
I was just down in Florida this week reporting on the fact that Ian, either drowned or crushed almost 2 billion honeybees. Florida is the epicenter of the honey bee business, which then pollinates crops around the country. And they're worried that the drought in California could crash the almond crop, which would then crash the beekeeping industry because they depend on that cash crop.
 
So as the sort of climate crisis collide, we're seeing new effects, new strains and different places in the economy. But those hopefully, who are moving to these places that are more vulnerable, are going in with eyes open.
 
WALKER: Yes.
 
WEIR: And are doing so, you know, fully preparing themselves financially, physically and mentally for the heightened risk in those spots.
 
WALKER: It's really incredible just how much climate change impacts so many factors in our lives and our livelihoods. So many cross sections there. Bill Weir, appreciate you for joining us. Thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: Thanks, Will.
 
WEIR: Good to see you, guys.
 
SANCHEZ: Of course. Officials are putting out a warning this weekend that holiday gatherings could put additional stress on hospitals as beds are filling up with flu cases. The major city now encouraging people to mask up indoors and around crowds outside, when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:51]
 
SANCHEZ: This morning hospitals in the United States are now the fullest they've been since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 80 percent of beds are in use nationwide. The last time hospital beds were this full was back in January at the height of the Omicron surge.
 
WALKER: And more places are starting to take precautions. Seattle and New York City have both issued advisories urging residents to wear masks indoors again. CNN's Brynn Gingras is here and has more on these masks again, indoors. What's going on?
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hey, guys. Good morning. So you mentioned that 80 percent of hospital beds full. Well listen, about 6 percent of those are actually from COVID-19. So yes, that virus is certainly going up, so is RSV.
 
But the biggest issue that this country is seeing are the number of flu cases. I want to give you another statistic to swallow here. 100,000 people out of 100,000 people, 26 hospitalizations are for flu. That is a very big number, actually the biggest number that the CDC has seen in more than the last decade.
 
But again, it's these three viruses that are circulating across the country, really surging. Only seven states in this country are not at a high or very high alert right now. And so that's why you're seeing some cities like New York City, Seattle saying, hey, listen, let's maybe take the masks back out. Issuing an advisory, not a mandate and saying if you are immunocompromised, if you're feeling sick, if you're 65 years and older, maybe put the mask back on certainly when you're indoors, certainly if you're in crowds to stop the spread of this virus because, of course, we are now entering the end of the year holiday season, and then into the new year. SANCHEZ: And Brynn, there's also a shortage of children's painkillers in stores across the country.
 
GINGRAS: Yes, this is so important to so many parents out there. Amara, I don't know if you've experienced this, but certainly I have with just finding children's Tylenol in certain areas.
 
WALKER: Yes.
 
GINGRAS: It's an issue. It's not widespread, but it's an issue. If you're feeling it, it's a big issue, right? So, what we're hearing is that manufacturers are trying to boost up these products and get the supplies out to areas where the demand is major. So that is happening.
 
In addition to that the FDA is sort of stepping in, talking to pharmacists and saying, hey, here's different ways that you can create antibiotics for kids if you're running out of certain things. And also guys, I really think it's important to point out, go to CNN.com because our health team has put together a number of tips if you are a parent who isn't able to find certain medications, there some ideas of what maybe you can do to help your child in the immediate future. So that's a good idea.
 
WALKER: I'm so going to go there. And Brynn, I'm so glad you talked about the shortage because I was in California two weeks ago, when I sent my kids were sick -- sent my dad to get Tylenol, he went to a CVS or Rite Aid and to target and couldn't find it. And I was like, what's going on here, must just be the area. And then I set my brother was in a different county and he still couldn't find any as well. So I was like, what's going on?
 
GINGRAS: And it's a very simple necessity when you're a mom. I know that.
 
WALKER: Right? I mean -- 
 
GINGRAS: I got to stock up.
 
WALKER: Right, right. You need at least two or three in your medicine cabinet because you know how often these kids get sick.
 
GINGRAS: Right.
 
WALKER: Brynn Gingras, appreciate it. Thank you so much.
 
GINGRAS: Yes, of course.
 
WALKER: So a measles outbreak in central Ohio is growing this morning. So far, more than 60 children across several counties have become sick with many of them needing to be hospitalized.
 
SANCHEZ: Notably, none of the kids had been fully vaccinated. CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard has more.
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: We're learning that because of how widespread this outbreak is and how infectious measles is. It could take a few months before this outbreak gets under control. That's what Lori Tremmel Freeman, the head of the National Association of County and City Health Officials told me.
 
And we're learning that this outbreak is really being driven by a lack of vaccination. Columbus public health officials have confirmed that as of Friday, among 64 measles cases total in this outbreak so far, 61 were unvaccinated. The remaining three were partially vaccinated. That means they completed only one of the two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine needed to be fully vaccinated.
 
Also 25 of the total cases have been hospitalized, all cases are in children with the majority 70 percent being in ages one to five.
 <br>[10:45:11]
 
Now Columbus public health officials are urging parents to get their young kids vaccinated if they aren't already, because this is just one example of what can happen when children are not up to date on their childhood immunizations, which gives a highly contagious virus like measles, the opportunity to spread within a community.
 
Measles is so infectious, that if one infected person coughs or sneezes in a room, the virus can live for up to two hours in the air, even after that person leaves the room. Back to you.
 
WALKER: That is a stark warning. Thank you so much.
 
It is one of the most storied rivalries in college football. But there's more to the match between Army and Navy. We're going to go live to Philadelphia for the kickoff next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:34]
 
WALKER: It is the best rivalry in all of sports. Army and Navy take the football field for the 123 time this afternoon.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, but the rivalry goes beyond the grid iron for one family in particular. Coy Wire is live where it's from Philadelphia with more on that. Good morning, Coy.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Hi boys in Amarillo going back 130 years Army Navy game is one of the greatest traditions and rivalries in all of sports and highlights some of the brightest most inspiring young men and women, our future leaders, defenders of this nation. They commit their lives to service for all of us.
 
And, you know, while these academies deeply respect each other, they want to win this game pretty badly. On this one Saturday afternoon, it is on in the Crossfield Brothers find themselves in quite a predicament. Jim here represents the Naval Academy, a senior. Robert is at Army, he's a senior as well.
 
House divided indeed. What are you majoring in, Robert? And what are you looking to do in the future? ROBERT CROSSFIELD, WEST POINT CADET, CLASS OF 2023: So I'm going to Organizational Psychology major right now and upon graduation and commissioning, I'll going to be a second lieutenant in the Army and I'll be a Fifth Artillery Officer.
 
WIRE: Jim, how about you?
 
JIM CROSSFIELD, NAVY MIDSHIPMAN, CLASS OF 203: I'm a robotics and control engineer and upon graduation I'm going to be a Navy pilot, so.
 
WIRE: And what is one of your favorite parts of this rivalry?
 
J. CROSSFIELD: I think my favorite part about the rivalry is like I know how it inspires kids in high school and younger kids and I knew that when I was little I was like that's who I want to be when I grow up, so.
 
WIRE: And Robert, how about you, what makes this rivalry special?
 
R. CROSSFIELD: You know, rivals (ph) as at home, brothers at home and our brothers and arms and so it's pretty special to be part of this tradition when everyone on the field is willing to lay down their life for the outside.
 
WIRE: Now one of the coolest parts in my opinion are all the traditions. Part of that are the uniforms that are made specially for this game. Jim, you're holding Navy's football helmet, it represents the future space, right? You see the moon there on this side. On the other side, you have Bruce McCandless he performed the first untethered spacewalk. He was from the class of 1958 and Naval Academy.
 
And we have over here, you are holding the helmet for Army, this represents the first Armored Division. This is the 80th anniversary of Operation torch, the splattered mud there on the helmet representing those armored vehicles that traveled through North Africa. I have to ask you now, what is it like knowing, what's the worst part knowing your brother attends the enemy's academy?
 
J. CROSSFIELD: Well, all I say is there's a reason there's more Naval Academy grads that are off in space right now, so
 
WIRE: I believe there are 54 astronauts who've come from the Naval Academy. How about you? What's the worst part about knowing your brother chose to go to Naval Academy?
 
R. CROSSFIELD: I mean he's always wanting to take the easy way out so I know this is like obviously like the tours for him. He doesn't like to field too much, he doesn't like to get his hands very dirty. So I think he likes to just look nice and then, you know, sit in the office.
 
WIRE: He does look pretty today. Now you guys dress up well too. But you have a special mission today, right?
 
R. CROSSFIELD: Right. So we're going to be shooting the cannons every time our team beats the hell out of Navy. And, you know, so you're going to see those last go off, I have the car today and really get the energy going.
 
WIRE: We want to thank you both for choosing to serve all of us. Good luck today. When I say go Army, you say?
 
R. CROSSFIELD: Beat Navy.
 
WIRE: And when I say go Navy, you say?
 
J. CROSSFIELD: Beat Army.
 
WIRE: There you go. Back to you, Amara and Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: That's amazing. Our thanks to Robert and James Crossfield and to you as well, Coy. Hope you have a great time at the game.
 
WALKER: That extra layer of -- 
 
WIRE: Thank you, guys.
 
WALKER: -- sibling rivalry -- 
 
WIRE: Have a good day.
 
WALKER: -- making things so intense. I think Coy was trying to instigate there but I'm glad that no fists were flying. They're nice brothers.
 
SANCHEZ: As always, never surprises me that Coy is trying to start stuff. I'm not sure if he could still hear us, but he definitely tried to rile them up. Can he?
 
WALKER: Yes. I don't know that he can. I think he just pulled out his earpiece. But, yes, he just want to take responsibility.
 
Well, that's our time, everyone. Thanks so much for watching. There is more ahead and the next hour of Newsroom. Fredricka Whitfield is up next.
