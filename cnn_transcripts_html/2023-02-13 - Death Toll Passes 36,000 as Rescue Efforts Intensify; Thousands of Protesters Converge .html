BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: I'm Becky Anderson. Hello and welcome back to "Connect the World" live from the World Government Summit 
 
 here in Dubai. This hour an annual conference where leaders across the business and political world gathered to discuss future trends in 
 
 technology and in global finance.
 
Last hour, I spoke to the Head of the International Finance Corporation a member of the World Bank about improving economic development through 
 
 private sector funding where hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets are under management.
 
He told me unsurprisingly that the state of our global economy in the post- COVID pandemic in the mid Russia's invasion of Ukraine is discouraging and hampering investments in places that need it most, more on that is just 
 
 ahead.
 
First up, though our top story this hour the massive earthquake in Turkey and Syria has now claimed more than 36,000 lives. Search crews are still 
 
 finding survivors. Here you see them pulling a 13-year-old boy from the rubble.
 
He was rescued 182 hours after that initial quake Monday last week. But hopefully finding more people alive diminish with each passing hour. Well, 
 
 a short time ago the UN Aid Chief said the rescue phase of the earthquake response is now coming to a close.
 
Meanwhile, aid from other countries is arriving. Qatar says it will send 10,000 mobile homes to Syria and Turkey just the latest in its effort. The 
 
 homes were originally used during December's World Cup. Well, the quake's massive death toll on the region is staggering. In Turkey CNN's Sara Sidner 
 
 found despair but also remarkably still signs of hope and inspiration have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): 38 year old Kudret Kocebeler (ph) desperately pleads with volunteer rescuers to search for her husband 
 
 Badir. He's buried she says in their corner apartment which is somewhere under this rubble.
 
They tried to console her but this mother of twins wants action, not words. There is nobody out there. It's been six days I'm waiting here with my 
 
 twins standing in the cold. She says she's been asking anyone who will listen to dig her husband out but for six days she says officials kept 
 
 telling her they needed permission from the government to start on her building.
 
I want my husband back even if he's not alive. She may have accepted his death but can't go on without seeing her husband's body removed for this 
 
 hells cape. My life, my blood, my everything and my best friend in life he left me with my twins here alone.
 
SIDNER (on camera): While she waits for the realities of her husband's death here in this area where you see enormous piles of rubble. These are 
 
 different buildings but you can't really distinguish them because there's just so much destruction. There have been signs of life. A child was found 
 
 here alive after a week in the rubble.
 
SIDNER (voice over): Nurses comfort the girl who they think is three or four years old. She's dehydrated and in shock but alive. This is the moment 
 
 she was rescued her exhausted little body pulled from under the seemingly endless mountains of rubble in Hatay.
 
She was rushed to the makeshift hospital set up in the parking lot of the actual hospital that was evacuated after the earthquake. When she first 
 
 arrived as a mother I felt that she was like my own daughter, this nurse says.
 
SIDNER (on camera): She's cracking up the staff she's talking.
 
SIDNER (voice over): When we walked in the toddler had managed to make the nurses laugh relieved she could talk about a bit.
 
SIDNER (on camera): What is it that she said that made you all laugh? She made all the nurses laugh?
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I met mama.
 
SIDNER (voice over): The word that made all the nurses laugh was mama and I'm hungry. I want to eat something.
 
SIDNER (on camera): What did that do to your heart when she said Mama?
 
SIDNER (voice over): I felt a great pulse in my heart she says. No one knew her name and when they asked she said dada. It turns out this toddler does 
 
 not speak Turkish she speaks Arabic rescuers later tell us she is Syrian.
 
SIDNER (on camera): We have now learned eight days since the initial earthquake hit and collapsed the building that the woman you saw there 
 
 Kudret who was waiting for her husband begging to find him while he's been found. But he has been found dead and now she has to very burry him, back 
 
 to you.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Sara Sidner reporting there. Well, the Head of Istanbul Social Services pleading for more support. The group says it is getting donations 
 
 but they are not enough. More than 20,000 volunteers are working around the clock to process donations. Our Nada Bashir is at one of the age 
 
 distribution centers in Istanbul.
 
And it is clear now that the President Erdogan's sort of political fate may well rest on his government's response. That is one side of this. The other 
 
 side, of course, is the sort of heartwarming sense you get from the groundswell of support that we are seeing in Istanbul and around the world 
 
 - from around the world. Nada, what are you seeing where you are?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Becky really it is remarkable to see the huge outpouring of support here in Istanbul across Turkey and as you said there 
 
 around the world that we've been at this aid distribution center in Istanbul, one of two main centers really is the heartbeat of that 
 
 humanitarian aid effort here in this city.
 
You can see behind me, the volunteers working there. They form a human chain to get the boxes across into the Turkey. And if you take a look at 
 
 this truck, just next to me, this is the next one to depart. It is already filled with aid ready to depart this warehouse and head towards the - you 
 
 could hear the - take a listen. Take a look.
 
This has been happening every day for the last week. And you can hear the cheering the clapping, people here celebrating another vital aid truck 
 
 leaving the warehouse to head to those most in need. This is one of more than 200 trucks, which is left this warehouse over the last week filled 
 
 with essential items, blankets, clothes, toiletries, electric heaters.
 
And of course, the people that will be receiving this aid are so desperately in need of that humanitarian assistance. The coordinators here, 
 
 this center say that there simply isn't enough. They need more support.
 
They need more aid from the Turkish government and crucially, they need more aid from the international community. They say they do not want to be 
 
 forgotten because of course thousands of families thousands of people are depending on this aid on that support.
 
And of course now, as the search and rescue effort in Southeastern Turkey now shifts to more of a recovery effort, there will be a real emphasis and 
 
 a real focus on providing support to those survivors who have simply lost everything, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. I was saying Gaziantep earlier on in this week, and certainly the scenes there absolutely devastating. And for those who have 
 
 lost everything, a real sense of hopelessness, that part there of the effort then in Turkey to get aid to those who need it most.
 
Let's switch our attention to Syria now because one has to consider that what we are seeing in Turkey completely overshadows what is going on in 
 
 Northwest Syria. The United Nations telling CNN six more of its trucks carrying aid from the World Food Program have crossed into Northwestern 
 
 Syria from Turkey.
 
The UN says the trucks are carrying food and other essentials. If you know from watching this program, a UN official is declared that people in rebel-
 
 held Syria "Feel abandoned" and rightfully so. Well, CNN's Eleni Giokos is here with me for a closer look at that international aid effort and what's 
 
 making its way to the quake disaster zone?
 
The United Nations says it will move aid from government controlled regions in Syria to the countries rebel-held Northwest conceding, frankly and when 
 
 we heard it from the UN Relief Chief himself Martin Griffith said that the UN has failed the people of Syria. There is an enormous effort of 
 
 international aid getting into Damascus is how that gets from there into where it's needed most what do we know at this point?
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And it's such a critical question. And it's a travesty what is occurring on the ground, because while there's 
 
 been enormous effort to coordinate assistance to Turkey, it is far more complex in Syria. Now, interestingly, I was at Dubai humanitarian city on 
 
 Friday with W.H.O. was sending aid to Syria.
 
And I asked that very question, you know, whether the aid actually does reach rebel held territory, whether it's difficult, and they said that they 
 
 don't just leave the aid with the government that they make sure that it gets to the rebel held territory. But the crossings are few and far between 
 
 we know - how is the most important crossing that was impacted by the earthquake?
 
And, and interestingly, as well, that the question then became, you know, Syria has been going through so many problems for so many years. And now 
 
 the international attention is now back in play, but it's not enough, coordination is not enough. But I want you to listen to what the U.N. Chief 
 
 had to say they keep because it is actually quite harrowing to hear that he even says the news from the ground in Aleppo is absolutely chilling. Take a 
 
 look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. AID CHIEF: I have been hearing stories here in Aleppo, this morning, that chill you with what happened on those early 
 
 hours of that terrible day. And what is the most striking here is even in Aleppo, which has suffered so much these many years, this moment that 
 
 moment, a week or more ago, was about the worst that these people have experienced. We'll have assistance moving from here into the Northwest. But 
 
 the Northwest is only one part of Syria, as you know.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That's Martin Griffiths and he says that relief into the hardest hit regions will be dispatched as quickly as possible. The problem is just 
 
 how quick is that at this stage?
 
GIOKOS: We're - a date isn't it?
 
ANDERSON: We're a week into this and concern is that those who have lived through more than a decade of conflict, have what is just catastrophe 
 
 heaped on catastrophe at this point. And the real concern is how to avoid the victims becoming hostages of politics at this point.
 
GIOKOS: And there's a sense that is already a reality, right, that they're stuck in this political upheaval where they desperately need assistance. 
 
 And that is sort of the cognitive dissonance that is occurring right now, where people are in desperate need of help. We've seen images; we know what 
 
 they're going through. We're a week into this.
 
And the aid has just not arrived with regard to the magnitude that we've seen in Turkey. And it's a coordination issue. Firstly, it's an access 
 
 issue in various parts of Syria and then there was the sanctions issue. There was a plethora of issues, compounding one another.
 
The U.N. and the W.H.O have been very clear on this; they don't wait for events like this to happen. They are ready to mobilize aid, then the 
 
 question becomes how do you get it through to these regions as quickly as possible. And they have made it absolutely clear that the sanctions on 
 
 Syria have made it almost impossible to operate that easily.
 
And then, of course, the political issues in the anti-government areas in Syria have made it again almost impossible to act as quickly as they would 
 
 have liked. So the sense that the forgotten people that have been left behind in this tragedy, Becky, you know what more?
 
ANDERSON: It is it's heartbreaking. It really is. Do stick with CNN. Thank you, Eleni. For more information on how to help the earthquake victims 
 
 cnn.com/impact is available to you will find ways to donate with a list of organizations working on rescue and relief efforts, do please use that

Well, Israel's Prime Minister is accusing opposition leaders of deliberately dragging the country into "Anarchy". Mr. Netanyahu is calling 
 
 for them to "Show responsibility in a video message issued following protests outside Israel's parliament on Monday ". Tens of thousands of 
 
 demonstrators took to the streets near the Knesset building, waving flags and signs and banging drums to voice their concerns over Mr. Netanyahu's 
 
 proposal to weaken the country's judiciary.
 
Some are accusing him of trying to reform the system to avoid his own corruption trial. CNN's Hadas Gold is following the latest developments 
 
 from Jerusalem for you. How widespread were these protests in general strikes, Hadas?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, the protests were very large. We were out there for hours, and there definitely were tens of 
 
 thousands. We've seen some estimates that it might have been upwards of 90,000 people out on the streets in front of the Israeli parliament and the 
 
 Israeli Supreme Court.
 
And for many of the protesters who came in from outside of the city from all over the country, they wanted their voices to literally echo through 
 
 the halls of Parliament because today was the day that these are judicial reforms were getting their first committee hearing. And even within the 
 
 Israeli parliament there were dramatic scenes during that committee hearing.
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
GOLD: Opposition lawmakers were jumping over tables yelling at the coalition leaders, they had to be, they were actually even forcibly removed 
 
 by security. And we heard even from opposition leader, former Prime Minister Yair Lapid that they could hear their shouts, their yells within 
 
 the halls of the parliament.
 
I think that we're now showing some of the scenes from inside the Parliament of when it got quite heated there. But for many of these 
 
 protesters, they've been coming out now for weeks in Tel Aviv. But they really wanted to come to Jerusalem; they can be essentially in the backyard 
 
 of these legislators to show them why they were opposed to this.
 
They really see this as a weakening of Israel's independent judiciary. They see this, as you noted as something for Benjamin Netanyahu that can benefit 
 
 him personally as he faces corruption charges. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu denies this. He says that these are necessary reforms that have been a long 
 
 time coming.
 
And we heard from the Israeli President last night Isaac Hertzog in a rare televised address, calling for consensus saying there's voices on both 
 
 sides that that we can listen to, we can come together and we need to talk. Because otherwise, he was warning that Israel could be on a violent 
 
 collision course where he said it would be essentially brother fighting against brother.
 
And Becky, even U.S. President Joe Biden weighed in. And he rarely weighs in on, you know, sort of internal Israeli politics, saying in a statement 
 
 on Sunday to the New York Times that they really need to build consensus that that is the best way forward on this issue.
 
And I do have to give you just a bit of news, just in the last few minutes, we just got a statement from the Deputy Prime Minister, Uri Levine who said 
 
 following this speech by the Israeli President that they do want to coordinate a joint meeting with the opposition leader and the president.
 
Now they're stopping short of saying they're going to halt the pace of this legislation, which still needs to go through its first few readings. But 
 
 that is I think, a major moment in that the coalition Netanyahu's government. They are recognizing that they may actually need to sit down 
 
 with the opposition leaders and somehow come to some sort of consensus, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Right. That's fascinating. Stick on that one for us. And the more you get on that, please get it to us. Thank you. And you can read a lot 
 
 more about these protests. I have news from the region. With the Meanwhile, in the Middle East newsletter that is Meanwhile in the Middle East at 
 
 cnn.com/Mideast Newsletter.
 
Well, still ahead, it's been a busy week for U.S. fighter jets as the U.S. military shoots down yet another high altitude objects over North American 
 
 skies, we're going to try and unravel some of the mystery for you after this. And we'll be bringing you more of the thought leaders at this year's 
 
 World Government Summit, including the co-founder of the navigation app weighs on the trends in tech that you might want to watch for in 2023.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, we'll soon learn more about the investigation into Donald Trump's attempts to influence vote counting after the 2020 presidential 
 
 election. A judge in Georgia says this week he will release portions of a report prepared by grand jury that spent month poring over evidence.
 
Fulton County District Attorney formed the special Grand Jury after Trump made a phone call to the Georgia Secretary of State and asked him to find 
 
 extra votes. Well, DA has not yet announced whether charges will be filed against Trump or anybody else for that matter.
 
American officials meanwhile scrambling to find out what the objects are and where they are from after the U.S. military shut down a fourth high 
 
 altitude objects over North American airspace. This one was spotted over Michigan before it was taken down on Sunday.
 
But it started with that suspected Chinese spy balloon brought down last weekend. CNN's Natasha Bertrand has more details on Sunday's incident and 
 
 the many unanswered questions surrounding it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER (voice over): The U.S. on edge dispatching fighter jets to shoot down yet another mysterious object 
 
 in your Michigan's lake here on Sunday. The incident is the third time in as many days that the U.S. military has shot down an unidentified object 
 
 that was assessed to pose a risk to civilian aircraft and unprecedented series of events.
 
GENERAL GLEN VANHERCK, COMMANDER OF NORAD AND USNORTHCOM: I believe this is the first time within United States of America airspace that NORAD or 
 
 United States Northern Command has taken kinetic action against an airborne object.
 
BERTRAND (voice over): On Friday and Saturday, U.S. jet shot down two more objects near Alaska and over northern Canada. Those objects were flying at 
 
 around 40,000 feet and had balloon like features with a small metal cylinder underneath officials said. Sunday's object over Lake Huron was 
 
 flying at around 20,000 feet and it was described by officials as octagonal with potential surveillance capabilities. The incidents have sparked 
 
 confusion and prompted bipartisan criticism from lawmakers.
 
REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): I have real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows. But part of the 
 
 problem here is that the both of the second and the third objects were shot down in very remote areas. So my guess is that there's just not a lot of 
 
 information out there yet to share.
 
BERTRAND (voice over): After a Chinese spy balloon transmitted the U.S. earlier this month and was also shot down. The North American Aerospace 
 
 Defense Command readjusted its filters to better spots low moving targets operating above a certain altitude official said, which may be leading to 
 
 more detection.
 
But officials say they won't know more about the objects until they can recover and analyze all of the debris. The incidents have also raised 
 
 questions about whether similar objects have simply gone undetected in the past. And whether shooting each one down is the right response.
 
REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): What's been come clear in the public discussion is that we don't really have adequate radar systems. We certainly don't have 
 
 an integrated missile defense system. We're going to have to begin to look at the United States airspace as one that we need to defend and that we 
 
 need to have appropriate sensors to do so.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: CNN's National Security Reporter Natasha Bertrand joining us now live from Washington, DC. I have to ask what exactly is going on here? I 
 
 mean, the idea that we are reporting on a lot of flying on identified objects or what we might in the past have called UFOs over one weekend does 
 
 seem absolutely remarkable.
 
BERTRAND: It is unprecedented. This has never happened where NORAD and NORTHCOM the officials responsible for monitoring U.S. airspace have 
 
 actually taken down an airborne object within U.S. airspace. And now it's happened three times in three days.
 
And look officials say this is because they have essentially begun detecting more of these objects after opening up their filters and kind of 
 
 widening the aperture on what their radar can actually detect in American skies previously slow moving objects, very small objects, things above a 
 
 certain altitude.
 
They were not registering on the radar. But now NORAD and NORTHCOM say that they have actually changed those filters that they're seeing kind of every 
 
 little thing that pops up. Now the question, obviously that raises from this is, well, does that mean that the U.S. is going to be shooting down 
 
 every single object like this that it sees from now on?
 
And that is a question the Pentagon got repeatedly last night in a call with reporters. Now, they say that they will be judging each of these 
 
 objects on a case by case basis and deciding for each object, whether it is the right move to take it down or whether to keep it up and just mean to 
 
 maintain observation of it.
 
But ultimately, this is a serious change in policy from what we saw just last week, when the U.S. allowed a Chinese surveillance balloon to transit 
 
 the entire continental U.S. before actually shooting it down over the coast of off the coast of South Korea. So the question now of course is you know 
 
 is this happening because these objects are at a particular altitude and potentially posing a risk to civilian aircraft.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
BERTRAND: And if so, if we weren't seeing those objects before on the radar did they also pose a risk to aircraft? So, a lot of questions here, they're 
 
 still unanswered, including, of course, just what these objects are and where they're coming from Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, and whether they pose a threat in and of themselves. Natasha, thank you. Well, meanwhile China is accusing U.S. of flying spy 
 
 balloons over its airspace. Beijing says it's preparing to shoot down an object flying near its eastern coast.
 
The White House Twitter to rebut the allegation say any claim that the U.S. has flown its own balloons over China is false sedans. CNN's Ivan Watson 
 
 has the very latest perspective from Beijing. He's reporting for you out of Hong Kong.
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Accusations are flying fast and furious between Washington and Beijing, both governments accusing 
 
 each other of flying spy balloons in each other's airspace.
 
On Monday, the spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry responded to questions from journalists about that enormous Chinese balloon that flew 
 
 across much of the U.S. earlier this month, and was shot down off the coast of South Carolina by a U.S. fighter jet on February 4. And instead of 
 
 providing more details about it, he accused the U.S. of flying spy balloons into Chinese airspace, take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: Since last year alone, U.S. high altitude balloons have illegally flown over China's airspace more 
 
 than 10 times without any approval from relevant Chinese authorities. The first thing for U.S. to do is to introspect itself and change its course 
 
 instead of slandering and inciting confrontation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WATSON: A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council has already denied that charge and instead accused China of running a high altitude 
 
 surveillance balloon program that she claims has violated U.S. sovereignty as well as the airspace of more than 40 other countries, she says across 
 
 five continents. Now we've heard that U.S. fighter jets shot down over the course of three days over the weekend, three different unidentified objects 
 
 operating in airspace over North America.
 
On Sunday, a Chinese state news outlet announced that Chinese officials had detected an unidentified object flying off the coast of Shandong province 
 
 in China. And those Chinese officials were preparing to shoot it down and also urging the public to collect images of the debris and perhaps pieces 
 
 of the debris as evidence afterwards.
 
Now, as of Monday, we haven't gotten any updates from Chinese officials about that object, not about where it's come from, what they suspected to 
 
 be, or at what altitude it was operating. But clearly, both governments are looking to the skies right now on the lookout for balloons. Ivan Watson, 
 
 CNN, Hong Kong.
 
ANDERSON: You're watching "Connect the World" live from Dubai this evening. Excuse me; NATO says Russia has launched a new offensive in Ukraine the 
 
 latest from the front lines office.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: I'm Becky Anderson for you out of Dubai this evening. You're watching special "Connect the World" from the World Government Summit here. 
 
 More on what has been going on here a little later this hour. Your headlines though the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria 
 
 one week ago is now claimed more than 36,000 lives.
 
Earlier a 25 year old woman was pulled out of the rubble alive 178 hours since the earthquake hit. But hope is fading as the likelihood of similar 
 
 rescues and pockets of life grows colder with each passing hour. Meantime, six more U.N. trucks carrying food and relief have crossed into 
 
 northwestern Syria from Turkey after another convoy entered on Sunday.
 
And the European Parliament is discussing the EU's response to the situation. An ominous warning today from NATO Secretary General Jens 
 
 Stoltenberg says we are seeing the start of a new Russian offensive in Ukraine. It comes amid word that Russia is sending thousands of new troops 
 
 to war.
 
And the Ukrainian military spokesperson says they are seeing a record amount of artillery fire in the eastern part of his country. Military aid 
 
 from NATO countries has been a crucial lifeline for Ukraine's military since the start of this war nearly 12 months ago, but some of the weapons 
 
 provided to Kyiv were made decades ago. Sam Kiley reports on how Ukrainians are making do with military equipment from another era.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Carrying weapons designed 75 years ago, these Ukrainians are grateful that they're 
 
 training with an American vehicle, even if it's from another age. They're a mixture of combat Veterans and relatively new recruits.
 
But all have been fighting in Ukraine's eastern front with Russia in the Cauldrons of Bakhmut and Soledar. That Commander-in-Chief Volodymyr 
 
 Zelenskyy has begged the West for modern NATO standard equipment, and he's been given some modern weapons. But not the strategic weapons like long 
 
 range missiles and jets that he says he needs.
 
Meanwhile, Ukraine's war is expected to intensify and Ukrainians make do with old Soviet weapons. And workhorse hand me downs like these M113s, 
 
 aluminum troop carriers, which the U.S. army started using in 1960. About 400 have been given to Ukraine by the U.S. and others. This has been 
 
 patched up since it took a direct hit in Bakhmut, where the top gunner was killed.
 
To say that it's old, well, it looks old, but it just looks battered, but it does the job 100 percent, he tells me. Ukraine has been given better air 
 
 defenses, better artillery, better missile systems than it had before. But Zelenskyy said that's not enough in any way. It's not the best equipment, 
 
 often, not even second best.
 
KILEY (on camera): The Ukrainian military are keen to stress that they're really, really grateful for all and any help that they're given. These 
 
 armored personnel carriers from America are better than some of what they started the war with. And they're an important part of the battlefield 
 
 replacement. They've been here since the summer this one already needs a new engine.
 
KILEY (voice over): Ukraine captures a lot of what it needs from Russia. It's desperately cannibalizing ancient equipment for parts, like a 20th 
 
 century nation under siege, not a nation that's backed by America and by NATO allies. Making do is what Ukraine has done. Privately though 
 
 commanders here make it clear that it's going to take more than an iron will and hand me down weapons for them to win this war. Sam Kiley, CNN in 
 
 southern Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, the nation under siege as the situation on the ground, expected to get worse. Well, CNN's Senior International Correspondent David 
 
 McKenzie joining us live from Kyiv.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
ANDERSON: And I think it would be fair to say that although alarming and Stoltenberg's warnings today about a new offensive by the Russians will 
 
 come as no surprise to people on the ground. After all, this has been something that has been telegraph now, for some time, David.
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It has been telegraphed and the proof is in what's actually happening on the ground. 
 
 Whether it's a new offensive or not, is somewhat academic. But what we are seeing is a very big increase in attempted assaults by Russian forces in 
 
 the eastern part of this conflict in particular around the towns of Vuhledar and to the north in Bakhmut and other areas, relatively small 
 
 towns and cities that are hugely strategically important.
 
But what the NATO Secretary General said in terms of what they really need here, on the back of Sam's piece is also ammunition. They say that the 
 
 large caliber artillery rounds that are needed desperately on that front are in short supply.
 
And certainly they need to plan to ramp that up because of the enormous kinetic amount of fighting that is happening right now between Russia and 
 
 Ukraine. Now, he said the NATO Secretary General that yes, this is the start of this offensive in his mind, take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: We're seeing the start already, because we see in what Russia does now President Putin do now is to send in 
 
 thousands or thousands or more troops, accepting a very high rate of casualty taking big losses, but putting pressure on the Ukrainians.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: Those ammunition needs to come soon. He said though they have to ramp up production to supply Ukraine with the basic artillery shells that 
 
 are needed to fend off the Russians.
 
We just spoke to a military expert he said in that eastern part of the campaign, at least for now, they're seeing the Russians not necessarily 
 
 learning the tough lessons of earlier in the conflict with multiple videos showing Russian mechanized units getting obliterated by military fire of 
 
 course in artillery, but also by the tough defenses that have been set up by the Ukrainians in the last few months to dig into those positions. 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: David, you're in Kyiv? What's the atmosphere like there?
 
MCKENZIE: Well, certainly in the past few days, you had that barrage of missiles and drone attacks that were in part directed towards the Capitol 
 
 towards the region, I should say. But the air defenses of the Ukrainians have been improved significantly based both on static air defenses and 
 
 these mobile units who will rush out when the threat of missiles comes and use shoulder fired, counter strikes to bring them down.
 
You do get the sense here in Kyiv, there is a sense of calm, the air raid sirens, you know, certainly people pay attention to them when they are 
 
 warned to get underground. They are conducting classes in for school in the subway system and conducting their business there. There is a rhythm to 
 
 this conflict, far more dangerous, of course in the eastern and southern front lines, but the air defenses for now appear to be holding when it 
 
 comes to protecting the Capitol.
 
ANDERSON: David McKenzie is in Kyiv in Ukraine, David, thank you. Well, coming up, we're going to be discussing key trends in emerging tech with 
 
 the man who literally wrote the book on it. Here but the World Government Summit in Dubai, stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
ANDERSON: Right, you're back with us from the World Government Summit here in Dubai for what is a special edition of "Connect the World". Key to what 
 
 is going on here, which is effectively a sort of meeting of great minds, is pushing our boundaries of knowledge through science and technology, whether 
 
 it be artificial intelligence with three clean energies.
 
Forms like these are where great ideas, our platform, and perhaps more importantly, where funding can be secured. Well, my next guest is an expert 
 
 in spotting these trends and capitalizing on them. Uri Levine is the Co- Founder of Waze and navigation app used the world over.
 
If you haven't already used it, you probably will do at some point. He has literally written the book on how to disrupt an industry and push it to its 
 
 limits. Fall in love with the problem not the solution is a handbook he says for entrepreneurs, so there is no better person to have with me today 
 
 to drill down into the technology, we are hearing about here and seeing on display then you are who you are now joins us live.
 
As far as the world of tech was concerned 2022 wasn't the best of years. What's your forecast in for 2023? And, where are you seeing some 
 
 excitement?
 
URI LEVINE, CO-FOUNDER, WAZE: You know, end of the day, when you look back at previous recessions like 2008 or 2000, these are coming and going right. 
 
 So bearish markets and bullish markets are coming and going. Usually when we see a crisis, this is about two years long. And so I would in general 
 
 say we should expect the same thing here.
 
ANDERSON: That's fascinating, all right. Well, 2023 starting off strong for AI with the boom of Chatbot AI, ChatGBT, of course. That has sort of 
 
 created what seems to me as sort of investment domino effect as more companies like Google, for example, announced their own version.
 
I was talking to somebody today about the use of AI through, for example, education and how AI you know, becoming such a big disrupter. Do you think 
 
 this will be the year that AI truly arrives?
 
LEVINE: So for a second, I would say when you think of disruption, what we really want to think is the use case, right? It's the change of the 
 
 behavior. It's not about the technology, it's about change of behavior, and the result is changing the market equilibrium.
 
Now if the younger generation today, instead of going and searching at Google or going into ChatGPT and ask ChatGPT, for an answer for something, 
 
 rather than to implement their search, and then their creative thinking around that, then what is going to happen is that Google actually is going 
 
 to lose because they are not going to Google anymore.
 
And that's change of behavior. Now, with regards to the technology or the level of the ChatGPT today, or all the GPT solutions that we are seeing 
 
 today, it's not good enough yet. But through multiple iterations, it will become good enough, and we will replace some of the existing technologies.
 
ANDERSON: That's fascinating. And I wonder whether you will be using your investment vehicle, founder's kitchen to double down on AI investments.
 
LEVINE: So founder's kitchen is more of a company builder, right. And so we started to engage with startups at the very early day's way before they 
 
 even started. And we have a method of coaching them and mentoring them in order to increase their likelihood of being successful. Because at the end 
 
 of the day, I bring the experience and I bring the feature personality of me to guide those CEOs to become more successful.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
ANDERSON: Before we talk about, falling in love with the problem, not the solution, which is your sort of trademark, as it were, I do wonder whether 
 
 it's worth just pursuing the fact that we are surrounded by decision makers and government representatives here from around the world at the World 
 
 Government Summit in Dubai. How do you see the relationship with between policymaking and new technology developing in 2023?
 
LEVINE: So you know, in many cases, when we look at trajectories and changes in direction, this is not about the single year; this is about 
 
 maybe a decade for a change to take effect. And in general, I would say the first role of the government is not willing to fear right, is to allow 
 
 entrepreneurs--
 
ANDERSON: After all you even say that as an entrepreneur -
 
LEVINE: To allow entrepreneur ecosystem to be creative and impactful.
 
ANDERSON: There is a role.
 
LEVINE: The next role, however, and by the way, they need to support that role, right. So by supporting that role, this is really important. But 
 
 there is another role, which is what really government needs to and what really leaders needs to do is ask themselves, how this country is going to 
 
 look like for my children, for the next generation.
 
Because this is the main role that I would say government's actually here, looking into a generation into the future, and making sure that the next 
 
 generation is going to enjoy a better life than us and their future is brighter than us than ours.
 
ANDERSON: You published your first book just few weeks ago, fall in love with the problem, not the solution got a t-shirt echoing handbook for 
 
 entrepreneurs. Tell me what readers can expect to learn from this book and the reasons why you wrote it?
 
LEVINE: So I'm going to start with the second question. The reason that I wrote it is that everyone knows me as an entrepreneur. But there is another 
 
 strong personality of me of being a teacher. And I feel equally rewarded when I build stuff myself, or a coach someone to build it.
 
And through this book, I actually fulfill my destiny as a teacher and sharing my know-how, which is quite rare because most of the entrepreneurs 
 
 they are not teacher, so therefore, they have the know-how, but they don't share it. And the idea is to essentially to make the world a better place, 
 
 right?
 
So when I help entrepreneurs, when I help business people, or when I help leaders, when I help people, in general, to become a better version of 
 
 themselves. And as a result, increase their likelihood of being successful, and then the ward is going to become a better place. And I actually feel 
 
 rewarded.
 
ANDERSON: Well, that sounds very altruistic, I'm sure you are keenly and laser focused on whether you believe an investment will work still. I mean, 
 
 you know, clearly, that's your business.
 
LEVINE: Really simple, doing good and doing well.
 
ANDERSON: You're deeply entrenched in the startup environment, how has it changed since you co-founded ways, way back a decade ago, in 2013, how the 
 
 world has changed.
 
LEVINE: So, so obviously, it has changed a lot, right? For a second, I would say, I want you to think of, if we would have a time machine and we 
 
 are going to roll back into 2007 when we started ways.
 
That means that I'm going to take away your iPhone, and Uber and Waze and WhatsApp and Netflix and pretty much everything that you're using every 
 
 day, I'm not sure that you will survive. This is how fast the world's changing. In fact, if you think about what does it mean for the next 
 
 decade, it's going to be even faster.
 
ANDERSON: You talked about is the sense of sort of philanthropy, this sense of sort of altruism. And you know, given where you have got to in this 
 
 world, and this idea that the book you've just written is a sort of, you know, is a teaching device to all intents and purposes. What do we need, 
 
 then, from new, young tech entrepreneurs? You talk about, you know, providing a better world, what are you seeing? And what do we really need 
 
 at this point?
 
LEVINE: What we really need them is to think of a problem, a big problem, something that it's worth solving, something that the world will become a 
 
 better place and make that problem their mission, because this is what can make the world a better place. Now, at the end of the day, if you solve a 
 
 problem, you create value.
 
ANDERSON: You got an example of this for me?
 
LEVINE: There are a lot of problems. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems, right? So you can think of anyone, right? And you mentioned the 
 
 education system, look, our kids go to school the same way that we did. And we went to school, the same way that our parents did, right.
 
ANDERSON: And we know that's not fit the purpose.
 
LEVINE: And it doesn't fit the purpose, right. And so obviously, you can say, wait a minute, this is a big problem, right and not a big problem; 
 
 think of medical services in the U.S., right? There are five times more expensive than they are in Germany. Now it's not that they're better.
 
They're simply five times more expensive. So obviously there is a lot of inefficiency in the system, addressing that is going to create a lot of 
 
 value to a lot of people. So there are many aspects, in the U.S. people do not have enough money to retire, that's a big problem.
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
LEVINE: By the way, I addressed that with one of my startups. And at the end of the day, we're looking into many of the problems today and we said, 
 
 OK, what if we can solve it? And that's the attitude that I want people to have. That's the attitude that I would like entrepreneurs to have and this 
 
 is what's going to make the world a better place.
 
ANDERSON: Uri Levine, it's good to have you on.
 
LEVINE: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Thanks for joining me here at the World Government Summit.
 
LEVINE: Absolutely, thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Just ahead Rihanna's high flying Super Bowl performance on the unexpected news that she's expecting, more on that after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Pop icon Rihanna dazzled Super Bowl viewers worldwide on Sunday in a long awaited return to the stage. They say the old ones are the best 
 
 ones don't need entertain a belted out a medley of a biggest hits from a floating platform wearing a show stopping read in salt ensemble and backed 
 
 up by a sea of dancers clad in white, but perhaps even more stunning.
 
She did it all while revealing a baby bump. That's right we honest representative confirms that she is indeed pregnant with her second child. 
 
 CNN's Entertainment Reporter Chloe Meals has more on the performance that has got everybody talking today and maybe even still humming the tune. She 
 
 joins us from New York. I'm not sure what cause more talker performance all the news of the forthcoming baby, Chloe.
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: I think it was all of it because there was so much anticipation for Rihanna to take the stage because it's 
 
 been so many years since she's gone on tour. It's been about seven years, I think since she put on an album. So this was so exciting. And she has you 
 
 know, gave birth to her first child in May a baby boy with ASAP Rocky.
 
And so when she got back on the stage, this was like a big comeback for her. And then I think we were all sort of looking at each other being like, 
 
 wait a second, Is she pregnant? And at the very end, you see she kind of rubs her belly and we were like, OK, we think she's pregnant. And then her 
 
 representative confirmed it.
 
But look, I mean, show stopping, visually stunning and she had said in an interview earlier in the week that she changed the set list like 39 times 
 
 because she has so many hits. So you know I've talked to performers in the past that performed at the Superbowl and they all say the same thing.
 
It's really hard to kind of distill your catalogue into just 30 minutes. Also, let's point out something that I find so cool every year is those 
 
 people, the production people who put together these incredible sets in just a matter of minutes during commercial to put together the stage and to 
 
 do all of that.
 
But yes, we're all talking about Rihanna. She sounded great. She looked great. And she showed the world that she is pregnant with her second child, 
 
 just nine months after giving birth to her first. And many people were wondering if she going to bring out a guest, who she is going to have of 
 
 the many collaborators that she's worked with.
 
And the guest was the baby bump and I love that she does really owned this performance and just made it about her voice and her power. And I think 
 
 that it just goes to show you that women rock right, we can do it all. We can be pregnant and we can take the stage of performance that have time 
 
 show. It was really empowering.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
ANDERSON: You know, it got to get me arguing with that one, Chloe, good way to end our show. Thank you very much indeed, Chloe Melas in the house. "One 
 
 World" with Zain Asher is up next. It's a very good evening from the team working with me here in Dubai.
