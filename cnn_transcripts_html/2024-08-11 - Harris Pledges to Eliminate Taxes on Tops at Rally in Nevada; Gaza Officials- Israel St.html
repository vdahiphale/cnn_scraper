KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber, this is CNN Newsroom. 
 
Kamala Harris trying to reach workers in Nevada with a pitch they've already heard from her rival. What she said and what more we can expect in terms of policy proposals in the days ahead. 
 
Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign says it's the victim of hackers. How the team says they discovered the security breach, what was leaked, and who they're blaming.
 
Plus, the U.S. has some harsh words for Israel following a deadly strike on a school in Gaza. We'll look at the possible impact this could have on ceasefire talks.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber.
 
BRUNHUBER: And we begin here in the U.S. as Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris wraps up a tour of battleground states. She and her Vice Presidential pick were in Las Vegas, Nevada, where the focus was on service employees who make up such a large part of the city's workforce. 
 
Eva McKend reports on what she's promising and why may sound a little familiar.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: At a worker focus rally in Las Vegas, Vice President Harris pledging her support for eliminating taxes on tips for hospitality and service workers. It was the first time that she has made such a pledge and also notable because this is a policy former President Donald Trump also supports and has been campaigning on for weeks. Harris really aiming to go after the support of workers in this critical battleground state. She received the support of the Culinary Union and their 60,000 members. This message seemed tailor-made for them.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, (D) U.S. VICE PRESIDENT &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And it is my promise to everyone here when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America -- 
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS: -- including to raise the minimum wage on tips for service and hospitality workers.
 
MCKEND: The Vice President will hold a fundraiser in San Francisco Sunday and then next week she will roll out her economic policy vision where she says she will address inflation and how to bring costs down.

BRUNHUBER: A new poll by the New York Times and Siena College shows a tight presidential race overall with no clear winner. But that poll shows Harris leading Donald Trump by four points in the crucial states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Now that's a significant improvement for the Democratic ticket as earlier polls showed Trump leading President Biden in those states.
 
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign says it has been hacked. In a statement the campaign blamed foreign sources hostile to the United States trying to interfere in the upcoming presidential election. CNN's Jeremy Herb has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY HERB, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: The Trump campaign revealed on Saturday that it has been hacked. These hacked documents were sent to "Politico" which reported on Saturday that it received emails from an anonymous account containing internal Trump campaign documents. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that foreign sources were behind this attack and he blamed Iran for the hacking.
 
He said in a statement these documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States intended to interfere with the 2024 election and so chaos throughout our democratic process. 
 
Cheung pointed to a report from Microsoft that was released this week. In that report Microsoft revealed that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had attempted to hack high-ranking officials emails in June. Now the Microsoft report did not say which campaign it had targeted or if the hack was successful. 
 
CNN reached out to the Trump campaign asking if it had sought more information from the FBI and the Trump campaign declined to comment. Microsoft also declined to comment on this report.
 
It's worth remembering now that in 2016 it was Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta who was hacked himself and his emails were published by WikiLeaks in the days and weeks before the 2016 campaign. 
 
In a statement on Saturday the White House condemned all forms of election interference from foreign countries.

BRUNHUBER: In some of her most substantial comments on a policy related matter since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated support for Israel's fight against terrorism while stating her concern about civilians in Gaza. This is what she said.
 <br>[05:05:15]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: Yet again the far too many civilians who've been killed. I mean Israel has a right to go after the terrorists that are Hamas but as I have said many, many times they also have I believe an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: The White House issued a statement on the strike. It said, quote, "We are deeply concerned about reports of civilian casualties in Gaza. We know Hamas has been using schools as locations to gather and operate out of. But we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimize civilian harm."
 
Other world leaders are also stressing the need for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Now, this comes after Gaza officials say an Israeli strike on a school killed at least 93 Palestinians on Saturday. CNN can't confirm that number.
 
Israel says the school housed a Hamas command and control center and that a top Islamic Jihad commander was likely among two dozen militants it says was killed at the school. A weapons expert tells CNN that based on parts of an explosive device found at the scene at least one U.S.-made bomb was used in the attack. 
 
Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us live from London with more on the strike and the reaction. So Elliott, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been fairly deft international pressure so far. Does anything change in the wake of this attack and the condemnation that's followed?
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: I don't think much is going to change to be perfectly honest, Kim. As you say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has very much been focused on what he says are Israel's war objectives and Israel won't give up on them. Those are to destroy the military and governance capabilities of Hamas, to get the 115 or so hostages about a third of whom are believed to be dead back into Israel. Those that were kidnapped, of course, on October the 7th in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks, and to prevent the Gaza Strip from posing a threat to Israel in the future. So I don't think Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to be
 
 deterred or deviated from those goals but perhaps with a nod to the international criticism particularly from the United States. The IDF put out not one, not two, but three statements on this same strike, something that they don't usually do.
 
It emphasized that it says it's used aerial surveillance, intelligence and small munitions to try to minimize civilian casualties. At the same time it very swiftly named 19 of the two dozen militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad that it says were killed in that strike including it says the likelihood that a top Islamic Jihad commander was killed in that strike. 
 
And then at the same time it reiterated what it has said -- has said on numerous occasions that Hamas is to blame for this because it uses these civilian facilities in order to -- well, as command and control centers to store weapons and also to use as a base to carry out terrorist attacks. So that's kind of what Israel has been saying and doing in response and also before the international condemnation.
 
As I said I don't think it's going to change Israel's war objectives or the way it goes about this war but certainly it's trying to put its version of events out there, you know, as a kind of counterweight to what the authorities in Hamas run enclave have been saying. 
 
Kim?
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah and then Elliott, meanwhile, Israel still waiting for the retaliatory attack that it knows will be coming?
 
GOTKINE: Very much so of course this in response to Israel assassinating a senior Hezbollah or the top Hezbollah military commander in South Beirut and for what it's accused of assassinating the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran something that Israel hasn't claimed responsibility for. 
 
And over the past few days it's been what 11-12 days now since those assassinations. You've heard from Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah also from Ali Khamenei the supreme leader in Iran saying that Israel will be punished. Ali Khamenei for example saying that you have paved the way for your harsh punishment.
 
Hassan Nasrallah saying that making Israel wait is kind of part of the punishment and then almost in anticipation of a retaliation from Iran or its proxies, the strongest one of course being Hezbollah. 
 
Yoav Gallant, Israel's Defense Minister for example saying he who plays with fire may expect destruction, that was a post that he put out on X in Arabic addressed to the Lebanese people. But for now still very much the expectation is that there will be a response and that it could be greater than the one that Iran carried out back in April in response to the killing of a top commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps at a consulate consular compound in the Syrian capital Damascus.
 
No sense still of when that is likely to happen, a very small hope among the U.S. and others that perhaps a ceasefire deal and talks are set to resume on Thursday could forestall an Iranian and/or Iranian proxy retaliation. But given that I've been speaking and holding those ceasefire talks on and off for the past nine months I think it -- you know, could be seem to be rather optimistic that a deal could be done, you know, as quickly as this Thursday when those talks are set to resume. 
 <br>[05:10:23]
 
Kim?
 
BRUNHUBER: All right I appreciate that. Elliott Gotkine, thanks so much. 
 
Hundreds gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday demanding a deal to release all the hostages held in Gaza and protesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
 
Among the protesters were families of hostages calling for an end to their 10-month ordeal. One of those is the family of Itay Chen. He was an IDF soldier who was killed on October 7th.
 
His father Ruby Chen has been calling to bring home all the hostages whether living or dead including his son's remains. Here's what he told Wolf Blitzer about the attack on the school in Gaza and a ceasefire deal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RUBY CHEN, FATHER OF ITAY CHEN: There's a time especially now that we are kind of like at that two-minute warning before, you know, getting in. We need to think what is strategic and not strategic to help us get that hostage deal. And I would question and ask, you know, is this attack helpful to get us to that finish line or not? We, of course, are very feel unfortunate that these things happen. We do not enjoy seeing these things happen. We do not like to see people -- innocent people killed. 
 
It's time after 10 months put this to rest. We the majority of the people that live in Israel, you know, are very grateful for what the United States has done the last 10 days with mobilizing these forces into the region. It has deterred until now Iran and Hezbollah for making an attack on Israel. So we are first very thankful for that for the United States. 
 
We see the efforts that the United States are putting on this. We also see a very interesting comment from Iran that came out the last 24 hours saying that they are not a side to a deal between Israel and Hamas. We've seen Arab countries come out. We've seen France and, of course, Qatar and Egypt urging for this deal to happen.
 
So we are optimistic because we have no other choice but we are positive that this is the time, this is the window of opportunity because of the political window both in the United States and in Israel to get this done. And we need everybody, everybody focused to get this deal done. And I would even urge the Prime Minister of Israel that claims he is the best negotiator. He knows how to get a deal done. He knows how to stand for what is correct for the state of Israel. I would urge him Mr. Netanyahu please get on a plane this Thursday. We see the Prime Minister of Qatar involved directly in these talks. I would urge him get on a plane. We will be very thankful to see you negotiate and bring our loved ones back home after 10 months of this agony.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: So you want Netanyahu personally to go to either Cairo or Doha, Qatar and negotiate on behalf of Israel?
 
CHEN: He is the Prime Minister. He was responsible for what happened on October 7th. And he claims that he knows to do the best negotiation possible. Show up. Do your thing. Bring our loved ones back home. It's about time.

BRUNHUBER: Russian air attack on Kyiv overnight killed a father and his four-year-old son according to Ukraine's emergency service. At least three others were wounded. Officials say the attack was carried out using ballistic missiles and Shahed-type strike drones.
 
Now comes days after Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Russian media reports more than 76,000 people have already been evacuated amid the fighting. Nearly 60 temporary shelters have been set up across eight regions of Russia.
 
Joining us now is CNN's Clare Sebastian in London. So Clare, clearly Moscow still on the back foot after this Ukrainian incursion. What's the latest?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, look, we're almost a week now since this incursion started, Kim, and I think it's clear that Russia is racing to try to stop Ukraine from advancing further or even, worst case scenario, digging in and holding on to territory. This is something that most military analysts think Ukraine will struggle to do in the near term. 
 
But the Russian Ministry of Defense has been claiming this morning that they've managed to hit a small convoy of Ukrainian military vehicles, some five of them. We've managed to geolocate some video of that to about 14 kilometers from the border. This follows similar footage that surfaced on Friday of a burnt-out Russian convoy, which CNN has also verified. 
 
So, look, the violence continues as of now. We can assess from unofficial reports that there is still fighting ongoing and that this is something that could be happening over a pretty wide area. 
 <br>[05:15:00]
 
CNN's own analysis has assessed that Russia may have lost control of some 250 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region. I think the evacuations of some 76,000 people speak to the nature of this emergency for Russia. It could also portend a bigger Russian operation to try to push Ukraine out. They are, you know, amassing forces to try to do this and have declared this sort of counter-terror regime in three border regions. 
 
As for Ukraine, well, up until now, they haven't really spoken publicly about this. There's been very little from the military and only hints so far from President Zelenskyy. But in his speech on Saturday, he had this to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today, I received several reports from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi regarding the front lines and our actions to push the war onto the aggressor's territory. I'm grateful to every unit of defense forces ensuring that. Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: Well, in another part of that speech, he did seem to acknowledge the risk that Ukraine is taking in undertaking this operation, even though they have achieved this successful element of surprise and blindsided Russia in launching it. He said, "we leave no part of the front unattended," a suggestion that they have not taken resources away from those parts of the front line where Russia has, in fact, been inching forward in the lead up to this. And as you noted, Kim, in the intro, we are watching to see what Russia is going to do in response.
 
Another deadly attack, missile and drone attack on the Kyiv region overnight, two people killed. That, of course, follows a very deadly attack on the eastern town of Kostyantynivka on Friday that killed some 14 people. That is, you know, fitting with the general course of this war, but obviously keeping a close watch on Russia's response here.
 
BRUNHUBER: I appreciate that update. Clare Sebastian in London, thanks so much. 
 
Well, after the break, investigators are now looking for the cause after the tragic plane crash in Brazil left 62 dead, but it may take time.
 
Plus, anti-racist protests sweep across Britain one week after anti- immigration riots rocked the U.K. The drive behind the counter movement just ahead. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: Venezuela's Supreme Court says its decision on the disputed presidential election will be final. The top court is investigating the results before it ratifies President Nicolas Maduro's victory. The court has heard from all parties except opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. He didn't attend any hearing, fearing he would be arrested. The country's electoral authority still hasn't released any detailed
 
 vote count. Several Latin American countries as well as the U.S. have rejected Maduro's win. 
 
The search for answers is underway in Brazil after the devastating plane crash outside of Sao Paulo on Friday. Now, the cause still isn't known, but investigators have started pulling data from the aircraft's two black boxes. The preliminary report could take 30 days. The state government now says all 62 bodies have been recovered from the crash site. 
 
Journalist Stefano Pozzebon has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: The plane plummeted to its demise in a matter of moments, but for those who witnessed the tragic crash outside Sao Paulo, the images will last forever. I don't know how long it will take before I can sleep again. I'm still in shock, says Gertrude Pereira.
 
She filmed the fiery blaze from her own front yard. Brazil has declared three days of national mourning as rescue workers tirelessly comb through the wreckage to recover the bodies.
 
RODRIGO SANFURGO, FEDERAL POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: I can say that we are working here now since yesterday. We have 100 police officers working here.
 
POZZEBON: Sixty-two people have died on flight 2283, but only a handful of bodies have been identified. Among the victims, a mother of three, a pharmacist traveling to visit her family, teachers at a local university and the crew of the plane. Brazilian authorities say they recovered two black boxes that could help clarify what really happened. The cause of the accident is still a mystery. 
 
But in such a tragedy, there is also relief for those who felt it could have turned out much worse. 
 
"The pilot was a real hero. He managed to crash in an open field without causing damage on the ground. Had he crashed two seconds before, we would be dead." A community and a nation looking at the sky, still waiting for an answer.

BRUNHUBER: One of the young girls killed in a brutal knife attack in Southport, England, will be laid to rest in the coming hours. Alice da Silva Aguiar's family will hold a private funeral service Sunday. 
 
The 9-year-old girl was one of three children killed in the attack two weeks ago. It took place during a Taylor Swift-themed event at a dance school, and it was one of the worst attacks targeting children in British history. Eight others were injured. Police have charged a 17- year-old with murder.
 
Anti-racism protests swept the U.K. on Saturday, days after anti- immigrant riots linked to Alice's death gripped the nation. One anti- racist protest was held just outside London, headquarters of the right-wing Reform Party, which made immigration a hot-button issue during last month's election. 
 
This weekend's protests are a contrast to the demonstrations last weekend, which turned into riots targeting Muslims and immigrants after the murders of those three young girls were falsely attributed to an Islamist migrant.
 
A massive crowd of anti-racist protesters also gathered outside a mosque in London. Many waved Palestinian flags, along with signs that read, "no to hatred." 
 
Taylor Swift is bringing her Eras Tour to London this week, where she will perform for five nights at Wembley Stadium. London police say they're on high alert as they prepare for massive crowds. Officials say they're equipped to handle all scenarios after the discovery of a terror plot forced the cancellation of Swiss concerts in Vienna. Some Swifties expressed relief that the London shows weren't cancelled, but say they'll be cautious during the upcoming concerts.

Remnants of Debby are moving through Canada and no longer pose a threat to the U.S. The East Coast is now in clean-up mode after Friday's rare flash flood emergencies. New York remains under a state of emergency as communities recover. 
 
Meteorologists are watching another tropical wave that recently formed in the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center says it has an 80% chance of developing into a cyclone in the next seven days. 
 
Meteorologist Elisa Raffa, reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: We just finally got Debby's rain to exit off the East Coast, and we're already watching our next tropical wave. Pretty high likelihood of some development in the next seven days from this tropical wave as it heads towards the leeward and windward Islands. You can see the spaghetti plots takes it in that direction.
 
After that, we'll have to see where it might be able to make a turn, either towards the Caribbean or maybe out into the Atlantic. But something we'll need to watch closely. It will likely become our next named storm.
 
The next name on the list is Ernesto, and we are again ahead of schedule for the season with all of these named storms, in large part because our ocean temperatures are just incredibly warm. They're still three to five degrees above normal across this zone here of development where we have that tropical wave right now. And then even near the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf, we're still looking at some of these water temperatures that are one to two degrees above normal.
 
The water temperatures have really been driving this above average forecast, this active season that we're in. NOAA just updated their forecast this week, and we're still looking at a 90% chance that the season is above normal. Up to 24 named storms possible. Average is 14. Up to 13 hurricanes possible. Average is seven. So again, an active season possible ahead. 
 
Another big reason is because we're still in that La Nina. That's that cool ocean circulation in the Pacific. But what it does is it moves the jet stream north. The jet stream has a lot of wind shear. It's that wind energy upstairs in the atmosphere.
 
So with the jet stream out of the way, that decreases that wind energy that the hurricanes heat and allows more of those tropical waves to form off the coast of Africa and head towards the Caribbean. And that is exactly what we're seeing this week. Again, something to watch. We could be having Ernesto on our hands in a couple of days.
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, still to come. Donald Trump's campaign points the finger at Iran after it says thousands of internal documents were hacked. We have details ahead.
 
Plus, Kamala Harris tries to win the support of a key electoral group, Latino voters. I'll speak to an expert coming up next. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:30:59]
 
BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom.
 
Our top story, the state of the race for the White House just days before the Democratic National Convention. Donald Trump's campaign says it has been hacked and is blaming Iran. They're pointing to a report released on Friday by Microsoft alleging that Iranian operatives have ramped up attempts to influence and monitor the election.
 
Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris has wrapped up her blitz of battleground states with a rally in Nevada. Speaking to a crowd of thousands she promised to advance policies to benefit working families. A new poll by the "New York Times" and Siena College shows Harris ahead of Trump by four points in the crucial states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan and that is within the margin of error.
 
This weekend Harris picked up a historic endorsement from the country's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization LULAC Adelante. Now this is the first time the group has backed a presidential candidate breaking with the norm and adding to her campaign's momentum. 
 
Latino voters have been seen as a key swing group. A recent Pew poll shows the demographic is mostly split on who they would vote for. 36% say they would vote for each of the candidates if the election were held today but that polling was done before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. The poll found about a third of registered Latino voters say they would vote for a third party with just 85 days left until Election Day. Harris has launched a new campaign ad trying to win their support. Have a look.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you're raised by an immigrant mother, you learn what's possible with determination. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And determination is how Kamala Harris --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- state attorney general -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- U.S. senator and our vice president in only one generation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: And joining me now is Eli Valentin, political analyst and professor at Virginia Union University. 
 
Thank you so much for being here with us. So as we saw there, with Biden as a candidate, polls had suggested Democrats had kind of been losing support from Latinos to Donald Trump. Is there any indication now that the switch from Biden to Harris has energized the Democrats' Latino base?
 
ELI VALENTIN, POLITICAL ANALYST: Oh, yes, absolutely. There's recent survey data that shows that the amount of Latinos that voted for Biden in 2020 and the amount of Latinos that have traditionally voted for Democrats are now coming back home. So recent polls, even polls of Latinos in battleground states show that Latino support for Harris is in the mid-50s. So about 55, 56% of Latinos that have been surveyed support Democrat Kamala Harris. So that's a significant boost.
 
BRUNHUBER: Just sort of a honeymoon phenomenon, or do you think that support is sticky?
 
VALENTIN: I think it's a solid support. Just looking at historical trends, Democrats have -- or Latinos have tended to support Democrats nationally. In 2020, Latinos voted for Biden at about a rate of 62 to 63%. And it's been roughly around the low to mid-60s for the last 30, 40 years. So this is for me, I believe, a solid support. Latinos had concerns like other Democrats about Biden's candidacy. But I believe that with the Harris candidacy, we're seeing Latinos go back to where they have been in the past.
 
BRUNHUBER: Biden polled poorly on the issue of immigration compared to Trump. So maybe not a surprise that the GOP is trying to paint Harris as the administration's borders are. Do you think that's working? And how will that play with the Latino community, do you think?
 <br>[05:35:05]
 
VALENTIN: Well, I don't know if it has a long-term strength, this messaging that the Republicans are trying to paint. Yes, immigration is a concern. I think Latinos have been concerned that for many years, both Democrat and Republican administrations have done very little to address the matter. 
 
Now, what polls indicate and the flavor that we see on the ground is that Latinos are really concerned about the economic situation, about inflation, about jobs and about real jobs. And I think at the end of the day, Latinos will support whichever candidate addresses those issues the best.
 
BRUNHUBER: Do you think -- we've seen that the Democrats sort of flagging support in the Latino community has been more pronounced with Latino men? What's been the poll? Is it what you were just touching on there that they don't maybe strongly identify with the identity messaging that Democrats used to appeal to the first generation and immigrant Latinos instead are more responsive to maybe the Trump economic message? Do you think that's it?
 
VALENTIN: Yeah, I think so. Some polling has -- has indicated that Republicans and in this case, Trump has been able to gain support from -- from Latino men. Interestingly enough, there are some Latino youth that have also been trending that way.
 
Now, I think traditionally Latino men have -- have -- have appealed to the type of strong man kind of candidacy that -- that Trump has represented. Now, I will also point out that there have been certain quarters that have -- that have decided to strategically use disinformation campaigns geared towards Latinos that has that has had an effect on many. We saw that especially in Florida last time, where disinformation campaign and spear tactics are used around this idea that that Democrats will be a socialist that they can, you know, bring a communist regime into the United States.
 
And that type of -- of messaging campaign and disinformation campaign has (technical difficulties) many Latino men. But -- but -- but again, I think we're seeing a turnaround for Democrats, especially for Harris. So I think that that's going to be something that I'll be looking at.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. And one might wonder why there would be an increased appeal with -- with Donald Trump, given that he continues to promise the biggest mass deportation in history. I mean, why would that message resonate at all? Is that a gift for Democrats, do you think?
 
VALENTIN: Well, I would say that's probably the biggest conundrum. And I think many of us scratch our heads around this. I don't know if any research, any polling has really dug into that.
 
So yeah, it's -- it's certainly baffling. But at the end of the day, at the end of the day, I think the economic message is -- is what really brings things home for Latino voters. So yeah, and although right, the migration crisis and the border crisis is real for many. But -- but again, at the end of the day, people want to have good jobs, they want to have good health insurance. And -- and Latino voters have always tended to vote for the candidate that presents the best messaging and the best proposals.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, we shall see which way the demographic not that it can be seen as monolithic, but it'll be interesting to see the breakdown in this election. Eli Valentin, thank you so much for being here with us. Really appreciate it.
 
VALENTIN: Thank you. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Police in Ferguson, Missouri say an officer is fighting for his life after being assaulted during protests marking 10 years since Michael Brown's death. Brown was shot and killed in 2014 by a police officer causing protests during the Black Lives Matter movement.
 
Police say the protests on Friday were mostly peaceful until a group of people pushed down a fence by the police station. That's when Officer Travis Brown was knocked over and hit his head causing a severe brain injury. Officials say several protesters were arrested, including the man accused of charging at Officer Brown.
 
All right, still ahead, we'll go live to Paris with a recap of Saturday's electrifying women's soccer final, which saw the U.S. enter its redeem team era. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: Medal Mania at the final full day of events at the Paris Games. Thirty-nine gold medals were awarded on Saturday, with China squeezing past the U.S. to reclaim the lead with the most gold medals. Team USA had 122 medals overall right now, putting it far ahead of the pack.
 
And there's still a chance for the U.S. to come out on top in the gold rush. Thirteen more golds will be awarded for today's closing ceremony, including the Women's Marathon, when just moments ago the Netherlands Sifan Hassan clinched the gold and set a new Olympic record. Ethiopia took home the silver and Kenya the bronze.
 
All right, I want to go live now to Paris. And CNN World Sport anchor Amanda Davies with some breaking news and bad news for American gymnast Jordan Chiles.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, I wish I could be kicking off the final day bulletin with some better news. But having had a week as a Paris 2024 medal winner, a really tough end to the games for Jordan Chiles. As the International Olympic Committee have confirmed, the U.S. gymnast will be stripped of her bronze medal from the floor competition is going to be reallocated to the Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu.
 
We're talking about that event that gave us one of the most iconic images of the games, the iconic podium photo with Simone Biles, Chiles and Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, the first all-black Olympic gymnastics podium. 
 
The courts of arbitration for sport, though, have ruled on Saturday that the inquiry Chiles filed in the moments after her routine on Monday, questioning the difficulty level scoring. It came too late.
 
Chiles initially had finished fifth with Barbosu in third. But after petitioning her score, Chiles was awarded additional marks that saw her edge out Barbosu for the bronze, much to the outrage of the Romanian delegation. They then lodged their own complaint to the courts of arbitration for sport, and that complaint has been upheld. So the International Olympic Committee say Barbosu is returned to the bronze medal position.

Now, Chiles' teammates Simone Biles and Suni Lee have sent their support on social media. Biles saying sending you so much love, Jordan. Keep your chin up, Olympic champ. We love you. Suni Lee saying all this talk about the athlete. What about the judges? Completely unacceptable. This is awful. And I'm gutted for Jordan.
 
Chiles, you might remember, did win gold with them as part of the team competition. And I can tell you just in the last few minutes, Chiles has actually taken to social media herself. She's posted four broken hearted emojis and a message saying she's removing herself from social media for her mental health.
 
There is the possibility USA Gymnastics or Team Chiles could themselves appeal. But as yet, no word on that.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, just -- just heartbreaking. And her reaction as well, you can just really feel for her. But Amanda, we have to get to some of the -- the marquee medals that were handed out Saturday. Take us through it.
 
DAVIES: Yeah, they were big ones and there was a whole lot of celebration. There was such a buzz on the streets here in Paris last night, particularly around the men's basketball final, the one that the script writers had been wanting. The stars were out in force both on and off the court.
 
And the game more than lived up to the hype as host France took on what might be one of the most talented U.S. teams ever assembled in that quest for gold. 20-year-old Victor Wembanyama, familiar name and face. He more than held his own against some of the all-time greats. The reigning NBA Rookie of the Year scoring 26 points. He did manage to keep his team in it right to the end. But in the end, the new dream team, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and co just proved too strong. 
 
It was Curry whose late game heroics have made him a four-time NBA champion. He added to his legend scoring 25 points. He hit four three pointers in the final three minutes that all but sealed the gold for the USA. It was a first for Steph, quite incredibly, third for LeBron and a record fourth gold medal for Kevin Durant.

STEPH CURRY, TEAM USA, WON FIRST OLYMPIC GOLD: It's everything I imagined and more. Just the excitement of doing it with, you know, the guys in our locker room. We all signed up for this mission to continue the USA basketball dominance.
 
Obviously, I understand it was going to be a really tough task with some great teams that we're going to have to face. And, you know, there's a sense of relief at the end, but it's more like a sense of accomplishment, obviously, knowing what we were able to do.

DAVIES: So later here on Sunday, it's over to the U.S. women's basketball team. They'll try and make it a double gold against France once again. They're also looking for their eighth straight, which is quite incredible.
 
It would also mean they join the women's football team atop the podium. Something that felt an impossibility this time last year, didn't it? After that early exit at the Women's World Cup.
 
This was the game I was lucky enough to attend last night. In a matter of weeks, it really does seem Emma Hayes has injected some new life into the setup, bringing her winning ways from Chelsea and England as the U.S. beat Brazil for a third time in the Olympic final. 
 
And it leaves a legend that is Marta, still all smiles with a silver medal, but without a major tournament title as she retires from international football after her sixth Olympic game. She is really one of those players that can have that title. 
 
Legend and icon on the final night of action on the purple track, though, at the Stade de France, a purple patch for the USA's four by four relay teams taking gold in both the men's and women's races, setting records along the way as well. Now, more than 30 years since the women didn't capture gold in this event, they finished an incredible four seconds faster than the Dutch in silver.
 
The men's event was closer, but they did it. And in record time as well, Olympic record time, the third straight games that both U.S. four by 400 teams have won gold. 
 
And just before I hand back, Kim, a word on Sifan Hassan, as you mentioned, taking gold this morning in Olympic record time in the marathon. What an end to her game. She's taken bronze in the 5000 and the 10000 meters here in Paris and now gold. 
 
I have no idea how many miles that is in total that she's run in the course of her Olympic campaign. But really quite something. And it's a mark that these games, they've purposefully made the women's events climax on the Sunday to give them more visibility. So something new in that fight for equality.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, it's great to see Amanda Davies in Paris. Thanks so much. 
 
All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: Temperatures in Spain didn't stop people from strolling the streets of Madrid this weekend. Residents and tourists look for ways to stay cool on one of the hot days of the year. Hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 Celsius in the Spanish capital Saturday. Spain's meteorological agencies warning another heat wave looms. 
 
Now, scorching sun might make tourists miserable, but it's good for one thing. Experimental solar powered airship. 
 
Lynda Kinkade shows us how this groundbreaking project could propel us into a new age of zero emission travel.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR: Powered by the sun, solar airship one is getting ready for takeoff in 2026. Layered with solar panels to generate its own power. This experimental airship aims to fly over 40,000 kilometers around the world in 20 days, crossing over 25 countries and establishing a new way to travel.
 
MIKE DWYER, CAPGEMINI ENGINEER: There's a simple mission here, go around the world without infrastructure, with solar power, with the flight crew of three to really prove that our new digital and engineering and manufacturing technologies can allow us to transfer or transform into electrification.
 
KINKADE: The high-tech ship has a double envelope that stabilizes external pressures and regulates internal temperatures. The solar film covers the upper part of the aircraft, providing continuous electrical power during the day. Excess electricity is stored in hydrogen fuel cells.
 <br>[05:55:17]
 
DWYER: The solution here is quite simple. It's electric power, but electric power applied at a scale to take an aircraft 40,000 kilometers around the world without having to have recharging infrastructure wherever they land and to allow them to be flexible in the route that they take, but also be zero emissions on route and be zero harm wherever they go.
 
KINKADE: The airship is fully independent. No heavy infrastructure is needed on the ground to secure the airship.
 
DWYER: This is the future revisited. We've had airships in the past. Yes, they've been helium powered or helium -- helium buoyant. They've been hydrogen buoyant. But now we're looking at a new age where the impact of zero emissions and doing no harm on your route lends itself to propulsion technologies like this, like the solar airship. It's a challenge.
 
I think it's a challenge that we should all be really looking to embrace because it allows us to explore the new technologies and real- world application of it.
 
KINKADE: Airships dominated the skies a century ago. Now, with this one, they're set to possibly make a comeback. The floating giant hopes to not just reach new heights in aviation. It could be the first nonstop flight without a carbon footprint transporting us into a greener future. Lynda Kinkade, CNN.
