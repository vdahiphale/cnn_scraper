JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Coming up here on CNN Newsroom. Monday in Moscow. Still no sign of Kremlin leaders including Vladimir Putin and the head of the mutinous mercenaries, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He is also laying low.
 
While Russia may have set back from the threat of civil war, the consequences of this rare and brief armed rebellion will likely play out for months, raising questions about Putin's ironclad grip on power.
 
And confusion and uncertainty too, over the future of Prigozhin and many of his loved mercenaries. Will they regroup in exile in Belarus?
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with John Vause.
 
VAUSE: Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Thanks for joining us. We begin with the aftermath of Russia's short lived armed rebellion and growing questions about Vladimir Putin's absolute grip on power. Calm appears to return to Moscow this Monday for an open military rebellion as Wagner group mercenaries marched on the Capitol.
 
The uprising, though came to a sudden end Saturday, after an 11th hour deal brokered by Belarus. And since then, there has been no sign of Wagner group head Yevgeny Prigozhin. His news service tells CNN he will answer questions when he has proper communication. One thing though, is clear. This insurrection marks the most profound threat we've seen to Putin's 23-year-long rule. And the U.S. Secretary of State says the turmoil may not be over yet.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It's too soon to tell exactly where this is going to go. And I suspect that this is a moving picture. And we haven't seen the last act yet. But we can say this. First of all, what we've seen is extraordinary. And I think you've seen cracks emerge that that weren't there before.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: The Military revolt lasted less than 24 hours but it was long enough to bring into question Vladimir Putin's aura of invincibility and stability. Damage to his self-proclaimed reputation as a leader who never forgets a slide, never tolerates disloyalty.
 
CNN Senior International Correspondent Ivan Watson reports on how those crucial hours played out from beginning to end.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A weekend of chaos and drama in Russia. Mercenaries declared a mutiny and then called it off in under 24 hours. Yevgeny Prigozhin issued a call for rebellion. The head of the Wagner mercenary group, accusing top Russian military commanders of gross mismanagement of the war in Ukraine.
 
Then Prigozhin released video of an alleged Russian airstrike on a Wagner camp in Ukraine demanding revenge. Russia's Defense Ministry denied the attack, and soon Russia's top prosecutor announced criminal charges against Prigozhin. Then in the early hours of Saturday, Prigogine followed through on his threats, sending his fighters across the border from Ukraine back into Russia.
 
Footage surfaced at dawn showing Wagner fighters surrounding the military headquarters in the southern Russian city of Rostov. Some locals stood nearby watching. At around 7:30am precaution was then shown dressing down senior Russian military leaders and issuing demands.
 
YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER GROUP HEAD (through translator): Again, we came here we want to receive the Chief of General Staff Sergei. Until they show up, until they show up, we are located here, blockading the city of Rostov, and will go to Moscow.
 
Video showed columns of Wagner troops heading north towards the Capitol along the way claiming control of military installations in the Voronezh region. Footage later showed at least one Russian helicopter narrowly avoiding a missile.
 
At 10am, Moscow time Russian President Vladimir Putin made a televised address to the nation, calling the rebellion a stab in the back.
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): All those who deliberately chose the path of treachery, who prepared an armed mutiny, who chose the path of blackmail and terrorist methods will face inevitable punishment and will answer both to the law and to our people.
 
The Kremlin announced counterterrorism measures tightening security in Moscow. But by Saturday night, suddenly a Kremlin reversal. Putin spokesman announced a deal.
 <br>[00:05:00]
 
Prigozhin released an audio message saying his troops would turn around and go back to field camps to avoid shedding Russian blood. Supporters chanted Wagner as fighters drove out of Rostov, giving Prigozhin handshakes as he left in this SUV. The Kremlin says it's dropped charges and Prigogine will go to Belarus, while promising his fighters contracts with the Russian Military.
 
For now a crisis apparently averted, but this very public betrayal and the mercenary's short but unimpeded march on Moscow reveals deep weakness at the heart of the Putin regime. Ivan Watson, CNN.

VAUSE: There appears to be no clear winners in Russia from this rebellion. The head of the mutinous Wagner group has agreed to exile in Belarus to avoid prosecution, but for now, no sign of where he might be adding to a long list of questions over his future. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has that report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So there's still a lot that's unclear about what's going to be in store in the future for the Wagner private military company. One of the things, of course, that we've heard from the Kremlin is that they say that the fighters for Wagner, because of their military achievements on the battlefield, will be able to apply to join the Russian Military.
 
That's something that's been in the cards for a while. There was a decree by the Russian Defense Minister a couple of weeks ago, where he said that all of the private Military companies needed to have contracts with the Russian army if they wanted to operate in the future. Now, Yevgeny Prigozhin of the Wagner private military company had always said if they were not going to do that, and that was of course, also one of the things that escalated the feud between progression and the Russian military leadership.
 
But all this is about a lot more than that. The private military company Wagner is one thing but Yevgeny Prigozhin owns a lot more than that. He has media holdings, so like, for instance, the Internet Research Agency, which the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election, Prigozhin was indicted for that. What happens to his media empire?
 
Then, of course, there's all his dealings in the Middle East. Oil fields in Syria in Africa, exploiting things like gold and diamonds also training local forces there. So there are definitely still a lot of questions about whether or not Yevgeny Prigozhin, when he goes to exile in Belarus will retain any sort of control over that, or if other solutions will be found by the Russian leadership. Frederik Pleitgen, CNN Berlin.

VAUSE: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, has spoken with close allies over the weekend about Russia's internal conflict. That includes U.S. President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Polish President Andrzej Duda. Mr. Zelenskyy says there was agreement on what was happening and why and how to respond. He also thanked the U.S. for its continued support.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Now the Russian occupiers are suffering losses which we need. Each of their losses is a long term strengthening of freedom. We also discussed further strengthening of Ukrainian troops, and I thank our partners for understanding our needs long range needs. I am especially grateful to President Biden and the United States for the reliability of patriots. We discussed the strengthening of artillery, and (MORS) and other things.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: But some U.S. officials are still amazed that conflict ended so quickly. They had expected the uprising to escalate. CNN's Alex Marquardt has more now reporting in from Washington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The abrupt ending to Yevgeny Prigozhin's march on Moscow was sooner and less violent than U.S. national security and intelligence officials expected. A U.S. official tells CNN that they assessed that there would be a lot of fighting and bloodshed as Wagner forces pushed up from southern Russia toward Moscow.
 
Instead, there was very little resistance from Russia's army, security services and others and Wagner troops are well on their way to the capital, before Prigozhin shockingly called the advance to a halt and ordered his troops to turn around, a deal supposedly brokered by Belarus, also surprising the U.S.
 
But the insurrection itself was predicted by the U.S. intelligence community according to multiple sources, speaking to CNN. Movement and build up a Wagner troops, equipment and weapons was observed by analysts and a rebellion was believed to be coming soon.
 
Intelligence officials have briefed the Gang of Eight in Congress, the leaders of both chambers from both parties as well as the head of the intelligence committees. Here's Congressman Mike Turner, the Republican Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
 
REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): This is not a weekend trip he's taking, taking his convoy and his military convoy up to Moscow. There's a number of accomplices, including as we saw some of the Russian people on the border with Ukraine who clearly support the Wagner group, in contrast to their support for the Russian government.
 
This is something that would have had to have been planned for a significant amount of time to be executed in the manner in which it was.
 <br>[00:10:00]
 
MARQUARDT: Still the speed and audacity of the move by Prigozhin caught many by surprise along with his sudden decision to stop his troops in their tracks. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington.

VAUSE: Professor Matthew Schmidt teaches national security at the University of New Haven, joins me now from Connecticut. It's good to see you.
 
MATTHEW SCHMIDT, PROFESSOR OF NATIONAL SECURITY, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN: Good to see you. John.
 
VAUSE: And so Prigozhin's mercenary fighters came with him at (inaudible) miles in Moscow then suddenly retreated. Here's the former director of the CIA, General David Petraeus on what he believes may have happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Clearly Prigozhin lost his nerve. He was, as you noted earlier, within roughly two hours' drive of the outskirts of Moscow where they were starting to prepare defensive positions. This rebellion, although it had some applause, along the way, didn't appear to be generating the kind of support that he had hoped it would.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So in other words, if you're going to take Vienna, take Vienna, but is that how you see it as the most likely explanation here, cold feet?
 
SCHMIDT: You know, I used to work for the general at Fort Leavenworth. And I respect him, absolutely. But he may not be right. He could be right. But there are other explanations as for why Prigozhin may have may have stopped. We don't exactly know what happened in this deal. We don't know when the phone calls were made. They may have -- they may have made the phone call. And that's why he stopped.
 
I just think it's really early to draw conclusions on this yet. And I would be wary of anyone who's who counts this as though they know something even -- even General Petraeus.
 
VAUSE: Well, there is a perception out there, a common belief, if you like in this -- in these early days that Vladimir Putin has been left seriously weakened by all of this.
 
SCHMIDT: Again, I have to posit the opposite possibility, right? In the end, what do we know happened here? He stopped it in 24 hours. Right? This guy Prigozhin, his nominal enemy is now safely ensconced in a neighboring state in Belarus, under surveillance, right? Probably in fear for his life in any moment. And the 25,000 plus mercenaries that were behind -- behind Prigozhin are now going to be folded into Putin's direct command. Right. And some of these are the best fighters in Ukraine, which he now gets to direct.
 
The only thing we don't know, is did Prigozhin get, you know, some sign off on getting rid of the Defense Minister and, and, and Gerasimov, General Gerasimov, right? So this, this looks very much to me, like a Putin win. And the most important thing here is the elites, right? The oligarchs that everybody keeps waiting to turn on Putin, well, this was their shot. And they didn't take it, John.
 
So I think I think that hope that Putin is going to be you know, ousted is really gone now, because there's no other insurrection coming anytime soon.
 
VAUSE: You say there's no other Prigozhin in the wings.
 
SCHMIDT: There's no other Prigozhin in the wings. Right? And -- and, look, coup d'etats aren't military only events. They're political events with military components, and Prigozhin provided the military component of this. But he couldn't come through with the political side, he didn't have political support.
 
And the fact that nobody gave him that support in Moscow is indicative that Putin still has control, control of the security services and he has the control and loyalty of at least enough of the elites.
 
VAUSE: OK. I want you to listen to the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on how he sees the bigger picture here, for Vladimir Putin and for Russia. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLINKEN: 16 months ago, Russian forces were on the doorstep of Kyiv, Ukraine, thinking they were going to take the city in a matter of days, erase the country from the map. Now, they had to be focused on defending Moscow, Russia's Capitol, against mercenaries of Putin's own making. So this raises lots of profound questions that will be answered, I think, in the days and weeks ahead.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So this coup d'etat may have been a win for Putin in some ways. But overall, would you say, you know, this war of choice in Ukraine has been the biggest disaster of his presidency and just keeps getting worse. And U.S. intelligence believes this year, Putin will have few, if any military victories in Ukraine. So how does this now play into what presidential elections which is scheduled for next March?
 
SCHMIDT: You mean, in Russia?
 
VAUSE: Yes.
 
SCHMIDT: Just to be clear.
 
VAUSE: Yes, in Russia.
 
SCHMIDT: So I don't think it plays much at all. Putin has set up a system that that leans heavily towards his advantage, and that system will stay in place. And look, we in the West, when we talk about this, we are constantly talking about it as those the mirror image of our electorate, as though, as though the Russian public and what they think matters in the election of their president, the way the American -- what the American public thinks matters in our elections.
 
And it's simply not that way. Right? And second, again with this coup d'etat attempt, if that's what it was, right? There's no indication that the Russian population was cheering, was cheering Prigozhin on, right?
 <br>[00:15:00]
 
So I think we need to step back and assess, you know, the facts on the ground that we -- that we can see here. This war in Ukraine is the worst war that Russia has waged, because, you know, since, since 1970, right? It's been a disaster for them, and it will continue to be a disaster, I'm sure of that on the on the battlefield.
 
But, but that doesn't mean Putin is weak.
 
VAUSE: Has Ukraine been able to take advantage of this? Or will they be able to take advantage of this? How do you see it?
 
SCHMIDT: I'm going to have to go into an American football metaphor here, unfortunately. It's like if your -- your enemy team fumbles the football, they could fumble it and recover it at the same spot they fumbled, meaning nothing really changes.
 
They could fumble it, your team could recover it and fall on the same spot, meaning you're not really in that much of a different position. Right?
 
You could recover it, run it back for a touchdown, or you could recover it and then fail to convert two points on a drive. Right? Ukraine has an opportunity here, but it was over very fast. Right? And we haven't seen that they've been able to convert on that opportunity. So -- so I don't think it's actually changed the battlefield yet. It may. But at this point, I don't see any change right now.
 
VAUSE: OK. Matthew Schmidt, great to have you on. Good to hear a different point of view as always, thanks for coming in.
 
SCHMIDT: My pleasure.
 
VAUSE: Extreme weather was on full display Sunday just outside of Indianapolis. The National Weather Service says it's almost certainly a tornado. They'll make it official after a survey team reports back Monday. Here's what it looks like for a fire company responding to reports of a collapsed building. Officials say at least 75 homes have been damaged and an apartment building under construction was destroyed. There are no reports of serious injuries.
 
Oppressive heat has turned deadly in Texas. Temperature of 119 degrees Fahrenheit or 48 degrees Celsius, being blamed for the deaths of 31 year old man and his 14 year old stepson while hiking in Big Bend National Park. The soaring temperatures are raising concerns about the stability of the power grid in Texas. There's no relief in the forecast this week. Cities have started opening cooling centers.
 
We'll take a break here on CNN. When we come back, Vladimir Putin has ruled Russia unchecked for decades. To explain why the recent armed uprising by the Wagner group is so significant to his iron grip on power. Plus, Ukraine's Military takes advantage of Russia's chaotic weekend, claiming advances around the beleaguered city of Bakhmut. More from the frontlines after this break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: There's still no sign of Wagner Chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin more than 24 hours after the Kremlin says he accepted a deal to leave Russia for exile in Belarus. To avoid prosecution for his armed Military rebellion which saw his most enemy fighters marching on Moscow. The uprising seemed to end as quickly as it began with an 11th hour deal brokered by Belarus. But not before cracks appeared in Putin's hold on power.
 
He held -- he's held power for almost a quarter of a century. At no point since Putin was named Acting President by Boris Yeltsin on New Year's Eve in 1999 has he faced a challenge as direct as what we saw this weekend. His demand on those who wanted power or money in Russia has always been the same. The price of that is loyalty.
 
Though he had a falling out with Putin government, as recently as May, Yevgeny Prigozhin said quote, I love the Motherland. I listen to Putin. Here's what CNN's Fareed Zakaria told Jim Sciutto on the potential fallout from the insurrection.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: To me, Jim, the more important sign here was Prigozhin's own remarks when he basically decided to frontally attack the rationale for invading Ukraine. This was the most interesting thing that's happened in some ways in the last 24 hours, in the last 48 hours. Prigozhin who has been fighting the Ukrainians and has been losing his troops to them says the whole war was -- was -- was started on false pretexts. The Ukrainians did not provoke us. We decided to do it because we wanted to control them because we you know -- there's a whole bunch of oligarchs who had been making money in the Donbass, he provides a kind of alternative narrative that is not one that looks good for Putin.
 
It's completely contradicts Putin's own narrative about the whole thing about Ukraine being taken over by Neo Nazis. And I wonder whether that will turn out to be you know, if they -- if things go down for -- for a badly for Putin, I wonder if this becomes a central issue, which is that his own guy says the whole rationale for this war is a lie.

VAUSE: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, has spoken with close allies about the turmoil in Russia, saying the crisis is a result of Russia's own aggression. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): The longer Russian aggression lasts, the more degradation it causes in Russia itself. One of the manifestations of this degradation is that Russian aggression is gradually returning to its home harbor. In our conversations with the leaders, we have exchanged or assessments of what is happening in Russia. We see the situation in the same way and know how to respond.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Meantime, on the frontlines, Ukraine's military claims to have gained some ground around the beleaguered city of Bakhmut during heavy fighting over the weekend, and Russian efforts they say to retake territory have failed. Further South, Ukrainian forces have carried out more than 1000 firing missions, resulting in heavy Russian losses, according to one commander.
 
CNN though cannot verify those claims. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more on the frontline battles in Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: After the brief but intense drama in Russia, it's back to the war in Ukraine. While Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was on the rampage against his foes in Moscow, officials in Kyiv were largely silent, following Napoleon's advice never to interrupt your enemy while he's making a mistake.
 
Briefly, many Ukrainians entertained the hope that civil war or chaos in Russia would lead to an early end to the war, but Prigozhin's sudden about face dashed those hopes. Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview, he was hoping for something more concrete, perhaps a civil war in Russia. He said he was still confident that will eventually happen. While attention was diverted away from the front the fighting went on.
 <br>[00:25:00]
 
Sunday Ukrainian officials claimed their forces had seized a kilometer, a kilometer stretch of trenches near Bakhmut. They said they killed, wounded or captured an entire battalion. They didn't give exact numbers. It was a limited tactical success. The much anticipated counter offensive has yet to hit its stride. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Zaporizhzhia.

VAUSE: Images of a Russian military aircraft allegedly shot down by the Wagner group, now circulating on social media. Russia's Ministry of Defense has not commented on the loss of any military aircraft. But this type of plane is sometimes used as an airborne command and communication center. The cause of the crash is not clear but the images of the planes final plunge shows had been hit by a missile or rocket which would indicate that was the cause. A Russian military blogger said on Saturday the Wagner group shot the plane down with 10 people on board. Russian state media reporting that Wagner Yevgeny Prigozhin has offered to pay compensation to the relatives of the dead crew members.
 
Well, in Syria at least nine people were killed, dozens were wounded when Russian planes bombed a city in Rebel controlled Idlib province on Sunday. Rescuers say this was the second day of airstrikes in the area, and it happened ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid Al Adha. Sunday's attack is most fatal in northwestern Syria so far, this year.
 
Ahead here on CNN Newsroom, Belarus's president has emerged as a dealmaker, who stopped the Wagner uprising. More on Aleksandr Lukashenko, one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, one of his only allies in Europe. Also Beijing emphasizing its closeness with Russia and Vladimir Putin, days after he faced one of the biggest challenges -- challenges to his leadership in decades. We'll tell you what they're saying. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Welcome back, I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN Newsroom. Back to our top story now uncertainty and confusion across Russia after the weekend's insurrection. Despite apparent calm on the streets of Moscow the whereabouts of Wagner boss Yevgeni Prigozhin remains unknown.
 
And Russian President Vladimir Putin he was last seen on state television Saturday, delivering an urgent address to the nation on the armed rebellion. He is also not counted publicly since a deal was struck to end this crisis, at least in the short term.
 
But Russian state media posted a short behind the scenes clip of Putin's address to the nation and a four day old interview with him in whom he talks about his working day and how he's dealing with the war in Ukraine. The uprising began in the Russian City of Rostov-on-Don and some residents shared their thoughts.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was unexpected and somehow incomprehensible, and stressful, of course, very stressful.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were very serious problems in the country and they need to be solved. People who can no longer tolerate it they resort to such radical methods as Prigozhin.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How can one in a situation where we are in a conflict and another country have an internal war as well?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been one of Vladimir Putin's few close allies, but their relationship and Lukashenko's dependency on Russia goes back a long way. CNN's Nic Robertson has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Alexander Lukashenko rules Belarus like a personal fiefdom president since its creation in 1994 he brooked little opposition, dubbed Europe's last dictator, Lukashenko has come to be defined by his fealty to his powerful neighbor Russia's President Vladimir Putin, transforming Belarus into a near vassal state.
 
Putin used Lukashenko and Belarus to help launch his 2022 invasion of Ukraine, driving tanks over Belarus's border towards Kyiv. And using Belarusian skies to bomb Ukrainians.
 
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT: We will never be enemies of Russia and we will never look disapprovingly at Russia. This is the country closest to us, the people closest to us. I think that while we are in power, we will stick to this tendency, if it were otherwise it would be like in Ukraine.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Reality was the war deepened Lukashenko's already growing dependence on Putin. Lukashenko's flawed 2020 election victory, claiming 80 percent of the vote, described by Western governments as fraudulent, triggered nationwide protests.
 
Get out they shouted. He responded with force. The woman who ran against him, whose husband Lukashenko had already jailed, fled the country.
 
SVIATLANA TSIKHANOUSKAYA, BELARUSIAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: Thousands of people are in prisons for political motivated cases, hundreds of thousands had to flee Belarus because of repression. And one day we can wake up and see that Belarus has left his consolation prize for Putin.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): The protests escalated. Lukashenko called on Putin for help was bailed out, but at a cost. Most recently Putin tightening his grip, pledging to station nuclear weapons in Belarus like Putin Lukashenko is a product of his Soviet upbringing, his Belarus often seems stuck in that past.
 
Unlike Russia, the KGB was never disbanded, or even renamed. Before entering politics Lukashenko ran a collective farm later often had him filmed as president digging up carrots or potatoes to show he never forgot his roots.
 
But behind the folks eat farmer image, looked a thug, often turning to strong arm tactics when a Belarusian dissident was a passenger on board a plane flying over the country in 2021.
 <br>[00:35:00]
 
Belarus air traffic control called in a bomb threat, causing the plane to land and the man was arrested. Like so many dictators Lukashenko has an eye on the future, creating a dynasty grooming his young son, sometimes dressed in a military uniform for leadership, often taking him to meetings with world leaders.
 
His intervention to broker and apparent truce in Russia and help Putin by hosting Wagner Yevgeni Prigogine suggests his own fate and his families is more intertwined with Russia than ever before. Nic Robertson, CNN, London.

VAUSE: Late Sunday night China gave public support to Russia's government and in particular, President Vladimir Putin. Notably Beijing waited till a day after Yevgeni Prigozhin's armed insurrection was over China's Foreign Ministry posting on its website this.
 
This is Russia's internal affair as Russia's friendly -- and comprehensive strategic partner of coordination for the new era. China supports Russia in maintaining national stability and achieving development and prosperity.
 
Meantime, relations between the U.S. and China took a bit of a hit after Beijing issued a diplomatic reprimand over U.S. President Joe Biden comparing Chinese President Xi Jinping to a dictator at a political fundraiser last week. On Sunday, CNN's Dana Bash spoke to the U.S. Secretary of State about the controversy. Blinken has recently returned from a trip to Beijing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It's very clear that when it comes to China, we are going to do and say things that they don't like. They are going to do and say things that we don't like. If you look at what comes out of the Chinese Foreign Ministry every day about the United States, you'd hear plenty of that.
 
But the purpose of the trip at the President's instruction was to try to bring a little bit more stability to the relationship to demonstrate that we're committed to managing it responsibly, which really is an obligation for us and an expectation that countries around the world have and to be able to deal very directly with our differences.
 
There's no secret about those differences. There's no secret about concerns we have about democracy, about human rights, about some of the actions that China is taking around the world. And being able to have better stronger sustained lines of communication means we can talk about these differences directly.
 
We can work through them where we can, but at the very least, avoid misunderstandings avoid miscalculations, that's the fastest way to go from the competition we're in to a conflict we want to avoid. So I think on those terms, the visit was positive. And again, one of the things I told the Chinese is that we're going to continue to do things and to say things that you don't like.
 
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Do you believe --
 
BLINKEN: Just we're going to do the same and we'll work through them. BASH: Do you believe that Xi Jinping is a dictator?
 
BLINKEN: The President speaks clearly. He speaks candidly. I've worked for him for more than 20 years, and he speaks for all of us.

RON NIRENBERG, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS MAYOR: There are multiple investigations underway. I will tell you that the body cam footage was very disturbing. It disturbed the Police Chief enough that he has already fired those police officers or placed them on leave and so again off the streets.
 
But with regard to the investigation now I'll tell you that it is very disturbing. Murder charges have already been filed so those police officers while they still are obviously given due process. They're no longer on the job in terms of patrolling the streets of San Antonio.

VAUSE: And the San Antonio Police Chief says the woman was having a mental health crisis at the time of the shooting. CNN's Mike Valerio has details and a warning his report includes disturbing images.
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we need to start with a victim who is at the center of this case, Melissa Perez, 46 years old she's a mother and she was having a mental health crisis very early on Friday morning just after midnight.
 
She was cutting according to law enforcement authorities, the wires of her apartments' fire alarm system. So firefighters show up at that very early morning hour and they asked her hey, what's going on? What are you doing, cutting the wires to the fire alarm system?
 
And she tells the firefighters she was cutting those wires because she thought that the FBI was listening to her. So it's very apparent that she needed help. Officers show up to that scene though, and they determined among themselves that they need to charge her with criminal mischief a felony count for cutting those wires.
 
She is scared though. She goes into her apartment and she grabs a hammer. She moves closer to her apartment window twice and in both of those instances, officers open fire two volleys of gunshots that lead her.
 
Now we're going to show you about 20 seconds of the body camera footage there's an unsettling exchange of words between the victim and an officer. And then those two volleys of gunfire here it is.

VAUSE: In Canberra, Australia, Russia has just lost its appeal to build a new embassy a stone's throw from Australia's Parliament House. The government passed legislation to prevent Russia from using that land, claiming a potential national security threat. CNN's Angus Watson joins me now from Sydney. So, Angus, where do they go from here? Does Russia have any other recourse now?
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN PRODUCER: Well, John, the strange conclusion to this story might just have arrived. Australian affiliates are reporting that a lone Russian diplomat who is squatted on the site of this previously proposed new Russian Embassy in Canberra has now left. He was spotted last week after the Australian government moved to evict Russia from the side. He was spotted coming out of a small cabin on the construction site to smoke cigarettes and pick up take-away food orders. The government didn't quite know what to do with him because he had diplomatic immunity. So, a Police car was out front, and in the end, they just waited him out. He left today after the Australian High Court threw out Russia's application to challenge the Australian Government on the eviction.
 
Now, as you say, the Australian government had decided that it was a national security threat to have Russia so close to Australia's Parliament building. Russia already has a diplomatic compounded Embassy in the Australian capital. It wanted a new one. That one was going to be 400 meters away from Parliament. Australia was worried about the possibility of eavesdropping, of spying taking place at that site, and moved quickly to legislate to give it the power to turf Russia out. Russia responded badly calling Australia "Russophobic", and taking it to the High Court. Today, the High Court judge ruled that Russia's application was flimsy at best and they don't have a leg to stand on here, John. VAUSE: They really have nowhere else to go after that ruling. Angus, thanks very much, Angus Watson live in Sydney.
 
Well, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has undergone surgery for breast cancer. The UK Press Association reports her operation was successful. She is now recovering with family in Windsor. A spokesman for the Duchess told the PA she is receiving the best medical care. Her prognosis is good.
 
Security forces are gearing up as the Hajj gets underway in Saudi Arabia, and it could be one for the record books. More than two million Muslims from around the world are expected to take part this year. But, along with the crowds, there will also be the heat, temperatures nearing 45 degrees Celsius. That's around 110 Fahrenheit. Saudi authorities have placed thousands of paramedics on standby. Health workers will be available to treat cases of heatstroke, dehydration and exhaustion. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Muslims undertake it at least once in their lifetimes, if they have the means.
 
And finally from the WNBA, the Phoenix Mercury announced today that Brittney Griner will be a starter at next month's All-Star game in Vegas. In fact, her now nine career All-Star game selections are more than any other starting All-Star. This comes just six months after Griner was released from Russia as part of a prison swap. Griner spent nearly 300 days in jail on what the U.S. calls a bogus drug charge. The All-Star game will be played in Las Vegas July 15. You're watching CNN Newsroom. I'm John Vause.

VAUSE: Coming up here on CNN Newsroom, Monday in Moscow, still no sign on Kremlin leaders, including Vladimir Putin, and the head of the mutinous mercenaries, Yevgeny Prigozhin, also laying low. Well, Russia may have stepped back from the threat of civil war. The consequences of this rare and brief armed rebellion will likely play out for months or longer, raising questions about Putin's ironclad grip on power. And confusion and uncertainty too over the future of Prigozhin and many of his Wagner mercenaries. Will they regroup in exile in Belarus?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center this is CNN Newsroom with John Vause.
 
VAUSE: Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Thank you for joining us. We begin with the aftermath of Russia's short-lived armed rebellion and growing questions about Vladimir Putin's absolute grip on power. Calm appears to return to Moscow this Monday after a weekend military rebellion by Wagner mercenaries marching on the capital. The uprising, though, came to a sudden end Saturday with an 11th-hour deal brokered by Belarus. And since then, the head of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has not been seen nor heard. His news service tells CNN he will answer questions when he has what they say is proper communication. There is much which remains unknown about the insurrection.
 
But, one thing is clear. The open rebellion is the most profound crisis Vladimir Putin has faced during his 23-year-long rule, and the U.S. Secretary of State says the turmoil may not --
