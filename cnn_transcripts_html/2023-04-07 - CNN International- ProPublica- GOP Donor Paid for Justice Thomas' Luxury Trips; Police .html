JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: This latest episode involving the lavish trips that Justice Thomas took, but did not disclose, touches directly on concerns about the Supreme Court's integrity and why the justices do not have a formal code of ethics. 
 
These kinds of off-bench activities have been cropping up more and more. But this report is probably one of the most staggering. ProPublica after an extensive investigation found that Justice Thomas has benefited from travel and lodging at these lush hotels provided by a private individual on a scale like no other Supreme Court justice has. 
 
Harlan Crow is a major Republican donor who has an interest in reshaping the judiciary. At his expense, Thomas and his wife, Ginni, took trips to Indonesia, New Zealand and other places across the world. These trips were not disclosed, and in fact, remained largely secret until now.
 
There's some ambiguity about what Justice Thomas should have disclosed under federal law. The justices currently put only minimal amounts of information on their annual financial disclosure forms. They also have no formal ethics code or a way for the public to lodge complaints, ethics complaints against the justices and have them resolved in some way. The justices say that they abide by rules for lower court judges, but it's very difficult for the public to know if they do. 
 
In 2011, the last time Chief Justice John Roberts addressed the ethics issue, he said, essentially trust us. We follow rules that lower court judges use. He said he had confidence in all of his colleagues. But he has been essentially silent since then, even though these questionable activities keep coming to public light. Neither Chief Justice John Roberts nor Justice Thomas responded to our questions after the ProPublica report. 
 
Earlier this year, we learned of extensive efforts undertaken by Thomas's wife, Ginni, to try to reverse the 2020 election results that landed Joe Biden in the White House. Justice Thomas did not recuse himself from election related cases. 
 
Step back and consider how much concentrated power over American lives rest with the Supreme Court, these nine justices. Public approval of the court has been dropping, particularly since it reversed nearly a half century of precedent in the June Dobbs decision. That ruling reverse Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that had declared a constitutional right to abortion. 
 
Harlan Crow said that in a statement -- first given to ProPublica, and then to CNN -- that he and his other guests did not discuss cases with Thomas. But consider the access that these corporate and conservative leaders had to Justice Thomas. And also consider the appearance that justices could be vulnerable to such gifts of travel and hospitality. Unreported gifts as they were. Maybe this latest episode will lead the high court to finally adopt some formal rules, or at least to respond to questions and be more transparent about their off-bench behavior.

BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: A new round of nationwide protests in France against the government's pension reforms escalated into clashes and scuffles with police on Thursday. The French interior minister says more than 150 police officers were injured, some of them seriously. Authorities detained more than 100 people. Across the country, nearly 600,000 people took part in the protests. 
 
FOSTER: This was the scene as protesters targeted a well-known financial company in Paris for its ties to private pension funds. 
 
CNN senior producer Saskya Vandoorne joins us from Paris. The images we saw last night looked really dramatic. How did it turn out, Saskya? 
 
SASKYA VANDOORNE, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: Yes, well, Max, you know there was a big turnout yesterday -- has been lower than previous protests, but half a million people, you know, is significant. 
 
And so now, France has become used to these kind of scenes, and yesterday the protest began peacefully. It was almost festive. And then of course these scuffles did break out. We have seen in, you know, the previous weeks this kind of radical fringe get bigger. And their aim really is to take on the police. But as, you know, I really want to kind of underline that as a whole, the protests have been rather peaceful. 
 
And so now we need to talk about how this will affect Macron. What happens next? So next week there'll be more protests on Thursday and then on Friday, crucially, the Constitutional Council will rule if this pension reform is greenlit or whether it's unconstitutional. We expect this to be just a formality, but we'll have to wait and see. 
 
So, the question is, if it is green lit, and then the protests perhaps died down. What does Macron do next? His popularity is really low at the moment. The last time it was this low, was during the yellow vest protests. So, what can he do to win back the trust and to get that popularity back? Take a listen to what the head of the CGT union had to say about Macron. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOPHIE BINET, GENERAL SECRETARY, GENERAL FEDERATION OF LABOUR (through translator): Today wanting to force through this reform creates chaos. Emmanuel Macron was the president of the rich, and now he is the president of chaos. And so, I think that the wisdom of the Constitutional Council should be to do with the head of state obviously refuses to do. That is, to say to consider that in order to move on for the country to start to run again serenely, the reform must be withdrawn. There was no other way out than that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:35:04]
 
VANDOORNE: So, Macron, maybe in China right now, but this really is the biggest challenge facing his presidency and they will continue to protest until they feel that they are heard. The question is, will Macron listen -- Max.
 
FOSTER: Yes, so this is a big question. Where does he go from here? Even if he does, you know, overcome this last hurdle in pushing this reform through. 
 
VANDOORNE: Well, I think that's the problem. He hasn't really offered any kind of solution or exit to the crisis. You know, the last time his popularity was this low was during the yellow vest protests in 2018. And back then he kind of organized these great town halls to listen to people voice their concerns, voice their grievances. But he hasn't suggested anything this time around. 
 
And what all the trade unions are asking for is really just for the reform to, you know, be put out the window. The head of the CFDT trade union was just saying this morning that they will respect what the Constitutional Council says, but that that will not stop them from protesting -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Saskya in Paris. Thank you so much for that. 
 
NOBILO: Britain's military intelligence believes that Russian attacks are gaining more traction in Bakhmut. 
 
FOSTER: The Ukrainian military released this video showing troops fighting house to house in damaged buildings. But British intelligence says it believes Russian troops have, quote, regained some momentum there and have likely advanced into the city center. 
 
NOBILO: Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials and making it clear that they're not ready for any territorial concessions to Russia. That appears to walk back remarks from the top presidential adviser who suggested to the "Financial Times" that Crimea could be up for negotiation. 
 
The Ukrainian aircraft producer wants to get the world's largest plane back in the sky. The Antonov 225 was one of a kind, which Ukraine built in the 1980s. It was an engineering marvel before it was destroyed in the early days of the war. But as David McKenzie reports, Ukraine is not ready to give up on it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The first hours of the war, Russian elite forces descending on Hostomel Airport outside Kyiv. Their intended launch pad to the capital, it didn't work out. Ukrainian forces famously pushed the Russians back, and they made a discovery at Hostomel, the pride of Ukraine, the remarkable AN-225 or Mriya cargo plane gutted in the fighting.
 
CAPTAIN YEVHEN BASHYNSKY, PILOT: You know, it was feeling like you were part of something great.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): It's the first-time pilot Yevhen Bashynsky has come back.
 
MCKENZIE: Yevhen, coming back here, it must be quite hard for you. What's the emotion like?
 
BASHYNSKY: It's very hard to be here, and to see all this situations, destroyed planes, destroyed hangers, it's quite hard to see.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): The Ukrainian Antonov Company says it wants to rebuild this one of the kind giant, no matter what it takes. Designer Valeriy Kostyuk says they've already retrieved much of what they can use.
 
MCKENZIE: You can feel the extraordinary size of this plane inside the fuselage. And Mriya was the heaviest plane in the world. That it could carry up to 250 tons inside or even on top.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Designed to transport the Soviet-era Buran spacecraft, the Antonov Company refurbished the Mriya multiple times. With six turbofan engines, each with more than 50,000 pounds of thrust, and a 32-wheel landing gear system, the Mriya was a marvel, an outsized hit with plane spotters and aviation enthusiasts.
 
MCKENZIE: When you were flying this plane, so many people wanted to take photos of it, follow it. What was that like?
 
BASHYNSKY: I was feeling great responsibility, not only to operate this plane properly, correctly, but it was also a great responsibility because you're attracting a lot of attention. A few days after, you can open the YouTube and see, oh, what have you done.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): But, to put Mriya back in the sky, the Antonov Company says it could cost nearly a billion dollars and take years. But for Ukrainians, it's a point of pride. 
 
David McKenzie, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine.

NOBILO: A Moscow court has set a date to hear an appeal of the arrest of an American journalist. That is, according to Russian state media, which cited the court. Evan Gershkovich is a reporter for the "Wall Street Journal," and he faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. 
 
FOSTER: But "The Journal" vehemently denied the charges, calling it a, quote, vicious affront to a free press. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
The court will hear the appeal on April 18th. His arrest marks a significant escalation of both Moscow's tensions with the U.S. and its campaign against foreign news media. 
 
NOBILO: Coming up, China is renewing its friendship with France as tensions between Beijing and Washington rise over the Taiwanese leaders visit to the United States. 
 
FOSTER: And later Easter week services are underway for Christians around the world. Just ahead, the symbolic right that Pope Francis performed for Holy Thursday and what he's expected to do later today for Good Friday. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: French President Emmanuel Macron is wrapping up a three-day visit to China. During the trip, he and President Xi Jinping struck a deal on nuclear and wind energy. 
 
FOSTER: They also discussed solutions to end the war in Ukraine. Mr. Macron is hoping for a breakthrough and counting on President Xi to reason with Russia. Will he get that? Let's ask CNN's Marc Stewart who joins us live from Tokyo. What do you think -- Marc? 
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Max. Good morning, Bianca. Let's keep in mind from the start this was described as a diplomatic visit. Not so much an opportunity for France to sculpt China. 
 
But among the headlines that we are reporting, according to a French diplomatic source, President XI has agreed to talk to Volodymyr Zelenskyy when the time is right. So, let's perhaps seen as a as a moment of optimism. 
 
But make no mistake. There are distinct differences between these two nations and their approach to the war in Ukraine. President Macron is blaming Russia for disrupting the peace in Europe. On the other hand, we have China and President Xi trying to take a hands-off neutral approach yet not going far, according to some, to condemn Russia for the invasion. We also had seen diplomatic ties and economic ties between China and Russia actually strengthened during this time of war. 
 <br>[04:45:00] So, so far, big takeaway, lots of -- lots of words but no substantial action from this meeting. That would be a game changer in the direction of this conflict. Max and Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: And Marc, as ever Taiwan is still a point of friction, especially right now, as U.S. lawmakers are actually arriving in Taipei with a not particularly subtle message for China. 
 
STEWART: Indeed, as we see several U.S. lawmakers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, have been spending time in Taiwan. Their message is going to be based on security, investment, financial matters and, of course, regional stability. And it comes at a time -- where, as we have been reporting in recent weeks -- Taiwan is really fighting to find diplomatic allies around the world. It was just a few weeks ago that Honduras tied -- cut its ties with Taiwan in favor of China. 
 
So, as we have seen by President Tsai Ing-wen's trip to the United States, and then this reverse trip by lawmakers, it's all an attempt to let Taiwan know, it does have allies despite the might of China behind it. 
 
NOBILO: Marc Stewart, thank you. 
 
FOSTER: A search is underway for 10 people on board a Japanese military helicopter. The country's defense minister says the chopper crashed on Thursday off the coast of southern Japan. It disappears from radar near Okinawa, Miyako Island. 
 
NOBILO: So far, crews have found parts of a window frame door and rotor blade. Those on board included two pilots, two mechanics and six passengers. One was a senior commander of Japan's Ground Self Defense Force. 
 
Still ahead, the Masters is underway at Augusta National. We'll check the leaderboard and see how five-time champion Tiger Woods is faring. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: It is good Friday, one of the most somber days on the Christian calendar commemorating Jesus' crucifixion, and Pope Francis will preside over the Way of the Cross today at the colosseum in Rome. 
 
NOBILO: Yesterday, the pontiff lead Holy Thursday services, he washed and kissed the feet of 12 people at a local juvenile jail. The 10 boys and two girls were seated on high platforms so the Pope didn't have to kneel down. Pope Francis has ongoing knee issues and has trouble walking. The ceremonial recalls when Jesus washed his disciples' feet at the Last Summer. 
 
There is rain forecast for Augusta, Georgia today, which could put a dampener on the second round of the Masters. Right now, three golfers share the lead, American, Brooks Koepka, Norway's Viktor Hovland and Spain's Jon Rahm, all under seven par. 
 
FOSTER: Tiger Woods is nine shots back, complaining of a sore leg after the first day. CNN's Don Riddell reports from Augusta National. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: A really difficult day for Tiger Woods during his opening round at the Masters. A 74, a two over par score would have fallen well short of his expectations. And given that it was such a glorious day here, it was more than 80 degrees sunshine from start to finish. Given that the weather is going to change, it's going to be wetter and much, much cooler. Tiger perhaps knows that he's missed his chance.
 
TIGER WOODS, FIVE-TIME MASTERS CHAMPION: Well, I feel like I drove it good. I just didn't do the job I needed to do and get the ball close. Today was the opportune time to get the ball -- get the round under par and I didn't do that today. Most of the guys are going low today. This is - this was the day to do it. 
 
Hopefully, tomorrow I'll be a little bit better, a little bit sharper and kind of inched my way through it. I mean, this is going to be an interesting finish to determine with the weather coming in. If I can just kind of hang in there. Maybe kind of inch my way back. Hopefully, it'll be positive towards the end.
 
RIDDELL: You know, Tiger Woods hasn't missed the cut at Augusta since the mid-90s. But he's got it all to do if he wants to play a part of the proceedings here this weekend.
 
So, a difficult day for Tiger Woods, not so much for one of his playing partners, Norway's Viktor Hovland. He shot a brilliant 65 with an eagle on the second and he never looked back from there. So, a seven-underpass score for Viktor Hovland. The World Number three Jon Rahm, he had a double bogey on his first hole, also ended up with a 65, So, a superb comeback performance from Jon Rahm.
 
And what about Brooks Koepka? He might just be the story of the opening day. Koepka is one of these breakaway rebel LIV golf players. His game has really been in the wilderness for a few years. But he won on the LIV tour in Orlando at the weekend. He came out and shot a 65. And he could be a key part of the conversation over the next few days. As the narrative continues between the LIV guys versus the PGA tour guys, that would certainly make things very interesting. Back to you.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: It must be very frustrating for the winners because we always end up talking about Tiger Woods, even when he's not winning. 
 
NOBILO: Ah, well that's a big conversation in the golf world. Which I know all too well. Do you know what impact that rain would have on the greens? It would get wetter. 
 
NOBILO: Yes, but what does that do to the balls? 
 
FOSTER: It makes it go faster -- slower.
 
NOBILO: No, it makes it go slower. Now here's a look at some of the stories trending this hour. 
 
Actor Hugh Jackman has been given the all clear after a cancer scare. Jackman revealed this news on Instagram, saying that biopsies for possible skin cancer came back negative. The Australian actor has been treated for basal cell carcinoma in the past before getting the good news. He urged fans to be safe in the sun.

HUGH JACKMAN, ACTOR: If I can just take this opportunity to remind you summer is coming for those of us here in the northern hemisphere. Please wear sunscreen. It is just not worth it. No matter how much you want a tan, trust me, trust me, trust me. This is all stuff that happened 25 years ago, it's coming out now. Put some sunscreen on. You'll still have a incredible time out there. All right, please be safe.

NOBILO: That was the moment SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida into orbit. It's carrying a new NASA device called "Tempo" that we're told will be able to monitor air pollution over North America more closely than ever before. It will reportedly be able to track down the community level and even offer hourly updates. 
 
FOSTER: Sounds groundbreaking. An amateur mathematician appears to have solved a geometry problem that has puzzled scientists for more than 60 years. He's come up with a 13-sided shape, called the "hat" because it looks like one. It also is dubbed an "einstein," not for the physicist, but the German for one stone apparently. 
 
NOBILO: It means it can cover a surface without a repeated pattern. That's a first for a single tile. The creator, a retired printing technician, got help from a math professor and two other academics. The shape will not be copyrighted so that everyone can enjoy working with it in decorative arts and architecture. 
 
FOSTER: Tiling on the bathroom is going to look different. NOBILO: Absolutely. 
 
FOSTER: Animals in the U.K. Zoo on the hunt for Easter eggs. This is breaking news for you. The Whipsnade Zoo broke up lemurs, rhinos and wolverines on Thursday with an egg extravaganza. The rhino foraged for treats and brightly painted easter boxes. The lemurs went after papier-mache eggs filled with their favorite sweet potato goodies. And wolverines, Puff and Fi use their sharp claws to break pinatas stuff with meaty snacks. 
 
NOBILO: Well, you want to start going to the gym, so maybe you should be eating sweet potatoes rather than Easter eggs when you go on your easter holiday next week. 
 
FOSTER: Thanks for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster.
 
NOBILO: And I'm Bianca Nobilo. EARLY START is up next right here on CNN.
 
FOSTER: I'm being much more professional.</pre>
