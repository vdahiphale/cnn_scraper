(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, unfortunately, we are watching another deadly day of gun violence unfold in the United States. At 
 
 least five people have been killed in a mass shooting at a bank in downtown Louisville, Kentucky.
 
Several more people were wounded including one police officer. Authorities have confirmed the government is dead. Well, this shooting now happened 
 
 apparently before the bank opened this morning Omar Jimenez spoke earlier to my colleague, Sara Sidner.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Of course, Sara and you know, that's one thing that the police and investigators will be looking into, as far as you 
 
 know, why did this particular shooter do this and that timing, of course, very key?
 
Now, one thing we've gotten from police is we just got that as to this point, you said it was around 8:30 is exactly correct calls came in for an 
 
 act of aggressor as it was described initially, around 8:30 this morning at the Old National Bank.
 
We know this was an active shooter officers came on the scene within minutes, the lone shooter as described by Louisville Police has been killed 
 
 and then the total killed is five at least six more were transported to the hospital.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: And as Omar made the points, sadly these numbers can rise. Of course, I want to bring in CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst Charles 
 
 Ramsey. Let's just talk about what we do know at this point and then perhaps we can talk about what we don't - we are, by the way, viewers 
 
 expecting news conferences by both local politicians and police and we'll bring you those as and when we get them. Let's start with what we do know 
 
 sir at this point. What do we understand us the details here?
 
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, what we understand so far is around 8:30 am Eastern Time, an individual entered the 
 
 Old National Bank now it's unclear whether or not this was a former employee, if the bank was even open at that particular point in time?
 
ANDERSON: OK, sir I'm going to stop you there with respect. I'm just going to get to the Deputy Chief Officer Paul Humphrey, who is speaking now let's 
 
 listen this.
 
COL. PAUL HUMPHREY, DEPUTY CHIEF, LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE: --exchange gunshots with our suspect and ultimately that suspect did die at the scene. 
 
 We're trying to confirm if that suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or was killed by officers at this time?
 
At least two officers were shot during this exchange of gunfire. One is currently in surgery at University of Louisville Hospital. At least four 
 
 more victims were confirmed to be deceased inside the location, as well as eight that are now currently being treated at University Hospital.
 
Two are critical one of those being the officer. We're currently working to identify all of the victims work with their families for reunification and 
 
 provide services to the families and the victims. The investigation I want to reiterate is ongoing.
 
This will be a long scene. It will take pretty much into the night. So I'll still ask that the public avoid the area. I want to reiterate that there is 
 
 no active threat. We believe this is a lone gunman involved in this that did have a connection to the bank.
 
We're trying to establish what that connection was to the business but it appears he was a previous employee. It is clear from the officer's response 
 
 that they absolutely save people's lives. This is a tragic event.
 
But it was the heroic response of officers that made sure that no more people were more seriously injured than what happened. We will continue to 
 
 provide updates as soon as possible. We will have another press briefing following this at 3 pm today. I will turn it over to Mayor Greg Greenberg 
 
 at this time.
 
CRAIG GREENBERG, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY MAYOR: Thank you Deputy Chief Humphrey! First I ask that everyone around our city around the country 
 
 around the world pray with us for those who are currently at Louisville Hospital injured, fighting for their lives as a result of another act of 
 
 gun violence.
 
I want to thank all of the first responders the brave and heroic men and women of LMPD who thanks to their efforts, quickly responded to the 
 
 emergency call. And as you just heard from Deputy Chief Humphrey, without a doubt their actions saved lives.
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
There will be a lot more information we are able to provide as the day goes on. But I want everyone in this city to know that notwithstanding tragedies 
 
 like today, when multiple people are killed by gun violence notwithstanding tragedies when individuals are killed by gun violence, our community will 
 
 continue to come together.
 
We will find ways to love and support one another and the families and friends who have been directly impacted by these acts of gun violence. And 
 
 we will come together as a community to work to prevent these horrific acts of gun violence from continuing here and around the state.
 
I want to thank again, everyone at LMPD from the Louisville Fire Department, from EMS, from the state agencies and now federal agencies that 
 
 are also involved. We are a safer community. We are a stronger community, thanks to the work of our law enforcement.
 
And again, my prayers go out to the families who have lost loved ones today. My prayers go out to the officers who are at the hospital right now 
 
 and my thanks for all of them. Through with together, we will get through this together. Finally, I want to introduce Governor Bashir, who has joined 
 
 us and who is assisting with the efforts Governor?
 
ANDERSON: All right. Four dead at least eight hurt in a Louisville bank shooting. A lone gunman has been shot dead at the scene. Police believe 
 
 that gunman could have been a former bank worker, let's bring back our guest Charles Ramsey.
 
Charles you were speaking earlier on about the details as we understood them and what we don't know as of yet. You just heard from the Deputy 
 
 Police Chief here. What did you make of what you heard?
 
RAMSEY: Well, I mean, it was a lot of new information. In fact that they believe this individual was a former employee. As I was speaking before, it 
 
 wasn't clear whether or not the bank was open for business at 8:30 am or if this individual gain access to some other way?
 
If he's a former employee, then he may have been able to gain access, before the bank was actually officially open. Four dead originally they 
 
 said five that fifth could be the shooter. We don't count the shooter as a victim.
 
And then eight injured, including two police officers were previously we thought it was only one. All those individuals are describing as hurt. It's 
 
 probably a combination of gunshot wounds, and maybe some injuries that occurred during the chaos that's created whenever you have an active 
 
 shooter situation take place.
 
So it's unfolding, it's still moving forward. There's a lot of information yet to be learned officially. But at least we know that this seems now to 
 
 be a more targeted shooting as opposed to just a random act of violence.
 
ANDERSON: And tell us I mean you're steeped with experience, of course, what will authorities be doing now?
 
RAMSEY: Well, what they'll be doing now is one I think the individual responsible for this the actual shooter from some of the footage that I'm 
 
 sure you've seen they've got part of a parking lot roped off, probably because the individual who came to that location drove a vehicle.
 
So they've got to get a search warrant go through that vehicle. They'll go through the individual's home with a search warrant. They will be looking 
 
 at social media. They'll be doing all kinds of things to try to determine a motive and learn more about this individual.
 
But from all indications now this is a lone gunman, no longer a threat to anyone in the Louisville area but again, just one more tragedy that we have 
 
 to live through here in the United States that just makes absolutely no sense the amount of gun violence that takes place here.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, as you rightly point out, you know, another mass shooting, the numbers continue to skyrocket. The Deputy Police Chief in his remarks 
 
 and his remarks were relatively short just giving me the details as he understood them.
 
He commended the actions of police officers. Two of them as we know have now been injured in this. I mean the speed at which the police seem to have 
 
 responded to this does seem quite remarkable and it is likely as the Police - Deputy Police Chief pointed out that they saved lives.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
RAMSEY: Well, there's no question about that. I mean response and an active shooter situation is critical. There was a very quick response apparently. 
 
 They had to make forced entry into the location in order to confront the gunman.
 
Obviously, there was an exchange of gunfire. Two officers wounded, the individual is now dead. It's not clear whether or not that was self-
 
 inflicted, or if it was as a result of police gunfire? But had he been allowed to continue even more individuals, no doubt would have been 
 
 seriously injured or killed as a result of their actions.
 
So the fast response is something that officers trained for, unfortunately, in the United States get a lot of practice here because we have so many of 
 
 these types of situations but each one is always that timing and time response is always critical, because the longer it takes the more people 
 
 that can be injured or killed as a result.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you sir. Thank you very much indeed for joining us.
 
RAMSEY: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: And as we get more on that situation, we will bring it to you. We are going to take a very short break at this point back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Israel's military has released video of a deadly raid in a West Bank Refugee Camp. Palestinian health officials say a 15-year-old boy was 
 
 killed and two others wounded by Israeli military fire. The military says soldiers opened fire after they were attacked by people throwing Molotov 
 
 cocktails.
 
Well, this coming on the day that Israel's far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir joined settlers marching to legalize outpost in 
 
 the West Bank. Well over the weekend, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Tel Aviv again protesting Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to 
 
 overhaul the judiciary.
 
The Prime Minister's plans to change the balance of power in the country are coming at cost. The Bank of Israel says damage to the economy could be 
 
 as much as 2.8 percent of its GDP over the next three years. Now this is a worst case scenario characterized by extreme disruption of investment. 
 
 There is still of course, a high level of uncertainty as to how all of this will play out?
 
Well. I want to bring in Israel's Economy Minister Nir Barkat live from Jerusalem. Earlier this year, you dismissed fears that Israel's judicial 
 
 reform plans would harm the economy and trigger a brain drain. Do you still stand by that sir given what we have seen to date?
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
NIR BARKAT, ISRAELI ECONOMY MINISTER: Well, first of all, Becky, Happy Passover! Happy Easter and Ramadan Kareem to all your viewers!
 
ANDERSON: Thank you.
 
BARKAT: With your permission, before we discuss I answer you, I want to remind you that we had the third victim today from the same family. The 
 
 mother, Leila (ph) was an English teacher; they came to Israel just a few years ago. And their daughter was a volunteer, helping the elderly and the 
 
 other daughter, the two daughters the third one was a volunteer with youth movements.
 
They unfortunately, when the mother died just a few hours ago, they donated the organs to save other people's lives. And on the other side, the 
 
 terrorists that killed that family were greeted with candy, and flowers.
 
And you know what they're going to get from the Palestinian Authority? Million dollars for the rest of their lives for killing innocent Jews 
 
 that's the difference between living as Jews seeking life and making better life for other people and the terrorists that all they seek is death. 
 
 That's the huge difference between us. And that's very unfortunate.
 
ANDERSON: Nir, I think it's really important that you point out, yes and it's so important that you point out the level of violence on all sides, 
 
 let's be quite clear here. We are seeing people dying, who simply shouldn't be losing their lives.
 
We see that and we have seen a relative and I have to say, I mean, I use the term judiciously here, a relatively calm weekend after so much fear of 
 
 it being a real flashpoint weekend, you pointed out the beginning of this.
 
This is Passover, Easter, and Ramadan, all coming at the same time. So the incidents that we are talking about here, relatively isolated, over what 
 
 could have been or there were certainly fears that it could have been so much worse this weekend. But every life loss is a life that we should 
 
 consider.
 
I want to talk to you about this judicial reform Nir because I do - the question of the hour. We've seen this violence, as we have also seen, of 
 
 course, these huge protests in, you know, against the government's plans for significant judicial reform.
 
I just wonder, you know, the question is always how much concern is there inside the country about the cost to Israel's economy at this point? And I 
 
 think, you know, it's fair to say, you know, the economy can be hurt by both these issues.
 
The judicial reform and what we are seeing on one side, of course, this dreadful violence that we are seeing on the other. You're the Economy 
 
 Minister so let's just address that question, if we can?
 
BARKAT: That was a long question. In short, I'm proud of the democracy in Israel. I'm very proud of our democracy. People care about our future. They 
 
 go to the street. Some of them want to create the reforms for the benefit of a better democracy, and others are concerned about the democracy, but 
 
 they're proud and they go to the streets.
 
We will sort it out. The Prime Minister asked for time to have further discussions between the two parties. And I have no doubt in my mind that we 
 
 will sort this out because we all care about our country. It comes from the good from understanding that it's a real democracy can go out in the 
 
 street, and demonstrate.
 
By the way, we're not the only country that has sometimes polarized views in the United States, between Republicans and Democrats and Brexit for and 
 
 against Brexit - but we're very strong democracy--
 
ANDERSON: And of course there are being - yes. That I understand - with Poland and Hungary. Let me put this to you that - has already fallen 
 
 sharply. Go on, please.
 
BARKAT: As Minister of Economy, I speak to people all over the world. They recognize the huge potential of Israel. They understand that we're by far 
 
 the leading entrepreneurial country in the world. We have great technology, and we understand how to make a better world.
 
So the world is interested in investing. They understand that short term, our democracy is thriving and there are challenges internally, but there's 
 
 no doubt in my mind that the potential of Israel will overcome and I'm very proud. I know I was entrepreneur myself, remind you from coming from the 
 
 high tech sector, and I see the future. 
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
ANDERSON: This is, of course, the live TV. And I'm going to see whether we can get our guests back. Because, you know, I remember Nir Barkat being, 
 
 you know, a great entrepreneur, it's good to have you back, sir. I think I've got you back and you are explaining your background as a, as a very 
 
 successful entrepreneur.
 
So, it will be painful for you as Economy Minister, of course, to see the fall in the shackle that's a steep drop this year. Western companies had 
 
 invested billions of dollars in Israel have expressed growing concern about a lack of confidence.
 
BARKAT: Becky, we have a bigger problem.
 
ANDERSON: I hear what you're - let me finish the question. I hear way where you're at. And I understand your enthusiasm for sort of underpinning this 
 
 conversation with a sense of optimism. But does it not worry you that figure that Israeli investors have lost some $26 billion dollars; since the 
 
 overhaul was announced in January is a significant number, sir.
 
BARKAT: Smart investors see through this issue and understand that anybody and everybody that invested in Israel in the past one big time, so I would 
 
 recommend investors to look beyond the curve. But we had a bigger problem, Becky, not only Israel, but the whole world. And that is Iran.
 
Everything that is now going around Israel's' orchestrated by the regime in Iran, that wants to create a nuclear bomb, to use it, to eliminate Israel 
 
 off the map. And they're using their proxies, currently against Israel. But they're the leading supporter of terror around the world.
 
And you know, what they call us, we're in Israel with a little Satan. You know, the big Satan is the United States of America and Europe is in the 
 
 same line. And we must understand that terror is terror is terror. We have to fight and combat terror all over the world. And the Iranian regime is 
 
 using their proxies.
 
Currently, we again against Israel, and we have to fight them. We have to make sure they understand that if they use not only the nuclear threat, but 
 
 also the conventional threat of hundreds of thousands of rockets around Israel. And if they dare to hit Israel, we will hit them back not only the 
 
 Lebanese that are in proxy to Hezbollah. But we have together; the world has to unite against the Iranian regime.
 
ANDERSON: And you're a government minister, and I would expect you to - and as a government minister, I would expect you to raise that issue and you 
 
 have every right to do sir. I want to concentrate this conversation, specifically on the economy here.
 
The proposed reforms have been widely criticized by those in the tech industry, you're from that background, yourself, you will know many of 
 
 those who have been really very critical about what is going on. That tech industry makes up some 15 percent of the country's GDP.
 
CNN spoke to the Head of Viola Ventures and Israeli venture capital fund with over 1.3 billion under management Take a listen to what he had to say, 
 
 sir.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHLOMO DOVRAT, CO-FOUNDER &amp; GENERAL PARTNER, VIOLA VENTURES: If this reform passes in its current form, I hope reason will prevail. And I'd like to 
 
 believe that it will not. But if it does, Israel will become a much less attractive place for many people. And I'm concerned.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: And this is a man who never speaks to the press, does what he said concern you sir?
 
BARKAT: Well, Shlomo was a dear friend of mine, we come from the same background, and we speak a lot. And we both understand that Israel is the 
 
 only Jewish home and the Jewish democracy in the world, we have no choice but to succeed, we have no choice, but to figure this out.
 
And we have no choice but to invest in our future. And Shlomo and I meet a lot because we are focusing on solutions, how to resolve the conflicts and 
 
 the challenges. There's no doubt in my mind that the back wind that the prime minister is now giving us, we will be able to sort this out.
 
And we see me - Shlomo and I, how we can take that, you know, the challenges we have right now and turn them into a huge opportunity. And 
 
 Shlomo and I share that opportunity together.
 
ANDERSON: Right, let's just talk about the latest polling. Because I think this is important within the context of the discussion that we are having. 
 
 According to Channel 13 News poll supports the Prime Minister's Likud party has plummeted. Let me bring the numbers up for our viewers.
 
It indicates that if elections were held now Likud would win 20 seats down from the 30 to one five months ago and his religious nationalist coalition 
 
 would fail to gain a majority down to 46 from 64, with the previous Bennett Lapid government 64 seats enough to form a government. In light of this, do 
 
 you not think that the judicial reform plan was a mistake for Israel in general and for Likud in particular?
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
And will you continue to support the reforms? Or is there a situation where you would vote against at this point, given your position in defending the 
 
 economy here?
 
BARKAT: Well, Becky, we just had the elections almost half a year ago, and the new government is formed three months ago, only 100 days have passed. 
 
 So, they're no elections in the foreseeable future. The elections in Israel are every four years or so. And right now, the government is not at any 
 
 risk. So, the polls are irrelevant, what is relevant?
 
The government's not at any risk at this point. We are focusing on how to resolve the challenges that we have up front with us. We discussed that 
 
 just a while ago. And we've got very strong back win to figure this out and we will, and then focus on our economy, on Iran, on internal security, our 
 
 periphery, these are things that everyone, we got mandate to push through. And this is what we're focusing on.
 
And we're going to go through these times. There's no doubt in my mind, I'm a very optimistic guy, and I believe in the future of the state of Israel, 
 
 and so do all of us on both sides of the political map. So, I wouldn't focus on--
 
ANDERSON: Yes, and I met you a number of times and--
 
BARKAT: --propose meaningless.
 
ANDERSON: And I've always been struck by you're, by your optimism. Earlier today Israel's far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir join 
 
 thousands of Israeli settlers marching to what is an illegal outpost in the occupied West Bank. Is that not a provocative move to the Palestinians 
 
 given what is going on at present and the concern about the escalation of violence?
 
BARKAT: You know, unfortunately, the last Friday, you had a bunch of young men that came not with the Quran, to pray on the Temple Mount, but they 
 
 came with sticks and stones and bombs and fireworks and use them against the police. They weren't coming to pray on the Temple Mount, they meant 
 
 provocations.
 
Now, the folks that went to today for the march is that march is done for years already this is not the first time and they want to settle in the 
 
 home of the Holy Land of the State of Israel. Every put a shovel sent Judea and Samaria; you find Jewish roots there connecting the Jewish roots that 
 
 go 3000 years back. And so, they're not coming for provocation.
 
They're coming to connect to their homeland. And the Jews, the Israelis that live in Judea and Samaria, believe in the Bible. And you take a Bible 
 
 in your hand, you walk into the end scenario, the land speaks to you. So, they're there for the connecting to the Holy Land. They didn't come to make 
 
 any provocation on the contrary.
 
ANDERSON: Well, that's not the perspective of many people. But it's your perspective. And I appreciate you joining us today and giving us your 
 
 perspective on what are some really very important issues. You are always welcome on this show, sir, as are your colleagues in government. Thank you 
 
 very much indeed for joining us.
 
Next up the Pentagon's big problem, how the leak of classified documents is putting international relations under new strain. Plus, one of the 
 
 deadliest conflicts in the Middle East maybe heading towards a resolution what we know about new peace efforts in Yemen.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back, you're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me Becky Anderson. The time in Abu Dhabi where we are broadcasting to you is 7.30 in 
 
 the evening. Your headlines this hour, Palestinian health officials say Israeli forces killed a Palestinian teenager and wounded two other people 
 
 during a raid in the West Bank refugee camp.
 
Israel's military forces say its forces responded after the attack. They were attacked by people throwing Molotov cocktails. It says the camp was 
 
 raided to arrest a terror suspect. Israel's far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir spoke out as he joined settlers marching to 
 
 legalize an outpost in the West Bank.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ITAMAR BEN GVIR, ISRAELI NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER: Those who are strong in the face of terror and - will be strong in the face of terror and Tel 
 
 Aviv. This is our statement here. We must be strong in the face of terror both in - and in Tel Aviv.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: At least four people have been killed in a mass shooting in the U.S. state of Kentucky. Police say they responded quickly after the lone 
 
 gunman opened fire at a bank. The gunman is now dead. And officials say it appears he was a previous employee at the bank. Authorities say eight 
 
 people were wounded in the attack including two police officers.
 
China has wrapped up three days of military drills in the seas around Taiwan. The drills appear to have included simulations of an aerial attack 
 
 launched from Chinese aircraft carriers. The drills came after Taiwan's president visited the U.S. and Central America last week more on this story 
 
 in just a few minutes time.
 
Well, the U.S. is in damage control mode after the leak of highly classified intelligence documents onto social media. These documents 
 
 appeared last month on the social media platform discord according to screenshots of the posts reviewed by CNN. Taken together, they are 
 
 providing a rare window into how Washington spies on allies and foes alike.
 
South Korea now says discussions will be held with counterparts in the United States after some of the documents revealed a conversation between 
 
 South Korean national security officials over Ukraine. Kylie Atwood is live from the U.S. State Department with more.
 
Kylie on the fallout, do we have any further information on how these documents were leaked? And what information they include?
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, we don't know the source of these leaks yet. And that is an effort that's underway by the 
 
 Department of Justice and the FBI on the criminal side, and also by the Pentagon, because they're leading an interagency effort to assess you knows 
 
 how this information got out, and to also do a damage assessment of what was actually impacted as a result of this leak thus far.
 
And it's important to note that there are a widespread number of topics that were covered here. There are a lot of topics, excuse me a lot of 
 
 documents that have to do with the Ukraine war, Ukraine's weaponry, its military capability at this time. And there are particular concerns about 
 
 that information haven't been leaked out because these documents are from February and March.
 
So, they're pretty recent. And what they give the public eye is an understanding of where Ukraine may be, in terms of its military 
 
 capabilities that aren't so strong right now. And the concerning factor there is that they are preparing to mount an offensive in the Ukraine war 
 
 right now.
 
And so, if you give Russia a light into a vision into what the U.S. believes are Ukraine's capabilities in terms of its weaponry right now, 
 
 that isn't going to be good for its battlefield operations. Now, we've already heard from Ukraine saying that they're changing some of their 
 
 military plans because of these leaked documents.
 
And then of course there are documents that have to do with a plethora of other subjects including you know U.S. relations with its allies, with 
 
 Israel, with South Korea and the like. So, there's a lot of diplomatic fallout that we're expecting from this.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. Thank you. Well, for three days, Chinese ships and planes had been buzzing around Taiwan and military exercises that have 
 
 raised tensions in the region. China now says the exercises are over. The first time ever, it appeared to include a simulation of a Chinese aircraft 
 
 carrier carrying out strikes on Taiwan more from CNN's Selina Wang.
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: China launched three days of military exercises around Taiwan after the island's president met the U.S. House 
 
 Speaker. Chinese military said the drills create an all-around in circumvent of the island and simulate precision attacks on key targets.
 
In reaction to the military drills, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said China's "Provocative measures have clearly challenged the 
 
 international order undermine peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait and the region".
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WANG (voice over): China's fighter jets fly around Taiwan skies, military ships sail off its coast, China says it's simulating precision attacks on 
 
 key targets in Taiwan. While Beijing has not launched any missiles, its military released this animation showing missiles fired from land, sea and 
 
 air into Taiwan to have them explode in flames.
 
Beijing is showing the world its fury, launching the three days of military exercises around Taiwan after the Islands President Tsai Ing-wen met with 
 
 U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. For the first time it appears Chinese simulated strikes with war planes that took off from an 
 
 aircraft carrier.
 
This video shows Taiwan's Coast Guard confronting a Chinese ship. The Taiwanese sailor says you are now seriously damaging regional peace, 
 
 stability and safety. Please turn around immediately and leave. If you keep proceeding forward, I will take eviction measures. We encounter 
 
 highlighting the risks of any miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait.
 
Beijing sees democratically ruled Taiwan as a part of its territory that will eventually be reunified with the mainland. Chinese military said the 
 
 drills are "a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces collusion with external forces and unnecessary move to defend national 
 
 sovereignty".
 
Experts say Beijing is normalizing military activity around the island. It already says military jets and ships around Taiwan every day. On China's 
 
 heavily censored social media, some are commenting that the drills do not go far enough. One writes, let's just take Taiwan, another says if you're 
 
 not going to attack then don't waste taxpayer money.
 
When then-U.S. with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last summer, China responded with military drills that simulated a blockade for the 
 
 first time China even fired missiles over the island. Experts say the military response this time is more restrained because the meeting between 
 
 Tsai and McCarthy withheld on American soil to avoid provoking Beijing.
 
Both Washington and Taipei have called the visit just an ordinary transit stop. But the symbolism was undeniable. With Washington support for Taipei 
 
 only growing, Beijing's anger will only intensify.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WANG: On China's third day of military exercises around Taiwan, the U.S. Navy sent a destroyer close to a contested Island to the South China Sea. 
 
 Now Beijing claims the island is theirs and called the move illegal. Meanwhile, the U.S. says they can operate wherever international law 
 
 allows. So, it's not just Taiwan but the South China Sea is another source of tensions between the U.S. and China.
 
And with these latest exercises around Taiwan, experts say China's military is flexing its military might showing the world that it has the ability to 
 
 conduct blockade and missile strikes on targets in and around Taiwan. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.
 
ANDERSON: Well, the Yemen's Houthi rebels are holding peace talks with Saudi Arabia, but can they lead to a permanent solution? I'll speak with a 
 
 man who was the U.N. special envoy to Yemen and resigned a month after the war broke out, that is after this.

 <br>[11:40:00]
 
ANDERSON: Tirpitz to end what has been the long and bloody devastating war in Yemen. Houthi media reporting that Saudi and Omani delegations held 
 
 talks with Houthi officials on Sunday remember the two sides trying to negotiate a permanent ceasefire Saudi backed Coalition and the Houthi 
 
 movement supported by Iran have been at war in Yemen since 2015. Here's a closer look for you.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON (voice over): A handshake between Yemen's Houthi rebels and Saudi Arabia, a major moment between two warring sides. Saudi Arabia now meeting 
 
 with the Houthis to negotiate a permanent ceasefire the talks mediated by Oman.
 
MUHAMMAD ABDUL-SALAM, HOUTHI CHIEF NEGOTIATOR: Our just demands are stopping the aggression completely, lifting the blockade completely, paying 
 
 the salaries of all Yemeni employees from oil and gas revenues, as well as the exit of foreign forces from Yemen, compensations and reconstruction.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): And nearly nine-year-old conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and left the country heavily dependent on 
 
 international aid. Yemen's war just one of several proxy conflicts between rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. Negotiations gaining momentum since those two 
 
 countries agreed to re-establish relations.
 
In 2014 the Iran aligned Houthi is toppled a Saudi backed government in the capital Sana and have de facto control over northern Yemen. Al Qaeda also 
 
 presents in the country the talks raising more questions than answers at this point.
 
ABDULGHANI AL-IRYANI, SENIOR RESEARCHER, SANAA CENTER: No party can take control over all of Yemen. The Houthis are the strongest faction in Yemen. 
 
 But they will not be able to control even all of North Yemen, let alone all of Yemen. So, we're talking about a degree of disintegration if we do not 
 
 have the other parties to - included in the current conversation with the Houthis.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): What happens to the UAE back to southern Transitional Council forces in the south of Yemen, a senior Emirati 
 
 official telling me "from the start of the Yemen crisis the UAE has always supported Saudi Arabia and fully supports current efforts by the kingdom to 
 
 bring a political solution to the crisis and to bring peace and a permanent end to hostilities between all the various Yemen parties".
 
The UAE hopes for the beginning of a constructive process between all Yemenis. A prisoner swap on Saturday saw 13 Houthi prisoners released by 
 
 Saudi authorities. For now, a permanent ceasefire agreement expected to shore up trust on both sides. But for peace to hold, Yemen needs a 
 
 political solution.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Jamal Benomar was the United Nations Special Envoy to Yemen, facilitating negotiations until March of 2015 and Saudi Arabia of 
 
 course intervened militarily. He joins me now live.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
Jamal, it's good to have you. You were very close to negotiations to find a settlement in this long and bloody conflict from what you know and see of 
 
 these talks directly between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. Does this feel different sir?
 
JAMAL BENOMAR, FORMER U.N. SPECIAL ENVOY TO YEMEN: I think what is happening is very, is very interesting. Saudi Arabia decided to cut its 
 
 losses. They didn't achieve any of their objectives since they launched this war in March 2015. Their objective was to install a government that is 
 
 loyal to them, but they ended up strengthening the Houthis have become much more entrenched and powerful.
 
But Saudi should be commended you know, for taking this step. This is a, this is eight years late, but better late than ever. That's how I see it.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, the Houthis have laid out their demands, including the lifting of the blockade, they want to reopen the port in the airports, they 
 
 want salaries paid. I mean, are they going to get these demands from the Saudis? Is that what's going on behind the scenes?
 
BENOMAR: Well, what are interesting here are that all the negotiations that have been taking place? And interesting, these negotiations were not 
 
 facilitated by the U.S. or the UN. It was Oman with a little help, also from China. The U.S. is on side line here, because they sided with the 
 
 Saudi.
 
But the thing here is that the focus of all these negotiations have been on the cons - what they would call the consequences and the impact of war, the 
 
 humanitarian situation, the exchange of prisoners, the issue of opening of ports, and so on. To my knowledge, there's been no substantive discussion 
 
 about the endgame, which is how power can be shared, power and resources can be shared among all these different entities. And--
 
ANDERSON: Yes. And let's talk about that. Because, yes, because the key stakeholders here include Saudi Arabia and the Iran back through Iran 
 
 aligned Houthis. But where's the Yemeni government in all of this? Where's the STC? Where's the U.N. in this process?
 
This is a permanent ceasefire, these two both the kingdom and the Houthis are looking at. But what about a permanent political solution in Yemen for 
 
 the benefit of the millions of Yemenis who've been through so much for so long?
 
BENOMAR: Well, definitely, you know, this is a Houthi Saudi negotiation. And the so-called "Legitimate international recognized government" they are 
 
 on the side line and the U.N. the same is nowhere to be seen. But nevertheless, you know, I think what happening here could create 
 
 potentially, the conditions for a political process that is inclusive, that engages all the different sides in this conflict.
 
And there are many, you know, don't forget that. After the start of this war, the Emiratis and the Saudis have created new militias and new actors, 
 
 new warlords, each one is in control of their territory, the Yemen has really fragmented. So, if there is a lull that is more permanent, there 
 
 will be a chance, you know, for another effort to bring all the sides together.
 
But here, instead of imposing solutions, I think what is needed is for Yemenis, to have the space for them to discuss their issues and develop an 
 
 agreement that is a power sharing agreement, but this needs to be done. Free from interference, you know, by the regional actors or international 
 
 actors, you know, that's a condition seek going on for the process to move forward.
 
ANDERSON: Jamal, it's good to have you. Your insight and analysis is extremely important. Everybody, I hope watching this show will, you know, 
 
 be watching in supportive of watching what is going on and hoping that this will help provide a political solution for Yemenis. And we will continue to 
 
 watch his story as it develops. Thank you very much indeed for joining us.

 carriages will take him to his coronation and back, first the Diamond Jubilee stagecoach scene here will be used when he and Queen Camilla leave 
 
 for the coronation in the morning.
 
And after the service, a 260-year-old gold statue - will be used for a much larger procession back to Buckingham Palace.

SALLY GOODSIR, CURATOR OF DECORATIVE ARTS, ROYAL COLLECTION TRUST: The coach is huge. You might be able to tell that from how I'm standing beside 
 
 it. It's nearly four meters tall. It's over seven meters long. It weighs four tonnes. Because of that it can only be used at a walking pace, which 
 
 really adds to the majesty and the stateliness of this great royal procession.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well coronation will take place on May the sixth; it will be the first time a new British sovereign is crowned in 70 years. And to mark the 
 
 momentous occasion, there's a new royal emoji this crown will appear on Twitter when coronation hash-tags are used.
 
The Royal Family says it is based on the 17th century St. Edward's crown which King Charles III will wear during his coronation. Right for our 
 
 parting shots tonight, a new report by the lancet planetary health says that more than 80 percent of heat related deaths in the Middle East and 
 
 North Africa are preventable if we limit global warming to two degrees.
 
Well, the countries across the Gulf and the Middle East feel the heat of climate change more and more every year. That's part of the reason the UAE 
 
 is taking the step of hosting this year's Climate Change Conference COP28. Well ahead of its kick-off in, back end of November, the UAE wanted to give 
 
 youngsters a platform in global climate dialogue an expo city in Dubai.

 driving global climate action. Held at Expo city Dubai, the day-long event marked a significant moment for the country's youth to participate in the 
 
 U.N. climate change process.
 
OMNIA EL OMRANI, COP27 PRESIDENCY YOUTH ENVOY: As the young people, we are the ones that are shouldering the impact of climate change on our health, 
 
 well-being as well as our future. We are not the victims of climate change.
