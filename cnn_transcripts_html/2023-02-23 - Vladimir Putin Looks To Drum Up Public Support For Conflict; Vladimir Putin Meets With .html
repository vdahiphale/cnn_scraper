JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Hello everyone.
 
Coming up here on CNN NEWSROOM. A big mistake, U.S. president's blunt assessment of Russia's decision to suspend a nuclear arms control treaty. 
 
The Palestinians call it a massacre, the Israelis' counterterrorism operation. Regardless, it was the deadliest Israeli raid in the West Bank since the Second Intifada two decades ago. 
 
And a winter storm warning for areas around Los Angeles with blizzards forecast for the land of palm trees, beaches, and t-shirts (PH).
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with John Vause. 
 
VAUSE: U.S. President is back in Washington after an historic visit to Kyiv and a two day stop in Warsaw, attended to build support for Ukraine as the war with Russia enter its second year.
 
Before returning to the U.S., Biden met with NATO Secretary General and a group known as the Bucharest Nine, countries along NATO's eastern flank. 
 
The leaders reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and a shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people. 
 
And President Biden made clear the U.S. will defend "literally every inch of NATO territory". And when he was asked about Russia suspending involvement in his last nuclear arms treaty with Washington, Biden had a blunt assessment of Vladimir Putin's decision.

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a big mistake to do that. Not very responsible. And -- but I don't read into that that he is thinking of using nuclear weapons or anything like that. I think it's -- I'm not sure what else he was able to say in his speech at the moment. But I think it's a mistake and I'm confident we'll be able to work it out.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: While the U.S. president was wrapping up his visit to Eastern Europe, Russia's President Vladimir Putin appeared at a patriotic rally, drumming up support for the ongoing military operation in Ukraine. (INAUDIBLE) this almost a year long war, a war. 
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Russian leader Vladimir Putin rallying his nation for a tough battle. At a massive event in Moscow, Putin's message to the crowd Russian troops in Ukraine are fighting for Russia's survival.
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): There is a battle going on for our historical borders, for our people. It is led by the same courageous fighters who are standing here. They fight heroically, courageously, bravely. We are proud of them. Three cheers in their honor. 
 
PLEITGEN: The concert in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, with Putin himself leading the rallying call.
 
For those attending, patriotism is the main message.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I adore Vladimir Vladimirovich. I'm prepared to support him with everything I've got.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The whole of Europe and the west is helping Ukraine, so, of course it's taking a long time, but we will demilitarize Europe and U.S., too.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): My understanding is we are fighting for our interests there. Regrettably, it is not us who decide what those interests are.
 
PLEITGEN: Russian forces have made little progress on the battlefield in recent months, with both Russia and Ukraine sustaining heavy losses. As the U.S. believes, Russia might be turning to China for military supplies. Putin reaffirming his commitment to relations with Beijing in a meeting with China's top diplomat, Wang Yi.
 
PUTIN (through translator): Russian Chinese relations are developing just as we planned in previous years. Everything is moving forward, developing, and we are reaching new milestones.
 
PLEITGEN: China has brushed off the U.S.'s concerns that Beijing might be contemplating supplying arms to the Kremlin's war effort taking a swipe at the Biden administration.
 <br>[00:05:01] WANG YI, SENIOR CHINESE DIPLOMAT (through translator): We would like to emphasize once again that the comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and China has never been directed against a third party and is certainly not subject to interference and provocation by any third party.
 
PLEITGEN: While Beijing says it wants a political solution, Vladimir Putin is drumming up support for his military operation, trying hard to keep the Russian population motivated for a battle he deemed existential.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

VAUSE: Joining us now from Warsaw is David Sanger, CNN political and National Security Analyst and White House and National Security Correspondent for The New York Times. Thank you for your time, David.
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (on camera): Great to be back with you, John.
 
VAUSE: Thank you. Now, for the past year, China has tried to have this (INAUDIBLE), you know, highly critical of the U.S. and Ukraine sort of domestically. What appearing to be this neutral party for the rest of the world. 
 
So, with that in mind, I want you to listen to China's top diplomat, meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister in Moscow.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YI (through translator): Although crisis and chaos appear from time to time, crisis has opportunities and crisis can be turned into opportunity. This is in fact the dialectic of history. This requires us to be more proactive in identifying and responding more positively, and to continuously deepen our comprehensive strategic partnership.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: A lot of words there. But has China finally picked a side here, because it seems a stretch to argue neutrality amid talk of shared opportunities to say nothing of blaming U.S. hegemony, for the Russian invasion -- for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
 
SANGER: They picked a side John, but they're not entirely sure how far they want to go in supporting that side. 
 
So, what we've seen China to do in the past year is give economic support to Russia, they're continuing to buy Russian oil and gas. They're continuing to trade with Russia, supply them with dual use technology, chips, and so forth.
 
But now the U.S. has picked up evidence of the Russians have come back again, and said we need weapons, we need ammunition. We need intelligence support, satellite imagery, and so forth. And the warnings that the U.S. issued last weekend at the Munich
 
 Security Conference were basically to the Chinese, don't go down that road, or you're going to pay the same sanctions price that others who supply Russia well. 
 
So, you know, John, this is really the week in which we have seen these two camps kind of hardening in place. But it is interesting with the Chinese denied that they were getting ready to provide those weapons to Russia.
 
VAUSE: Well, a few hours ago, we received a video statement released by the Kremlin by the Russian president. Here's part of it, listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PUTIN (through translator): As before, we will pay increased attention to strengthening the nuclear triad. We will continue to inundate our forces with advanced technology. There are new strike teams, intelligence gathering, and communications equipment, drones and artillery systems. Our industry is now rapidly boosting production of all types of conventional weapons.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Well, we've seen the conventional weapons in play in Ukraine, and so far, not so good. But when it comes to the nuclear stuff, is this like making a threat of nuclear war without making an actual threat? 
 
Because since Putin's been doing this for about a year now, making nuclear hints and threats, at what point do those threats have some kind of diminishing credibility?
 
SANGER: Well, there are sort of two separate issues at work here. So the other day, the end of his hundred minute long speech, John, he said that he was going to suspend participation in New START, that's the last nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia that exists to this day. 
 
Later on, they said, but don't worry, we're not going to increase the numbers under that treaty, both sides are limited to 1,550 weapons each deployed, many more in storage. 
 
And they said that they would basically let the treaty run for its next three years. What they won't do is allow inspections. 
 
Now, what he just said, what you just played before is something they had said and something that Americans could say, within those numbers, they're improving their nuclear arsenal, and so is the United States. 
 
The worry, John, that I have is twofold. What happens when the treaty expires in February 2026? And the tactical nuclear weapons that they've -- at various points threatened to use in Ukraine, which aren't even covered by the Treaty.
 
VAUSE: Well, Biden was asked about the withdrawal from New START. Here's his response. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President any reaction to Putin saying he's pulling out of New START?
 <br>[00:10:03]
 
BIDEN: I don't have time. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No time?
 
BIDEN: No, it's a big mistake.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: At one point, he seemed always dismissive of you know, what Putin has done. And he went on to say that, you know, he hopes that Putin will reconsider and that everything will be OK. They'll try and work with them to get them back into the treaty. But where does that confidence come from?
 
SANGER: Oh, you know, at this point, I don't think a worry is really about this treaty, John, because in some ways, what Putin has done just sort of solidifies the status quo ante. 
 
I mean, there have not been neutral inspections, American inspectors going to Russia, Russian inspectors coming to the United States since before COVID. And the Russians would not restart it after that. 
 
United States has other ways of making sure that their weapons are roughly where they say they are. I think the bigger concern here is this may well be the end of arms control, traditional arms control, because it's almost impossible under these conditions to imagine the United States and Russia sitting down to negotiate a follow-on treaty, much less actually agree on one.
 
VAUSE: David, as always, it's so good to have you with us. Thank you for your reporting.
 
SANGER: Thank you. Great to be with you.
 
VAUSE: Israeli forces say six rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza a few hours ago, most were intercepted, one fell in an open area. 
 
This appears to be retaliation for another lethal Israeli military raid in the West Bank, this time in broad daylight, a rare move that killed at least 11 Palestinians on Wednesday. 
 
Palestinian officials say more than 100 others were wounded in Nablus, many by live fire during what they call a massacre. Israel says its operation targeted and neutralized three suspects who were planning imminent attacks. 
 
The Islamic Jihad militant group says two of their commanders were among the dead. Israeli authorities say the suspects refuse to surrender and "open extensive fire on our forces".
 
According to the Palestinian health ministry, they say Israel has killed more than 60 Palestinians since the start of this year, 11 Israelis have died in Palestinian attacks. This latest bloodshed driving up the already soaring tensions in the region. 
 
Joining us now is Aaron David Miller, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former Middle East negotiator at the U.S. State Department. Aaron, thanks being with us. It's good to see you.
 
AARON DAVID MILLER, SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE (on camera): Good to see you, John. 
 
VAUSE: OK, so there's a lot of factors which have combined to bring us to this moment. But first, I want you to listen to Ned Price with reaction from the U.S. State Department.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NED PRICE, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: We recognize the very real security concerns facing Israel. At the same time, we are deeply concerned by the large number of injuries and the loss of civilian lives. 
 
We are deeply concerned that the impact of today's raid could set back efforts aimed at restoring calm for both Israelis and Palestinians.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: It seems any effort to restore calm has suffered more than a setback here. Where do you see this conflict heading now?
 
MILLER: Well, you know, I wrote those talking points for 20 years. And we can talk a minute about the Biden administration, what they're willing and unable to do in responses. But I think it would -- Ned Price is referring to that over the last several weeks, clearly Israelis and Palestinians have been meeting quietly secretly in a back-channel representatives of Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas. And the Americans apparently, over the last week brokered a set of understandings, which seemed to be frankly, a good sign that both sides were stepping back. 
 
But I think efforts to restore calm is at a minimum, only a temporary fix. Without a strategic pathway to address the mutual and legitimate needs and requirements of both Israelis and Palestinians, this is only going to be a temporary sort of respite until the next rung. 
 
And the fact is John, there's a perfect storm, you have a 56-year-old Israeli occupation, you've got a Palestinian authority that has lost all credibility prickly among young Palestinians and on the street. You've got armed groups operating in Juneid and Nablus, with the Palestinian authorities unwilling and frankly, I think, unable to control because they don't want to appear to be Israel's policemen. And these groups are planning terrorist attacks and resistance to the Israeli occupation. And then you have for the first time in the history of the state of
 
 Israel, you have the most fundamentalist and extreme Israeli government, which basically has claimed an exclusive and unquestioned right to the West Bank and to Jerusalem. So, I think this is new.
 
VAUSE: You touched on this, there's a sense that we've sort of seen this movie over and over again, but there are significant differences this time, it's no longer just that cycle of violence that we saw for many, many years. 
 
One of the factors here this very conservative -- this very right-wing government. And it seems to be on a collision course right now with a number of new militant groups in the West Bank. And that's a sort of an unknown factor how that's going to play out.
 <br>[00:15:00]
 
MILLER: Yes, I mean, I think you've got a couple of things going on here. First of all, you have this complete loss of faith and trust and credibility, the Palestinian authority and young men primarily in Juneid and Nablus wishes now have never -- they've always been outlying areas the Palestinian authority was reluctant to control, particularly within the refugee camps. 
 
And you've got a proliferation of weapons. You also have Hamas in Palestine Islamic Jihad in Gaza that are encouraging this, without a doubt, don't want to encourage Israeli attacks, at least for the moment on Gaza. 
 
So, you have this effort on the part of Hamas and the PIJ, Palestine Islamic Jihad and even fought lots of brigades to create sales in Nablus and Juneid, and to plan these attacks.
 
And the Israelis since last March had been operating in an effort preemptively, proactively to deal with this. The problem is today, when you go into Nablus in broad daylight, looking for three guys in a house and you go in heavy and big, you're going to end up rallying other armed elements, young men with weapons, and that I think in a densely crowded area, you're going to end up with a lot of casualties.
 
VAUSE: The U.N. Secretary General also expressed his concern about the situation right now and some of the reasons he believes for the sudden escalation of violence, here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECURITY-GENERAL: Across the occupied West Bank and Gaza, hopelessness is spreading, feeling anger, and despair. Each new settlements is another roadblock on the best to peace. All settlement activity is illegal in international law, and it must stop.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: All of these factors are true, but there's also the demise of the credibility of the Palestinian Authority, as well as President Mahmoud Abbas. He's hold on to power for 18 years without calling an election. It seems any authority, any credibility the PLA once had is really in demise.
 
MILLER: Yes, and I think the other trend, it's not a headline, I think it's a trend line is there's been this loss of respect and credibility for the Palestinian Authority. And even for the -- any number of Palestinian organizations, including the PLO.
 
So, you have young men let's say in early 20s, who were not here for the second Intifada, who are frustrated and determined, it seems to me to strike out on their own, above and beyond with the Palestinian Authority, or even some of the organized groups want.
 
VAUSE: Aaron, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate your insights as well as your experience. Thank you.
 
MILLER: Always a pleasure, John, thanks.
 
VAUSE: We had this just in, Israel defense forces say they've had weapons manufacturing site blowing to Hamas, this was an airstrike in the central part of the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The military confirmed this in a statement just short time ago, it comes after a number of rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, about six rockets were fired earlier. This all appears to be retaliation for that West Bank raid on Wednesday that left a lot of Palestinians dead. We'll have more on that when it comes in. 
 
But for now, a short break. When we come back, promises of better earthquake preparations from Turkey's government, revealing plans to crack down on unsafe construction. 
 
Also ahead, what to do about North Korea as it continues to threaten global peace and security. We'll speak exclusively to South Korea's top diplomat.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:20:31]
 
VAUSE: More than two weeks since a massive earthquake in Turkey. The government there is now wrapping up relief efforts as the death toll passes 49,000 across both Turkey and Syria.
 
The Turkish government has launched an economic relief plan and banned layoffs in 10 provinces as authorities moved to demolish damaged buildings. 
 
The Justice Ministry says at least 160 people of nearly 600 suspects have been arrested, many more detained over unsafe construction. 
 
There are reports that the government had provided amnesty to contractors in the past for developing projects without the necessary safety requirements. A presidential spokesperson concedes mistakes were made.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
IBRAHIM KALIN, TURKISH PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, I don't want to deflect responsibility here in any way. We are in a position of responsibility, and we have to take action, no doubt. But it's also a matter of a culture of understanding. And everybody, you know, following these guidelines and regulations, individuals, constructors, private sector, municipalities, center of government, everybody. You know, I think we all are learning really great lessons, very costly sad but great lessons from all this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Ibrahim Kalin adds that CNN -- will tell CNN rather, more tents, containers and other temporary housing facilities are on the way for tens of thousands of people. That's in addition to more than 300,000 tents distributed as of Wednesday.
 
The government is promising to build some 200,000 new earthquake resistant homes within a year. CNN's Nada Bashir has that report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (on camera): We're in the city of Antakya in Hatay Province, which was among the worst hit provinces by the earthquake a little over two weeks ago and you can see around the city, the devastation, the destruction, it is absolutely everywhere. 
 
Some of these buildings like this one here are completely destroyed, completely collapsed. Others however are still standing like this apartment block behind me. You can see some of those possessions, some of the furniture still in there, but it is structurally unsafe. And that is a reality across the city and particularly after that powerful 6.3 magnitude aftershock on Monday where we saw that some of the buildings that had survived the first initial earthquake later on collapsed, causing further injuries, at least 500 people injured following that second aftershock. 
 
And if you just take a look over here at the scale of the destruction, this is just one street in Antakya. And this is -- really, this resembles much of what we've seen across the city. 
 
And of course, for those who are living in the city, for those who are living across Southeast Turkey in the impacted areas, the devastation is hard to get to grips with and many are now living in camps for internally displaced people, at least 900,000 people currently living in camps across the region. 
 
We visited some of those camps today. Many told us that they have lost absolutely everything.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I came here from Syria three years ago. Ma'arra was destroyed. Maarat al-Numan was destroyed. We came here, we fled the bombardment. And here we are now. How does God do this to us?
 
BASHIR: The Turkish government says it aims to rebuild the impacted areas within a year and there are already plans underway to begin the construction of at least 30,000 apartments in March. But just looking at the scale of the devastation here in Antakya, and
 
 of course, considering the destruction that has taken place across Southeast Turkey and indeed, parts of northwest Syria as well. It is hard to imagine that this could be achieved within a year and there is mounting pressure now on the Turkish Government. Growing questions as to whether enough was done to prepare for a catastrophe of this scale.

VAUSE: South Korea is taking a hardline towards its northern neighbor amid a flurry of missile launches and nuclear threats from Pyongyang. In an exclusive interview with CNN, South Korea's foreign minister says the only way to counter the threat is with Seoul's defense alliance with the United States. 
 
CNN's Paula Hancocks live for us this hour from Seoul. So, what else did the foreign minister tell you about North Korea?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, specifically, John, when it comes to North Korea, he said that they are heading in completely the wrong direction. He called for them to come back to the negotiation table, but as we both know, there is no indication that that will happen anytime soon. 
 
Now, Park Jin also said that he wanted the United Nations Security Council to be more unified, saying it simply cannot be silent. 
 
But of course, that is easier said than done when it comes to condemning what North Korea has been doing as China and Russia within the Security Council have no intention of siding with the United States to punish Pyongyang for breaking the resolution. 
 <br>[00:25:10]
 
So, it's a difficult situation the foreign minister says but he is calling on a more unified response. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANCOCKS (voiceover): An ICBM launch a military parade and a threat to use the Pacific Ocean as a firing range a busy month so far for North Korea.
 
PARK JIN, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER: North Korea may want to be recognized as a de facto nuclear state, but my government will not accept a nuclear North Korea.
 
HANCOCKS (on camera): Do you think Kim Jong-un would ever give up his nuclear weapons?
 
JIN: He may not voluntarily renounce nuclear weapons. But the important thing is that we have to create an environment where North Korea has no choice but to come back to the negotiation table.
 
HANCOCKS (on camera): Are there any back channels open at the moment?
 
JIN: Not at the moment, No.
 
HANCOCKS (voiceover): U.S. South Korea Military drills have intensified in recent months, angering Pyongyang. A growing call for South Korea to have its own nuclear program is neither realistic nor viable according to Park, preferring to rely on 70-year-old alliance and U.S. extended deterrence.
 
JIN: We are now currently discussing with the United States on how we can strengthen the extended deterrence. There is under what circumstances and in what way the U.S. nuclear umbrella can be activated in times of crisis.
 
HANCOCKS (voiceover): Park -- Pyongyang is learning from the war in Ukraine taking advantage of the world looking elsewhere.
 
JIN: Russia is now indicating to use the tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine and North Korea is also threatening to use the tactical nuclear weapons.
 
HANCOCKS (on camera): There's a relationship between Russia and North Korea concerning?
 
JIN: Yes, it is our concern that Russia and North Korea are cooperating in various ways. And we have to prepare ourselves against any kind of further provocation by North Korea based on that relationship.
 
HANCOCKS (voiceover): The White House announced in December they believe. North Korea has delivered rockets and missiles to Russian mercenary group Wagner as for Taiwan and China's threats to take control of the island by force if necessary.
 
JIN: We are opposed to unilateral change of status quo by force. So, in that sense, we will make sure that if something happens on the Taiwan Strait, we have to maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula because you don't have a direct impact on our country.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANCOCKS (on camera): Now, Minister Park was very clear that the future of South Korea certainly within this government is very closely tied to the United States also highlighting the fact that this year marks the 70-year anniversary of the start of the Alliance, John.
 
VAUSE: Paula, thank you. Paula Hancocks live for us there in Seoul. 
 
Still ahead, Poland's President speaks exclusively with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, his thoughts on President Biden, Vladimir Putin, and what he says is a key to winning the war in Ukraine.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Welcome back. I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
[00:30:4]
 
U.S. President Joe Biden is back in the United States after his trip to Ukraine and Poland. Before leaving Warsaw Wednesday, he describes Russia's decision to withdraw from the New START nuclear treaty as a big mistake. 
 
Biden also met with members of the Bucharest 9, a group of Eastern NATO countries, formed in 2015 in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. 
 
He says the U.S.'s commitment to NATO is ironclad and promised every inch of NATO territory will be protected. 
 
Meantime, in Moscow, Vladimir Putin addressed a cheering crowd celebrating a Defender of the Fatherland Day. Putin praised Russian forces on the frontlines, claiming they were defending the country, heroically fighting in Ukraine. 
 
Poland's president is praising his U.S. counterpart for his leadership in Ukraine and the strong commitment to the NATO alliance. 
 
CNN's Christiane Amanpour spoke exclusively with Andrzej Duda in Warsaw. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTINE AMANPOUR, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: How significant is this moment for you? Before President Biden arrived, you said the speech, the meeting would be of global significance and dimensions? 
 
ANDRZEJ DUDA, POLISH PRESIDENT (through translator): So let me start by saying that these two days, today and yesterday, this surprising presence of President Joe Biden in Kyiv, it sends an incredibly powerful signal, a political and strategic signal. 
 
It is a demonstration of strength of the United States, indeed. It is like saying that the American leader, who is, as a matter of fact, is the leader of the free world, is able to travel even where war is raging, even to a place where there is a potential danger. He is not afraid, because the United States is strong enough to protect him. That is No. 1.
 
And No. 2, he was there, and today he's in Warsaw. He gives his speech to the whole world, because we have to say it like this. This is he speech by the president of the United States, as I said, the leader the free world. It is a speech -- address to the whole world. 
 
And he sends a signal of the defense of the free world, of the defense of NATO, of the defense of every inch of the territory, as the president said today. 
 
So to us, the Poles, this American signal, this allied signal, not only within NATO, that first of all, a signal sent by the greatest superpower in the world, a signal sent by our friend and ally today so significant. AMANPOUR: So the United States and all you allies have stood united,
 
 and the president today said that Vladimir Putin did not think that you would all remain united, you would remain so strong, and that Kyiv, Ukraine would still remain free. What more needs to be done, all the weapon systems that you've been sending, what more needs to be done to ensure what you say is Ukraine's victory in this war? 
 
DUDA (through translator): The difference of potentials between Ukraine and Russia's huge and obvious. Everybody actually expected that it would take 72 hours at the most, the defense of Ukraine, and after 72 hours, Ukraine would fall. It would be captured by Russia. 
 
On the 23rd of February, 2022, I was in Kyiv. I talked to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, just a couple of hours before the Russian invasion. And at the last moment, actually, we made it to the Polish border. because we traveled by car back then. 
 
So we crossed the border, and right after that, Russian missiles struck. So I remember, when I said good-bye to Volodymyr, Volodymyr told me, Andrzej, I do not know whether we would see each other again. That was a very powerful moment, a moving moment.
 
And then he told me, if Putin thinks that he would control Ukraine, conquer Ukraine, just as he used to -- as they did with Crimea in 2014, that he is mistaken. We've got eight years of combat experience and thousands of people who are fighting on the front. We are going to fight till the end, until we drop. 
 
And that is what has happened. They are fighting until today. 
 
So first of all, what they need is weapons, because the difference is huge in terms of the quantity. What Russians have got today is all equipment. Very old equipment. They are taking tanks from 1960s, from their stocks, but they have those tanks, and they are crushing. 
 
And they've got this advantage of steel, of mass, and they are crushing Ukrainians. There are 140 million Russians and less than 14 million Ukrainians. So this shows you that mobilization potential of Russia and the mobilization potential of Ukraine.
 <br>[00:35:05]
 
So it's enough to look at this clear data to understand that, under normal circumstances, unless Ukraine gets support, it has no chance of defending itself on its own against Russia. That is why Ukraine needs this support. It's indispensable. What kind of support can we offer to Ukraine as allies? 
 
What the United States is doing, what we are doing as Poland, as well, we have donated to Ukraine 300 tanks from our stocks. Right now, we are providing more tanks to Ukraine. 
 
At this moment, we are sending that state-of-the-art tanks that we have, Leopard tanks. We are providing a company of Leopard tanks. We have organized and let collections, so to speak, of tanks for Ukraine. This what I was requested to do by Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the prime minister of Ukraine asked for that.
 
So we initiated that today. The key to make sure that Ukraine defends itself against Russia is modern weapons, so that Ukrainian soldiers can efficiently find so that they have the means to push Russians with. 
 
AMANPOUR: Even fighter jets? 
 
DUDA (through translator): If there is such a need, of course, yes. We still have got MiG-29s. Ukrainian pilots aren't prepared to operate them today. 
 
The question is, when will Ukrainian pilots be ready to fly modern aircraft at NATO standards, such as F-16s or Mirage, French planes, or euro fighters, or any other type of modern machines? 
 
This is a question mark. When the Ukrainian pilots will be ready to do that, because that training of a pilot is much more complicated and much longer than the training for a tanker.
 
So this is the way it is. So here is a question mark. When will Ukraine be ready with its own force to use such planes? 
 
AMANPOUR: I realize that you're all sort of holding off on that. But I want to ask about the Leopard tanks which you were very vocal in unleashing from -- from Germany.
 
And yet, this weekend, at the Munich security conference, Chancellor Scholz told me that now Germany has to try to persuade you all with Leopard tanks to actually send them to Ukraine. And there's been some slowness about this. When will your Leopard tanks get to Ukraine? 
 
DUDA (through translator): We're ready to send our tanks, and the tanks are ready to be sent. And we're training, in Poland, Ukrainian soldier so that they are able to operate those tanks. 
 
I am slightly surprised by that answer that Chancellor Scholz gave you. I hope that they are also ready with their Leopards because, honestly, we have got serious problems with getting spare parts and to tanks -- spare parts from Germany (UNINTELLIGIBLE). So these problems are quite common. 
 
Other countries have problems with Leopards, because Germans have got a serious problem with sharing spare parts with not understanding the situation. That's the way it is.

VAUSE: The Polish president there, Andrzej Duda, speaking exclusively with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. 
 
The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote in the day ahead on a resolution calling for lasting peace in Ukraine as soon as possible. The U.S. calls that a vote that will go down in history. 
 
U.N. secretary general Antonio Guterres says Russia's invasion of Ukraine one year ago is a clear violation of the organization's charter.

ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: War is not the solution. War is the problem. People in Ukraine are suffering enormously. Ukrainians, Russians and people far beyond need peace. And while prospects may look bleak today, we must all work, knowing that genuine, lasting peace must be based on the U.N. charter and international law.

VAUSE: The Russian ambassador to the United Nations says Moscow launched its special military operation to protect its own security, as well as defend Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. 
 
Still to come here on CNN, extreme winter weather setting in in many parts of the United States. We'll have the latest conditions, as well as the forecast in a moment.

VAUSE: The Pentagon has released an unusual picture of an American spy plane shadowing that suspected Chinese spy balloon. The pilot of the U2 took a selfie which shows the shadow of his plane on the balloon, as well as the balloon's payload. 
 
This was about 60,000 feet above the United States and the day before the shutdown. The balloon was first spotted January 28th, shut down several days later after it finished crossing the lower 48 states. 
 
A massive winter storm has millions of Americans on alert as it sweeps the country. More than 650,000 customers in states across the nation are without electricity because of heavy winds, snow and ice. Minnesota State Patrol reported more than 100 car crashes on Wednesday, amid bad road conditions. No surprise there. And in California -- yes, California -- strong winds knocked down trees and even brick walls. Parts of both Minnesota and California -- yes, Minnesota and California together -- under blizzard warnings for part of Wednesday. 
 
Meteorologist Britley Ritz joins us with more. This is incredible. Los Angeles, Ventura County, a blizzard warning? 
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, and it's a very rare situation to get that down in Southern California. So it's just unbelievable. Keep that in mind, John. 
 
So many are still under some sort of winter weather alert, from blizzard warnings to ice storm warnings over 60,000 -- or million people, rather, under some sort of alert. 
 
Ice storm warnings going on across parts of the Great Lakes back into the Midwest. Much of Eastern Iowa under that ice storm warning. That is what is causing numerous power outages in Michigan, where we've had almost an inch of ice. We'll show you totals here in a minute. 
 
Look at the snow. This is round two moving in, some of the heaviest snow moving in now from Minneapolis, stretching across the U.P. of Michigan.
 
Back now into New England. So we're tapping into the snow in New England and parts of the mid-Atlantic, tapping into some ice. So we're also starting to see power outages in New York, where we picked up almost a quarter of an inch of ice. 
 
All right. Snowfall totals, keep in mind, these are preliminary. We are still adding to them. Battle Lake, Wyoming, 48 inches. Salt Lake City, 17 inches. Rapid City, seven inches of snowfall. Ann Arbor, here we are at over a half inch of ice. 
 
This is where we start to see the trees breaking down and snapping. And then we add the wind in on top of it. So hence why we're dealing with widespread power outages. 
 
There's the pink. You're noticing that through Thursday morning and into Thursday afternoon, holding onto the freezing rain, unfortunately. And that rolls into parts of New England here late Thursday and into Friday, still holding onto stray showers as we move into the upcoming day here. 
 
But regardless, many of us are still dealing with excessive amounts of snow and ice -- John.
 
VAUSE: There is a lot of snow and ice out there. And yes, California, that's still quite bizarre in so many ways.
 
Britley, thank you so much. Appreciate it. 
 
I'm John Vause. Back at the top of the hour with more CNN NEWSROOM. But first, WORLD SPORT starts after a short break. You're watching CNN. Back here in 16 minutes.
