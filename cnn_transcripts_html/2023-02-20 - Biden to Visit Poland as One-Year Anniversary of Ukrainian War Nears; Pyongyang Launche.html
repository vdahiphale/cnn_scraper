MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome. Coming to live from Studio 4 at the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company. 
 <br>[00:00:35]
 
Coming up here on CNN NEWSROOM, almost one year now since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden heading to the region soon to mark that anniversary. 
 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announces $100 million in earthquake relief for Turkey and Syria. More than 46,000 people have now died as a result of that disaster. 
 
And North Korea carrying out another missile test, this time launching two ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. We'll have a live report from Seoul, South Korea. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Michael Holmes. 
 
HOLMES: It has now been nearly one year since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, that anniversary coming in just a matter of days now. And there has been no letup to the fierce fighting on the front lines, nor to the devastating human toll of war. 
 
Have a look at this cemetery. This is in the Eastern city of Kramatorsk, that has a section dedicated to Ukrainian soldiers who've died since the start of the war and has now opened more space for those who've lost their lives on the battlefield.
 
But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia is also seeing what he called "extremely tangible losses" in the East, in the strategic town of Vuhledar, where he says the situation is very difficult. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We are breaking down the invaders and inflicting extraordinarily significant losses on Russia. I repeat again and again: the more losses Russia suffers there -- in Donbas, in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Marinka, Kreminna -- the faster we will be able to end this war with Ukraine's victory. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Still, Russia's attacks continue, and one Russian-installed official is claiming there's been an improvement of Russian positions in the embattled Eastern city of Bakhmut. 
 
All of this as U.S. President Joe Biden plans to head to Poland in the day ahead to mark the war's one-year anniversary and express continued U.S. support. The Polish prime minister explaining what he's expecting from the visit. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, POLISH PRIME MINISTER: I expect that there will be a very strong confirmation of our resilience and our joint efforts to defeat Russia in Ukraine. Because instead of saying, as some Western European politicians say, that Russia cannot be -- cannot win this war, and Ukraine cannot be defeated, we have to change that paradigm, and we have to say Ukraine must win and Russia must be defeated. And I believe that the words of President Biden will reassure all Europe that the United States is with us in this fight for freedom and peace.

HOLMES: CNN's Sam Kiley now with more from Kharkiv in Eastern Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Inevitably, with the visit of the U.S. president to Poland, here in neighboring Ukraine, there will be a hope among Ukrainian officials and, indeed, the population that perhaps the U.S. president would nip in as an expression of solidarity and visit, perhaps, even Kyiv, as other heads of government and world leaders have done in the past. 
 
But of course, that is fraught with very serious security concerns, and as John Kirby recently said, there were no plans to do that. 
 
But nonetheless, this is all coming at a time when there is, in the words of the U.S., they're convening policy and they're convening abilities to bring together all allies supporting Ukraine. They're beginning to solidify policy behind the notion that perhaps Russia needs to be defeated in Ukraine rather than merely contained. 
 
Now that would be, if it does solidify in that direction, a very significant step forward. That is certainly the signal coming from the top E.U. diplomat. This is what he said. 
 
JOSEP BORRELL, EUROPEAN UNION FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians have a lot of applause (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and not enough ammunition. That is the paradox. They need to be less applaud and better supplied with arms. The Ukrainians are fighting, paying the highest price in terms of lives, but this war happens on European soil, affects us, and has a global impact around the world, which also affects global security.
 <br>[00:05:04]
 
KILEY: Now, if you combine that with Secretary Blinken saying that the world is also being affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, warning that if the Russians were able to prevail here, they'll continue to hold a significant chunk of territory, illegally seized. That would encourage imperial aspirations and warlike notions in other countries around the world, with disastrous consequences. 
 
We are seeing a greater solidification of policy behind the idea, as I say, that Russian defeat here would be a victory. Now, what that means in terms for Ukraine is how to deliver that victory.
 
From the Ukrainian perspective, they're saying they need weapons urgently. They're not -- it's not just about tanks, which are a tactical weapon. They want strategic weapons. They want jets, long- range artillery missiles, and the ability to interdict the ability of the Russians to continue to supply their large numbers of troops and materiel that they're pouring into this war. 
 
Sam Kiley, CNN, in Kharkiv. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: All right. For more on the story, I'm joined by Major General Mick Ryan. He's a veteran of the Australian army, and he's also the author of the book, "War Transformed: The Future of 21st Century Great Power Competition and Conflict." He joins me, as always, from Brisbane, Australia. 
 
And it's good to see you, sir. As we approach this one-year anniversary, what do you think will be the -- the revised aims of the Russian offensive, given their losses over the last year, the failure to achieve those initial goals? 
 
MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN (RET.), AUTHOR, "WAR TRANSFORMED": Well, good day, Michael. 
 
It's clear that Putin hasn't stepped back from his maximalist aims to subjugate all of Ukraine, but now his strategy is to do it in smaller bites than he probably imagined some time ago. 
 
So the Russian military offensives, which have been underway for a little while now, are really probably aimed at securing the two Eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk in this initial phase for Russia. 
 
HOLMES: The U.S. suggesting that China might be about to give material military support to Russia. What impact might that have, if it turns out to be true? 
 
RYAN: I think this is a really disturbing development. China could provide a range of material assistance to Russia, whether it's munitions, or even replacing armored vehicles. They could provide a whole lot of intelligence, not just battlefield, but political intelligence for Europe. 
 
But we should also remember the Chinese may also be doing this to stimulate a U.S. response, to see how the U.S. might react, not just in Europe, but in future contingencies in the Pacific. 
 
HOLMES: And we've talked about this before. The reports are that Russians have bolstered their forces, regrouped, re-armed. But do you see the capacity and, importantly, the capability to make effective gains? Do they have any momentum? 
 
RYAN: I think it's very unlikely we'll see significant gains by the Russians. They've conducted 100, 150,000 mobilized troops into the Ukrainian force, but these are green troops. 
 
So what we're seeing, actually, is a decrease in overall quality of the Russian forces. They've expended large amounts of their munitions over the last year, large amounts of their high-quality equipment. So this is not a high-quality Russian force that's capable of making large-scale penetrations. This will be a very slow, very painful and rolling activity for them. 
 
HOLMES: And then the thing is, it's clear that, you know, Vladimir Putin and the generals don't really care about Russian losses on the battlefield. They just call up more poor Russians to the front. 
 
Do you think the Russian theory now is to simply outlast and destroy as much of Ukraine as possible, drag this out and wait for cracks in the Western coalition support? 
 
RYAN: I think you're on the mark there, Michael. This is a regime in Moscow that constantly reinforces the toughness, the mythology of Russian sacrifice. It's repeated in schools and in the military.
 
And they've talked about outlasting the West and the Ukrainians in this war.
 
So Putin's strategy at the moment is playing for time. He knows that polls and support for Ukraine in different countries are changing. He believes he can outwait the West.
 
But he may want to take a page from the Afghan book, where the West actually supported operations there for over 20 years. So he may not be right in his assumption about Western impatience. 
 
HOLMES: And at the same time, you know, with minimal gains either way on the battlefield, a stalemate isn't going to be sustainable for either side, is it? So given that Russia is unlikely to achieve its initial goals of basically walking in and taking the country, then you know, what might be the modified objectives in terms of an endgame? 
 
RYAN: Yes. I don't think we're at a stalemate yet. We're a little way from that. The Russians are trying offensives, and the Ukrainians are essentially punching them in the face. 
 <br>[00:10:08]
 
I think we need to wait and see where we go with the Ukrainian offensive, which we should expect to see in the South and East over the coming months. I would expect now to have a more decisive impact on this war than the Russian offensives will. 
 
HOLMES: CNN's Nathan Hodge wrote a fascinating piece about potential cracks in support for Putin, when it comes to those around him. What do you think it would take, from a military perspective, for cracks to impact Putin's own job security? 
 
RYAN: I think that, whilst that's always a possibility, it's low probability. I mean, he's surrounded himself over 20 years with an extraordinarily loyal cadre of military and civilian intelligence officials. It could happen, but we shouldn't base our theory of victory in this war on disposal of Vladimir Putin. 
 
HOLMES: Always great to get your analysis, Major General Mick Ryan. I appreciate it. Good to see you, mate.
 
RYAN: Thanks, Michael. 
 
HOLMES: Well, two leading House Republicans are calling on U.S. President Joe Biden to increase military support for Ukraine. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul telling CNN that bipartisan support for Ukraine is, quote, "still very strong in Congress." He also warned against hedging aid, which could prolong the conflict. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE MCCAUL (R-TX): For the past year, we've been very slow at getting these weapons in, in the name of it being too provocative. Whether it be Stingers, Javelins, these short-range artillery, now longer-range artillery ATACMS. They can take out the Iranian drones in Crimea. And also aviation like F-16. 
 
If we'd put this stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different as we look at the anniversary on February 24. 
 
The longer they drag this out, they play into Putin's hands. He wants this to be a long, protracted war, because he knows that, potentially, he'll lose -- we could lose the will of the American people and, therefore, the Congress. 
 
We're seeing the same dynamic in the European Parliaments. Strong support now, but they're worried that if this doesn't end with a resolution, you know, sooner rather than later, this will be an issue for us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: The U.S. and its allies have sent nearly $50 billion in aid and equipment to Ukraine's military over the past year. Now Poland's prime minister says the West must protect neighboring
 
 nations like Moldova, which he says are vulnerable to Russian forces and interference. His remarks come on the same day pro-Russia party organized a protest in the Moldovan capital. Several thousand people turned out, with many demanding the removal of the country's pro- Western government. 
 
The rallies were held just days after American and European officials warned that Moscow could be plotting a coup in Moldova. Russia denies those claims. 
 
North Korea has launched two more ballistic missiles into the waters off its East coast on Monday morning, escalating tensions in the region even further. Pyongyang says the tests are in response to joint military drills being held by the U.S. and South Korea. 
 
For more on all of this, let's go to Paula Hancocks, who is joining me now live from Seoul in South Korea.
 
Good to see you, Paula. Japan calling for a U.N. Security Council meeting over these incidents. What has been the regional reaction? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Michael, it's certainly been a busy few days here on the Korean Peninsula. 
 
It all started Saturday morning, when North Korea carried out an ICBM test, it says, on Sunday morning when it spoke about it in state-run media. They say it was an intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of hitting mainland United States, according to Pyongyang. 
 
Then on Sunday what we saw was a response from both the U.S. and the South Korean air forces. They had a joint show of force, including B1B bombers that came over the Korean Peninsula, escorted by South Korean fighter jets, as well. 
 
And then, in response to that, according to Pyongyang, this Monday morning, this morning, they carried out another launch. They said this morning's was a super-large multiple rocket launcher exercise, also pointing out that it is a means of tactical nuclear attack. 
 
So what we are really seeing is a tit-for-tat at this point. We had that significant launch on Saturday by North Korea, which the United States condemned, saying it's a blatant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
 
And then, what we have seen is really a response from both sides since that point. 
 
We also had a statement from Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-Jong. And she said that what happened on Saturday was actually proof that they had the missile re-entry technology, also saying that it would show those fanatics who raise tensions will pay the price. A thinly veiled reference there to the U.S. or South Korea, or potentially both. 
 <br>[00:15:08] So what we are seeing is once again North Korea saying, what they say is a response to a U.S.-South Korean joint military drill. We know there is another one coming this week at the Pentagon. There will be a nuclear tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korean side.
 
And then next month, in March, there will be bigger military drills here on the peninsula, likely again to cause some kind of reaction from Pyongyang -- Michael. 
 
HOLMES: Paula, really appreciate the update. Paula Hancocks there in Seoul for us. 
 
And we will take a quick break here on the program. When we come back the top U.S. Diplomat visiting Turkey after it was ravaged by that powerful earthquake. We'll have details on his pledge to help the region with more American aid. 
 
Plus, a small town in Georgia coming to terms with the news that their beloved former president, Jimmy Carter, is in hospice care. We'll take you there for details. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: In the coming hours, the U.S. secretary of state is expected to meet with Turkey's president to discuss security and recovery efforts after that devastating earthquake. 
 
This coming a day after Antony Blinken announced an additional $100 million in disaster relief for both Turkey and neighboring Syria, which was greatly impacted, of course. 
 
Earlier on Sunday, the top U.S. diplomat surveyed the earthquake damage in some of Turkey's worst hit area, saying the rebuilding process would be difficult but that America will be there to help. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This is going to be a long- term effort. The search-and-rescue, unfortunately, is coming to an end. The recovery operation is on, and then there will be a massive rebuilding effort. When you see the extent of the damage, the number of buildings, the number of apartments, the number of homes that have been destroyed, it's going to take a massive effort to rebuild. But we're committed to supporting that effort. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: This earthquake has forever changed the lives of so many people, including some of its youngest survivors. Nada Bashir reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Their laughter hides their loss. Pulled from the rubble, their parents still missing, the identities of some a mystery. This orphanage has become home to some of Turkey's youngest earthquake
 
 survivors. Authorities say the search for living relatives continues. But some of these children are believed to have lost everyone. 
 
MERVE BAS, ISTANBUL PROVINCIAL SOCIAL SERVICES (through translator): When we first receive these children, we observe signs of post- traumatic stress disorder. The children were very fragile. So as well as providing shelter and security to these kids, we also began providing psychosocial support. 
 <br>[00:20:07]
 
BASHIR (voice-over): The devastation wrought by the earthquake has left countless children orphaned or separated from their loved ones. And while authorities say they have so far managed to reunite more than 900 children with their families, many are still waiting to be processed. 
 
And NGOs fear that millions could be at risk of acute psychological distress. 
 
OBEN COBAN, TURKEY SPOKESPERSON, SAVE THE CHILDREN: They already have their loved ones lost. They already have their homes lost. They already have their schools lost. All schools, exact, are gone. But if they also lose their hopes, that means loss of generations. 
 
BASHIR (voice-over): That loss is all too familiar to this Syrian family. Three generations, now temporarily hosted in this small one bed apartment in Istanbul. Their home in Antakya now a mountain of rubble. 
 
Twenty-six-year-old Raghad says she was the first to wake when the earthquake struck, pulling her mother and four sisters to safety just moments before their home collapsed. 
 
RAGHAD, EARTHQUAKE SURVIVOR: When the earthquake happened, I think it's (UNINTELLIGIBLE).
 
BASHIR: Veteran Day (ph).
 
RAGHAD: Yes. There is a very -- a very big sound that it's not going out from my head. Every time it's huge. 
 
BASHIR: You're still here. 
 
RAGHAD: Yes.
 
BASHIR (voice-over): But this is not the first time Raghad and her family have faced a tragedy of this magnitude. Originally from the Syrian city of Homs, the constant barrage of airstrikes forced the family to flee their home in 2014. 
 
But having her life upended by catastrophe time and time again has taken its toll on Raghad's mental health. 
 
RAGHAD: That's not my first time I get a life from war or something bad. And every time I said why? And now I'm asking myself why -- why I'm alive? Maybe it was easy if I'm not. 
 
BASHIR: Easier than going through it? 
 
RAGHAD: Yes, because it's my not my first time that I start from zero. 
 
BASHIR: Yes.
 
BASHIR (voice-over): Starting from zero, for these children, may not be as challenging. It's a catastrophe they are simply too young to understand. But just like Raghad and her family, their lives have been changed forever by the earthquake.

HOLMES: The people of the small towns of Plains, Georgia, and indeed, many around the world are praying for the former U.S. President Jimmy Carter as he receives hospice care at home. 
 
On Sunday, the church where Carter has taught Sunday school for decades prayed for his family. CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Plains, Georgia, with more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We know from an official that President Biden has been maintaining close contact with the Carter family. He's been informed of Carter's declining health and his decision to undergo hospice care. 
 
But now we're hearing from President Biden directly via tweet. He put out this comment saying, "To our friends Jimmy and Rosalynn and to their family, Jill and I are with you in prayer and send you our love. We admire you for the strength and humility that you have shown in difficult times. May you continue your journey with grace and dignity and God grant you peace." 
 
So I am standing right now close to Main Street here in planes Georgia, the hometown of Jimmy Carter, where everywhere you look there's a piece of history, of Carter history here. 
 
To my left, beyond what you can see, through these trees behind me, his high school, where he learned about American history and probably never thinking that one day he would become Mr. 39, the 39th president of the United States. 
 
And actually, as we look down this way beyond the train tracks, less than a mile away, a couple of blocks, is the home that he built in 1961, the home that he still lives in today with his wife. 
 
And over to your left, right here, this building that's now a museum, that is the presidential campaign headquarter for his 1976 presidential bid. This is the spot where thousands of people would drop by to get a sense of how a peanut farmer wanted to become president of the United States. I also want you to take a look at this video. This hospice news is
 
 really coming four and a half months after he celebrated his 98th birthday. This video you're looking at is the weekend before that, where they are at the Plains Annual Peanut Festival, waving at the crowds there. This may have been one of his last public appearances here in Plains. 
 
Now the news of this hospice news, of Carter preparing for his end of life, his family preparing, is understandably rocking Plains. 
 
PHILIP KURLAND, OWNER, PLAINS TRADING POST: This is emotional. The fact that he won't be coming in the store anymore. He won't be here. He won't be at meetings. 
 
But you know, every little thing I do here, he'll be with me.
 <br>[00:25:01] 
 
If I said something to his family, I would say, yes, I know you're mourning and, yes, I know you're hurting, but I hope you celebrate his life, too, because what a life. What a well-done life. 
 
ROSALES: And Carter has always been known as a man of deep, deep faith. In fact, he taught at Maranatha Baptist Church Sunday -- Sunday School every single week until his health issues really forced him to take a step back away from that. 
 
And Sunday service, his congregation, his fellow people in faith, were sending out prayers to him and wishing his family comfort. 
 
Isabelle Rosales, CNN, Plains, Georgia. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Still to come on the program, a show of support from the U.S. president as the war in Ukraine nears the one-year mark. We'll have more on Joe Biden's trip to Poland. 
 
Also, U.S. officials fear China might provide military support to Russia as Moscow continues its invasion. We're live in Beijing with the latest on that. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Poland's prime minister says he expects a, quote, "very strong confirmation" of joint efforts to defeat Russia in Ukraine when U.S. President Joe Biden visits pull in this week. 
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has a preview of that trip from the White House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Joe Biden is set to visit Poland ahead of the one-year mark of Russia invading Ukraine. And he will use this opportunity, White House officials say, to
 
 reinforce support for Ukraine and show unity among allies. 
 
Now during his visit, he is expected to meet with the Polish president, as well as with a group of Eastern-flank NATO allies. He is also expected to deliver remarks, and in those remarks, again show support and note the humanitarian and security assistance that Ukraine will continue to get as it fights this ongoing war with Russia. 
 
Now, White House officials said those remarks are not only intended for the American people but for the world, including Russia. 
 
Now we got a sense from the administration on their tone with Russia when Vice President Kamala Harris, during the Munich security conference, said that Russia had committed crimes against humanity. 
 
That is a step further from where the administration has been before, saying that they had committed war crimes. 
 
Now, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has said that it is important for allies to speed up, that they cannot have delay as they fight this war with Russia. 
 
Expect President Biden to address all of that during his visit in Poland. 
 
Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: U.S. believes China might provide military support to Russia as its invasion of Ukraine grinds on, as we've been reporting. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, says he warned China's top diplomat of consequences, should that happen. 
 <br>[00:30:12]
 
Blinken added Chinese companies have already been providing nonlethal support to Moscow. Here's what he told NBC News. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLINKEN: China is trying to have it both ways. Publicly, they present themselves as a country striving for -- for peace in Ukraine. But privately, as I said, we've seen already over these past months, the provision of non-lethal assistance that does go directly to aiding and abetting Russia's war effort. 
 
And, some further information that we are sharing today and that I think will be out there soon, that indicates that they are strongly considering providing lethal assistance to Russia. To the best of our knowledge, they haven't crossed that line yet.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What form? What form? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES: CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang, joins me now with more on this. So Steven, how's China responding to the U.S. talking red lines on China providing that kind of material support to Russia? 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Michael, China has not specifically responded to Blinken's public remarks. But in their foreign ministry read-out on this meeting between Blinken and China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, in Munich over the weekend, it made some veiled references and a very strong pushback, and saying China does not accept U.S. finger-pointing and coercion on this issue. 
 
And actually turning the table on the U.S., and accusing Washington of throwing fuel to the fire and trying to profit from the war. 
 
Now the language may sound familiar, but the timing of this latest revelation is very interesting, because Wang Yi is actually going to Moscow after Munich to meet with senior Russian officials and possibly Putin on the eve of the anniversary of the war and paving the way, according to Russian media, for a Xi Jinping visit to Moscow later this year. 
 
So this, you know, latest U.S. assessment really, in a way, shows how U.S. officials increasingly frustrated with China on its role in this conflict, despite Beijing's repeated pledge of, quote unquote, "neutrality." 
 
Now, what has happened, of course, is this fast-growing ties, both economically, not to mention politically, between the two countries, with bilateral trade volume, for example, soaring to a new high. 
 
That's why Blinken mentioned, from day one, there were a lot of concerns in terms of China helping Russia dodge severe Western sanctions even before the latest assessment. 
 
But, of course, this revelation also comes on the heels of that whole spy balloon saga, and that of course, is making it even probably more difficult for China to be willing to work with the U.S. on this issue. 
 
But also, interestingly, Wang Yi did meet with his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich. At least publicly, China is still calling Ukraine a strategic partner and is saying how China respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
 
But the reality, of course: China's state media still refuses to call the Russian invasion an "invasion." Not to mention Putin and xi Jinping have talked on the phone, met in person multiple times in the past year, but Xi Jinping has still yet to talk to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy on the phone even once. 
 
So all of this, of course, is why their pledge in public that they are the only peacemaker just rings very hollow to many people -- Michael. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Yes, indeed. Steven, appreciate the reporting. Steven Jiang in Beijing there for us. 
 
Now, a Ukrainian soldier who was severely wounded in battle and was on the brink of losing his legs to amputation now has a fighting chance of saving them, thanks to an American volunteer and surgeons in New York. 
 
CNN's Omar Jimenez has that story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VLADYSLAV ORLOV, OFFICER, UKRAINE NATIONAL GUARD: It's completely nice now. It's like a full foot. Oh, my God. 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just this feels like a miracle for Vladyslav Orlov, an officer in Ukraine's national guard, and being treated in the United States. 
 
ORLOV: Sometimes I really don't understand what has happened with me, you know. I'm still somewhere on another planet. Like normal always, you know, because when it happens with me, I don't realize. I just smoke and wait (ph), and like boom. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): October 2022, the aftermath of what may have been artillery fire hitting his vehicle. 
 
ORLOV: Something is shot on my car, in front of me and car is flipped, burned.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): He was told he may have to have his leg amputated or may never walk again. So it began their pursuit of another option, any option. 
 
GARY WASSERSON, VOLUNTEER, COORDINATED AID: I sprang into action and started making calls in the United States. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): Gary Wasserson had already been helping coordinate resources to the region on a volunteer basis. 
 
WASSERSON: That was my biggest concern, was making sure that I could successfully get clearance for him to come here. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): Eventually, Wasserson was able to sponsor Vlad coming to the U.S., but from one complicated equation to the next, the hospital for special surgery in New York City had been assessing how they might be able to save Orlov's legs. 
 
DR. DURETTI FUTA, HAND AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGEON, HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY: He had both soft tissue wounds as well as bone defects or missing bone from the blast injuries, multiple fractures in each of the feet. He's also undergone two very lengthy procedures to begin the major step for reconstruction of both his right and his left foot. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): Reconstruction is one thing. Walking is something else entirely. His recovery isn't guaranteed, with more surgeries to go. 
 
ORLOV: All bones in foot is broken. It's same for my right foot, too. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): But doctors are optimistic. 
 
Meanwhile, back home for Orlov, it's been nearly a year since the Russian war in Ukraine began. Hope has become a currency. 
 
JIMENEZ: So when you get better, you want to go back? 
 
ORLOV: I want to try, of course. But I still have options to help my country. Everything that I can do, I will do. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): He hopes he may walk again, but he hopes that his country does so much more and that the world hopes it, too. 
 
ORLOV: One military man destroy another military man, it's war. Yes, OK. But when military men destroy women and children, it's not OK, absolutely. It's war crimes. It's every day. 
 
A lot of people don't understand, like with this war, what is going on. It's not just about war in Ukraine and Russia. It's about human rights.

FELIX KAMMERER, ACTOR, "ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT": To come here with 14 nominations is just mind-boggling. 
 
MACFARLANE (voice-over): The BAFTAs at London's Royal Festival Hall was a night of film royalty rubbing elbows with British royalty. The late Queen Elizabeth remembered in a heartfelt tribute by Dame Helen Mirren.

MACFARLANE (voice-over): The night also paid tribute to those displaced by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, and the war in Ukraine. 
 
KAMMERER: First year with refugees, and I think especially with a movie like "All Quiet," it's always important to get back to reality what really -- this has something -- this has to do with us. So, this I think, is a good time to show our support. 
 
MACFARLANE (voice-over): And on the night, the World War I epic film "All Quiet on the Western Front" cleaned up with seven BAFTAs, including Best Picture. 
 
EDWARD BERGER, DIRECTOR, "ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT": Today, there's a different war in the Ukraine. In five days, it will be one year, the anniversary, and there are no heroes in it, in any war.

MACFARLANE (voice-over): Set during the Irish civil war, "Banshees" picked up four BAFTAs, including Outstanding British Film, despite a mostly Irish cast. 
 
MARTIN MCDONAGH, DIRECTOR, "THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN": I know every Irish person in the cast and crew were kind of going "Best What" award? But thanks to Rosie, our stand-in donkey, who's British. 
 
TOM HANKS, ACTOR: He was my destiny.

Christina Macfarlane, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Great cinema there. 
 
The documentary of Alexei Navalny, by the way, might have won a BAFTA on Sunday night, but it is highly likely that the Kremlin critic himself is not even aware of the owner.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexei Navalny is taking on the most dangerous job in the world, challenging the leader of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin. 
 
ALEXEI NAVALNY, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER: If I want to be a leader of this country, if I want to fight Putin, I have to organize people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Navalny is serving nine years in a maximum security Russian prison on charges of fraud and contempt of court. Earlier this month he was transferred to a solitary confinement cell for six months.
 
But his daughter, as we just saw, was at the BAFTAs ceremony in London and spoke with CNN about the importance of the award.

NAVALNAYA: Thank you to our amazing and incredible, very passionate, and talented team, we're here. I'm very happy that the story about my father and about the work that he is doing is getting noticed. It's amazing.
