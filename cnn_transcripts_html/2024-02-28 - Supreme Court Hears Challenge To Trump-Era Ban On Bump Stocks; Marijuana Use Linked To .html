BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: The U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether a ban on bump stocks enacted under former President Donald Trump should stand.
 
Today, justices heard arguments made by a Texas gun store owner, who claims the ATF overstepped its authority when it banned the accessories. 
 
Remember, the ban came after the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest in U.S. history, when a gunman opened fire from the window of a hotel, killing 58 concert-goers and hurting hundreds more. 
 
He used a semi-automatic rifle that was equipped with a bump stock so that it fired like a machine gun. 
 
CNN senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, was in the courtroom today hearing arguments. 
 
Joan, it seems like the court was very divided over the arguments. 
 
JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: It was. Now remember, this is a Supreme Court that in recent years has cut back on gun control and has expanded the idea of the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
 
But this case is not about the Second Amendment. This is case is about government regulatory power to expand the idea of what is a machine gun.
 
And as you just referred to this terrible incident in Las Vegas in 2017, in which 58 people were killed, hundreds injured.
 
And after that, the Trump administration said that this ban on machine guns that dates to the 1930s, the era of Al Capone, could cover bump stocks because of how rapidly they could fire. 
 
Now here's the language at issue. The text of that law refers to "a single function of a trigger" that allows multiple firing of rounds. 
 
And the challengers say, because the trigger resets itself between shots of a bump stock, it wouldn't fall under that language. 
 
The government says that, no, the shooter himself or herself would initiate a sequence with a single motion so it should fall under it. 
 
So it's interesting, Boris, at some points, the justices were going like this with their hands as they were trying to simulate the trigger firing. Because it goes down to -- comes down a single function of the trigger irrespective of how important this law is. 
 <br>[13:35:10]
 
And actually, some of the liberal justices tried to argue that actually the Textualist reading, which is usually what conservatives imply --
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
BISKUPIC: -- a very Textualist reading, actually would accommodate this. So I think it's going to be a close call. 
 
And I'll just refer to something that Justice Elena Kagan said. She said, "I view myself as a good Textualist. At some point, though, you have to apply a little bit of common sense." 
 
And what the government lawyer was saying here is that the challengers are doing a Textualist reading of what is arguably an ambiguous statute, and that that they are actually having to go through some gymnastics themselves.
 
And that the better reading on the text, not talking about good government policy at all, on the text, would go to the government here.
 
SANCHEZ: It is a fascinating case. 
 
BISKUPIC: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: Look forward to whatever decision the Supreme Court issues. 
 
Joan Biskupic, thanks so much for walking us through that. 
 
BISKUPIC: Thank you. 
 
SANCHEZ: Brianna?
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: All right. Let's discuss this now with CNN contributor and senior "news writer at "The Trace," Jennifer Mascia, here. 
 
All right. So, Jennifer, let's talk about this. 
 
What did you glean from Justice Neil Gorsuch asking today why the ATF, which is a federal agency, is banning bump stocks rather than Congress? it's a similar sentiment we heard from Justice Amy Coney Barrett. JENNIFER MASCIA, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Right. Well, what they're referring
 
 to is the 1934 National Firearms Act. And they're saying, well, you know, if it's a single trigger pole -- you know, well, obviously, bump stocks are only a twenty-year-old technology, right? 
 
There's no way that Congress in 1934 could have anticipated anything like that. 
 
So they're saying, if there is a difference between the amount of effort that a user has to put into a device that makes it function like a machine gun versus the single trigger pull that was the standard at the time, was there any distinction made? And should there be now? 
 
And so that's really what dominated a lot of the talk today. 
 
But what's interesting is that ultimately this is not a Second Amendment argument. This is whether the ATF exceeded its rulemaking authority. 
 
So while the Second Amendment argument kind of dominated today, and these features of the gun, could it be considered a machine gun? Ultimately, that's not what this particular case is going to be decided on. 
 
KEILAR: So if the justices rule, ultimately, that the ATF bump stock ban is unconstitutional, will that have repercussions on other federal actions that are related to guns? 
 
MASCIA: Well, what's interesting is that there was just another case this week where the ATF's rulemaking authority was upheld. 
 
So a federal judge in California -- and, of course, that's a very liberal state -- you know, said the ATF's new rules on ghost gun kits, which it implemented via or after an executive order, actually didn't go far enough, that they could have gone farther in their rulemaking authority outside of Congress. 
 
So it's really interesting to see what different courts are finding. The Supreme Court, ultimately, is weighing in on this once and for all. And that will affect the entire country. 
 
Now bump stocks are not nearly as widely owned as pistols or any other firearms. This is a small subset of the firearms community. You know, recreational shooters who enjoy, put -- you know, sending 400 bullets are 700 bullets at a time toward a target. 
 
So ultimately, this is not going to affect the majority of gun owners or anything close. But it is a gun rights argument that is held very near and dear to that particular community 
 
KEILAR: Yes. And yet many people -- I know it's not the majority of gun owners or even a sizable portion. But you still have hundreds of thousands of these that have been purchased, right? 
 
So knowing the damage they can contribute to, what does it mean for public safety if these are available? 
 
MASCIA: Notably, these are -- they were used in a horrific crime where hundreds of people were shot. But we don't see these in a lot of shootings. 
 
So the argument could be made that it's more important to vet a gun owner and not the device, you know, whether it's a bump stock or assault weapon.
 
Any kind of different device, these are cosmetic changes. Ultimately, it's the owner and their intent with it. And maybe it's more important to focus on that than the actual, you know, device. So we'll see.
 
KEILAR: Yes, we'll certainly see. 
 
All right. Jennifer, thank you so much for being with us.
 
And still to come on CNN NEWS CENTRAL, a new study laying out the risks of using marijuana, regardless of whether it's smoked, vaped, or taken as an edible. We'll have the details on that ahead. 
 <br>[13:39:56]
 
And the pope back at the Vatican after being admitted to the hospital earlier today. What we're learning about his brief stay right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: It turns out that any, any use of marijuana, smoking, vaping or eating, can significantly increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke. That's according to a new study published today using data from nearly 435,000 American adults. 
 
It found the danger is real for the young and old alike, even if a person has no existing heart conditions.
 
CNN's Jacqueline Howard joins us now live. 
 
So, Jacqueline, what exactly did this study find? 
 <br>[13:44:58]
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: Yes, it was a really interesting study, Boris.
 
What the researchers found, they looked at this group of adults and specifically looked at those who use cannabis, those who use daily, and those who do not use cannabis.
 
And they found that daily cannabis use was associated with a 42 percent increased risk of stroke and 25 percent increased risk of heart attack. 
 
Now, this is an association. It's not a causation study. But it does parallel what previous research has found when looking at marijuana use and associations with your cardiovascular health. 
 
And one researcher specifically talking about smoking marijuana really said in a statement, quote, "Cannabis smoke is not all that different from tobacco smoke, except for the psychoactive drug." 
 
We're talking about THC versus nicotine. But it's the smoke itself that one researcher really kind of homed in on as a concern and having impacts not just on -- most of us think of our lungs -- but on our heart health as well -- Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: Jacqueline, we mentioned the risk to young and old alike, but are there any specific groups demographically that face a greater risk? 
 
HOWARD: I think the takeaway here is it really is the general population this risk was found. 
 
And when we think about younger adults, the researchers said that this relationship between cannabis use and potential heart health risks was similar for men under 55 and women under age 65. 
 
So like you said, Boris, those older in age, those younger in age, this association was found.
 
And I think it's another important takeaway message for people who may have a history of heart attack or stroke to be aware of this association that was found if they use cannabis -- Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: Jacqueline Howard, thanks so much for walking us through that.
 
Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: Now, to some of the other headlines that were watching this hour.
 
Pope Francis back at the Vatican after going to the hospital today. The Vatican says the 87-year-old pontiff underwent some diagnostic tests after holding general audience this morning.
 
Pope Francis has been in and out of the hospital here in the last year and recently canceled several audiences due to what is described as mild flu symptoms.
 
Also a spokesperson for Alexei Navalny is now confirming that the Russian opposition leader's funeral service will be held this Friday, two weeks after his sudden death in one of Russia's harshest prisons.
 
The service will be taking place at a cemetery in Moscow. And it is open to the public. His widow telling the European parliament today she doesn't know if police will arrest people at the service. 
 
She also said that her husband's body was abused. And she blamed Vladimir Putin for his death.
 
And Prince Harry has just lost a legal battle for taxpayer-funded security when he is in the U.K. A British court today ruled that he is not entitled to full royal protection because he is no longer a working royal. 
 
Harry has insisted that he and his family have been in danger when they visit his home country. His spokesperson says Harry will appeal this decision. 
 
Historic Hawkeye Caitlin Clark taking aim at one of the most hallowed records in college sports. Two teens standing in her way. We'll have that, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:53:05]
 
SANCHEZ: Iowa's Caitlin Clark is already one of the biggest names in college sports -- is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA women's basketball. But now with there's two games left in her regular season career, she has a shot at something even bigger. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. She's just 51 points shy of surpassing Pete Maravich as the all-time leading scorer overall. 
 
And with us now, we have CNN's Don Riddell.
 
Don, Iowa taking on Minnesota tonight. Set the scene for us here. 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Well, the excitement is building. The prices for these games are going through the roof. And she is on pace to break this record in just two game's time. 
 
Let's just look at the stats and kind of what she's achieved. She's averaging 32.1 points every single game she plays. As you've just acknowledged, she's 50 points shy of tying Pete Maravich, 51 shy of surpassing the record. 
 
And so at her current pace, she will do it in the final game of the season, which will be against their biggest rivals, Ohio State. However, in theory, it could happen in this game tonight. 
 
She is -- she's in the heart of the most wonderful storm and she's beginning to realize that it's about much more than just Caitlin Clark. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAITLAN CLARK, IOWA HAWKEYES GUARD: I think I've embraced that role of being a name that people can identify women's sports with really well. I think it's something that I accept and I'm comfortable doing. 
 
If that's what's going to help our game move forward, if that's what it's going to help women sports move forward, it's just something I want to embrace and enjoy and be an advocate for. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) RIDDELL: So I said that she's likely to break the record in the final game of the regular season, but there is a chance that she actually does it tonight.
 
Because, remember, just a couple of weeks ago, when she broke the women's record, she's called 49 points that night, which was a career- best. So it's not completely impossible to think she could do it in the coming hours.
 
SANCHEZ: And, Don, ticket prices for Iowa's Sunday home game against the Ohio State, the most expensive now for a women's basketball game on record?
 <br>[13:55:03]
 
RIDDELL: Yes. And that's just remarkable. 
 
And $491 was the cheapest you could get a ticket for when we looked at this on Tuesday. And 491 bucks is the cheapest ticket you can get, which is, by the way, already double what the ticket prices were when she broke the women's record just a couple of weeks ago.
 
You know about FOMO? Nobody wants to miss out. And the idea that people could be at a historical sports event means they'll pay through the nose to be there.
 
SANCHEZ: Don Riddell, thanks so much. We'll be watching closely tonight and on Sunday as well. Appreciate it.
