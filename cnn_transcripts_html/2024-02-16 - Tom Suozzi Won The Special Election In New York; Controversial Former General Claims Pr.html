COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, sunshine. Welcome to CNN 10. Go on and smell the flowers and cool the soup. We made it to Friday, baby. Friyay. 
 
 Let`s finish this week strong. I`m Coy Wire. 
 
Let`s start today by taking a look at the possible implications of the special election that took place in New York earlier this week. Democrat 
 
 Tom Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in New York`s 3rd Congressional District election. This election took place to replace expelled former GOP 
 
 Representative George Santos, who`s facing federal charges that include money laundering and lying to investigators. 
 
Suozzi`s win is significant because it helps Democrats tighten the already slim majority, the Republicans have in the House of Representatives, their 
 
 control now slips down to just six votes. 
 
And the repercussions may not end there. Our Lauren Fox explains what this might mean for both parties as they try to win over voters in the upcoming 
 
 presidential election season.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A democratic victory in New York, shrinking an already narrow Republican majority in the 
 
 House.
 
REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY):  Let me just enjoy this for one more minute, OK?
 
FOX:  As the GOP grapples with what it means for their chances in November.
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER:  The result last night is -- is not something in my view that Democrats should celebrate too much. There was a 
 
 weather event that -- that affected turnout. There are a lot of factors there. That is in no way a bellwether of what`s going to happen this fall.
 
FOX:  Many in the party arguing former three-term, Congressman Tom Suozzi won in a district where he had high name ID against a relatively unknown 
 
 GOP opponent.
 
REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS, (D) NEW YORK:  I think it was a little bit of the, you know, the devil, you know, versus the devil you don`t know.
 
FOX:  But the special election in the New York suburbs still a key opportunity for both parties to test drive their messages and assign for 
 
 Democrats that they may be able to play offense on immigration. One of the most difficult issues facing them this cycle. 
 
REP. BYRON DONALDS, (D) FLORIDA:  If the Democrats are going to try to campaign on wanting to secure the border, we should actually call their 
 
 bluff and make them do it right now.
 
FOX:  On the trail, Republican Mazi Pilip hammered Suozzi on the border in a district where a migrant shelter was built just last summer.
 
MAZI PILIP, (D-NY):  We are fighters.
 
FOX:  But Suozzi attacked his opponent for not having solutions. And instead embraced a bipartisan Senate bill aimed at cracking down on asylum 
 
 claims and more quickly processing and deporting migrants that come to the U.S. illegally.
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, (D) NEW YORK:  Tom Suozzi talked about issues, fixing challenges, solving problems.
 
FOX:  The district, which Biden one by eight points in 2020 has emerged as a key battleground for Republicans in recent years with a powerful party 
 
 apparatus that helped elect George Santos and a new class of GOP congressmen in 2022. Both parties view those suburban districts as key to 
 
 winning the majority in 2024.

WIRE:  Now this year, there are several major elections happening around the world with people in some of the world`s largest democracies, looking 
 
 to vote on their next leaders. One of them Indonesia, it`s the third largest democracy in the world with more than 270 million people. 
 
It appears that 72-year-old Prabowo Subianto won the Southeast Asian country`s presidential elections with unofficial results, showing him 
 
 winning nearly 60% of the vote. Subianto who`s eight former military general has a controversial pass. At one point, he was banned from entering 
 
 the United States. 
 
Our international correspondent, Anna Coren provides more insight on who this new leader is and what it may mean for Indonesia and beyond?
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is a job that Prabowo Subianto has wanted for a very long time. He sagged a takeover in 1998 after the fall of 
 
 the Suharto dictatorship but failed. He ran for president in 2014 and 2019, but lost both times to Joko Widodo and then falsely claimed the election 
 
 had been stolen. The 72-year-old will be Indonesia`s next president. 
 
The quick count, a reliable pollster shows he won almost 60% of the vote, which means there will be no runoff. And as the votes were being counted, 
 
 he addressed the media while doing laps in his indoor swing. 
 
Well, official results from the Electoral Commission won`t be revealed until next month. When he greeted supporters last night at a Jakarta sports 
 
 stadium may as well have been a victory celebration. He received a rock star welcome where he said, this was a victory for all Indonesians. Take a 
 
 listen.
 
PRABOWO SUBIANTO, INDONESIA`S PRESUMED NEW PRESIDENT (through translator):  This victory must be the victory of the people of Indonesia. Prabowo, 
 
 Gibran and all of the Indonesia forward coalition will embrace all elements and powers and become the president, vice president and government present 
 
 for all the people of Indonesia.
 
COREN:  But claims of vote rigging and massive fraud have been made from the other presidential candidates who`ve vowed to investigate. And there 
 
 have been a number of small protests staged in Jakarta today. 
 
Prabowo has an alarming history, a former general under the Suharto dictatorship. He`s been accused of human rights abuses, kidnapping, pro-
 
 democracy activists in the 1990s and ordering the massacre of independence fighters in East Timor in the 1980s, accusations he denies.
 
At one point, he was banned from entering the United States and Australia. But Prabowo has had a dramatic image makeover. Thanks in part to a slick 
 
 social media campaign, perhaps most importantly has been the endorsement by President Jokowi. He`s still wildly popular and credited for the country`s 
 
 solid economic growth, but he`s reached his two-term limit and cannot run again. But his elder son, 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming Raka is Prabowo`s 
 
 running. 
 
Now, it`s important to note that half of Indonesia`s voters are under the age of 40. Many weren`t born or too young to remember Prabowo`s alleged 
 
 human rights abuses. And of course the narrative has been rewritten. Prabowo is now a statesman, cuddly grandfather. He loves to dance on stage 
 
 and who`s campaigned as a continuity candidate. 
 
But critics are very concerned about what this means for the world`s third largest democracy. And if Prabowo, who has previously said that Indonesia 
 
 needs an authoritarian leader under his reign, the country will slide back to its authoritarian past.
