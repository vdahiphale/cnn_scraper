JIM SCIUTTO, CNN NEWS ANCHOR:  Lawmakers have been zeroing in this week on deadly and the alarming fentanyl crisis. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is now getting fact-checked.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN NEWS ANCHOR:  The Georgia congresswoman weighed in on issues after a mother who lost two sons to fentanyl overdoses made this emotional plea on Capitol Hill.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REBECCA KIESSLING, MICHIGAN MOTHER WHO LAST TWO SONS TO FENTANYL OVERDOES:  I mean, it's unbelievable. You would think that one death from fentanyl coming across our southern border would be enough to sound the alarm. 100,000 die every year and nothing is being done, not enough is being done. The numbers are going up, not down. And you talk about children being taken away from their parents. My children were taken away from me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  CNN's Daniel Dale with us now. So, that emotional testimony, we know that fentanyl overdoses and deaths are a major problem in this country. What is it about what the congresswoman said, what she claimed?
 
DANIEL DALE, CNN REPORTER:  Yes. So, the congresswoman attended this hearing. Questioned this mother. And then, afterwards posted a tweet in which she said, listen to this mother who lost two children to fentanyl poisoning and tell the truth about both of her sons' murders because of the Biden administration's refusal to secure our border and stop the cartels from murdering Americans everyday by Chinese fentanyl.
 
So, blaming the Biden administration for this woman's sons' death. In fact, this woman had been explicit. She testified to the committee that her sons' tragic loss occurred in July 2020, under President Trump. The Biden administration did not exist. I reached out to congresswoman's office for comment on this and to ask if she'd maybe delete the tweet or correct the tweet. Instead, her spokesperson, Nick Dyre, responded with profinity. He said that, you know, many other Americans have died under President Biden from drugs. And he said -- and I will sanitize this, he said, do you think they give an F about your BS fact-checking?
 
So, an usual response from a spokesperson. I also reached out to the spokesperson about other false claims that Marjorie Taylor Greene made the same day at a different meeting lying again about the 2020 election, saying that President Trump won Georgia. He lost to thousands of dead voters, cast votes in Georgia, the number is four. And in response to that query, the same spokesperson responded, and I will sanitize this, too, F-off.
 
SCIUTTO:  Daniel Dale, thanks so much for trying. Well, let's focus on the broader crisis here because, listen, it's been through multiple administrations. Joining me now to discuss, someone who has been fighting the surge in fentanyl, Randy Grossman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California. Randy, thanks for coming on this morning.
 
Randy Grossman, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California: Thank you, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO:  Listen, the deaths are off of the charts. This statistic caught me. Deaths are 2,375 percent from 2016 to today. 33 deaths from fentanyl in 2016. At least 817 in 2021, that according to the Medical Examiner's Office in your district.
 
Tell us how, if you can, how you are responding to this, because I think folks at home, they want to hear about solutions. And I you have a two-pronged approach that is to go out to prosecute the traffickers but also, do outreach community. Just give us the thumbnail.
 
GROSSMAN:  Yes. Thank you, Jim. You know, I have met with grieving parents and siblings and friends who have lost loved ones, and we just refuse to allow those deaths to be in vain, which is why we do have a two-part strategy. And first, to relentlessly pursue justice for those overdosed victims and their loved ones by targeting the suppliers that are responsible for the crisis.
 
But second, to be just as aggressive in our community, raising awareness about the dangers of fentanyl to prevent further deaths.
 
SCIUTTO:  Is this a border security issue?
 
GROSSMAN:  You know, on the prosecution side and on the law enforcement side, you know, we are targeting everyone from the cartel leadership to the drug trafficking organizations that operate at the border that bring the drugs into the United States through the Southern District of California to the street level dealers. And we are making some progress on the prosecution side. We are taking their drugs. We are taking their money. And we're take their liberty.
 <br>[10:35:00] We are securing lengthy prison sentences from cartel leaders all the way down to the street-level dealers. But we know as a matter of security at the border, as a matter of public safety, we're not going to be able to prosecute our way out of this crisis. So, we need to be in the community as law enforcement leaders, as prosecutors as chiefs of police, leaders of the federal agencies. We need to be in homeless shelters, we need to be in the classroom.
 
I was just in a middle school class just a month ago. And when I asked about the fentanyl, the hands went up. And to us, those are signs of progress because, for us, awareness will translate into saving lives.
 
SCIUTTO:  So, one thing that has struck me, and by the way, I am seeing it in my own children's classrooms as well, is that fentanyl is turning up in a whole host of places, not just heroin and high-end drugs but in other drugs, talk of like Adderall, right, something that's used by teenagers a lot. Marijuana as well. How do you get across the point that this could be anywhere, right? You can't trust anything, even if you are experimenting with something you would consider a less risky drug?
 
GROSSMAN:  Yes. Well, partly, because of you, you just gave that message on national TV, and we appreciate that. And it really comes down to a partnership with -- not only with the media but with the community and throughout leadership in our state and local governments to say just that, it is everywhere. The cartels are cutting their drugs as a matter of reducing costs and making profit. And it is everywhere, it's in oxycodone pills, it is Adderall and it's also in powder form as well.
 
We have seen an unfortunate trend where people in the depths of their addiction are actually seeking out the fentanyl, but it also continuous to be spiked in powder as well as pill drugs. So, it is everywhere. There is no safe experiment, bottom line.
 
SCIUTTO:  Right. You have mentioned oxycodone. And I have spoken to families -- so many families, sadly, who lost members where the path in is pain management after an injury. And what I found -- and I bet you folks listening at home have some experience, but myself, members of the family, young and old, have somewhat mild or minor operation and are always getting sent home with oxycodone. It doesn't mean that that by itself is a problem, but you do know that some folks, they get hooked, right, on other injuries and then, find their way down that path.
 
I mean, is that something that you see as a big part of this phenomenon, just how this country manages pain, right, and what doctors give out to do that?
 
GROSSMAN:  Sure. You know what, I can't speak to the results of those studies, but I can tell you that a significant number of the seizures that we're seeing in the Southern District of California are what we call these blues or these M30 pills. I mean, just we've had three very significant seizures since November. Over 3 million pills. Over a million pills each, and those were fake oxycodone pills or counterfeit oxycodone pills, the M30s. So, there is a substantial number of those pills being seized in the Southern District of California.
 
SCIUTTO:  Well, listen, you're doing good work. I mean, it's -- the concern is bipartisan. You know, no matter what your party is, folks see the effects of this, they're worry about it. We appreciative what you're doing and we hope you can keep up the conversation on this.
 
GROSSMAN:  Well, we appreciate you getting the message out. It's an honor to work with our federal, state and local law enforcement leaders who are all in on this effort, very dedicated to this fight against fentanyl. Thank you.
 
SCIUTTO:  Randy Grossman, thank you.
 
HILL:  Up next, rail working helping with cleanup at the site of that Ohio train derailment say they are experience headaches, nausea. The warning now from the union leaders.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
SCIUTTO:  Sometime today, the NTSB is expected to release an investigative update on the toxic train disaster in East Palestine, Ohio. So far, more than 1.8 million gallons of liquid waste, nearly 700 tons of solid waste, mostly soil, have been removed from the site.
 
HILL:  And now, union leaders say the rail workers who have been helping in the cleanup are experiencing migraines and nausea. And a letter to the government and to transportation -- the transportation secretary, the union has accused Norfolk Southern of putting the workers at risk by not providing personal protection gear. CNN's Isaac Dovere joining us now.
 
So, Isaac, how are officials responding here, these health concern and perhaps, most important, what's actually being done for these workers?
 
ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes. Well, look, we've heard from some of the residents of East Palestine about the nosebleeds and the other ways that they have been getting sick. But now, the union workers speaking out, saying that they have been getting sick as well. This letter that went to the governor of Ohio and the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, yesterday saying that they had not been provided with personal protection equipment for the cleanup, and they were experiencing a range of symptoms as well.
 
Buttigieg and the federal railway administrator president met with representatives of 12 unions yesterday in Washington, and this was a major topic of discussion. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told me he was not part of the meeting but he told me it is essential that the workers be a part of this conversation to figure out what is going on here and how to keep everybody safe going forward.
 
SCIUTTO:  I am amazed they wouldn't take a simple step of providing PPE for folks dealing with those kinds of chemicals. But goodness. Guess that's what we're seeing. Isaac Dovere, thanks so much.
 
DOVERE:  Thank you.
 
SCIUTTO:  Still ahead, the rise and fall of HQ Trivia. CNN takes a deep look into the game show app that went vital before it suddenly came crashing down. The show's former host, he's going to join us next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
SCIUTTO:  Well, before Wordle or Spelling Bee, two games that take up a big chunk of my own time. Nearly everyone with a mobile device was playing HQ Trivia. Remember that?
 
HILL:  I do.
 
SCIUTTO:  I'm sure you were better than me. The new CNN film, "Glitch: The Rise and Fall of HQ Trivia," reveals the crazy story behind the game show app that went viral then crashed and burned in record time. Here's a previer.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
SCOTT ROGOWSKY, COMEDIAN AND FORMER HOST OF HQ TRIVIA LIVE:  This is HQ. I'm Scott, the host.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And HQ Trivia was everywhere.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You could actually win real money.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It just got so popular. The app is not ready to work.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And it crashed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And that's when the cracks started showing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Russ and Colin were polar opposites.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was jealousy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It leads to chaos.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Joining us now, the original host of HQ Trivia, Scott Rogowsky. Although, I understand you like to go by Quiz Daddy. Scott, nice to have you with us this morning.
 
SCOTT ROGOWSKY, COMEDIAN AND FORMER HOST OF HQ TRIVIA LIVE:  Thank you. Nice to be here.
 
HILL:  I think people do remember this -- yes. I remember this fondly. I remember my kids actually turning it on to me. My older one was probably fifth or sixth grade at the point and all of his friends became obsessed with it. This just took off like a rocket. What do you think it was about this game?
 
ROGOWSKY:  Well, Erica, it was something new. It was fresh. It was a live game show on your phone, right? You don't have to be sitting on your couch locked into a television set somewhere, you could be mobile with it, out and about, people were playing at basketball games, weddings. I got so many pictures of people playing all over the world in different places.
 
But you can take it anywhere. And it was a live tuning. You had to be in it to win it. It wasn't like any other kind of game on your phone where you could play any time you want, at your pleasure, it was certain time of the day for 15 minutes. There was a time element. You could win money. Let's not forget, we're giving away money. Who doesn't want to win free money?
 
HILL:  Money.
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes.
 
ROGOWSKY:  So, there were a lot of factors.
 
SCIUTTO:  So, I mean, almost as quickly as it took off, reaching, you know, 2 million players, I mean, so fast, it just started to decline and then, fell off of the cliff. What happened?
 
ROGOWSKY:  As many factors for its success, there were for its ultimate demise. A lot of it is explained in the film, obviously, which I'm glad the full story is getting out there. But I can narrow it down to this. I think it was a great product, right, and it just did not iterate and evolve quickly enough. It sat in this weird mix of being tech and media.
 
And in the tech world, you have to innovate, you have to iterate very quickly. You always -- how many times you get updates in your phone, right? Update this, update that. We weren't updating enough with fresh material. I like it to be -- like a five-course meal, you know, Michelin star meal, it gets -- it's good once, twice. But if you have it every day for two years, you're going to be turned off to it at some point, right?
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes.
 
HILL:  You might get a little sick of it. I'm curious. What was this like for you? So, you're the host. You're -- I mean, you're on this rocket. It's shooting up. Then it drops. What was that like for you both during and after?
 
ROGOWSKY:  Well, I mean, I was -- prior to HQ, I was kind of an underemployed semi struggling comedian in New York City for, you know, 12 years I was on that grind. And this was out of the blue audition that I got and I really didn't think much of it at the beginning, right? I mean, a game show on your phone, who wants to do that? But it very quickly took off. And as it did, I was thinking, wow, this really could be the future of media, the future of television, and I was getting really comfortable. Just as I was getting into my groove, it all started to come down around me. So, it was definitely a roller coaster for sure.
 
SCIUTTO:  All right. So, I understand that you have questions for us to test us out and then, I just want to say, I'm not at all competitive with Erica here.
 
HILL:  Yes. Jim's competitive at all about anything, ever.
 
SCIUTTO:  Bring it.
 
ROGOWSKY:  And a good yaley (ph) of course. Yes. So, here we go. Here's what we got for you guys. It's been a while since I've asked some questions. So, bear with me if I'm a little rusty. But I've got one for Jim first here. Jim, you are a city boy as am I, and Mets fan, as am I. So, let's go deep into the blue and orange here, OK?
 
The question is, who has the most home runs in a Mets' uniform, OK? Which player in most home runs, Mets' history, in Met's uniform? Mike Piazza, David Wright or Darryl Strawberry?
 
SCIUTTO:  Oh, God, man. I am going to be so embarrassed. (INAUDIBLE) is going to kill me if I get this wrong. The other resident Met fan. Mike Piazza.
 
ROGOWSKY:  Think old school here.
 
SCIUTTO:  Oh, my God.
 
ROGOWSKY:  This older school.
 
SCIUTTO:  I'm so bad.
 
ROGOWSKY:  The Straw Man.
 
SCIUTTO:  I'm going to go hide in a hole now. I'm going to go hide in a hole now somewhere.
 
ROGOWSKY:  52 dingers for Straw. Piazza is number three. Erica, I've got you too here. OK.
 
HILL:  I'm nervous.
 
ROGOWSKY:  One of the most savage question of all time I ever asked HQ.
 
HILL:  Oh, God.
 
ROGOWSKY:  OK. 83 percent of players got this wrong. Ready? Which Rice Krispy's elf usually wears marching band uniform? Snap, Crackle or Pop?
 
HILL:  I have literally -- 
 
ROGOWSKY:  Have you had your cereal this morning?
 
HILL:  -- no idea. I can picture them, but I don't know which one is which.
 
SCIUTTO:  The one with three kids.
 
HILL:  I am going with Crackle.
 
ROGOWSKY:  Crackle. Oh, this is crackling interview here. But -- 
 
HILL:  It is. We are crackling smart.
 
ROGOWSKY:  I want to pop with you, Erica. Pop is the answer.
 
SCIUTTO:  Can you please come back tomorrow so we have another chance?
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
HILL:  Do you mean we need to redeem ourselves, Sciutto?
 
ROGOWSKY:  Yes. I'm here all day.
 
HILL:  Is that what you're saying?
 
SCIUTTO:  Oh, man.
 
HILL:  All right. Good. Well -- 
 
SCIUTTO:  I'm so bumped.
 
ROGOWSKY:  I'm here all week.
 
HILL:  We may call on you.
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes.
 
HILL:  Scott, really appreciate. This was fun. And very much looking forward to the film. Thanks for coming on this morning and thanks for embarrassing us both. OK.
 
ROGOWSKY:  Yes, that's what I do. My pleasure.
 
HILL:  You are nailing it. In all seriousness, be sure to catch the new CNN film "Glitch: The Rise and Fall of HQ Trivia." It premieres Sunday night, 9:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific right here on CNN.
 
Thanks for joining us for our epic fail in trivia this morning. I'm Erica Hill.
 
SCIUTTO:  I'm so bumped right now. I'm Jim Sciutto. "At This Hour With Amara Walker" will start right after a quick break.
