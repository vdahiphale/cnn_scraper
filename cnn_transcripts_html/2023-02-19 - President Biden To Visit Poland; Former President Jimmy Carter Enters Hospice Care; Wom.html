(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: Welcome to the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. President Biden heads to Poland tomorrow almost one year to the date of Russia's invasion, full-blown invasion of Ukraine. The president will pledging unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO allies and it comes after the U.S. sent an unmistakable message to two of its antagonists at the Munich Security Conference.
 
Vice President Kamala Harris accused of Russia of crimes against humanity in the war and warned China not to provide lethal aid to Russian troops in Ukraine. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House. Let's talk about this trip that the president will take tomorrow, Priscilla. It is very important. It is coming at a time when the world is marking this one-year anniversary, if you want to call it that, one year since this full-blown Russian invasion of Ukraine. And it is shaping up as a trip that perhaps Vladimir Putin wouldn't have -- would not have predicted, that the president has rallied much of the world to Ukraine's aid. 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: And of course, it comes at a time where officials are warning of a Russian offensive, a potential Russian offensive in the next weeks or months. Crucial moment, Jim, as you laid out. President Biden heading to Poland tomorrow where he is going to reinforce support among allies and make it clear that they still stand by Ukraine and will be providing as they have been, humanitarian and security assistance. 
 
Now, on that schedule, he is expected to meet with Polish president as well as the eastern flank of NATO allies. Now, we got a little of a sense of what Poland is expecting in remarks by the polish prime minister. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, PRIME MINISTER OF POLAND: We have to change the paradigm and we have to say Ukraine must win and Russia must be defeated, and I believe that the words of President Biden will reassure all Europe that the United States is with us in this fight for freedom and peace. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVAREZ: Now, President Biden will be delivering remarks during his trip to Poland. Those remarks officials say will be intended for the American people, the world and also Russia. We got a sense of the tone the administration is already taking just days away from that one-year anniversary when Vice President Kamala Harris just yesterday said that Russia has committed crimes against humanity. That is a step further that when the -- where the administration has been before, that they have committed war crimes. So, anticipate more from President Biden and the administration as they crack down on Russia and make clear that they are rallying around Ukraine. Jim? 
 
ACOSTA: All right, Priscilla Alvarez, thank you very much. 
 
The Russia ambassador to the U.S. says Washington is accusing Moscow of crimes against humanity as an excuse to escalate the war in Ukraine. This after Secretary of State Blinken and Vice President Kamala Harris said the U.S. determined that Russia has committed the most egregious of crimes in Ukraine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPO) 
 
KAMAL HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We have examined the evidence. We know the legal standards. And there is no doubt these are crimes against humanity. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Joining me now, Rebecca Hamilton, a former prosecutor with the International Criminal Court and professor of law at American University. Rebecca, thanks for joining us. I mean, it's bizarre that the Russians, I mean, I suppose what else are they going to say, but it's bizarre that Russians would quarrel with this given the evidence that the entire world has seen? I remember the scenes that we were playing out of Bucca very early on in this war. And you could just see the carnage, you could see war crimes. I mean, just picture-proof. 
 
REBECCA HAMILTON, FORMER PROSECUTO, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT: Yeah, it's not a surprise to me that Russia is trying to, you know, defend and refute. But as you say, the evidence is very clear and this recent determination of crimes against humanity comes after a very thorough review of the facts and evidence by the U.S. government. 
 
ACOSTA: And what is the distinction? I mean, when the vice president goes out there, I mean, I know from covering the Obama-Biden administration, they're just not going to go out willy-nilly and use terms like that. A lot of thought must have gone into that kind of a declaration from the vice president?
 <br>[17:04:55] 
 
HAMILTON: Exactly. So, we are talking about crimes like murder, torture, rape, deportation. But what is characteristic about crimes against humanity, makes it a crime against humanity is that it is part of a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population. 
 
ACOSTA: And Russian state media quotes Russia's ambassador to the U.S. saying he accuses the United States of turning a, quote, "blind eye" to the atrocities of the Zelenskyy regime against Russian troops. Obviously, this is more propaganda coming out of the Russian government. What do you make of all that? 
 
HAMILTON: I mean, it is, and I think there is overwhelming evidence that the bulk of crimes that are being committed in Ukraine are being committed by Russian forces. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity that are happening on the territory of Ukraine. And that jurisdiction, it is open to look at any crimes by any party. 
 
So, if there were genuine allegations of crimes committed by Ukrainian soldiers it could investigate that, but every piece of evidence that we've seen to date suggests that, by far, the bulk of the crimes that are being committed are being committed by Russian forces. 
 
ACOSTA: And Rebecca, you've worked as a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court. What are the odds that we will ever see any Russians including high-level Russian officials held accountable for what has taken place in Ukraine? 
 
HAMILTON: There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to seek some level of accountability. The only question is how much and how high up will it go in terms of Russian leadership. So, the International Criminal Court has been investigating this for months, gathering the evidence, building the cases. We will see those prosecution start to go forward.
 
And in addition, in this situation, and perhaps unlike atrocities that we see in Syria or in Yemen, here we have the Ukrainian government itself very keen to see accountability for what has happened to its citizens. And so, the Ukraine government and Ukrainian prosecutors are also building cases. 
 
So, really it is a question of, will there be enough prosecutorial resources between both the domestic and the international for the scale of crimes that we've seen committed. And obviously it's going to be much harder to get sitting Russian officials like Putin, in the (inaudible). But, you know, when we look back at the history of prosecutions for international crimes, eventually it takes time, but eventually we do see these leaders face justice. 
 
ACOSTA: And this all goes back to Putin. Is there any doubt in your mind?
 
HAMILTON: There is no doubt in my mind. And what is interesting and important to note about this charge of crimes against humanity, which is part of this widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, the prosecutors will be working to link that back to Russian policies, that at the end of the day, all lead back to Putin. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Rebecca Hamilton, thank you very much for your expertise, your insights. We appreciate it. HAMILTON: Thank you.
 
ACOSTA: And much of the world is following former President Jimmy Carter and the sad news about his declining health. The 98-year-old former president is now on home hospice care and will refuse further medical treatment. CNN's Isabel Rosales in Plains, Georgia, Carter's home town. Isabel, President Biden issued a statement sending a support to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. What else did he say? 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Jim. Yeah, President Biden has been staying in close contact with the Carter family but he's now in the last hour so, put out a statement about the Carter family and here's what he says, "To our friends Jimmy and Rosalynn and to their family, Jill and I are with you in prayer and send you, our love. We admire you for the strength and humility you have shown in difficult times. May you continue your journey with grace and dignity and God grant you peace."
 
So, Jim, I'm standing right now on Main Street, and really anywhere that you look around here, there is a piece of Jimmy Carter history. Right behind me, around the corner, was the home of Rosalynn. This road has been named after her, Rosalynn Carter Trail. And right over here. Take a look at this. Carter's warehouse. This is where his father sold and operated and owned this peanut industry. 
 
And you can see that today in time. They are still selling all sorts of peanut butter ice cream and treats here. So, every which way you look you will see either the face, the imagery, the name of Jimmy Carter. Now, this hospice news, it comes four and a half news after Jimmy Carter celebrated his 98th birthday.
 
And we have video of the celebration weekend beforehand where he was taken out in a Ford red convertible driven by Secret Service and he's waving out to the crowds from the car. 
 <br>[17:10:00]
 
This is during the Plains annual peanut festival. And this may have been one of his last public appearances here in Plains. And of course, the news of Carter's -- the Carter family preparing for Jimmy's end of life here is rocking this community.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
PHILIP KURLAND, OWNER OF PLAINS TRADING POST: I want to not believe it, but the reality of the situation is, I must believe it. But he will always be here. He's being buried in Plains, not in his library in Atlanta. What does that tell me? This is home and he wants to ensure Plains will always be successful and have a good foundation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROSALES: And Carter, Jimmy Carter, is a man of deep faith. The church, the same church where he taught Sunday school until he couldn't anymore because of health problems. They are praying for him and his family as well. Jim? ACOSTA: Isabel Rosales, thank you very much. We'll all be thinking
 
 about the Carter family during this next stage of his life. We appreciate it. 
 
ACOSTA: Meantime, Hollywood is mourning a beloved comedian and actor. Richard Belzer has passed away. Belzer is known best for playing Detective John Munch on several crime shows including "Homicide: Life on the Street" and of course, "Law and Order: SVU." His longtime manager Eric Gardner confirmed that Belzer passed away peacefully earlier this morning at his home in France. Long-time friend of the actor said that he dealt with, quote, "lots of health issues."
 
So many tributes are coming in on social media. I've been seeing all of this coming into my feed this afternoon, because there are just so many people out there in this country, around the world, who love Richard Belzer. Belzer was 78 years old.
 
A woman in New Jersey runs inside a gas station and locks tha door. It's a start of a shocking story one that takes more than a year and goes from nearly one end of the country to the next. That's next. 
 
Plus, I'll talk to the father of a slain journalist whose murder was streamed online live about his fight to hold internet companies responsible for the content that was posted and suggested on their sites. 
 
And later, he was a guest judge on "Shark Tank." I'll ask Harvard expert Matt Higgins if he thinks the worst of the economy that we've all been dealing with is behind us. You're live in the "CNN newsroom."
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ACOSTA: A dead bolt lock provided the key to dramatic escape for a kidnapped woman ending what police described as a year-long nightmare at the hands of her captor. It happened at a gas station in New Jersey where the woman saw an opportunity to break free and took it. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins me now. Polo, remarkable story, remarkable escape. 
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Yes. She was held against her will, Jim, for nearly 12 months and earlier this month she saw that opportunity to escape and she seized it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): It was a dramatic end to what police described as a nearly year-long cross-country kidnapping. The woman seen running into this New Jersey service station in early February is escaping her suspected captor who is close behind, a man later identified as James Parrillo, Jr. 
 
The year-long ordeal started in New Mexico where the couple first met last February. The woman says she agreed to give Parrillo a ride to Arizona. They eventually made their way to California where she says the relationship took a violent turn. That's where police say Parrillo physically assaulted the woman taking away her phone and debit cards. Eventually the pair made their way cross-country in what New Jersey state police describe as a year-long nightmare. Cameras inside the store captured the moment the bare-footed woman deadbolts the door preventing her alleged kidnapper from entering.
 
BOBBY MADAAN, GAS STATION OWNER: You can hear her screaming like, I've been kidnaped. 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): Bobby Madaan is the owner of the service station. He remembers the frantic look of the woman desperate to get away. 
 
That lady was really scared like she was really scared. She's looking at the back wall in the office thinking that he's going to come through the back door or break the door to come in. I told her -- I just reassured her that you're fine. You're safe. Those doors locked. Nobody is coming in and the police is on their way. And she just kept repeating that, you know, he's kept me against my will. And eventually the state troopers did get there. 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): New Jersey state police are looking into the possibility that Parrillo may have held other women against their will in the past. He's already been charged with kidnapping and aggravated assault and (inaudible) with what police say was a heroic escape. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
(On camera): And with the suspect behind bars and after that dramatic rescue, Jim, this investigation is still very much ongoing according to authorities. They are actively reaching out to authorities in other jurisdictions trying to see if they can make contact with people that possibly knew Parrillo. As we mentioned, they believe that this is not the first and only time. Meanwhile, CNN did reach out to his attorney and we've not immediately heard back yet. Jim? 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Polo Sandoval. Thank you very much.
 
A murder investigation is underway in Los Angeles after a Catholic bishop was found shot to death. Bishop David O'Connell served in the L.A. area for 45 years. The archbishop there says O'Connell was a peacemaker with a heart for the poor and immigrants. His killing, just one of several incidents of gun violence across the U.S. this past weekend. 
 
National correspondent Camila Bernal is tracking the story for us. Camilla, this is shocking and I'm -- it must be just sending shock waves across L.A. There are just so many folks I'm sure who just love this bishop. 
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And we've been talking to Catholics here in Los Angeles who say they are in shock because they were very devoted to this bishop who they say was a man of prayer, who was constantly seen praying for his community. Authorities here saying that they believe this bishop was shot in the upper part of his torso. He was found at a home here in Los Angeles, but they have not found the person responsible for all of this. [17:20:01]
 
So, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department saying that they are still looking for the person that pulled the trigger. All of this while the community here is in mourning and really just, it is something that they cannot believe happened to their bishop. Now, another community in mourning, but in Philadelphia. 
 
Authorities there saying that a university police officer at Temple University was also shot and killed. He was trying to stop a robbery and that's when he was killed. But in this case, they have been able to find the person responsible. They say it's an 18-year-old who has now been charged with murder. 
 
Another shocking incident involving guns happening in Columbus, Georgia. Authorities there saying that nine children were injured. There was a party and these minors later went to a gas station nearby. There was some confrontation, a fight, and nine of them ended up being injured. They were ranging in ages 5 to 17. 
 
Authorities in Columbus, Georgia, trying to piece together exactly what happened and who was responsible for shooting. So far, they have not been able to figure that out. 
 
Finally, one of the latest shootings happening this morning at around 12:45 local time in Memphis, Tennessee. Authorities there saying there were two separate shootings. They believe that a total of 10 people were injured and at least one was killed in that case. They are also still looking for the suspect for the person responsible of this shooting. 
 
So, again, just multiple shootings from coast to coast, and in many of them police and authorities still trying to figure out who did it and why all of this happened. Jim? 
 
ACOSTA: It's something we go through just about every weekend on this program. Going through these terrible mass shootings that are just an epidemic across this country. Camila, thank you very much. 
 
A big case coming up this week for the Supreme Court to tell you about it could transform the internet. We'll talk about that coming up. You're live in the "CNN Newsroom." 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:25:00]
 
ACOSTA: A case before the Supreme Court this week could fundamentally reshape the way you and I experience the internet. At issue, whether sites like YouTube and Facebook could be held liable for types of content their algorithms recommend to users. The family of an American woman who was killed in an ISIS terror attack in Paris in 2015 is suing YouTube owner Google arguing the company's algorithm is illegally promoting the terror group and its content.
 
At the heart of the case, is whether tech companies are protected by Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act, which says websites can't be held responsible for content created and posted by third parties. This issue is incredibly personal for Andy Parker. His daughter, reporter, Alison Parker and her cameraman, Adam Ward, were killed in 2015 during a live interview by a disgruntled former employee. 
 
Video from that incident can still be found online. And of course, so many people throughout Virginia know this case all too well. She went to James Madison University, my alma mater. I've been there lots of times, Andy, and I've seen the impact your daughter has made at the school. Alison is just so special there on campus. But Andy, let's talk about this case. What's at stake, because I mean, this has big implications. 
 
ANDY PARKER, FATHER OF REPORTER FATALLY SHOT ON LIVE TV: Thanks for having me, Jim. Yeah. It's going to be really big. And ultimately, I think it's going to -- we're going to be able to find out whether people like me and the Gonzalez family and countless others will be able to hold Google and Facebook accountable through the legal system. 
 
Right now, Section 230 gives these guys complete immunity. They can publish whatever they want to do. They can put it out there no consequences at all. And, you know, in the early days, early on when that video of Alison was out there, they were even running ads, scrolling ads underneath the video of her murder. 
 
Again, I -- I've told you this. I've told your audience this. I've never seen that video, but I've had help with from people that have flagged video like Eric Feinberg for Coalition of Safer Web. So, you know, the gist of it is, we'll find out, hopefully by June, whether we can take these guys to court. 
 
ACOSTA: And why is it so, I mean, for viewers at home to understand this, why is it so hard to get these videos off of the internet? Why can't these companies just take them down? They're flagged to these companies and they just can't get rid of them. Why is that? 
 
PARKER: Because they don't want to. Because they make money from it. And I will refer back to Frances Haugen who is the Facebook whistle- blower that testified before Congress. She validated everything I've been saying for the last seven years. And that is these guys know how to do it, they know how to remove this content and they just don't want to do it because they make money from it. And I can't abide by that. That's what gets me more than anything else, is that they're making money and they're profiting from my daughter's murder. 
 
ACOSTA: And you wrote an op-ed about this recently and you said that the policing of these videos like flagging and reporting them has fallen to the families affected. So, essentially, families like you and your family. 
 <br>[17:29:54]
 
You have to police this and I know you don't look at the video but in other cases I assume other family members have looked at the videos of their loved ones who have been tragically murdered or killed in some mass shooting or something like that. And they are the ones that have to police this? Go to these companies and say take these videos down and then they relive the horror? 
 
PARKER: Yes. And it's unconscionable. They shouldn't have to do -- having to be doing it. I shouldn't have to be doing it. Eric Feinberg or Lenny Posner, they shouldn't have to be doing this, but that's what these companies require. And, you know, if you do it and they do remove something, it's just arbitrary with what they decide to pull off and what they decide to leave up. 
 
And ultimately, you're just playing whack a mole. So, this has got to stop. And the only way that it will, I believe, is that if you eliminate the immunity offered by Section 230. If enough people with legitimate claims, like I do and the Gonzalez family do, if we can bring these folks to justice, that stuff will stop because they're not doing it, they're not doing what they're supposed to do and can do, because they don't have to. 
 
ACOSTA: Their hands aren't being forced to do it. But you know, Google says that without its algorithms and protections of Section 230, they say the internet would devolve into a disorganized mess and a litigation minefield. This is a quote from Google. What's your response to that? 
 
PARKER: Well, listen, if there are legitimate claims and legitimate lawsuits, they're going to be heard. If they're frivolous, they're going to be kicked out just like with any other industry. You know, Jim, I find it ironic that the issues that we face today, gun violence, which you alluded to in a previous segment there, between gun violence and social media, the only two industries in this country that are immune from any kind of liability are the gun industry and social media. 
 
I don't know -- I don't think there's a coincidence there that we have all of the troubles that we have. And I believe that if we do, or people are allowed to put their -- to take their claims to court, it's going to stop them. It's going to -- you know, if they die a thousand deaths, die by a thousand cuts, then they will stop this practice and they'll fix it because they can. 
 
ACOSTA: And they have the money to do it. I mean, all they have to do is, you know, put together some folks and they probably already have some of these folks who would have the duty of pulling these kinds of videos down. 
 
PARKER: Oh, sure. They do. They do, and you know, I've been working on this now for seven years now, and you know, we filed with Georgetown, with help of Georgetown University Law Center, we filed complaints with the FTC against Google and with Facebook. And the FTC is just, you know, silent. All we hear is crickets. So, they're not willing to act. 
 
Congress either doesn't have the will or the stomach to act, but I find it ironic that with, you know, some of the congressmen, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, they want this thing fixed like I do, for different reasons. They think that these companies stifle conservative voice, which is not correct. 
 
But, listen, if I can have allies like that that would get something done in Congress, I'd sure take it. And who knows with the Supreme Court. It's going to be very interesting to see with the dynamic there because it's going to make some interesting bedfellows, I think. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Andy Parker, always thinking about you and your family and Alison as well. It's always good to talk to you. Thank so much or coming and explaining this for us. We appreciate it. 
 
PARKER: Likewise, Jim. Take care.
 
ACOSTA: Thanks. You, too. All right, at the same time there's now renewed push by U.S. lawmakers to finally do something to help protect children against cyberbullying. At a Senate judiciary hearing this past week lawmakers from both parties lashed out at big tech companies. Their pleas gained new urgency because of a CDC report showing that teenagers especially girls are experiencing more violence, suicidal thoughts and mental health challenges as a result of what's taking place online. CNN's Brianna Keilar has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIN BRIDE, MOTHER OF CARSON BRIDE: This is my son Carson Bride with beautiful blue eyes and amazing smile. 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Kristin Bride is one of a growing number of parents who have lost a child to cyberbullying. Her 16-year-old son, Carson, died by suicide in 2020 after he was harassed on a Snapchat integrated app that allowed users to send anonymous messages. 
 
BRIDE: I woke to the complete shock and horror that Carson had hung himself in our garage while we slept. 
 <br>[17:34:58]
 
We discovered that Carson had received nearly 100 negatives, harassing, sexually explicit, and humiliating messages including 40 in just one day. 
 
KEILAR (voice-over): She's part of part of a group that testified on Capitol Hill about the dangers children face online. 
 
EMMA LEMBKE, SOCIAL MEDIA REFORM ADVOCATE: The constant exposure to unrealistic body standards and harmful recommended content led me towards disordered eating and severely damaged my sense of self, and there I remained for over three years, mindlessly scrolling for five to six hours a day. 
 
KEILAR (voice-over): The hearing coming just one week after President Biden's call to action during his state of the union address. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We must finally hold social media companies accountable for experimenting and doing, running children for profit. KEILAR (voice-over): The ubiquity of social media in kids' lives and
 
 the vehicle it provides for cyberbullying are also getting renewed attention as the CDC unveils a new report. It shows significant declines in youth mental health, an increased suicide risk in 2021 especially among girls. 
 
KATHLEEN ETHIRE, DIRECTOR, CDC DIVISION OF ADOLESCENT AND SCHOOL HEALTH: The levels of poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors reported by teenage girls are now higher than we have ever seen. 
 
KEILAR (voice-over): And as story of Adriana Kuch, a 14-year-old student in New Jersey who was attacked by four other teenagers in her school's hallway has stunned the nation. Video of her attack was posted to TikTok. Her father said she died by suicide the following evening. 
 
MICHAEL KUCH, FATHER OF ADRIANA KUCH: Getting hit in the face with a water bottle didn't hurt Adriana. What hurt Adriana was the embarrassment and humiliation. They just kept coming at her. 
 
SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): The social media platforms are operating in the days of the wild west and anything goes. 
 
KEILAR (voice-over): Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Richard Blumenthal are reaching across the aisle to try to get legislation passed after it failed last year. 
 
BLACKBURN: Protecting our children is not a partisan issue. 
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTAL (D-CT): I hope that outrage will finally be channeled into overcoming, here's the really important point, the armies of lobbyists and lawyers that big tech has mustered to counter and combat this legislation. No more. 
 
BRIDE: There is absolutely no way that any one parent can feasibly manage the fire hose of online harms that are being directed at our kids every day. We need help from the federal government, and we need it now. 
 
KEILAR (on camera): We see those vulnerabilities in the numbers of this new CDC report. One in three American teenage girls saying they've considered attempting suicide. One in five gay or bisexual teens saying they have attempted in the year before they were surveyed. They are clearly at a crisis point as they are navigating a sometimes-perilous online world. Brianna Keilar, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ACOSTA: Stories like "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" have been told the kids for ages but their characters could soon be very different. We'll tell you why some of these transformations might be happening when "CNN Newsroom" returns. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:40:00]
 
ACOSTA: Augustus Gloop, one of the famous characters in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is getting a makeover. New editions of author Roald Dahl's classic books area being rewritten in some cases to take out language deemed offensive such as fat, ugly or crazy. Some of the words are quote/unquote being used there. Now judged by modern day sensibilities has beloved titles also include "James and the Giant Peach," and "Matilda."
 
Suzanne Nossel joins us now to talk about this. She's the CEO PEN America, a human rights and free expression organization. Suzanne, great to see you, as always. It's been a long time but great to catch up and talk about this subject. Let me ask you this, author Salman Rushdie recently criticized some of these changes being made to these famous books. What are your thoughts on these classic works being altered? 
 
SUZANNE NOSSEL, CEO, PEN AMERICA: I think it's a mistake. Look, I think the impulse here is probably a noble one. They're trying to protect kids from stereotyping and prevent kids being made to feel bad if they're overweight or have other characteristics that might be triggered by these books.
 
But in so doing, it kind of gone in and excised and nipped and tucked and added things, added gratuitous lines that Roald Dahl never wrote and it just opens up, I think, a very problematic window for people exposed to go in and apply the standards of today to rewrite traditional literature and, look, people might agree with what the changes are to these books. 
 
Some might agree, but think about how that power might be misused. We're right now dealing with a crisis of book banning in this country to try to excise certain topics from our public discourse. If you were to reopen literature and insist that those elements, be scrubbed out, you know, you could see all kinds of wholesale changes. And so, I think this is just a door that we ought not open. 
 
ACOSTA: And I want to ask you about some of the book banning stuff in just a moment, but I know, Suzanne, you made the comment that you might be -- teachers might be missing a teachable moment here with some of these books to be able to say, okay, yes. There are some references made here that are insensitive to today's ears but it reminds me of reading Mark twain, growing up in high school, and that sort of thing. 
 
I mean, obviously, you know, time's change and we can reflect on literature and talk about that. 
 
NOSSEL: Yeah. Absolutely. Look, I think teachers have to be sensitive to the sensibilities who's in the classroom. 
 <br>[17:44:57]
 
It's a much more diverse classroom in many cases than it would have been 30 or 40 years ago. They need to consider how words land with different kids depending on backgrounds, but that can be done by conceptualizing, by talking about it, by letting people know. Look, you know, you may hear a word here that you're not accustomed to hearing that may be offensive to you, and here's the context to which it was written.
 
It's not to say it was right then, but it's something that can be discussed that can be part of the pedagogy. We were all going to be encountering offensive things as we go through life. And part of the role of children's literature has always been to help us confront our fears, that which is disturbing and to explore them and come to grips with them so that we're better prepared to move forward,
 
And I think this notion that that can be scrubbed clean out of children's books is really wrong-headed. 
 
ACOSTA: And speaking of scrubbing clean, I have to ask you. Down in Florida, this clash between Governor Ron DeSantis and the college board over AP African-American studies classes, that continues. I know that the college board has expressed some regret over its handling of this issue.
 
What is your sense of this issue and where it's headed? I mean, this is going to be injected right into the presidential campaign, it seems. It really already has. And so, we're going to have this conversation. 
 
NOSSEL: Absolutely. Look, Florida has become kind of ground zero for the disputes over freedom of speech, and in the AP curriculum case, you've got to understand the backdrop here is this Stop Woke Act that was enacted in Florida, championed by Governor DeSantis, that lays out a whole set of discussions on issues of race that are banned in the classroom in Florida. 
 
You can't talk about subjects that might make people feel guilty or that might invoke the notion that people are responsible for actions by their people -- their forbearers, by white people, you know, say, centuries ago. That those last to the present day. That these things are entrenched irrevocably in our culture. 
 
And so, outlawing those principles then raises all these questions about how you can teach a subject like AP African American history in which concepts may, you know, bump up against those strictures. And look, the college board and even many of the very credible scholars who have been associated with creating this curriculum, you know, are quite insistent that this did not guide their decision-making. 
 
But you know, the thing about censorship, it's insidious. You may not even know consciously that you are writing something a certain way or leaving something out or adding something in, you know, because of the power of that government censor. But it is unquestionably there. And in this case, they were communicating with the state of Florida. They were well aware of this law. 
 
So, it's just impossible, I think, for the public to sort of separate the outcome of this curriculum where certain concepts have been excised with this influence that Florida has tried to wield. And so, it puts this whole important field of study for high school students, you know, under a cloud now. 
 
Whether this course is credible, how could you ever get to a credible course, you know, given what the state of Florida has done. I think it's just a very vivid reminder why, you know, no matter what you think about the classroom having to come to woke, if you believe things have gone too far, the answer cannot be government legislated mandates outlawing certain kinds of speech, certain ideas, certain viewpoints. That is a very dangerous direction that we've now taken. 
 
ACOSTA: Absolutely. And I have a feeling, Suzanne, we're going to be talking about this issue again because it certainly seems to be staying out there front and center for everybody in this upcoming campaign. Suzanne Nossel, thanks so much. Great to talk to you. 
 
NOSSEL: Thank you, Jim. Good to see you. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Suzanne, with the great PEN America organization. 
 
Check this guy out. He's only been on an NBA team for a hot minute. Maybe less than that. But now he's suddenly a slam dunk champ. We can all live vicariously through him. We're live from the NBA All-Star Game next. You're live in the "CNN Newsroom."

ACOSTA: Tonight, the best of the best in the NBA are hitting the hardwood for the All-Star Game. Team Giannis versus Team Lebron. And if the game is anything like what we saw in last night's slam dunk contest, we're all going to be in for treat. CNN's Andy Scholes joins us with some of the unbelievable footage that has already come out of this All-Star Weekend in Salt Lake City. Tell us more. 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, SPORTS ANCHOR: Yeah, Jim. So, we're just hours away from the big All-Star Game here in Salt Lake City. I'm standing right now at the big bleacher report event, BR Utah. They're going to have a big concert to get the fans ready. They got all kinds of games you can play. You can even win tickets to go to the All-Star Game. 
 
So, some fans here are going to be leaving really happy. And this is going to be the first year ever at an All-Star Game they're actually going to hold the draft for the teams right before tipoff. You're going to have Lebron and Giannis picking the teams, and I'll tell you what, the pressure is on for Giannis. Since they went to this format, Lebron is a perfect 5-0 when drafting a team for the All-Star Game. And I actually asked Giannis earlier this week, what's he got to do to end that streak?

GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO, NNA PROFESSIONAL PLAYER: Got to beat LeBron to play against LeBron. But, no, I'm going to draft a -- I'm going to try to draft a really good team, people that will play hard and hopefully we can enjoy the game and take him down this time.

SCHOLZES: Yeah. And they actually get started on our sister station TNT at 6:00 eastern, so be sure to tune in. And I'll tell you what, this weekend, already got off to an amazing start. Thanks to Mac McClung. He was the first G-leaguer invited to participate in the dunk contest. He was actually a 2022 G-league Rookie of the Year. He's only (inaudible) two NBA games in his career, but he put on an all-time performance in the slam dunk contest. 
 
He had the entire Vivint Arena just going crazy. He had three perfect dunks in the competition, including a spinning dunk at the end to win it. McClung, he grew up Gate City, Virginia, a town of just 2,000 people. He's trying to latch onto an NBA team. And I actually got the chance to catch up with him and asked him, how does it feel to go from obscurity to the 2023 slam dunk champion?

MAC MCCLUNG, 2023 NBA SLAM DUNK CHAMPION: I feel a lot of gratitude. I had a lot of help and the crowd was really amazing. It was a blessing. It's really cool, man. I mean, I'll be able to tell my kids and brag about it one day. But, yeah, the goal is to play in the NBA. I'm going to keep working every day. I'm very hungry and I'm resilient. So, I'm going to keep working. 
 
SCHOLES: Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter, Mac McClurg. How does it feel to have your name amongst those greats? 
 
MCCLUNG: I don't think it's really set in yet. It's all been a blur. I feel like I was out there for 30 seconds and I'm back, but I'm grateful, man. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: McClung actually got signed by the 76ers this past week, Jim. And I know a lot of people now are going to be rooting for him, hoping he latches on. And he said, you know what? If they invite me back next year, I'd be happy to come back and defend it. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Thanks so much, Andy. Great stuff. Appreciate it.
