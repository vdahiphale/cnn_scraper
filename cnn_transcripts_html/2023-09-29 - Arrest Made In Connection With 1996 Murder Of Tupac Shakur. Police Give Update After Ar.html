BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: New today, Las Vegas police arrested a suspect in connection with the 1996 shooting death of legendary rapper Tupac Shakur. We're expecting a press conference at any moment from officials to bring us the newest developments.  CNN's Josh Campbell joins us now live. He's got breaking details on what happened. So Josh take us through it, what led to this arrest?
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Boris, so for nearly three decades there has been this looming question who murdered Tupac Shakur? The answer to that question has been the subject of endless speculation, even conspiracy theories. But we're learning that a suspect associated with that case was taken into custody today by police in Nevada. He has named Duane Keith Davis. 
 
Now he was a self-described witness to that murder. And just to kind of walk you through the timeline here, going back just two months in July, police in Nevada search the residence associated with Davis and carted out all kinds of items including computers and iPhone hard drives. There was also a memoir that he wrote about life in a street gang and describing the murder of Tupac Shakur. And so all of that evidence could possibly come into play here and actually leading to his arrest.
 
SANCHEZ: Hi, Josh, we're going to stop for one second and go straight to that press conference in Las Vegas. Let's listen in.
 
SHERIFF KEVIN MCMAHILL, LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT: 27 years, for 27 years the family of Tupac Shakur has been waiting for justice. We are here today to announce the arrest of 60-year-old Duane Keith Davis, aka Keffe D for the murder of Tupac Shakur. 
 
Davis was arrested this morning by my LVMPD Criminal Apprehension Team. And this investigation started on the ninth of September 7, 1996. It is far from over. It has taken countless hours, really decades of work by the men and women of our homicide section to get to where we are today. Several of those detectives that are standing here with us include Detective Cliff Mogg, the lead detective -- detective on this case. He is now retired. Well, I know there's been many people who did not believe that the
 
 murder of Tupac Shakur was important to this police department. I'm here to tell you, that was simply not the case. It was not the case back then. And it is not the case today. Our goal at LVMPD has always been to hold those accountable and responsible for Tupac's violent murder accountable. 
 <br>[15:35:03]
 
Just like we do for every homicide victim in our city every single victim, every life that is lost is important and remains a priority to this police department. As we methodically built this case to move forward with an arrest, it was also important that at the same time, we're building towards a successful prosecution. We work closely with our esteemed District Attorney Steve Wolfson and his office to ensure that is going to happen. 
 
Mr. Davis' own words reinvigorated our case in 2018. When he gave me some of those details, and I'm going to introduce to you our homicide Lieutenant Jason Johansson, and he will provide you many of the details on how we got here today.
 
LT. JASON JOHANSSON, LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT: Thank you, Sheriff, and thank you everybody for being here today. My name is Jason Johansson and I'm the Homicide Lieutenant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. And my goal here today is to walk you through our investigation and what led us to the indictment of Duane Davis also known as Keffe D, for the murder of Tupac Shakur. 
 
This case has been reviewed by our homicide team and homicide detectives for over two and a half decades. And ultimately, our persistence in this investigation has paid off. Let me walk you through a timeline of events that as we know them right now. Prior to September 7 of 1996, as we all know, Tupac Shakur was an artist who has signed with Death Row Records, and that Death Row Records and its CEO Marion Hugh Knight were closely affiliated with the Mob Piru Criminal Street Gangs, and that they had an ongoing feud with the South Side Compton Crips. 
 
Duane Davis was the leader and shot caller of the South Side Compton Crips.  And both of these gangs operated out of the Southern California area of Compton. On the night of September 7 of 1996, Tupac Shakur, along with Suge Knight, and members of their entourage, which include members of Mob Piru came to Vegas to attend the Mike Tyson fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. 
 
Members of the South Side Compton Crips, which included Duane Davis, along with his nephew Orlando Anderson were also in attendance at the same event. As both were leaving the fight, members of Death Row Records spotted Orlando Anderson near an elevator bay -- bank inside the MGM and at that time they began to kick and punch him near that elevator bank.  
 
I will now show you hotel security footage as many of you have already seen related to this incident. And on this incident, you will see Tupac Shakur who's wearing his shiny satiny shirt along with Marion Hugh Knight who has a large man in a brown suit, punching and kicking Orlando Anderson.  Following this incident, you'll see hotel security intervene and then they will leave the area the fight.
 
Little did anyone know that it is this incident right here that would ultimately lead to the retaliatory shooting and death of Tupac Shakur. Following this incident, Tupac and Suge Knight both left the MGM to make their way to a post-fight party, which was the occur at a local nightclub.
 
At the same time, where it had spread amongst members of the South Side Compton Crips of what had occurred inside the MGM. And then that's when Duane Davis began to devise a plan to obtain a firearm and retaliate against Suge Knight and Mr. Shakur for what occurred inside the hotel against Mr. Anderson. 
 
After Davis obtained a gun, he entered into a white Cadillac along with Terrence Brown, Deandre Smith, and Orlando Anderson. Based on our investigation, this is where we know they were seated. At some point in time, as they are in the white Cadillac, Mr. Davis took the gun that he had attained and provided it to the passengers in the rear seat of the vehicle.  As they were both, as they were driving west on Flamingo Road near Koval, they located the black BMW which was driven by Suge Knight and in the passenger seat was Tupac Shakur.
 
And as they turned around, they pulled up near the passenger side of that vehicle and immediately began shooting at Mr. Knight and Mr. Shakur. Following that shooting, the white Cadillac fled the area southbound on Koval, and is our after officers arrived on scene, Tupac was later transported to the University Medical Center, where he is treated medically, and died approximately six days later on September 13. 
 <br>[15:40:26]
 
My homicide section handled this investigation from its onset and for a short amount of time -- and within a short amount of time, what we knew is that we were working gain investigation where our victims, our witnesses and our suspects were all from Southern California and not local to Las Vegas. 
 
Within the first few months of the investigation, our detectives knew most of the information I just briefed you on. However, we never had the necessary evidence to bring this case forward and present it for criminal charges. 
 
As time went on, this case had been reviewed multiple times by different investigators assigned to my section. But it wasn't until 2018 that this case was reinvigorated as additional information came to light related to this homicide. Specifically, Duane Davis' own admissions to his involvement in this homicide investigation that he provided to numerous different media outlets. 
 
In our section, we knew at this time that this was likely our last time to take a run at this case to successfully solve this case and bring forth a criminal charge. It was at that time that this case was assigned to Cliff Mogg, our detected within my homicide section, and over the last five years, this -- my section worked closely hand in hand with the Clark County District Attorney's Office and followed a systematic investigative plan over the last five years.
 
We've conducted countless interviews and corroborated numerous facts that were not only consistent with the crime scene on the night of the incident, but also corroborated and were consistent with the sequence of events that night. This ultimately led to us procuring a search warrant, which was executed at Mr. Davis' residence in Henderson, Nevada. And following the execution of that search warrant, in close coordination District Attorney's Office, this case was presented to the grand jury, which ultimately led to Davis being indicted on charges of murder. 
 
Before I hand it off to the District Attorney's Office, I would be remiss if I didn't thank Detective Mogg and all the other detectives that were not only assigned this case and reviewed this case, but all the other detectives from other agencies that assisted us in this investigation. They know who they are. And thank you very much for all the assistance you provided. It does not go unnoticed. 
 
And lastly, one of the most important things in my opinion is the we need to make this be a reminder that the charge of murder does not have a statute of limitations. This agency has been and is invested in solving our cold case homicides, so that we can bring closure to those families and justice for those victims of homicide. And with that I will turn it over to the Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson.
 
STEVE WOLFSON, CLARK COUNTY, NV DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Thank you Lieutenant Johansson. I appreciate it. Good afternoon. I am the Las Vegas Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson. It has often been said Justice delayed is justice denied. It's a quote we hear often and for many, many years when talking about our legal system, but not in this case. Today justice will be served in the murder of Tupac Shakur. 
 
I'd like to acknowledge the relentless work of the many Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Detectives. We've mentioned Detective Cliff Mogg many times and we can't mention his name enough. He is the detective along with his colleagues that brought this case here today to you. 
 
A Clark County grand jury has indicted Duane Keith Davis, with one count of open murder with use of a deadly weapon with a gang enhancement. Davis will appear in court in the next few days or so, for a hearing to determine his custody status and to set a jury trial date. This grand jury has been receiving evidence for months and has determined there is sufficient evidence to justify the filing of this criminal indictment. I have assigned two of my top prosecutors Marc DiGiacomo and Binu Palal to prosecute this case. 
 <br>[15:45:09]
 
I know a lot of people have been watching and waiting for this day. Tupac Shakur is a music legend. And for a long time, this community and worldwide have been wanting justice for Tupac. Today, we are taking that first step. Tupac was actually quoted as saying, "Death is not the greatest loss
 
 in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive. Never surrender."
 
Well, we didn't surrender. Thanks to the great work of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department under the leadership of Sheriff Kevin McMahill, Lieutenant Johansson, retired Detective Cliff Mogg. I am proud to announce the return of this document. This is the indictment we've been waiting almost three decades for. It spells out the facts and circumstances. And what justifies a Clark County grand jury in returning an indictment. Justice will be served. Thank you.
 
MCMAHILL: Thank you, Steve. I just like to say that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Section year over year solves over 90% of the homicides that occur in our jurisdiction, you won't find that anywhere else in the United States. For those family members that have lost somebody that we haven't solved that case, I want you to know, just like in this case, we're not going to give up. 
 
I also say to you that as we began, we're going to take a couple of questions. I want you to remember in your questioning that this investigation, subsequent arrest and now indictment is only the beginning of the process. And we are committed and invested in ensuring a successful prosecution as we move forward. So with that, we'll take any questions that you might have. Ken?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you been in touch with Shakur family, anyone within here today? And if so, can you characterize what they told you?
 
WOLFSON: The family has reached out to my office. I imagine also to Metro. We've been in communication with them. We understand that they are welcoming this news. They are pleased with this news. And they are certainly aware of the return of this indictment.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We anticipate them being at court for arraignment of Mr. Davis?
 
WOLFSON: I don't think there'll be at the arraignment. I mean, that's a relatively short hearing. But I know that they'll be involved. I know that they'll want to be apprised of what goes on, on a frequent basis. 
 
MCMAHILL: Kobak (ph)?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you talk about any of the statements that you made that pique your curiosity in general got you back into this?
 
MCMAHILL: Jason, you want to answer that? We're not going to talk about any particular statements, but maybe he can address that globally.
 
JOHANSSON: What I'll say is there's lots that's going to come out when it comes time for trial. But he provides his own series of statements that are that are very consistent with the evidence that we have on the scene that we've obtained through our investigation. I'll leave it at that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you identify anything that came from the raid? I'm sorry, the service of the warrant in July, that you didn't know before?
 
JOHANSSON: Yeah, that's good question. What I'll say about the search warrant that we did in July that we obtained information or evidence during that execution, that search warrant that corroborated information obtained through our investigation, and I'll leave it at that until we go to trial. 
 
MCMAHILL: Go ahead.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello, I'm Jacqueline (ph) with Channel Three. So I know that this was obviously a big move. Is there anyone else being looked at, at this point? I know a lot of people have passed away since this incident. But Is anyone else being looked at as part of this investigation still?
 
JOHANSSON: So as I stated earlier, in this case, the only living suspect related to this investigation is Duane Davis. All other three suspects are deceased.
 
MCMAHILL: Vanessa?
 
VANESSA MURPHY, CHANNEL 8 REPORTER: Thank you. Vanessa Murphy, Channel 8. Steve, can you talk about the murder charge if he is not the one believed to have pulled the trigger?
 
WOLFSON: Yes, well, under Nevada law, and this is the law in most states in this country. You can be charged with a crime, whether you're directly involved or whether you're an aider and abettor. We have an aiding and abetting statute, which provides that if you help somebody commit a crime, you can be equally as guilty. The best example is two guys that I agree to come in a bank robbery and one of them goes into the bank with a gun and actually commits the robbery, and the other guy is the getaway driver, never went in the bank, but he assisted the guy that went in the bank. So he's equally guilty. That is one of the theories in this case as well. 
 <br>[15:50:18]
 
MCMAHILL: Last question.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you investigators believe that Davis is -- was the only person behind the plan to kill Tupac? Or was he one of multiple people who came up with this plan?
 
JOHANSSON: I think the best way to characterize that is Duane Davis was the shot caller for this group of individuals that committed this crime and he orchestrated the plan that was carried out to commit this crime.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you say how he obtained the gun or whom he obtained the gun?
 
JOHANSSON: We know that he attained it from a close associate that a lot of the actual details of who's specifically, all that come out of trial, but he attained it from a close associate of his. 
 
MCMAHILL: Thank you for coming. I appreciate it.
 
JOHANSSON: Thank you.
 
(OFF MIC)
 
SANCHEZ: A moment, almost three decades in the making, a moment that many fans never anticipated would actually come and arrest and indictment in the murder of legendary rapper Tupac Shakur, really, investigators they're going into stunning detail about how his murder was a retaliatory killing, that an investigation in which they knew soon after the murder of Tupac around September of 1996, the details of, but a case that went cold until 2018. And now one that is headed potentially for a conviction.
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: They showed this surveillance video and they said this is a moment this altercation that ultimately led to that moment on September 7, 1996 on the Las Vegas Strip, where someone pulled up multiple people in a white Cadillac, they believe, and shot into the passenger side of Tupac Shakur's vehicle, ultimately killing him, days later, he died in a hospital. But I think people are in disbelief today. Fans of his music, people who knew him, his family as well, they've carried this hurt for so long. And now knowing that police have arrested someone also they said, there were three other suspects, but all of them are deceased.
 
SANCHEZ: Yeah, and the arrests they made, you're looking at the mug shot there on your screen. Duane "Keffe D" Davis, a 60-year-old man who they describe investigators as the head of a rival gang that had issues with Tupac and his cohort. 
 
Let's discuss these latest details with CNN's Josh Campbell, and also with us, CNN Legal Analyst Joey Jackson. 
 
Josh, first you, there was a lot of detail in what we just heard from investigators, they're going over all the evidence that they collected.
 
CAMPBELL: Absolutely. And, you know, this is where the timeline of this murder comes into play here, so important. We know that after Tupac Shakur left a boxing match, it was a white Cadillac that pulled up alongside his vehicle. Shakur was in the car with Suge Knight, whenever those shots rang out. 
 
Now, interestingly enough, Duane Davis, the suspect who has now been charged here indicted in Nevada, he gave public statements. This is something that the officer alluded to there shortly saying some of his own comments are being used here now as evidence, particularly if you look back, for example, in 1998, Davis gave an interview with the BET saying he was inside that other car. He said, he was in the front seat. He claimed that the shots actually rang out from the backseat. He refused to publicly name who else might be in that car, saying that that's the code of the street that he didn't want to, you know, run a miss, I guess, a video of his cohorts there in the gang. But there was this question about, OK, so you're there. What other
 
 roles did you have? Interestingly, we also just heard as the prosecutor talked about the law here as it applies, he said, you don't have to actually be the person to pull the trigger in order to be charged with murder in the state of Nevada. So we start to see these elements start to shape up. If he was in the vehicle, as he claimed, and that actually plays into law that you don't have to pull the trigger to also be charged with murder. Police believe that he was as they described the shot caller here, the person who devised this plan to retaliate against Shakur and ultimately lead to this murder guys.
 
KEILAR: Joey Jackson, let me ask you about the charges here, indicted with one count of murder with a gang enhancement. Tell us about this?
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes, so that's a big development, Brianna, and let's talk about what we learned. Number one, you hit the nail on the head and indictment that means that a grand jury convened and heard evidence. What is the grand jury? A grand jury consists of at least 20 people in the state of Nevada, of those 2012 have to make the assessment as to whether or not there's reason to believe that a crime was committed and that this particular defendant committed it. 
 
And so the grand jury apparently, we also learned, has been hearing evidence for quite some time with regard to that grand jury and with regard to that charge. We also learned at this presser that there was means, motive, and opportunity. What were the means? A gun.
 <br>[15:55:08]
 
We've heard about the retrieving of the gun from that defendant there, Mr. Davis. We learned about the motive and that's predicated upon the surveillance that we saw in that hotel with regard to the attack of Mr. Anderson, apparently Mr. Davis' nephew and the opportunity right based on the motive of, OK, they attacked my nephew, I will now go get a gun and kill Tupac Shakur. We learned of the opportunity that, of course, Mr. Shakur after the Mike Tyson fight was traveling with some people in the car, in addition to other cars that were behind him, they spotted him and shot and fired. 
 
And so that's all predicated. And we also learned about the corroborating evidence that they have, doing countless interviews to quote them. And so they came up with the charge of murder, obviously, the gang enhancement relating to other people acting in concert. And those other people acting in concert, meaning collectively together at the direction of Mr. Davis. So the gun is in his hand. We know that Las Vegas, certainly, Nevada is a death penalty jurisdiction, not suggesting that this is such a case. But I am suggesting that we know that the penalties would be steep in terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole, particularly with that gang enhancement if the prosecutors pursue it in that.
 
SANCHEZ: And investigators at the press briefing specifically pointed out the fact that there is no statute of limitations on murder. One other thing that struck me as we were hearing from the Sheriff of Las Vegas, talking about how many people thought that the department sort of set this case aside and didn't pay as much attention to it as they should. He went on to say the goal was always to bring justice for Tupac's family.
 
KEILAR: He said as well, he thought this might be the last run that they would have it this case. And obviously it is a moment they seized, arresting Duane Keith Davis, also known as Keffe D for the murder, the 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur. Thank you so much for joining us on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER" starts after this short break.
