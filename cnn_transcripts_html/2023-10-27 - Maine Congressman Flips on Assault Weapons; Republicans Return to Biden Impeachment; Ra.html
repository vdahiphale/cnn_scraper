NATASHA ALFORD, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Background checks. So, I think that if you really dig into that bipartisan act, there may be places to move the ball a little bit forward with both parties.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.
 
ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, and President Biden called the Safer Communities Act the most significant bipartisan gun reform in decades. But I tend to think that any time these mass shootings happen, our hearts break, we have these same kind of dialogues in Washington, very little seems to change. I tend to think that state legislatures are where there's going to be more impact. There's always to be something that, you know, a caveat of why the laws wouldn't have helped in this state. So, I could see that being something that gets more momentum. Is Maine going to look at why some of these, you know, red flags weren't in place. That may be where we're more likely to see change than in Congress. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, it's an interesting point because Maine Democrats had pushed and gotten some of a pretty significant package of gun restrictions for the statehouse earlier this year, but most of it had been blocked. Obviously we all know where Maine kind of sits in that. 
 
I do want to ask about Dean Phillips because he is now in the race. Do we have some sound we want to play what Dean Phillips said on CBS? 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you running for president? 
 
REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN): I am. I have to. I think President Biden has done a spectacular job for our country, but it's not about the past. This is an election about the future. I will not sit still, I will not be quiet in the face of numbers that are so clearly saying that we're going to be facing an emergency next November. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: What's the strategy here? ALFORD: I don't -- I mean, I just feel that this is a response to what
 
 the American people are saying, right? I mean there is the Democratic sort of institutional response, which is to come around President Joe Biden. But Americans are saying every single day, we don't want this matchup. And Democrats, younger Democrats in particular, when you think about what's happening right now with Israel and Gaza, Joe Biden is losing younger and younger voters who are not happy with the way he has handled this international crisis. So, it's that with what the poll numbers that we've been seeing, I think it's only responsible. Some Democrats see that it is their responsibility to provide an alternative. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: You know what I thought was interesting? He also said that in that CBS interview that he hoped him jumping in would encourage other Democrats to do it. So perhaps this isn't about him winning but about others. 
 
GRIFFIN: That was interesting because my first thought was, this seems like a bunch of consultants who want to make money off of Dean Phillips telling him to run, but -- 
 
MATTINGLY: Have you dismissed that thought? 
 
GRIFFIN: I have not dismissed that thought, especially some of the characters involved.
 
But I think that is interesting. Seventy-three percent of Americans think Joe Biden's too old, six in ten don't want to see Trump versus Biden again. But it's too late, I would just simply say. I mean January is going to be the first caucuses. New Hampshire, if we count that, is a new -- is coming up. So, I don't see how anyone could have a formidable challenge against Biden at this juncture. Would have had to be six months ago. 
 
MATTINGLY: Missed the Nevada filing deadline already.
 
GRIFFIN: Right.
 
MATTINGLY: White, mid-western guy, who's very pro-Israel, is the alternative that they - the disaffected youth vote is definitely looking for right now.
 
GRIFFIN: That the young progressives (ph) are dying for.
 
MATTINGLY: It's an interesting dynamic. We'll definitely have to follow it. 
 
Natasha, Alyssa, thanks, guys, we appreciate it. 
 
HARLOW: So, House Speaker Mike Johnson - I can't believe we're saying House speaker. There is a speaker of the House just after three weeks entering -
 
MATTINGLY: I know. It's the little things that show progress in society.
 
HARLOW: Yes, it's the little - thank you, Phil.
 
Entering day three of his role and also key questions. How is he going to navigate his party's push to impeach President Joe Biden? CNN has learned that while the three-week-long process to find a speaker played out, Republican-led committee leading that impeachment inquiry continued to work behind the scenes. 
 
Our Annie Grayer is with us, has some really interesting new reporting on all of this. 
 
Good morning, Annie. Where do things stand now? 
 
ANNIE GRAYER, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, good morning, Poppy and Phil. 
 
The work very much continued behind the scenes. But the question is, now that there is a speaker, will there be public momentum for the effort? Now that Mike Johnson is elected, Republicans are scrambling, trying to keep the government open past that November 17th funding deadline. They lost three weeks of work over the speaker's election and they're trying to make up for lost time. And the question is, is this inquiry still going to be as front and center? 
 
Republicans, look, when they came to Congress, there were some on the far right from day one who wanted to impeach the president, didn't need to see any evidence first. Then you have some more moderate members who knew that they needed to see direct evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden in order to get onboard with the effort. And three weeks of chaos and infighting has really just made the effort of getting the moderates onboard that much more difficult. 
 
MATTINGLY: So, does Speaker Mike Johnson, member of the Judiciary Committee, I was struck when he was asked about this last night. He didn't necessarily go down the path that I thought he would. What did he say? 
 
GRAYER: Right. So, Mike Johnson is a member of the Judiciary Committee and supportive of the impeachment inquiry effort. But take a listen to what he said on Fox last night. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-MN): We're going to follow the truth where it leads. We're going to engage in due process because, again, we're the rule of law party. 
 <br>[08:35:04]
 
I know people are getting anxious and they're - they're getting restless and they just want somebody to be impeached, but that's not - we don't do that like the other team. We have to - we have to base it upon the evidence. And the evidence is coming together. We'll see where it leads. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) GRAYER: So, that's a more measured response from Speaker Johnson. And that's because he now has to represent the entire Republican conference. He can't just speak for the right-wing of the party. 
 
And what we saw in the speaker's race is there is a very strong, moderate block of Republicans, willing to stand up when they feel compelled to. And that's what happened when Jim Jordan ran for speaker and they blocked him time and time again. So now Johnson is in the speaker's chair. He got the support from moderates to get there. And now he has to navigate a very narrow majority who's just trying to get the trains back running again and the -- and will the impeachment inquiry be a big part of that? So far, unclear. 
 
HARLOW: Train's running. Government open. Critical - critical things.
 
MATTINGLY: Patrick McHenry back in Financial Services. 
 
HARLOW: There you go.
 
Annie --
 
MATTINGLY: The only place he ever wanted to be. He's happy.
 
HARLOW: Phil loves to nerd out on this stuff.
 
Annie, thank you. Great reporting. We'll see you soon. 
 
MATTINGLY: Thanks, buddy.
 
Well, breaking just moments ago, law enforcement has recovered a cellphone belonging to the Maine shooting suspect. We're following the new developments in this urgent manhunt. 
 
Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:40:17]
 
HARLOW: Just into CNN, the United Nations says eight more aid trucks are expected to enter Gaza today, but that is a fraction of what is needed. Hundreds of trucks are still waiting to enter with food, medicine, water and fuel, if it's allowed in. Those supplies could literally mean life and death for the millions of people waiting for them. U.S. officials say as many as 600 Americans are still trapped in Gaza. Among them, a Massachusetts couple, and look at them there, and their one-year-old son. 
 
Here is an update on this family we told you about earlier this week. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ABOOD OKAL: Hi, this is Abood Okal recording this voice memo from Gaza Strip, specifically Rafah City.
 
HARLOW (voice over): A Massachusetts family stuck in Gaza waiting to cross into Egypt through the Rafah crossing for the past 14 days. Abood Okal describing the dire situation in a voice memo sent to CNN by his attorney, Sami Nabulsi (ph). 
 
OKAL: The airstrikes have been intensifying. Last night we can still hear bombardment all around us. Some are through airstrikes where we could actually hear the missiles fly over the house or basically hit near us. My son was not able to sleep. We've been trying to soothe him as much as we can and keep him shielded from the wrath of the war. 
 
HARLOW: In a picture provided to CNN, Abood says a blast happened about 900 feet from where they're seeking shelter. There are about ten Americans inside the house, according to Abood. And he says supplies are running low, including basic needs for their one-year-old son. 
 
OKAL: Unfortunately, yesterday we ran out of milk for him. We opened the last box. And basically tonight we would be completely out. It would be his first night ever in his entire life to go to sleep without having milk. 
 
HARLOW: They are staying ten minutes from the border with Egypt. Abood says that he and his family have made attempts to cross into Egypt through the Rafah crossing to no avail. He says each time they've waited for hours but the gates remained closed. 
 
A State Department spokesperson told us this week that at times Hamas militants have, quote, "been preventing people from approaching the crossing." That's something Abood says he has not seen. 
 
But yesterday he says the family got a visitor. 
 
OKAL: Out of nowhere, a kitten showed up at our front door. She had a collar on and was very friendly. 
 
HARLOW: Abood says his son loves cats and named this one Milka (ph) after his favorite brand of chocolate. The kitten keeping his son happy, quote, "most of the day after the airstrikes." Also yesterday Abood says he received an email from the State Department. But there was no new information about leaving Gaza. 
 
OKAL: Time is of an essence nowadays. All it takes is one missile. One airstrike to miss its target or be too close to where you are. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARLOW: You know, Abood Okal's pleas for help to the State Department, the American government. He is one of about 600 Palestinian Americans stuck still. 
 
MATTINGLY: And the lack of information or information that ends up not bearing out to be accurate.
 
HARLOW: That's right.
 
MATTINGLY: Meet at this time. You can cross at this time. It ends up never being the case. The frustration and fear, palpable. 
 
HARLOW: Absolutely. We'll keep you posted on their story, we promise. 
 
MATTINGLY: Well, Tulane University says three students were assaulted during a rally near campus after a protester apparently tried to light an Israeli flag on fire. The details on that, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:47:53]
 
HARLOW: Welcome back. 
 
As Israel's war with Hamas intensifies, there has also been a rise of anti-Semitic - anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic acts in the United States. This is video from Tulane University in New Orleans where three students say they were assaulted during a rally near campus. The confrontation appears to have escalated after a protester tried to light an Israeli flag on fire. It is unclear at this point if anyone was arrested for the incident. 
 
Our next guest has quite a bit of perspective on this issue. That is because five years ago today he was inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh when a gunman walked in and opened fire. Eleven Jewish worshippers were killed in what remains the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. The gunman was unanimously sentenced to death for those murders by a federal jury over the summer. 
 
MATTINGLY: The Tree of Life Foundation is now raising money to preserve and renovate parts of the synagogue. There are plans for a museum, a memorial, and a center for fighting hatred and anti- Semitism. 
 
Joining us now is Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who survived the shooting and served as the rabbi encater (ph) for the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburg since the summer of 2017.
 
Sir, we appreciate your time, particularly on this day. But probably more importantly, given what's -- everything that's happened in the last 20-plus days. You've said the attack on Israel felt like a re- traumatization of sorts. How are you feeling right now? 
 
RABBI JEFFREY MYERS, SURVIVED 2018 MASS SHOOTING AT TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE: I wish I could say that you feel good about the news of the world and how everything is proceeding on a daily basis. Add to that the trauma of the horrific massacre in Lewiston and yet the unapprehended individual, it's just not easy. 
 
HARLOW: You know, the fact that it was -- that massacre, I remember that day so well five years ago now to at day. And just among the victims, a 97-year-old great-grandmother, an 87-year-old accountant, a couple who was married for 60 years. We're looking at all of their images now, by the way. 
 <br>[08:50:00]
 
Are you surprised that this country hasn't come farther on anti- Semitism since then? Do you think we have regressed as a nation? MYERS: I would not sound surprised at all. I'm disappointed in America
 
 because the founding aspects of America are one where there should be life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, indeed, is not the case for all of America's citizens at this time. So, I find myself sometimes disspirited but nonetheless awaiting when the silent majority becomes a vocal majority to rise up and say, enough already, we all need to learn how to live together in peace and work together. 
 
MATTINGLY: Rabbi, have you heard from members of your faith community about fear or anxiety, not just because of what happened on October 7th, but just in terms of the environment inside the U.S. right now? 
 
MYERS: Sadly, Phil, I have. There are congregants who are afraid to go worship. They do not feel safe in the United States. I wish I could have an easy answer for them about that. I wish I would say like some magic wand to wave and it will just go away. That's indeed just not the case. 
 
MATTINGLY: So, what do you say to them? 
 
MYERS: Well, we've continued live streaming. And I just try to remind them that for the time being, if you're not feeling comfortable, we try to talk more about it. Live streaming is an option. We try to connect them with others in the community so that they can attend synagogue worship feeling with a safe number of people to arrive. And we try to do our best to have them feel safe. It's reopened that fear that they felt after 10/27 once again. 
 
HARLOW: Rabbi, you lived through the nightmare that now so many people in - in Lewiston, Maine, have lived through. And I just wonder if you have something to say to them this morning? 
 
MYERS: I've been there. I understand it. I wish there would be something, you know, that I could instantaneously do to ease their pain and their suffering. Regrettably I can't. What I can do is send the warmest, tightest embrace possible to all the impacted families, communities in Lewiston and beyond and to let them know that we here in Pittsburgh understand. We stand with you at this difficult time, and we offer all support that we can. 
 
HARLOW: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, I think that will mean a lot to them. Thank you for being with us. 
 
MYERS: Thank you, Poppy. 
 
MATTINGLY: Well, we are just now learning authority will hold a press conference at 10:00 a.m. from Lewiston, Maine, as the manhunt continues for that shooting suspect. More in a minute. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:57:24]
 
Congressman George Santos expected in a New York court this morning for an arraignment on fraud charges. Federal prosecutors announcing 10 fresh charges against the New York Republican earlier this month after he was originally indicted in May. Santos has been out on bond since pleading not guilty to the original charges. 
 
Our Brynn Gingras outside the courthouse.
 
Brynn, good morning.
 
So, what's going to happen today? 
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Poppy. 
 
George Santos is now actually inside the courthouse for the arraignment that begins at 10:30 this morning. This is on ten additional charges to the 13 that he faced back in May. So, a total of 23 charges. 
 
In this superseding indictment, U.S. attorneys say that Santos stole the identities of campaign donors, racked up a bunch of charges on their credit cards, all while falsifying documents to meet certain benchmarks in basically the campaign finance process. And he did this, according to prosecutors, with the help of his treasurer, Nancy Marks. 
 
Now, keep in mind, these new charges come just days after Nancy Marks pled guilty to one count for her role in this fraud scheme. So, it will be interesting to see how this court process plays out for the congressman. 
 
For his part, he says he's not going to -- he's going to plead not guilty today. He told so to Manu Raju. But we are waiting to see what the judge does in terms of his bond agreement. Of course, he was out on bond on those original charges. That will be addressed again in court today during his arraignment, Poppy. 
 
MATTINGLY: You know, Brynn, you mentioned this conversation with Manu. On Capitol Hill, New York Republicans are expected to file a resolution to expel him from Congress. There was a lot of chatter last night about what it may mean, what he may do. How's he actually responding to this? 
 
GINGRAS: Yes, I mean, he's keeping his feet on the ground cemented. I mean he pled not guilty again to those original charges. He came out here and talked to the press and basically said he's not going anywhere. And he said so much to Manu and also in a tweet. Phil, let me read you what he said. He said, "I have not cleared out my office. I'm not resigning. I'm entitled to due process and not a predetermined outcome as some are seeking." 
 
Now, listen, in this indictment there's a lot of evidence that prosecutors lay out, including text messages between Nancy Marks and George Santos about this scheme. So, we'll see how he responds to this evidence. More of which is going to be turned over to Santos' defense team throughout this court process.
 
So, we'll see what he says, if he does talk to the press after this arraignment later this morning, guys.
 
HARLOW: OK, Brynn, thank you for the reporting. MATTINGLY: Special counsel Jack Smith withdrawing a subpoena seeking information from former President Trump's 2020 presidential campaign. It comes after Smith withdrew another subpoena earlier this month seeking records from the Save America Political Action Committee, which is controlled by Trump. 
 <br>[09:00:06]
 
Now, it's not clear why the subpoenas have been withdrawn, but it could mean Smith is slowing or near closing his probe into whether Trump's political operation broke any laws by promoting election lies to raise money. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you so much for spending your morning with us. Have a good weekend. We'll see you on Monday.
