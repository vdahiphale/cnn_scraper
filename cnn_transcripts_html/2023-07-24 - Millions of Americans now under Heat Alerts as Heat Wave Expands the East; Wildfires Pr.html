ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world. You're watching "CNN Newsroom" and I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead. The heat's still here and it is expanding. Dangerously hot temperatures plaguing the U.S. southwest make their way east. 
 
Walking a fine line as Donald Trump braces for a potential third indictment, his GOP rivals struggle to denounce the former president's actions. 
 
And drone strikes hit two buildings in the center of Russia's capital. Moscow is blaming Ukraine for the attack. We'll have a live report just ahead. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us and we begin in the U.S. where millions of Americans are under threat of extreme temperatures amid a heat wave that shows no signs of cooling down. 
 
Cities like Chicago and Minneapolis could see temperatures approach 100 degrees Fahrenheit by Wednesday, but other states have hit that and higher already. 
 
More than 2,300 heat alerts have been issued across America since June 10th, many breaking high temperature records. No stranger to the heat, Phoenix, Arizona has had an especially hot summer. For the past 23 days, Phoenix has recorded temperatures exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 
CNN's Camila Bernal has more now on the extreme heat. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In places where temperatures are reaching 110, 120 degrees, officials really trying to encourage people to remain indoors and to avoid the heat as much as possible. But for some who maybe work outside, it is impossible to avoid the heat. They have to be outside. And those people are being reminded to wear the appropriate clothes, to take water breaks, to be in the shade, to stop working when you feel dizzy or when you begin to feel sick. 
 
And it is very important to point out the significant impacts of these heat waves, starting with hospitals, for example, who have reported an increase in some of the patients that they're seeing, heat-related illnesses and heat stroke, for example, in some of the hospitals in the most affected areas. 
 
And then there's also the economic impact of all of this. A recent study showing that it costs the U.S. about $100 billion a year, and that's only in productivity loss alone. 
 
That's what the extreme heat is costing the U.S. and many of the industries the most impacted being agriculture and construction, but really there is no industry or business that is immune to this. 
 
Think about for example a food truck and being in a kitchen when it's extremely hot. Think about pets or animals at the zoo and the people that actually work at the zoo. But even people who are working indoors and have to go to work are seeing the impacts and the effects of these heat waves. Take a listen to this librarian and what he had to deal with. 
 
JOHN JANEZIC, LIBRARIAN, SANBORN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: I was crossing the parents and all of a sudden when I was done, I turn around, I'm sweating, I'm tired, I want to come back to the library where it's nice and air conditioned and as I'm walking back I trip. Like, what just happened? And I tripped because this part of the shoe right here was like this. It looked like this. 
 
BERNAL: And in some cases the effects of the heat wave can be dealt with easily. You can buy a new pair of shoes. But it is important to point out that there are dozens of deaths that have already been reported as a result of these heat waves. The U.S. has set more than 2,300 records because of the heat that we're seeing in different parts of the country and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any relief in sight.

CHURCH: Turning now to Canada where the search continues in Nova Scotia for at least four missing flood victims including two children. Officials say rushing waters swept all four away from their vehicles. Rescuers had to be lowered by chopper to save several other people stranded by the flooding on Saturday. Roads and homes have been damaged as well as a major rail line. It's believed to be the heaviest rainfall in the Halifax region in
 
 more than 50 years. The city's mayor called it biblical proportions of rain three months worth in just 24 hours. There's a state of emergency in effect until August 5th. 
 <br>[03:05:01]
 
Well, Greece is carrying out what it calls its largest ever evacuation effort as wildfires rage on the island of Rhodes. More than 19,000 tourists and residents have fled their homes and hotels. Some describe harrowing journeys, escaping on foot with fire directly at their backs. Greeks officials have opened shelters in northern Rhodes, and say they're setting up a dedicated help desk to get foreign nationals safely home. 
 
So let's get the latest now from Elinda Labropoulou who joins us live from the town of Mandra, just northwest of Athens. Good to see you Elinda. So what more can you tell us about Greece's unprecedented evacuations prompted by these wildfires? 
 
ELINDA LABROPOULOU, JOURNALIST: Well, the largest evacuations are in Rhodes, but Rhodes is not the only place that's actually burning right now. Unfortunately, in the last 24 hours, we've had a number of new fires breaking out, including on the island of Corfu. It's another very popular destination, and we understand that authorities there are preparing for potential evacuations as well. 
 
Some of the smaller villages have been already emptied, but for precautionary reasons. But police was just telling me now that they are preparing for possible further evacuations as well. 
 
Now on the island of Rhodes, thousands of people have left the island, thousands of tourists, some have been moved to other destinations. We have to understand that this is also the absolute peak season of the summer, which means the island is pretty packed. 
 
All the hotels were very busy and it's been an incredibly difficult operation from what authorities are telling us. Some people left on foot, they left just with their passports in their hands and they were moved to some larger cities. Some of them have by now already left the island. 
 
And some of the travel agencies and the travel lines have suspended services for now. So as you understand for the economy of the island, this is also a very serious issue. But luckily so far we've had no casualties. We have no reports of serious injuries of any kind. But this is a very ongoing situation.
 
A number of other fires have broken out in Greece just in the last 24 hours alone. This is because the country is pretty much a tinderbox right now. It's been having a prolonged heatwave, possibly the biggest heatwave in its history so far. And scorching temperatures are expected to continue throughout the week, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: All right. Elinda Labropoulou, joining us live from Athens. Many thanks. Well, this could be an historic week for former U.S. President Donald
 
 Trump, who's facing the possibility of a third criminal indictment this year, this time for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Even Trump himself believes the indictment is coming. The question is when? 
 
A third indictment could also be a game changer in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination, but some of Trump's Republican challengers are shrugging off his role in the January 6 insurrection among those questioning the case against him, his former vice president Mike Pence. 
 
You would recall of course, Pence was whisked away to safety that day as writers chanted hang Mike Pence after believing Trump's claim that Pence had the power to overturn the results but refused. Here's what Pence told CNN about it on Sunday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: While his words were reckless, based on what I know, I'm not yet convinced that they were criminal. President Trump was wrong on that day, and he's still wrong in asserting that I had the right to overturn the election. But what his intentions were, and as you know, criminal charges have everything to do with intent, what the president's state of mind was. And I don't honestly know what his intention was that day, whether as he spoke to that crowd, as he tweeted during the riot itself. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Another indictment for Trump would also add to what is already a packed political and legal schedule. As you can see here, he will be juggling both priorities in January, March and May of next year at least. 
 
Well, Donald Trump has been making threats about what could happen if his legal woes get worse. At one point, Trump reposted a video threatening revenge if he's in fact indicted by special counsel Jack Smith. And I spoke earlier with law professor and host of the "Passing Judgment" podcast, Jessica Levinson, and asked for her response to Trump's latest dog whistle to his base. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JESSICA LEVINSON, PROF. OF LAW, LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL: And we know that words matter because we all live through January 6, 2021. And we know that when the president speaks to his base, they are listening and they will mobilize and sometimes they will become violent. 
 
So if I were the president's attorney, obviously I'd be very upset. This is not good for him. The judge is, or potential future judge is watching. 
 <br>[03:10:01]
 
And when it comes to things like gag orders and exchange of discovery, you have to know what kind of litigant you're dealing with when you have somebody who is threatening revenge on the Department of Justice. 
 
Politically speaking, I think it's a very, very different story. I think this is what his base largely wants to hear, that this is a witch hunt and that they need to basically reclaim the president's good name and they need to take action to do so. 
 
CHURCH: And Jessica, former Vice President Mike Pence says he is not yet convinced that Trump's actions on January 6th were criminal. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says January 6th was not an insurrection but instead an unfortunate attack. What is your legal and political assessment of these claims from two GOP presidential hopefuls? 
 
LEVINSON: Well, I don't think they're making legal assessments so, I don't think that we really need to take that on. Those are political comments because they're both running for president and they're trying to thread a needle of getting the former president's supporters and saying that they will be, they will hold up the mantle, that they will be Trump-ism without Trump. 
 
And so they're trying to be very careful not to turn off those who support him, which potentially means saying what most of us see, which is there was in fact an insurrection in the Capitol and that there is very likely the potential of a criminal indictment when it comes to the 2020 election. And I think those are things they simply don't want to say out loud, but that's a political calculation. I don't read that as a legal assessment. \

CHURCH: Ukraine and Russia are accusing each other of carrying out new drone attacks overnight. In the annexed Crimean peninsula, Russia says Ukraine launched 17 drones targeting an ammunition depot. And in Moscow, the Defense Ministry claims it intercepted two UAVs, which crashed and hit two buildings. 
 
This video, geolocated by CNN, appears to show one of them flying above the city. Ukraine says Russia also carried out its own strikes, this time targeting ports along the Danube River. It happened a day after Moscow attacked the port city of Odessa along the Black Sea. 
 
And CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all the latest developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So what more are you learning about these drone strikes on Moscow? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Rosemary, so the Russian Ministry of Defense, as you say, now talking about two separate, what they're calling, attempts by the Kyiv regime to launch a terrorist attack, one in Moscow and of course one in Crimea, taking Moscow because this is of course hundreds of miles from the front line. The Russian capital now for the fourth time being targeted by drones, the first one was of course in early May when drones targeted the Kremlin itself. 
 
This, according to the mayor of Moscow, was two non-residential buildings, one really quite close to the center, an area adjacent to the Russian Ministry of Defense where they say debris was found. They had a road closure there which appears, according to a local traffic map, to have been lifted. 
 
And then in the south of the city, a non-residential high-rise business center was apparently hit, although Russia is saying that it averted those drones from hitting its target. But for residents of Moscow, they are now experiencing elements of this war, it seems, on a daily basis. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POLINA, MOSCOW RESIDENT (through translator): I was asleep and was woken up by an explosion. Everything started to shake. It felt like the whole building had come down. I looked out of the window. I live in the neighboring building on the side where there's less damage. And it felt strange. The damage was so minor. Well, okay, not minor. Any explosion is scary. But it sounded worse than it looked, as it seemed like the whole mall had exploded. After that, I looked online and saw the amount of damage from this side and we came and had a look from here. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: So no casualties or serious damage according to the mayor of Moscow. Now separately in Crimea, the Russian head of that region saying an ammunition depot and a house were destroyed. The Russian Ministry of Defense saying 17 drones were thwarted. But this appears to have been the third time in a week that we've seen an ammunition depot hit on the Crimean Peninsula. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH: And Clare, what is the latest on President Putin's efforts to export Russia's grain after ending Ukraine shipments and striking the war-torn nation's grain facilities overnight? 
 
SEBASTIAN: Yes, so President Putin in comments that were published in an article on the Kremlin website on Sunday clearly designed for an African audience saying that Russia will be able to replace grain supplies that should have come from Ukraine, will be able to provide them on a commercial and free of charge basis to African countries, clearly trying to keep those alliances going even though his decision to pull out of that grain deal really threatens the food supplies of these critical alliances in the developing world that Russia has been cultivating. 
 <br>[03:15:14]
 
So, in that context, we then see another wave of drone attacks overnight. Ukraine's military saying that it lasted four hours using Shahed attack drones and hitting port facilities. You can see the damage there along the Danube River. So when the Black Sea ports aren't functioning, the Danube is another alternative route. Russia apparently now hitting that. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH: All right, our thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London. 
 
And still to come Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been discharged from the hospital as the Israeli Parliament debates a contentious judicial reform bill We will head to Tel Aviv for the latest. 
 
Plus We'll take a look at why an unarmed black man was attacked by a police dog despite surrendering with his hands in the air.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now out of the hospital after undergoing surgery for a pacemaker implant. 
 <br>[03:20:05]
 
He was hospitalized over the weekend for what doctors say was a transient heart block. It comes as Israeli lawmakers are debating a bill that would curb some powers of the country's Supreme Court, and a vote is expected in the coming hours. Mr. Netanyahu earlier said he would attend the vote. 
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
Meantime, thousands of demonstrators continue to protest across Israel. Many also converged on Jerusalem and police are using water cannon to try and disperse them. 
 
Well, for more, let's go to journalist Elliot Gotkine. He joins us live from Tel Aviv. Good to see you, Elliot. So Israeli lawmakers set to vote today on this first part of the judicial overhaul bill. What is expected to be the outcome of this? 
 
ELLIOT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Well, Rosemary, just to remind viewers that this part of the judicial overhaul is to do with reasonableness. The government is trying to pass a law that would prevent the Supreme Court from blocking government decisions on the ground of whether it deems them reasonable or unreasonable. So that's what they're voting on. These votes are due later today. And if these votes go ahead, then the government, the governing coalition, with 64 out of 120 seats in the Knesset, is going to get this bill passed. 
 
It seems incredibly unlikely, even if there are one or two dissenters, that it would not be able to do so. The question is, will this vote actually take place? Because there is a huge amount of pressure going on right now to try to reach some kind of compromise, not just from the protesters that you see out on the streets, not just from tech workers and some business groups, which are striking today again to put more pressure on the government, not just from reservists, who are some of whom are refusing to serve if this bill gets passed. 
 
But you've even got pressure from no less than President Joe Biden, who for the second time in a week has said in a statement that he shared with CNN that a compromise needs to be reached. He said, given the range of threats and challenges confronting Israel right now, it doesn't make sense for Israeli leaders to rush this, adding that the focus should be on putting people together and finding consensus. 
 
And actually, President Isaac Herzog, fresh from a visit to Joe Biden in the United States, went straight from the airport, from his plane, to meet with Netanyahu when he was still in hospital last night. He then met with leaders of the opposition as well as they tried to reach some kind of compromise over this judicial overhaul. 
 
According to reports, it seems to be that one of the sticking points is how far down the road each side is prepared to kick the can of the rest of these judicial overhaul measures. For now, there is no agreement. And of course, the other interesting question is, Rosemary, what happens if this bill is passed? Because usually the president would have to sign it into law. In theory, he could refuse, but that would be unprecedented. 
 
And the Israeli Bar Association has already said that if this bill is passed, that it will file a petition to the Supreme Court to block it from coming into effect. So effectively, the Supreme Court would be asked to perhaps block a bill that is designed to prevent the Supreme Court from blocking bills. 
 
It's all very complicated, and we'll have to see how this vote plays out later today, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: Yeah. Most definitely. Elliot Gotkine, joining us live from Tel Aviv. Many thanks. 
 
Yuval Noah Harari is a lecturer in world history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He joins me live from Tel Aviv in Israel. Appreciate you joining us. 
 
YUVAL NOAH HARARI, LECTURER IN WORLD HISTORY, HEBREW UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM: Hello, thank you for having me. 
 
CHURCH: So in what's proving to be an unusual moment in Israel's history, thousands continue to protest against the judicial overhaul plan, even camping on the streets to make their point as lawmakers debate the bill ahead of a vote today. How do you expect this vote to play out and do you see the Supreme Court itself having a role in this? 
 
HARARI: Well actually I think the situation is very, very simple. We just need to understand one thing about what's happening in Israel. The question is what limits the power of the government? Democracy is based on checks and balances. But in Israel there is just a single check on the power of the government, and that is the Supreme Court. 
 
If the government, for instance, wants to take away voting rights from Arab citizens, which is something the coalition members are talking about, the only thing that can stop it is the Supreme Court. So this is not just a judicial overhaul. This is an attempt by the Israeli government to gain unlimited power, and they are saying so openly. 
 
You know, you listen to the Netanyahu supporters, and they basically say, hey, we won the elections. That means we can do anything we want. Any restriction on our power is undemocratic. They don't understand the meaning of democracy. 
 
And they are trying to now to grab unlimited power. And this is why you see something which was really unimaginable in Israel. You have chief, former chiefs of the Israeli army and security forces telling soldiers don't serve. [03:25:11]
 
You have Air Force pilots saying our contract is with Israeli democracy. Once this law passes, our contract is over, we are not flying. By tomorrow morning, the Israeli air force, the famed Israeli air force, might be partially grounded. This is unprecedented. 
 
CHURCH: So given that, how much do you worry that this controversial legislation, if approved, and it sounds like that will be the case, it will be voted on, will threaten and weaken Israel's democracy? 
 
HARARI: It will tear apart the social contract of Israel. Even if we somehow manage to get over it, it will take years for the wounds to heal. And I don't see anybody in the government interested in healing. 
 
They're just, they're really trying to break up Israeli society. This is Netanyahu's life mission, apparently, to split the Israeli nation, and he's very close to succeeding in his life mission. 
 
CHURCH: And the Israeli Bar Association is preparing a legal challenge to this first bill. How likely is it that challenge could succeed, do you think? 
 
HARARI: I don't know. I'm not a legal expert. I can't get into the heads of the Supreme Court justices and what they will decide. But it should be clear that the implications will reverberate far beyond the borders of Israel. Israel is holding on occupation, 2.5 million Palestinians. The coalition members are openly saying, and this is not a secret, they intend to annex the occupied Palestinian territories without giving citizenship to the Palestinians. The reason they go after the Supreme Court is because they know it will block it. 
 
But once the Supreme Court is out of the way, we are very likely to see an escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This government is led by zealots who believe in an ideology of Jewish supremacy. You know, and Netanyahu has been warning the world for years about the dangers of a fundamentalist regime with nuclear weapons. 
 
He meant Iran, of course, but he is now establishing a fundamentalist regime with nuclear weapons here in Israel. And this will have consequences far beyond what happens to Israeli citizens under this kind of authoritarian rule. 
 
CHURCH: There's a lot of opposition against this bill. We will watch to see what happens. Yuval Noah Harari, thank you so much for your analysis. I Appreciate it. 
 
HARARI: Thank you very much. 
 
CHURCH: Still to come, a battle between the U.S. Justice Department and Texas over the state's use of floating border barriers. We'll look at where things stand right now.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back everyone. More on our top story this hour. The unrelenting heat wave sweeping across the United States. Scorching temperatures could continue to break records in states like Arizona and Texas. As you can see here, several states across the U.S. Southwest are registering well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Meteorologists say the extreme weather could last into August. 
 
Authorities in Mexico say five migrants from Colombia and Peru have been rescued from a mountain pass near the U.S. border after they were abandoned by their guide. Mexico's National Institute of Migration says a 15-hour operation was launched last week after one of the migrants phoned authorities for help saying they had no food or water. One minor was among the group. They were taken to a shelter in Tijuana after their rescue. 
 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott says his state has the sovereign authority to defend its border as it faces a Monday deadline to commit to removing floating barriers on the Rio Grande. That deadline was set by the U.S. Justice Department, which has warned that the state could face legal action. 
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has details from the White House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: The Justice Department has given Texas Governor Greg Abbott until Monday afternoon to tell the administration whether he is going to remove the floating barriers along the Rio Grande. It's the latest escalation in the feud between President Joe Biden and Texas Governor Greg Abbott over the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
 
In a letter on Thursday, the Justice Department said that Texas did not have authorization to set up the floating barriers this month, citing a clause in the law to that effect. They also went on to say, quote, "The State of Texas actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government's ability to carry out its official duties." 
 
Now, officials have been talking for months within the administration as to what actions, if any, could be taken by the Justice Department as they watched with concern the actions the Texas governor was taking along the Texas-Mexico border. 
 
Those floating barriers have, for example, posed a potential drowning risk to migrants who are crossing. Now, the Texas governor in a tweet said that it is the sovereign authority to defend our border. So he is standing firm on his position to keep those barriers. 
 
But again, he can reply by Monday afternoon as to whether or not he will take them down. If not, the Justice Department says in their letter they're ready to take the Texas governor to court. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, The White House.

CHURCH: New York police are searching the home of a man suspected of at least three of the state's Gilgo Beach murders. A law enforcement source tells CNN they have searched Rex Heuermann's basement, but could take two or three more days to search his attic and garage. CNN affiliate News 12 Long Island reports a K-9 team and ground- penetrating radar were seen being used in the investigation. A source tells CNN it's possible police will search the backyard to see if something was buried there. 
 
An unarmed black man was attacked by a police officer's canine in Ohio as he surrendered to authorities with his hands up. This despite a state trooper repeatedly urging officers not to release the dog. 
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval takes us through what happened in the July 4th incident. 
 <br>[03:35:03]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The footage provided by Ohio State Highway Patrol is disturbing, but now under scrutiny after a man was mauled by a police officer's canine. 
 
July 4th, Jackson County, Ohio. A case report shows a highway patrol officer in a marked vehicle tried to stop the driver of this big rig for a missing mudflap. The man behind the wheel, later identified by authorities as 23 year old Judarius Rose, drives on and a chase begins about 20 minutes into the pursuit. The big rig is seen rolling to a stop, but that lasts only a few seconds. The driver continues to flee and officers stay on him for another eight minutes. 
 
UNKNOWN: He took off again. We're heading northbound. 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): It wasn't until police used tire deflation devices -- 
 
UNKNOWN: We're stopped. 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): -- that the chase came to a slow but dramatic and disturbing stop. That's a Circleville, Ohio Police Department K-9 unit rolling up to the scene. After repeated orders from state troopers, the driver eventually steps out of the rig, his hands in the air as requested. 
 
A patrolman is heard asking the K-9 to not be released. Though it's unclear if he could be heard by all officers on scene, that's when the K-9 is deployed. 
 
UNKNOWN: They're not releasing the dog with his hands out. Do not release the dog with his hands up. Do not release the dog with his hand up, don't. UNKNOWN: Keep the dog off (inaudible).
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): After the K-9 takedown, an officer approaches then quickly walks away, her hands covering her face as Rose screams in pain. The frustration audible in the voice of another state officer. 
 
UNKNOWN: Was I not loud enough? 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): After the dog is removed, officers move in to arrest Rose and administer first aid. 
 
JUDARIUS ROSE, UNARMED BLACK MAN: You just let a dog bite me. 
 
UNKNOWN: Oh yeah, dudes come to me. 
 
ROSE: I was coming, all the guns pointing at me. How you do you expect me to respect you? You got a gun pointing at me. It's like 20 of y'all. 
 
UNKNOWN: Oh yeah, dudes stop brother. 
 
ROSE: I did stop. 
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over): A spokesperson for the Ohio State Highway Patrol tells CNN, as troopers were attempting to gain compliance by providing verbal commands to the suspect, the Circleville Police Department deployed their canine, which resulted in the suspect being bitten. 
 
CNN has reached out to the Circleville Police Department for comment. Police say Rose was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and released before being taken to jail. His attorney declined to comment. 
 
(on-camera): Per that case report that was filed, Rose reportedly spoke to troopers while he was at the hospital being treated for his injuries, maintained that he had no idea why they were attempting to pull him over, that he was simply trying to haul a delivery to Grove City, Ohio, before making his way home. Meanwhile, the head of the Columbus, Ohio chapter of the NAACP is saying that she is appalled by what she saw in this video and is calling for an investigation into the actions of that K-9 unit.

CHURCH: The gun violence epidemic here in the United States has reached a grim new milestone with more than 400 mass shootings so far this year. That's according to the non-profit group Gun Violence Archive. 
 
For context, the U.S. had 647 mass shootings in all of 2022. CNN and the Archive define a mass shooting as one that injures or kills four or more people, not including the shooter. This weekend, we have seen several smaller scale shootings around the
 
 country. One at a hospital in Oregon, one at a bar in Florida, four incidents in New York City, and a series of shootings in the city of Chicago, which killed at least six people. 
 
A senior general and the U.N. command says conversations are now underway with North Korea's military about the U.S. Army private who suddenly ran into North Korea last week. There are still no details about Travis King's whereabouts or condition nearly a week after he bolted across the border from the truce village at the DMZ. 
 
King had been facing transfer back to the U.S. after being convicted of assault in South Korea. But military officials say it's not clear why he willfully crossed into the North without any authorization to do so. 
 
Travis King is far from the only American held by North Korea over the years. Experts are looking at how Pyongyang treated earlier American prisoners to try to figure out how they might be handling King. 
 
CNN's Brian Todd has that part of the story from Washington. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Army Private Travis King joins a sobering list of Americans who've been held by the oppressive Kim regime in North Korea. One of the best known among them, college student Otto Warmbier, arrested in 2016 while on a tour of North Korea for trying to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel in Pyongyang. 
 
GREG SCARLATOIU, COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH KOREA: He was arrested and imprisoned for something that, if true, would barely amount to a college frat prank anywhere in the half-decent world. 
 <br>[03:40:02]
 
TODD (voice-over): Warmbier was sentenced to hard labor, shortly after his sentencing, he went into a coma. He was hurriedly released by the North Koreans after 17 months in captivity, and died at age 22 just a few days after being returned home to Ohio. 
 
One of the Americans held longest inside the Hermit Kingdom, Missionary Kenneth Bae, detained for just over two years. He told CNN after he was released about his years of hard labor in a camp. 
 
KENNETH BAE, FORMER DETAINEE IN NORTH KOREA: Working in the field, doing farming labor, carrying a rock and shoveling coal. 
 
TODD (voice-over): American journalists Yuna Lee and Laura Ling were arrested in North Korea in 2009. It took a high profile mission by former president Bill Clinton to North Korea to get them out. 
 
LAURA LING, FORMER DETAINEE IN NORTH KOREA: We fear that at any moment we could be sent to a hard labor camp. TODD (voice-over): Analysts say if these cases are any guide, Travis
 
 King could be interrogated, possibly tortured, placed in hard labor or -- 
 
AMB. JOSEPH DETRANI, FORMER U.S. ENVOY FOR NORTH KOREA: I think they're going to look at the credibility of the individual. Can they use them as a propaganda tool? 
 
TODD (voice-over): It's happened before. American soldier James Dresnok defected to North Korea in 1962. Dresnok and his sons, now adults who still have never left North Korea, acted in North Korean propaganda movies playing the evil American. 
 
SCARLATOIU: Do I see Travis King as a new James Dresnok? Not really. Why? These are different types. This is a young man who's used to being on his phone, being on his internet, probably playing video games. 
 
TODD (on-camera): Human rights monitor Greg Scarlatoiu advises Travis King's family to use the same tactics that the families of Otto Warmbier, Kenneth Bae, and other Americans who were detained in North Korea used. To keep their story in the media. Don't let the public forget about him. Scarlatoiu says it's possible that another high- level American could be sent to North Korea to get Travis King out, but he says that all depends on whether King actually wants to leave.

CHURCH: Spain is almost done counting votes from its snap election, but who will lead the country is still very unclear. A look at where things could go next, ahead on "CNN Newsroom."

CHURCH: With more than 99 percent of the vote counted, there's no clear winner in Spain's snap elections. The center-right People's Party is set to come in first, winning 136 seats in parliament. But in order to govern, a party or coalition must have a working majority of 176 seats in the 350-seat legislature. And because no single party won enough seats to form a government on their own, the tough task of trying to build a coalition must begin. 
 
Journalist Al Goodman joins me now from Madrid. Good to see you Al. So no clear winner in Spain's snap election. What happens now? 
 
AL GOODMAN, JOURNALIST: Hi, Rosemary. Well, this is the parliament building here behind me where those 350 seats are, those prize seats. There may be a period, the horse trading is expected to start now, this day, the day after the elections, which had some surprises, but it did keep, according to the left, it kept the far right Vox party out of a potential conservative government. That's where it stands right now. 
 
But then there will be a pause and the political parties will reconvene as parliament sort of opens again in mid-August. And then, there are consultations between the party leaders and the king of Spain, the head of state, who will then suggest a leader to stand for investiture and to vote. This is a process that happens all the time. 
 
The current socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, who did better than expected in the elections and currently has a coalition government, his socialist party, a grouping of other leftist parties nationally, and some nationalist parties from Catalonia that's around Barcelona and the northern Basque region, and City of San Sebastian is one of those. They've been giving him support. 
 
But I just talked to a senior leader of the Socialist Party who said that a chance for Sanchez to repeat is not impossible, but it's going to be tough this time because these nationalist parties are going to demand a higher price. In fact, we heard one of the nationalist party leaders in Catalonia last night saying that our importance is Catalonia. We don't care about the government of Spain. 
 
So a lot is going on there. Now the leader of the main Conservative Party announced to his followers he's going to start to make consultations and see if he can try to form a government. But most political analysts say his natural partner is this far-right party, and he doesn't really have a lot of other close friends in parliament, in other parties, that would come to his aid. 
 
So, right now, the numbers look like the socialist prime minister might be able to do something. The conservative leader who actually got the most votes, but far from a majority, has an even tougher time. Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: All right, we'll watch to see what happens there. Al Goodman, joining us live from Madrid.

CHURCH: A scare on the pitch Sunday night as an ESPN soccer analyst suddenly collapsed while on the air. Shaka Hislop staggered and then fell as he and Dan Thomas were giving commentary before an AC Milan- Real Madrid friendly. Thankfully we are told Hislop is now okay and conscious but still no word on what caused him to collapse. 
 
Another day of Women's World Cup action is now underway with Italy and Argentina facing off in New Zealand in the first match of the day. Italy has just scored a goal in the final minutes. In less than an hour, Germany and Morocco will battle it out on the field in Australia. And later in the day, Brazil will take on Panama. Well, today's matchups follow a dramatic day of play in the tournament
 
 on Sunday. CNN's Don Riddell brings us all the highlights. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Just eight teams now of the 32 competing at the Women's World Cup are still waiting to play their opening matches. And so far the games that we've seen have been pretty close. Is that a sign that there's now more parity in a game that has been rapidly expanding across the globe? Or perhaps nerves have been playing a factor in the early action? 
 
On Sunday in Wellington, South Africa were going for their first ever World Cup result and they came pretty close against Sweden, who are the world's third-ranked team. Hildah Magaia opened the scoring for South Africa early in the second half, but Sweden responded by pouring more players into their attack and they were rewarded when Frida Rolfo's effort was deflected in for an own goal.
 
South Africa had lost all three of their previous World Cup matches. They would have settled for a point here but it wasn't to be as Amanda Illestedt scored a last minute winner. The Swedes just edged it, going top in Group G. 
 
In Group B, the 2017 European Champions, the Netherlands shaded the World Cup debutants Portugal by a goal to nil. Stefanie van der Gragt's first half header turned out to be the winner. Portugal only had one shot on goal throughout the entire match. The Dutch will play the USA, the defending champions next. That is a repeat of the 2019 final. 
 
Also on Sunday, a massive result for the reggae girls of Jamaica who went toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world, the fifth- ranked France. Jamaica's players really struggled to get into this tournament. They had to start a GoFundMe page in order to make all the ends meet and make the trip to Australia and New Zealand and they repaid everyone who believed in them with their first ever World Cup point. 
 
The French team have made it to the quarter finals in each of the last three World Cups but they are expected to go deeper this time but this really was a frustrating experience for them. Kadidiatou Diani peppered the goal with a couple of headers and she also hit the frame of the goal laid on but they couldn't break down the Jamaica team who celebrated wildly at the final whistle celebrating a monumental performance and a massive result. Their manager put into perspective just how significant an achievement this was. 
 <br>[03:55:14]
 
LORNE DONALDSON, JAMAICA COACH: I would say it's the number one result we have had so far because, I mean, you know, you're playing a team like France who is just fantastic. And you know, to answer it, I think it's the number one result I have seen. Men are women, so I would put it there. RIDDELL: We'll of course keep you posted with all the latest
 
 highlights and results from the Women's World Cup, but for now, it's back to you.

CHURCH: And thanks for that. Well, Formula One racing champion Max Verstappen made his rivals look like a field of Formula Two cars racing against a Formula One car. That is according to Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. His statement comes after Verstappen scored his seventh win in a row at the Hungarian Grand Prix. His latest win as teammate Sergio Perez recovered from ninth to third, landed Red Bull a 12th consecutive victory. 
 
At baseball's Hall of Fame, in Cooperstown, New York. Two veteran players who led their teams to World Championships have received the sport's highest honor membership. Seven-time All-Star and eight-time Gold Glove winner Scott Rolland was a key player in the 2006 and Lewis Cardinals World Series Championship and five-time All-Star and member of the Atlanta Braves 1990s dynasty, Fred McGriff was unanimously voted into the hall of Fame. He said he was humbled to be on the stage with more than 50 other Hall of Famers. On this stage, he said, is baseball greatness. There it is. 
 
Thanks for your company. I'm Rosemary Church. Have yourselves a wonderful day. "CNN Newsroom" continues with Christina MacFarlane in London next.
