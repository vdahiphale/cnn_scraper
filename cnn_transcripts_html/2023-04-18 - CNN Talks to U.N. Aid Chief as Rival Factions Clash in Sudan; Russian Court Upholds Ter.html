(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNNI HOST: Gunfire explosions and overhead fighter jets heard across Sudan's capital Khartoum and nearby cities. This despite 
 
 conflicting reports of an agreed ceasefire. This hour I will speak to the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator about ending the conflict.
 
But first, a Moscow court has upheld the detention of an American journalist accused of spying on Russia. Evan Gershkovich's lawyer plans to 
 
 appeal the decision. The FBI has arrested two men in New York accused of operating an undeclared police station on behalf of the Chinese government. 
 
 Prosecutors say the station in Chinatown was used to monitor and intimidate Chinese dissidents in the U.S.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited the frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the town of -- surrounded by Russian forces on three 
 
 sides. This comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare visit to Russian occupied Southern Ukraine. The Kremlin says he also met 
 
 with Russian troops at a military base in Kherson.
 
Right now we're watching developments in Sudan where a 24-hour ceasefire is scheduled to begin in less than one hour but there is a lot of uncertainty. 
 
 Earlier today rival generals from Sudan's armed forces and paramilitary forces said they agreed to the truce. A short time later Sudan's military 
 
 disputed that on its Facebook page vowing to defeat the paramilitary force.
 
We are monitoring all of this closely for you as the start time of that proposed truce approaches. But for the moment there is no letting up in the 
 
 fighting and innocent lives are being lost and official with "Doctors without Borders" says most of the wounded are civilians who've been caught 
 
 in the crossfire take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE (voice over): Fighting rages on in Sudan's Capital Khartoum, key targets are the airport and the presidential palace state TV broadcaster. 
 
 And it's not limited to the capital fighting also spreading in other parts of the country. Water and electricity cut off hospitals coming under fire. 
 
 At least 180 people killed since fighting started on Saturday, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, diplomats also in the line of fire,
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I can confirm that yesterday we had an American diplomatic convoy that was fired on all of our people are 
 
 safe and unharmed. But this action was reckless. It was irresponsible and of course unsafe.
 
MACFARLANE (voice over): And the EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Burrell, confirming a European Union Ambassador was assaulted in their residency in 
 
 Sudan, a worsening situation as the international community scrambles to find a solution.
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: I strongly condemn the outbreak of fighting that is taking place in Sudan, and the appeal to the 
 
 leaders of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to immediately cease hostilities restore calm and begin a dialogue to resolve 
 
 the crisis.
 
MACFARLANE (voice over): The latest fighting making an already dire situation in Sudan, much worse. Three World Food Program employees have 
 
 been killed in the fighting, forcing the United Nations to temporarily shut down many of its more than 250 programs across Sudan, leaving an estimated 
 
 16 million people without much needed aid, a reminder of the true human toll of armed conflict.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE: Well, Martin Griffiths is the UN's Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs. He's also the Emergency Relief Coordinator at the UN 
 
 and he joins me now live from Geneva in Switzerland. Mr. Griffiths thank you so much for your time!
 
We know the script has already that the humanitarian situation in Sudan was dire, some 16 million people in need of aid. And now, we have heard that 
 
 the UN have been forced to shut down some 250 programs aid programs in the country due to the targeting of aid workers and officials. What impact will 
 
 shutting down of these programs have on the people of Sudan right now?
 
MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS: Well, I think it's a really good question and we don't know an exact answer 
 
 to it yet. But what we need to find out as soon as movement is possible and you refer to the piece to the possibility of a 24 hour ceasefire. If that 
 
 happens if it's dependable and if it's announced and if it's accountable then we could move.
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
And we can check, then the agencies can check how many of the supplies from these warehouses have been looted what's remaining? And how can we get out 
 
 resuming programs for those 16 million people?
 
But right now, the imperative is, in fact, to have these temporary ceasefires, pauses, humanitarian pauses, if you like, to allow people to 
 
 move, to send relatives to hospital to restock food, it's the holy month of Ramadan, it's about 40 degrees, people fast during the day, being able to 
 
 move safely is, for the moment, the highest humanitarian priority, this will then allow us to move into response to the bigger picture.
 
MACFARLANE: And let's talk a bit more about that ceasefire, which we are expecting in around an hour from now. How involved has the UN been in those 
 
 negotiations about a ceasefire? You know, because we've been hearing, as we've been saying, conflicting reports on both sides about the willingness 
 
 to go ahead with this. So what is the UN's position been in this? And how hopeful are you that this is going to happen and hold?
 
GRIFFITHS: Well, the UN Envoy, Volker Petraeus, who was in Khartoum, and has been there, of course, for a very long time, has been hitting the 
 
 phones ever since this started on Saturday, to urge the two warring parties, if I could put it that way to do this, to agree to those 
 
 humanitarian cease fires for time limited period every day.
 
So the UN has been asked about this, are you referred to a variety of diplomatic efforts in the same way, what from a humanitarian perspective, 
 
 we know this from experience around the world, what is important is that any commitment made by the Sudanese Armed Forces, or the RSF, should be 
 
 accompanied by charity about what is going to happen or not happen in what places for what period of time?
 
Otherwise, people will come out of their homes, try to make it to hospitals, and be caught in a crossfire again, and that's what's happened 
 
 in the last couple of days, we must hope that there is much clearer accountability and publication of the promises made by those two generals. 
 
 That's what's crucial for -- ceasefire anywhere, including in Sudan.
 
MACFARLANE: But that surely is dependent on international pressure in order to force them into a position where they see themselves as being 
 
 accountable to the population at this point in time. That doesn't seem to be the case. And we have been hearing a lot of condemnation from the 
 
 international community.
 
But this situation, we've been warned for some time by the Sudanese people, you know, was in the works for months, if not years that the violence 
 
 between these two generals would erupt. So given what you're saying about humanitarian aid and access to that being vital, you know, that the 
 
 ceasefire being vital to that? What diplomacy at the moment at this stage, do you think could make a difference could allow for that humanitarian aid 
 
 that ceasefire to go ahead?
 
GRIFFITHS: I would argue very strongly. And I know this is exactly what the UN Envoy is pressing for, for the diplomacy that is happening to be 
 
 coordinated, so that all diplomatic efforts, whether from the United States, the United Arab Emirates, from Egypt, from other countries, the 
 
 European Union, is aligned along a single proposal to the two parties.
 
That it should be a 24-hour ceasefire as a beginning, for example, that it should operate in certain ways that there should be a hotline and so forth. 
 
 So that there is clarity from the international community and consensus among those interests, which can be brought to bear on the two militaries, 
 
 to encourage them in this direction.
 
That's very, very important. There is a lot of diplomatic activity. There is the African Union, the United Nations, as you know, together very much 
 
 involved in the transition of the peace process, now focused on this. It's a lot of activity, but connecting to produce the kind of assurances that 
 
 civilians will need to venture out of their houses that's something different.
 
MACFARLANE: Mr. Griffiths I want to ask you about the situation for the UN personnel working within Sudan because we have been hearing that gunmen in 
 
 Khartoum have stormed the houses of people of your organization and other aid organizations. Do you have any indication yet as to which military 
 
 organization is responsible, be it the RSF or the Sudanese Army for essentially openly attacking some of your UN personnel?
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
GRIFFITHS: Well, you know, Christina, better than me probably there are a lot of allegations as to who has perpetrated these crimes against our staff 
 
 just as against, you know, people in Sudan in Khartoum and elsewhere.
 
We have, like others suffered those attacks. The World Food Program, as you said, suffered three deaths. There has been looting of our premises, there 
 
 has been occupation of hospitals, there has been occupation of homes, UN has 4000 staff and dependents in Sudan. So we are among those who may be 
 
 targeted.
 
We are very, very vigilant about this. We will of course, be making inquiries as to who has perpetrated these crimes in due course, to hold 
 
 them to account. But meanwhile, those pauses, those ceasefires are the condition precedent to get us back on the road.
 
And I want to stress because that's only a condition precedent, the real challenge is going to be getting that massive humanitarian aid program back 
 
 into shape, and producing aid to those up to 60 million people across the country.
 
Stocks are down, hospitals are looted, we'll need to find out what's left? Where we can resupply from? Where we can find people who can move 
 
 humanitarian workers who can move safely? And then move back to doing what aid agencies do all over the world is providing aid for those in the direst 
 
 need. That's the big story here.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, that is undoubtedly the bigger picture. The smaller picture is, and we hope that this ceasefire will hold. The final question, 
 
 though, if the ceasefire does not come into effect, what recourse does the UN or any other aid humanitarian aid organizations have to help the people 
 
 of Sudan?
 
GRIFFITHS: Well, you know, we cite international humanitarian law, which has its obligations, as you know, in war. We look to diplomacy to help us 
 
 those who leverage on those who have the power to stop war or to start it. And this is familiar everywhere across the world.
 
Sudan is no different in that respect. What's very, very clear in the last few days of this particular crisis of Sudan is the very high level and 
 
 thanks to CNN and others to have international interest in getting this back to where it was before Saturday.
 
That's the most likely assurance we will have to be able to do our job. International attention, international focus, and frankly, and we've seen 
 
 this in the last three or four years in Sudan, the courage of those doctors associations of civil society, of those protesters who have insisted on a 
 
 civilian transition, the courage of the Sudanese is going to be the bridge that we need to see to get us back to where we were before.
 
MACFARLANE: Well, that is an important note to end on. And Martin Griffiths, we really appreciate you giving us your time at this point, and 
 
 we hope we will speak again in the days to come as things hopefully progress. Thank you.
 
GRIFFITHS: Thank you.
 
MACFARLANE: Well, as you know Egypt shares a border with Sudan and Cairo is calling for an end to the fighting that has engulfed Sudan for days. For 
 
 the news and analysis on what's been called a vicious power struggle and the latest on the efforts to stop the bloodshed, head to 
 
 cnn.com/mideastnewsletter, or get out of your smartphone and scan the code at the bottom of your screen now.
 
Now let's connect you to two major developments from Russia over the past few hours. The U.S. Ambassador to Russia is calling for the immediate 
 
 release of a Wall Street Journal Reporter who's just been denied an appeal against the terms of his detention.
 
Evan Gershkovich is the first American journalist to be detained in Russia over espionage allegations since the Cold War. That hearing took place in 
 
 Russia state media report -- as Russia media state reported that Russia, Vladimir Putin has made a rare visit to parts of Ukraine's occupied by 
 
 Moscow.
 
A video released by the Kremlin appears to show the Russian President meeting military commanders in the Kherson region. The Kremlin says the 
 
 visit happened on Monday so a lot to discuss here. Let's bring in Matthew Chance who's here in London.
 
And Matthew to this court hearing first, I guess this was the first sort of glimpse we've had of Evan Gershkovich in many weeks. How did he seem to be 
 
 and what are going to be the next steps here in this espionage charge against him?
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it is Christine you're right the first time we've caught a proper glimpse of him 
 
 since he was detained back in late March or there have been some images of him being sneaked in and out of the courtroom in various instances.
 
But you could see you know, here up close he was looking pretty relaxed and his arms folded standing in that sort of glass courtroom cage that exists 
 
 in so many Russian courtrooms.
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
Ahead of the court deciding on whether to uphold the appeal or reject it, the appeal was about whether he should be kept in detention in prison is in 
 
 a pretty notorious facility inside Moscow called Lefortovo jail.
 
And what his lawyers were asking for is that either he'd be allowed to be transferred under house arrest, or that they set a bail of 50 million 
 
 rubles, which is just over $600,000, at current exchange rates, for him to be sort of set free.
 
And the judge sort of rejected that out of hand, which was kind of expected because he faces the very serious charge of espionage, it wouldn't be 
 
 usual, in cases like this for bail to be settled for house arrest to be to be granted.
 
And Evan Gershkovich now faces many months, I suspect of incredible hardship ahead of him, as his case is, you know, basically heard in the 
 
 Russia -- in the Russian courts. Again, it carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and the Russian authorities have made it clear that 
 
 they won't even consider swapping, Evan Gershkovich for with the United States for a prisoner perhaps that they have until after that trial process 
 
 is over.
 
So he's going to be there for a long time. We've got a sound bite I think from one of his lawyers who spoke shortly after the court gave its decision 
 
 about how Evan Gershkovich is doing behind bars, take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TATYANA NOZKHKINA, EVAN GERSHKOVICH'S LAWYER: Here will be a lot of books, and then maybe he told us that maybe he'll make some good novel about 
 
 himself. It's a normal condition. It's he -- I think it's not a very nice place in general, but condition -- it's normal. He doesn't complain anyway.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHANCE: Well, not complaining there according to his lawyers. The U.S. Ambassador there, who was also at the court and spoke afterwards was a bit 
 
 more critical than saying that she found it troubling to see an innocent journalist like Evan Gershkovich in that kind of situation. She called on 
 
 Russia to release him immediately Christina.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes and Matthew, just turning quickly also to Putin surprise and rare visit to the Kherson region on Monday. What more details do we 
 
 know about how this trip was carried out, and the significance potentially of the timing of this trip?
 
CHANCE: Well, it was carried out under secrecy as you might expect, I mean, this is an active war zone. The Kherson oblast is where there is a 
 
 significantly active frontline in that part of Southeastern Ukraine. But obviously, Vladimir Putin, the Russian President visiting the bit of the 
 
 region that's controlled by Russian forces needless to say.
 
There was some concern or some question over when it actually happened. The Kremlin have clarified it happened on Monday, but it's only today. They've 
 
 released the images. It was a surprise visit and a very rare one, as you rightly say.
 
But it was just in March I think that President Putin also visited another area of the war zone where the special military operations Russia calls 
 
 that it is being carried out when he went to Mariupol to see civilians and inspect troops there as well. And so I think we're -- we've seen a few of 
 
 these kinds of surprise visits so far. And I expect we're going to be seeing more of them in the months ahead, Christina.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, Matthew Chance there with the latest on Russia. Matthew thanks very much for that! And as we were saying, as Vladimir Putin made 
 
 that reported visit to the Kherson region Ukrainian children from the same area have been returned to their families after controversially being 
 
 deported to Russia.
 
The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against both Mr. Putin and Russia's Children's Rights Commissioner accusing them of war 
 
 crimes in relation to the deportations. Nick Paton Walsh is in Kherson and he got to hear some of the children's stories firsthand.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Kherson may be free, but it's haunted by occupation. When Russian troops fled last year, blowing the 
 
 bridge, it was to only just across the river, from where their snipers and artillery now regularly fire Thursday, shelling killing a local man here 
 
 and Saturday, a mother and child.
 
Haunted too is the homecoming here of Bogdan age 13. We first met him in Kyiv when he just had been rescued from occupied Crimea. He was one of 
 
 thousands of children Ukraine says were forcibly supported by Russia a charge that's led to a war crimes indictment against Putin.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
But home it's tough. And on this hard-hit island off of Kherson, so dicey with Russian troops near this bank and shelling the water that police won't 
 
 let us over the bridge.
 
This is Bogdan's first time outside since he got back when we get him ice cream and pizza. Hope isn't great. A violent route there, the night before 
 
 left glass broken and his hand cut up. The bangs outside make it harder still.
 
BOGDAN, CHILD RETURNEE: Explosions are heard day and night. I want to leave for Kyiv. I'm scared at night that because of these sounds, the windows may 
 
 shatter.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The windows yes, but it's important it doesn't hit the house.
 
WALSH (voice over): The campaign Crimea had gentle indoctrination, daily Russian anthems but it wasn't his thing.
 
BOGDAN: They told us how it was a long time ago with Russia and Ukraine that once they were together.
 
WALSH (on camera): And how did you fee hearing this?
 
BOGDAN: It wasn't cool. In the lessons, I put my head down and looked at my phone. I didn't want to listen. I wouldn't stay in Russia. It firstly isn't 
 
 a pretty town there and there's trash everywhere. They don't clean anywhere or develop. Better to be Kherson than there.
 
WALSH (voice over): The town has its troubles, locals annually queuing here for cash handouts and arena has endured animosity from neighbors ever since 
 
 she let bogged down go to what she thought would be a safer place for just two weeks.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On the island there is contempt from people that I gave Bogdan up. Even at the humanitarian aid center they despise me. One of 
 
 them shouted, where is your Bogdan? Ira, here is your Bogdan? Some of the women in the line were whispering about me and looking at me. But I don't 
 
 pay any attention. It is what it is.
 
WALSH (voice over): Home here can be hard. Kira 10 was also sent to Crimea. Her parents are separated badly, and she came back straight to her Father 
 
 Alexander. But in the shop as they gather handout, toys, clothes and food because her father has lost his job in the war. The background chatter is 
 
 also the parents who let their kids go to the Russians should be treated with caution as sympathizers.
 
WALSH (on camera): What's in the bag? I don't know maybe more toys for you. I asked Kira how the Russian camp was where she stayed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was super at the camp. Super.
 
WALSH (voice over): I ask if it's better to be home. Their world is still spinning between two sides of a war, leaving them nothing but dizzy Nick 
 
 Paton Walsh, CNN, Kherson, Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE: And this just into CNN. More than 2000 flights are reportedly delayed after a temporary ground stop in the U.S. affecting Southwest 
 
 Airlines. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the order earlier for all southwest flights citing equipment issues.
 
Southwest called the problem intermittent technology issues, the airline has apologized. Alright, still ahead tonight on "Connect the World" a 
 
 solemn day in Israel remembering the horrors and the lessons of the Holocaust 80 years on.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
MACFARLANE: Against the wail of sirens, Israelis pause to remember the 6 million Jews who were killed by the Nazis in World War II. Holocaust 
 
 Remembrance Day is being marked across the country and at the site of the Nazi concentration camp outfits. CNN's Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem for us. 
 
 Hadas, clearly this has been an important, an appointed day. Talk us through how events have taken place across the country today.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well of course Holocaust Remembrance Day such a meaningful and somber day in Israel, the Jewish 
 
 state that was created in the aftermath and the embers really of the Holocaust and so many Israelis really feels as though almost every single 
 
 Israeli has some sort of personal connection to the Holocaust, usually from family members who either perished or survived the Holocaust.
 
And one of the biggest moments of the day there are plenty of ceremonies all throughout the day are those sirens that you just heard. So, at 10 am 
 
 exactly what are normally air raid sirens go off for exactly two minutes and the entire country freezes in place. Even people who are driving along 
 
 the highways will stop their cars and get out of their cars and stand to attention.
 
People crossing the street will stop exactly where they are, and standing attention in respect to the millions of people who lost their lives. Now 
 
 much of the main ceremonies happen of course here in Israel at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and Museum there are six torches to represent the 
 
 6 million Jews killed.
 
They are lit by six Holocaust survivors. It is 2023 and there are more than 147,000 recognized Holocaust survivors still alive, living in Israel. More 
 
 than 400 of them celebrated their 100th birthday this year, though, so they have very clear memories of the Holocaust.
 
And interestingly, Christina, more than 500 of them just recently actually moved here from Ukraine leaving of course, the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
 
 to come to safer places here in Israel. They have more than 500 of them recognized as survivors of the Holocaust, but their numbers of course, are 
 
 dwindling. There is a race against time by Yad Vashem to get as many of their testimonies recorded as possible.
 
Now, what's interesting is at the ceremony today, we saw the Israeli President Isaac Hertzog appearing alongside the Israeli Prime Minister 
 
 Benjamin Netanyahu and even the head judge of the Israeli Supreme Court, Esther Hayut.
 
And it has been, of course, been a very divisive time in Israel, and especially within Israeli society over politics over these proposed 
 
 judicial reforms. But in his speech, the Israeli President Isaac Hertzog called in the country to set politics aside, at least for today to call on 
 
 people to unite.
 
And remember, one of the central themes, of course, of this year's Remembrance Day is the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising but 
 
 just a very somber day for this entire country. It kicks off a week of memorial days here in Israel next week will be the Memorial Day for the 
 
 soldiers and it will end in the Independence Day next week, Christina.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, good to see those political leaders leading by example and setting politics aside as you say Hadas for the day, let's hope that will 
 
 hold.
 
GOLD: For one day.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, let's hope that will hold. Hadas Gold there, live for us from Jerusalem. Thanks very much. All right still ahead, as announced 
 
 temporary truce for Sudan approaches its systems enjoy growing hardships. And the renewable energy transition is continuing a pace for rich nations. 
 
 But what about developing ones? We speak with the president of a foundation attempting to change that.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
MACFARLANE: Returning to our top story now. The U.N.'s Human Rights Commissioner is pleading with Sudan's warring sides to immediately cease 
 
 hostilities. Sudan's Army General and paramilitary forces are both agreed to a 24-hour truce that is supposed to start in 30 minutes.
 
Well, Sudan's military is discounting talk of a truce. Human Rights Commissioner says civilians are suffering trapped in their homes with no 
 
 electricity and running out of food and water. U.N. reports at least 180 deaths in the fighting. Last hour in an exclusive CNN interview, I asked 
 
 Egypt's Foreign Minister about the chances of a temporary truce and Egypt's role as a mediator.
 
SAMEH SHOUKRY, EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Egypt has been in direct communications with both parties encouraging for restraint for cessation of 
 
 military activity and the return to dialogue. We have been in contact constantly around the hour advocating for a ceasefire. And we hope that 
 
 this agreement by both sides for a 24-hour cessation of hostilities will hold and will open further doors of communication that can lead to a 
 
 renewed peaceful dialogue to resolve the situation.
 
MACFARLANE: You say that you have been in constant communication with both sides in negotiating and mediating this, but we know that your President 
 
 el-Sisi strongly supports Sudan's army. So, what position does that put you into negotiate because presumably, the RSF may be skeptical of your 
 
 involvement?
 
SHOUKRY: Our relations with Sudan have been traditional than the historic relationship with all of the various political entities in Sudan. At the 
 
 same time, I think the president was very clear. Yesterday when he made the statement about the nature of this conflict, which is an eternal one.
 
Thereby we maintain impartiality and total commitment to the best conditions for the Sudanese people, and certainly the escalating violence 
 
 and the impact, both on military and civilian casualties, is something of great concern to us. Again, it is the best interest of Sudan and its 
 
 population that drives us and we continue to do so with the best of our abilities.
 
MACFARLANE: Well, Nima Elbagir is back with me this hour. And Nima, the foreign minister, there are other avoiding the answer, I think, on what 
 
 position Egypt is intermediate. But you know, what he was saying that I suppose everyone now is hopeful, rather than convinced that this ceasefire 
 
 will go ahead?
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think that his evasiveness really shows you how difficult it's been for 
 
 regional or even global superpowers like the U.S. to have any kind of impact on this war for dominance that's playing out in Sudan.
 
Before the ceasefire was agreed we had all these conflicting statements. Now finally, it does look like it's going ahead. But I think it's really 
 
 important to remind our view was exactly what is at stake, what the conditions are like. We want to show you our piece on this.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELBAGIR (voice over): Sudan's military with a show of strength over the Capitol Khartoum. As birdsong and artillery echo this country roiled in 
 
 recent years by conflict and coups is once again the plaything of strongmen and what the military is calling an attempted coup.
 
Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Sudan's military leader, is fighting for dominance with Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti who leads the paramilitary 
 
 rapid support forces, which gained notoriety in the western -- region, and it is the most vulnerable, who are paying the price.
 
Two doctors' organizations say that in Khartoum both sides have had hospitals in the fighting at least half a dozen, though both sides denied. 
 
 CNN obtained eyewitness accounts from doctors on the ground, who told CNN that the paramilitary rapid support force directly targeted a hospital 
 
 where wounded Armed Forces soldiers and their families were being treated, including one doctor who says she witnessed the RSF approach and Malim 
 
 Hospital in central Khartoum.
 
I have to be strong enough to speak to you. You're the one that's going to tell the world what's happening to us. The evacuation was chaos. We were 
 
 running soldiers were shouting run, and then someone else would yell stop. It's not safe, but what choice did we have?
 
Three separate doctors there describe to us coming under intense bombardment. The country's Central Committee of Doctors tell CNN there were 
 
 no doctors to tell them, the dead and injured are left to rot in their beds. And the Sudan Doctors Trade Union called the targeting of hospitals 
 
 and the housing of military personnel there, a clear breach of international humanitarian law, a charge both sides denied.
 
Both military leaders now fighting for control were key allies in subverting the country's nascent democracy after the popular uprising in 
 
 2019, which deposed Sudan's long-time dictator, Omar Al Bashir, who now languishes in prison.
 
The memories of those protests and the symbolic photo that became its emblem are slowly fading as has the promised transition from military to 
 
 democratic civilian rule. But in an interview with CNN from inside army HQ, the leader of Sudan's military tells me that the RSF militia is staging an 
 
 attempted coup.
 
ABDEL FATTAH AL-BURHAN, SUDANESE MILITARY LEADER: Yesterday and today a humanitarian ceasefire proposal was put forward and agreed upon. Sadly, he 
 
 did not abide by it. You can hear right now the attempts to storm the Army headquarters, and indiscriminate mortar attacks. He's using the 
 
 humanitarian pause to continue the fight.
 
ELBAGIR (voice over): I asked him why the Sudanese people should trust him, given his previous partnership with Commander --.
 
AL-BURHAN: The Sudanese army is the people's army. It is not owned by specific people or specific organizations.
 
ELBAGIR (voice over): General Burhan also committed to a return to civilian rule. The leader of the rapid support forces also told CNN this weekend 
 
 that he wanted to ensure democratic rule.
 
GENERAL MOHAMED HAMDAN DAGALO, LEADER OF PARAMILITARY RAPID SUPPORT FORCES: I don't want to be the leader of the army. There's a framework agreement 
 
 between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don't want to lead anything.
 
ELBAGIR (voice over): Neither general could tell us when the people of Sudan could expect this deadly fight to end, while many languish without 
 
 water, food, electricity, and no way to bury their dead.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELBAGIR: So much is riding on this ceasefire. So many people that we've been speaking to in Sudan are just managing to hold out in hope that they 
 
 can get to the ceasefire, get out, get the food and the supplies that they need for their families. So, we've got less than half an hour now and 
 
 people are really praying.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, and I know this is personal for you too and your family there in Sudan. So, we really hope in 20 minutes time that that ceasefire 
 
 will hold, thank you.
 
ELBAGIR: Thank you.
 
MACFARLANE: Thank you for your reporting. All right, coming up how the fortune left behind this 19th century oil tycoon is now helping developing 
 
 nations transition to sustainable energy sources, that's next. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back, you're watching "Connect the World". Now the person in these photos may be recognizable to many of you. They depict John 
 
 D. Rockefeller, this founder of Standard Oil the company which wants control 90 percent of petroleum production in the United States.
 
It made its founder one of the richest men ever. The Rockefeller Foundation got its start in 1913 when the oil tycoon provided an endowment of $100 
 
 million. The mission of the foundation has been to harness science and technology to promote the well-being of humanity throughout the world. And 
 
 since then, the foundation has provided over $22 billion to programs initiatives.
 
One of its main goals now is to empower people by connecting them to renewable electricity, creating green jobs and cutting carbon emissions. It 
 
 helped launch the Global Energy Alliance for people and planet. In November 2021 with 19 partners, including two other major worldwide philanthropic 
 
 organizations, the Bezos Earth Fund, and the IKEA Foundation.
 
The Council of the Alliance met today to pledge to reduce dramatically the cost of renewable energy technologies. Well, joining me now is the Co-Chair 
 
 of the Alliance and the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, Dr. Rajiv Shah. Doctor, thank you so much for joining us! Let's talk first about this 
 
 meeting that has just happened today. Bring us up to date on what was discussed and what tangible action came from it?
 
DR. RAJIV SHAH, PRESIDENT, THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION: Well, Christina, thank you for having me. This alliance is you so effectively introduced is 
 
 actually constituted of 19 major organizations including philanthropies like ours and the others you mentioned, but also the World Bank, other 
 
 regional development banks, investors and private sector investors. And together we've mobilized more than $11 billion to help lower income 
 
 countries get access to renewable energy.
 
And believe it or not, that is so important for two reasons. One is actually the fight for whether or not the earth stays at one and a half 
 
 degrees Celsius, will now be won or lost in 81 low income and low- and middle-income countries around the world.
 
And the second is because, in reality, even today, almost a billion people have almost no access to real electricity and power and are therefore 
 
 trapped in poverty. So today, our council came together and committed to take certain steps that will help dramatically reduce the cost of renewable 
 
 energy access in developing economies.
 
And also, specifically to expand access to important technologies like batteries, which right now are simply not available to most developing 
 
 countries, those supply chains are very tight, and most battery production is going to the wealthier parts of the world.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. And now let's talk about this divide as you put it. And I think key to this one of the keys to this, as you've outlined there is the 
 
 minimum energy requirements. Because I know that there's a big goal for your alliance to rise up the developing nations to a point where they have 
 
 enough energy to function in modern life. What are the big keys to doing this successfully and sustainably?
 
DR. SHAH: Well, you know, the first big critical key to this is making sure you reach everyone. You know, it was interesting to hear you talk about 
 
 John D. Rockefeller and the fossil fuel revolution and as important as that was for creating wealth and economic growth in certain parts of the world.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
Even today, a billion people don't have access to real electricity. They're just not connected to grids. They live in poverty; they farm without access 
 
 to mechanization and power. So and when they get access to power, it's at 60 cents or more a kilowatt hour because it comes from dirty diesel 
 
 generation that is polluting and noisy, and too expensive to help them grow their economies.
 
So, the first key to success is reaching everyone. And this alliance has helped develop renewable technologies, solar mini grids, small scale wind 
 
 and hydro battery storage connected to distributed generation and provision of electricity. So that a small village in rural Northeast India that 
 
 hasn't previously been getting 24-hour electricity, can now afford to keep its schools open at night.
 
So, girls can learn. It can provide power to small businesses. So those businesses can use power tools and start employing people and create that 
 
 upward cycle of growth and opportunity. And that example is being repeated all around the world, in nations where our alliance is active.
 
MACFARLANE: And I'm sure you expect me perhaps touch on the Rockefeller Foundation's pass. Because as I was saying, at the top there, as you just 
 
 mentioned, you know, this was a foundation formed from the proceeds of Standard Oil. And even though the family has been out of that business 
 
 since 2011, they only pledged, or you only pledged to divest its endowment away from fossil fuel investments in 2020. So why has it taken so long for 
 
 the foundation to come to that decision?
 
DR. SHAH: Well, it took perhaps too long, you know, I started and we put a process in place and then made that decision within a few years of when I 
 
 got here. But the reality is we're the first major foundation of our type in our peer group to make that pledge.
 
I think a number of others have followed us since then. Frankly, the universities went before us, many more courageous universities went ahead 
 
 and made that pledge earlier. So, the reality is, we think more institutions should stop financing, fossil fuels and focus as we have on 
 
 investing in renewable energy in these economies.
 
But it's not just about investment. The council that came together today includes political leaders like Prime Minister Jonas Store of Norway. And a 
 
 lot of what we have to do is help countries around the world change their policies, and make much larger public investments in renewable electricity, 
 
 and frankly, and renewable electricity that reaches everyone.
 
And so, we spend a lot of time with heads of state in dozens of countries, getting the commitment level up and focusing on applications of renewable 
 
 electricity that can finally reach everyone, and energy poverty and make sure that the next cycle of growth is much, much more inclusive as we go 
 
 forward.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, because I know and I found this jaw dropping that you have said in the past that by 2050, developing countries could collectively 
 
 account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gases, which is just extraordinary. So, the work you are doing, we know is vital.
 
And let's hope that countries and organizations will work with you. Unfortunately, Dr. Rajiv Shah, we'll have to leave it there, but it's great 
 
 to hear your perspective on this and have an update on how this is progressing.
 
DR. SHAH: Thank you for having me.
 
MACFARLANE: Thank you. Now fewer than 100 days until the FIFA Women's World Cup and this year's tournament looks to be the biggest yet. Next, we'll 
 
 hear from FIFA's first ever chief women's football officer about what to expect as the countdown ticks closer --.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back! The clock is ticking we're just 93 days away from the FIFA Women's World Cup. This year's tournament is the biggest in 
 
 history with 32 teams competing up from 24 in 2019, and eight teams on debut. My colleague Becky Anderson chatted with Sarai Bareman, who is the 
 
 first ever FIFA Chief Women's Football Officer and asked her how the preparations have been coming along, take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARAI BAREMAN, FIFA CHIEF WOMEN'S FOOTBALL OFFICER: We are in full delivery mode, making sure that everything is ready. The stadiums, the pictures, the 
 
 training sites, basically to welcome all the teams and the international fans. So yes, it's a very exciting moment. There's a lot going on at the 
 
 moment in Australia and New Zealand. And yes, it's building up to be the biggest woman's world cup that will ever see.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): And as far as ticket sales are concerned, go on; tell us where you at are?
 
BAREMAN: Ticket sales are going amazingly well. We just launched what we call our final sales phase of the tickets on the 11th of April. And we've 
 
 sold more than 100,000 since we launched that. So yes, we're really, really pleased with the way things are tracking. However, in saying that, you 
 
 know, there are still tickets available for matches right across the tournament across the nine incredible host cities.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): Yes, so right, FIFA launched its global strategy for women's football then in 2018. It described the state of play to be and I 
 
 quote here, "in rude health and in need of fundamental change and it aim to double the number of female players to 60 million by 2026" Are you on 
 
 track?
 
BAREMAN: Yes, it's we are absolutely on track. However, this woman's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will be a huge catalyst to helping us 
 
 reach that target. You know, there's nothing like a Women's World Cup once every four years to create a huge boom for the popularity of our sport for 
 
 the commercial value of our sport for our athletes to be showcased. Everything that women's football is about a spotlight really shines on it 
 
 during this moment once every four years.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): What are the other bigger challenges in growing the women's game globally right now, do you believe?
 
BAREMAN: So, I think one is really, really important is the commercialization of our sport. You know, women's football has been seen 
 
 for so long as a cost exercise. You know, we're for the first time we have unbundled the rights to the woman's world cap. We have a dedicated strategy 
 
 for women's football commercially, and we want to drive the commercial value of our sport.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): FIFA recently announced a 300 percent jump in prize money increase ahead of the tournament; bring it to $150 million. FIFA 
 
 President Gianni Infantino announced last month that the organization aims to have equal pay for the 2026 Men's and 2027 Women's World Cup. He said 
 
 though, it would be complicated to get there. What's the strategy so right to pull that off?
 
BAREMAN: What's important to say is in addition to that 300 percent increase, for the first time, we will be mandating that the players 
 
 themselves receive a minimum amount for their performance at the World Cup, which is really, really meaningful, particularly when you know and 
 
 understand the environment that a lot of these players come from.
 
But listen, I got to come back to that point on commercialization. You know, we're pushing a lot at the FIFA level to make sure that our sport is 
 
 recognized as a valuable commercial product. And it should be you know we had more than 1.12 billion people tuning in from more than 200 territories 
 
 in France. This year, we will have more than 2 billion people watching this event. It is a valuable commercial product and we need to ensure that we 
 
 hold it as a valuable commercial product.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): There was some controversy over Saudi Arabia becoming a major sponsor at the World Cup after backlash from Australia, and indeed 
 
 New Zealand football governing bodies. In the end, there was no deal signed. The Head of FIFA Infantino called that a double standard pointing 
 
 out that trade, for example, between Saudi Arabia and Australia, really rather healthy. Do you agree with his criticism?
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
BAREMAN: Listen, I think what a lot of people don't understand is that FIFA is a global organization. We have 211 member associations all around the 
 
 world. And I've been very fortunate in my last, you know, six years at this organization to be able to visit many of them. And when you're in this 
 
 global position, you're dealing with countries that are so vastly different.
 
Their cultural background, their religious backgrounds, you know, the, the way that they vote, the way that they elect leaders, all these things are 
 
 totally different. And that's why when we take an approach to things like commercialization, we take decisions around football and how we organize 
 
 it. We have to put a global lens on these sorts of things.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE: Absolutely cannot wait for this Women's World Cup obviously said to be the biggest on record yet. And that'll do it for this edition of 
 
 the show. Thank you so much for joining us, stay with CNN, we're returning after this short break.
