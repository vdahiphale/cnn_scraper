NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: All of this unfolded, according to Aderrien's mother, Nakala Murry, at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, when the father of another one of her children showed up at her house unannounced and he was irate. She was so scared for her safety, she says, she was able to sneak away momentarily to hand a cell phone to Aderrien who was asleep in his bed at the time. She asked him to call 911. And that's exactly what he did. 
 
Nakala Murry tells me that when the officer showed up, one of them, Greg Capers, had his gun drawn already, ordered everyone out of the house. And that's when Aderrien came around the corner of the hallway into the living room and Nakala Murry says she heard one gunshot. And that shot fired into the chest of 11-year-old Aderrien Murry. 
 
The attorney for the family saying there's really nothing that Aderrien could have done differently to avoid being shot.

CARLOS MOORE, ATTORNEY FOR FAMILY OF ADERRIEN MURRY: This sounds like the boy did everything right. I mean, everything right. He was a good student. He obeyed his mom when she requested him to call the police for her assistance. He called the police and his grandmother. And then when the officers showed up and said come out with your hands up, he obeyed the officer's request and still gets shot. There's no way he could have been mistaken for the adult. The adult was over 6 feet tall. This young man, this 11-year-old child was about 4'10".

VALENCIA: And we want to show you the photo of this officer. We just obtained photos of him earlier today. He's been identified as officer Greg Capers. We at CNN have made repeated attempts to reach out to him that have been unsuccessful. The police department also not calling us back. But this morning referring all questions to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations. And very quickly, Boris, we know this incident was captured on body camera, but MBI telling us they are not going to release that video because of an ongoing investigation. Capers, meanwhile, is on paid administrative leave. The bottom line here though is that the family wants to see him charged and fired -- Boris. 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Nick, please keep watching the story very closely and keep us updated with the very latest. Thanks, Nick. He is on paid administrative leave. 
 
VALENCIA: You bet.
 
SANCHEZ: Jim.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Well, last year, Navy Seal candidate Kyle Mullen died just a few hours after completing the grueling training selection course known as "Hell Week." And now a highly critical new report discovered lapses in oversight and medical care that contributed to Mullen's death, and to the risk of severe injuries. All of it prompting an overhaul of the Seals' notoriously brutal process. 
 
CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Oren, listen, this has been an issue at times to the years. We've seen it. The process has always remained grueling, but we've seen incidents like this. Tell us what was particular about this one and what particular changes they're recommending now. 
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Jim, you're absolutely right. That the Navy Seals selection and training course is designed to be incredibly difficult, brutal and grueling even. To leave candidates absolutely exhausted. But investigators concluded that's no excuse whatsoever to not have proper medical oversight of the candidates as they're going through this course, through what's known as "Hell Week" and even afterwards.
 
In fact, investigators wrote upon the release of the report that the medical oversight for this course was poorly organized, poorly integrated and poorly led. Thank you All of this came to light after the death of 23-year-old Kyle Mullen. He had completed Hell Week. He was through arguably the most difficult part of this course. He had gone through a final medical check. There were personnel who were checking on him, and yet he died some eight hours after finishing the course of bacterial pneumonia. 
 
And this is where the Navy found a list of problems. First, in going through Hell Week and before, Mullen himself had respiratory issues. He had some trouble breathing. He had taken oxygen. But none of that was passed down to the final medical check. So, there was no history of the systems that he'd been going through that they could use to know he was suffering from something more than exhaustion or breathing issues. 
 
Finally, those personnel who came to check on him, they had no medical training. So, even they didn't know what to look for or how to respond to it. In fact, Mullen himself was coughing up a red-orange fluid -- according to the investigation in his final hours. And there are some very difficult-to-read details about his final hours there. 
 
In an attempt to fix this, there will be much more medical oversight throughout the course, especially during Hell Week, every 24 hours, including 24 hours after the course. The recovery room where Seal candidates go after the course will also be right next to the medical clinic. And there is also a more thorough examination of performance- enhancing drugs and their potential use during Hell Week -- Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Listen, I mean, reading the details of the case, one of the issues was there were signs throughout the week, right? Symptoms throughout the week. And as you said, missed, not passed on to the folks treating him at the end of it. Just such a sad case, such a young man. Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon, thanks so much -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Next, after cancelling her European tour, a source now tells CNN, Celine he's Dion will likely never tour again. What we're learning about that legendary singer's condition.
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
Plus, panic in the sky after a passenger opens a plane's emergency exit midair. Hear why he said he did this when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SCIUTTO: This just in to CNN. The Texas House of Representatives is set to vote on articles of impeachment for the state's Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton tomorrow. 
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
A GOP-led house ethics panel heard testimony from investigators detailing what they say is years of misconduct by Paxton. We're going to stay on top of this story. 
 
SANCHEZ: We also have major news about singer Celine Dion. Just hours after cancelling her world tour, CNN is learning that the superstar's days as a touring artist may be over. CNN's Chloe Melas joins us now with her exclusive reporting. Chloe, Celine he's Dion is an icon to so many music fans. What are you learning about her condition and how it might keep her away from touring? 
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Look, Boris, this shocking announcement that just came a few hours ago with Celine taking to social media with this statement, saying that she is incredibly disappointed to tell her fans that she is canceling her entire world tour and that was going to go through 2024. 
 
Now I have interviewed Celine Dion in the past. I flew to Vegas. I saw the show. I sat down with her, spent almost the entire day with her. And a source close to Celine telling me, you better watch out, she might never tour again. That she was diagnosed, as we know, with stiff person syndrome. It's a rare neurological disorder which has really affected her vocal cords and it has made it really hard for her to rehearse, to sing. And it has affected every part of her daily life. 
 
You know, I have known for a while now that it has been a very tough existence. And this source telling me that she's in a lot of pain. The source also telling me that she is in daily physical therapy. And it's a sad day for fans of Celine Dion. This icon, all over the world, to know that your chances of seeing her perform live again are very slim. And so, they are encouraging ticket holders to go back to their point of purchase to get their money back. But she says that it breaks my heart, and she wants you all to know she is not giving up. 
 
SANCHEZ: Chloe Melas, thank you so much for reporting out that sad news. We certainly hope that she's in good spirits and that her health might improve. Thank you so much, Chloe -- Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Now to a story that's really caught our attention today. A terrifying scare in the air when a passenger on a commercial plane opened the jet's door. This was mid-flight hundreds of feet in the air. You can see the wind rushing through the cabin. And the people were holding onto their seats white-knuckled. Nine passengers had to be hospitalized after landing. 
 
CNN's Bianna Golodryga covering this next hour on "THE LEAD." Bianna, as we reported, the person has been arrested now. I watched the story and I'm imagining myself in that same position and also wondering how this was possible. But do we have any idea what motivated this person? 
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: It is a horrifying story, Jim. You've been covering it and we've been covering it all day. And I have to say, each time I see that video, I am just as shocked to see those passengers sitting there. Thank goodness more people weren't injured. 
 
So, here's the latest that were hearing. Local police say they have arrested a suspect. He has confessed to opening that emergency exit and pulling that lever, but he didn't give a reason as to why. And so, that really is where the investigation is going to focus now. 
 
And I was really interested in your interview in the last hour with Mary Schiavo when she was explaining how this was possible. And this was an ordinary flight. Landing about 150 miles from Seoul. When all of a sudden in the last two or three minutes, this passenger just opened that emergency door exit. And the reason he was able to do that -- according to Mary -- and we were told by experts, is that the plane at that point when you're just about 700 feet above ground is depressurized, so the door is able to be opened. Otherwise, that wouldn't have been possible. 
 
That having been said, a lot of questions still remain. What could crew have done at that point? This is an older plane. Would that be possible with newer planes? And I have to say, Jim, thank goodness everybody had their seat belt on. You know, you always keep your seatbelts on for precaution. And we're told by the flight crew as they walked through those aisles in the last few minutes before landing to put your seat belt on. This is never why you would think they would tell you to do that, though. 
 
SCIUTTO: No question. I mean, as you said, that sweet spot of the altitude, but also an older plane that didn't have other fail-safes in place. It certainly makes you wonder how that's going to be corrected going forward. I understand you have a special guest on the show. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, Gary Sinise, just in time for Memorial Day weekend. Of course, we all know him as Lieut. Dan from "Forrest Gump." But he has been one of the strongest advocates for supporting our veterans. And once again for about 20 years now he's putting on performances. We'll be doing one tonight in Washington, D.C. with his band, of course, raising money and awareness for veterans. I'll be talking to him about that. He'll have great weather in Washington to perform for our vets tonight as well. 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, nice to have you in the chair for "THE LEAD" tonight. Brianna Golodryga --
 
GOLODRYGA: Good to be here.
 
SCIUTTO: Good to have you -- Boris. 
 <br>[15:45:00]
 
SANCHEZ: Next, on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. See the moment a Coast Guard helicopter crew had to evacuate a child from the deck -- the top deck of a cruise ship. We have the full video straight ahead. 
 
And a series of shark attacks and sightings across the United States has led to a flurry of warnings this Memorial Day weekend. We might need a bigger wall for that story. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: Now to some of the headlines we're following at this hour. This is certainly one way to get to work. A Southwest pilot was forced to crawl through the cockpit window after the flight deck door got locked. 
 <br>[15:50:02]
 
Southwest says that passengers and crew members were already on board when this happened. Apparently, someone opened a lavatory door and inadvertently closed and locked the flight deck door. Yikes. 
 
Also, does this iconic home look familiar? Any second now. Does it remind you of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely girls? Yes, it's the "The Brady Bunch" home and it's for sale. It could be yours for a cool $5.5 million. The house is in Studio City, California, and it was completely rebuilt to look just like the show's set. 
 
And check out this incredible Coast Guard evacuation from a cruise ship. It happened after a toddler fell ill while on vacation. The child and mom were lifted off the plane's deck. We're told the little girl fortunately is in stable condition -- Jim. 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, as beach goers prepare for the holiday weekend, officials are warning people in some places to be wary of sharks in the water. This comes after reports of several unprovoked attacks over the last several weeks. The latest incident in Turks and Caicos left an American woman in serious condition, after officials say a shark bit her leg off. We should note, experts say and the numbers show, shark attacks are extremely rare. They do happen. CNN's Miguel Marquez joins us from Rockaway Beach in New York. Miguel,
 
 tell us what's behind this and where exactly there are alerts. Because I don't want to give people the impression that every beach everywhere is having shark attacks. 
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, well look, this is the Atlantic. This is their backyard. There are sharks everywhere. And yes, they are extremely rare, as you say. But you do not want to be on the wrong end of them. And they can really happen in almost any situation. 
 
We're in the Rockaways, there are people surfing out there today. We talked to several surfers today. One surfer we talked to was at a beach just a couple of -- about a half mile down and said that they saw what he thinks was a thresher shark this morning, about a six- footer. 
 
Another guy says last year he had a shark come up to him and then scurry away as soon as it realized he wasn't prey. Oftentimes, that's what happens. Sharks think humans are prey, they bite and then they let go. 
 
That's why that situation in Turks and Caicos is so concerning. It took her leg off. She was swimming out -- snorkeling out beyond the reef on a private boat. She was saved because there was a tour boat nearby and they just hopped into action and were able to save her life. 
 
There was another young woman, a surfer down in South Jersey. She was surfing last week when she got bit by something that the bite is consistent with a shark bite. So, you know surfing, being out in the water. 
 
But then there was a woman in Florida. She was in the low waters. She was right off the shore, just hanging out in the water, and a shark came up and bit her there in the stomach and on the arm. So, it could really happen anywhere. 
 
New York putting up more drones this year to spot sharks around the beaches and more craft on the water to spot sharks so they can get people out if they do see them. But best advice is, if you see seals, if you see schools of fish, birds going into the water, that sort of behavior, stay away from that, because you do not want to get mistaken for a shark meal -- Jim. 
 
SCIUTTO: Miguel Marquez in Rockaway Beach, New York, thank you so much -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: 22-year-old Kevin Pearce was an Olympic hopeful back in 2009 when he had an accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury that ended his snowboarding career. His older brother, Adam, stayed by his side through recovery, helping him relearn to walk and talk. But it wasn't until they found yoga that Adam watched his brother come back to life. Now, Adam brings yoga to other brain injury survivors and he's created a community of transformative healing. Meet this week's CNN hero, Adam Pearce. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ADAM PEARCE, CO-FOUNDED, LOVEYOURBRAIN FOUNDATION: I think people feel isolated after brain injury because they don't feel able. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's hard. I've lost my identity. 
 
PEARCE: And when we allow people to be vulnerable and who they are, there is a deep connection formed because there is so much common understanding of the challenges that go on with brain injury. 
 
The changes I see most after people with TBI practice yoga are probably a deeper connection to self. Helping them cultivate greater awareness and self-compassion allows them to meet the constant changes so much more. 
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANCHEZ: To get an inside look at this transformative yoga community, go to CNNheroes.com. And while you're there, you can nominate a hero of your own. CNN NEWS CENTRAL returns in just moments.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SANCHEZ: You know what they say about snitches. 
 
SCIUTTO: They get stitches. 
 
SANCHEZ: They get stitches because they are also welcome at Airbnb. The company is cracking down on partying at rentals. And one of the things they're doing is asking neighbors to report -- or as some may say, snitch -- on any suspected gatherings and parties. The crackdown is part of Airbnb's "anti-party system" that goes into effect this Memorial Day weekend. Yes, they're also making it harder -- 
 
SCIUTTO: They call it anti-party system? 
 
SANCHEZ: "The Anti-Party System." They make it harder for high-risk users to make last-minute one or two-night bookings through Monday. 
 <br>[16:00:00]
 
Jim, I've got to be honest with you. I feel like, if I rented an Airbnb and had a party, all the cars outside, all the music you don't like, the smell of pork cooking in the backyard. I feel like you would -- 
 
SCIUTTO: I just want to know if you're on the high-risk user list. 
 
SANCHEZ: You would call the cops, Airbnb, your friends at the state, the Defense Department. 
 
SCIUTTO: Not for Boris, no. I promise.
