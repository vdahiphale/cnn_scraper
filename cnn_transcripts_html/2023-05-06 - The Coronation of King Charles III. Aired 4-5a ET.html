ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, a very warm welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and around the world. I'm Isa Soares, live from Buckingham Palace. We will have a look at how the United Kingdom feels about the monarchy ahead of King Charles III's coronation; it's just gone 9:00 am here. 
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: I am Bianca Nobilo live from Westminster Abbey. VIP guests are expected to arrive later this hour for the coronation. 
 
SOARES: While the coronation festivities, you can hear some, the microphone here just outside Buckingham Palace. Guests waiting for the next hour, when King Charles III makes his way to Westminster Abbey. 
 
The doors to the royal church have already been open for an hour and a bit. Guests have been arriving for the first crowning of a British monarch in seven decades. About 2,200 deaths have been arriving at Westminster Abbey. 
 
A little later, we expect King Charles III to move from St. James Palace to Buckingham Palace by car. From there, he will begin his journey to Westminster Abbey with his wife, Queen Camilla, in the first of two processions. 
 
Today, the royal couple will ride to the service in the diamond jubilee state coach, drawn by six Windsor Grey horses you will see in the procession there. Let's get more on what you can expect today and the momentous occasion of this. Trisha Goddard joins me now from London. 
 
Trisha, the mood here is just electrifying. 
 
It's a family occasion. Isn't it?
 
TRISHA GODDARD, TV HOST: It really is. It's an exciting occasion. I just wanted to point out a couple of things that people may be worried about or concerned about. That's something that is close to King Charles' heart, which is mental health. 
 
A lot of people with mental health issues will be attracted to going to an occasion like this. They may appear distressed. I just want to tell people that we're not talking about bad people. We are talking about people who have got a lot of problems. 
 
Just to put people's minds at rest. There are groups like FTAC, Fixed Threat Assessment, where the police work with mental health workers. There's also Coast, an organization that works with police to support people with mental health issues. 
 
So anybody in the crowd who is listening, if you see someone who is really distressed, upset, this is a chance for us all to come together and accept people, whatever their troubles are, whatever their weaknesses are. 
 
Please reach out, help them. There are organizations that can help people because this will set off a lot of things for people. 
 
SOARES: Trisha, can I just interrupt you for one second, we are seeing musicians in action. We want to listen in. This is in Westminster Abbey. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
SOARES: This gives you a flavor of what we can expect. Music is such an important part of King Charles' life, opera in particular. Many of the songs and the pieces today have been specially commissioned by King Charles III. Trisha Goddard is with me. 
 
Trisha, we've been talking so much about the fact that is going to be a slimmed down ceremony, at the heart of it, the essence of it, it's very much the same, isn't it?
 
GODDARD: It is. It is about joy. Just listening to the music and watching the musicians play. It's all about joy. 
 
A lot of people are saying, will this happen?
 
Will that happen?
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
GODDARD: There is a lot of protocol. Although Charles is embracing the modern world, if you like, there still is that deference to the past and how things are done. While it may look like this person has been excluded or that person hasn't been included, we need to remember that, as I said before, there is a protocol. 
 
SOARES: And Trisha, it's slimmed down. I think it's reflective, of course, of modern Britain, as you are saying. 
 
I've had so many guests in the past, in the past 24 to 48 hours, saying how wonderful to see fewer peers and more people from the community, those who have been playing a part, of course, in their local community, nurses, those who have helped during COVID. 
 
How important do you think it is to be reflected for people watching today?
 
GODDARD: I think it's really important, especially if you mention nurses, as well. I think that it has more connection. One of the things a slimmed down monarchy has to do -- and Princess Anne alluded to this -- they've got to get out and do more, especially with Commonwealth countries. 
 
One of our earlier contributors were talking about many of the Commonwealth countries talking about being a republic. The way to fight back against any, sort of, uprooting of present systems is for the royals to actually get out more and visit those countries. They seem a little bit remote to many of them. 
 
SOARES: I think, for the guests I've been speaking to, at least those who are part of the Prince's Trust, I spoke to a young gentlemen who's being helped by the Prince's Trust. He felt it was so special, having met King Charles, having been helped by the Prince's Trust. 
 
He is part of today's occasion. Important to point out that this, of course, will be steeped in history. Everyone will be looking closely at the royals. 
 
What are they wearing? 
 
The other question everyone will be asking, where will Harry sit?
 
Will he sit at the front?
 
Will he sit with the other members of the family?
 
Will Harry be at the balcony?
 
What is your take on this?
 
GODDARD: I think it's so sad. Those protocols are there. But we forget, families are families. Imagine, any of us, if our families, every little thing that went wrong or went right was put in newspaper headlines. 
 
This is a family. This is a father and son. These are brothers and what have you. All of those things need to be taken into account. I don't know why we expect people to behave differently in families that happen to wear a little bit of gold on their heads. 
 
SOARES: I know, so many of my guests said, this is family, let's see that. We know from the order of service, in fact, that Harry will not be playing a part in the procession. There are still questions of whether he will be appearing on the balcony just behind me. Thank you so much, Trisha. 
 
We see some people already preparing. The heavens have opened. The Brits, we are all prepared for every season you can think of. I saw people wearing other people with umbrellas. Some people had a bikini under their tops. Those have been camping out for days, deck chairs, scones, bubbly wine. 
 
People are ready for this regardless of what the weather has in store. I want to go to the mall now, where is getting very busy, very packed. Nada Bashir is joining, us now, with the latest. Give us a sense of what we were seeing. 
 
Before we go to Nada, we are seeing some movement at this hour. You can see. There is that -- that's King Charles as you can see. There you go. And Queen Camilla in that front car, greeting the crowd, waving. 
 
If you remember, yesterday, in fact, he's just down the mall where Nada Bashir's at. He will be coming past me. Just listen as people cheer. People have been waiting. 
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
SOARES (voice-over): Waiting for days now to get a glimpse of King Charles. I'm just going to turn around because he's going to pass us here. That first carriage going past Buckingham Palace, being greeted by so many people who were waiting for hours and days to see him. 
 
We saw the king greeting those camping out at the mall. He's making his way to Buckingham Palace. It is from here that the king will make his way to Westminster Abbey. That is the route to the coronation. 
 
The heavens have indeed opened, the clouds are not dispersing, wanting to see any little glimpse of the king. For many people in this country, they would not have seen a coronation in some 70 years. This is truly historic. Plenty of pageantry. 
 
Nada, you are in the mall as the queen and king made their way to Buckingham Palace. Talk to us about the mood. I heard lots of people clapping. 
 
What did you hear?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lots of clapping, lots of cheers. Everyone is all very excited. Some people have been camping out for days. Others have just arrived tonight. They're trying out their luck to get a glimpse of the king and queen. 
 
Many people, of course, extremely excited to see this moment, to witness this moment. 
 
These people have come down from Cambridge.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: yes.
 
BASHIR: Why was it important for you to come down to be here?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because it is a historic event, really. I really love the royal family. I have always been a really big fan of it. So it's just history, I've been into history, the pageantry and all of it, for that reason. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm quite the same, it's more like -- there are very few chances you get to see something like this in London. 
 
BASHIR: The mall is really crowded now. It has reached capacity. This is a huge (INAUDIBLE) but everyone's high-spirited. Charles and Camilla making their way to Westminster Abbey. Of course, that procession back following the coronation ceremony, heading back to Buckingham Palace. 
 
SOARES: Nada Bashir, electrifying mood. Of course, we saw the king and the queen. I think they are a bit ahead of schedule, which is wonderful in many ways, because so many guests have been packed inside Westminster Abbey, waiting for this moment. 
 
We have been seeing for the past, well, since 6 o'clock this morning or so, we have been showing you the thousands of armed forces who have been arriving. Some 4,000 arriving since 6:00 am this morning. Military precision, it's just 10 trains arriving since this morning to take part in this pageantry. 
 
Bianca Nobilo is outside Westminster Abbey. 
 
Bianca, I'm not sure if you've got binoculars but it's been quite a flow of guests arriving. The doors have been open for just over 1.5 hours. 
 
What have you been seeing?
 
NOBILO: I do have binoculars. Although, at the moment, it's pretty orderly, calm. We're seeing the results of meticulous planning that has been going on for years and then ramping up to the days and nights in recent weeks. That is why it is so calm because roads are locked off. 
 
There is a lockdown imposed. There is almost less activity than you would ever imagine right now as they prepare this area for the VIP arrivals, the heads of state and finally the royal family and the king and queen themselves. 
 
We've had some bagpipes, some trumpets, there have been preparations. We can see the area for the carriages to make their final stop before the royals enter into the abbey. Other than that, no real signs of the scale and really historic nature of what we're about to see today. 
 
We know that we have celebrities, national celebrities and international ones, such as Katy Perry, who will be performing at the coronation concert tomorrow, already in the abbey, as well as some political figures, such as the mayor of London, who will be overseeing part of the security operation.
 
This is of course, a suit for political occasions. We are seeing politicians from all sides of the political spectrum here, in the United Kingdom. But for now, it is very much the calm before the storm. 
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
NOBILO: The rain is stretching to subside a little, too, which will be a relief to those guests who are just walking into the abbey right now. SOARES: Don't jinx it. We've seen some of the splendor of what this
 
 entails. We will see -- we've been hearing cheering and singing. We'll see much more of that as the processions get on the way. Both of them, on either side. Speak to in just a minute. Thank you, Bianca. 
 
Still ahead, they camped out for days just to get a glimpse of the coronation. We will discuss why the coronation matters so much to people across the U.K. You are watching CNN.

SOARES (voice-over): A very warm welcome back to our special coverage of the coronation of king. 
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
SOARES (voice-over): We've been looking at live images now from Westminster Abbey. Bands have been leaving Wellington Barracks and proceeding along the mall inside the abbey there. Beautiful music as greeting so many guests who have been arriving in the past hour. 
 
More than 2,200 guests, from celebrities, dignitaries, members of the royal family, politicians from around the world, members of the public who have received an invite. It's a more slimmed down coronation. It's still full of pageantry, history, rich in history with its beautiful music. 
 
Much of these pieces have been commissioned by King Charles. People have been camping out for days along the procession route. They have come from all around the world to witness today's events. Some spoke to CNN about why was so important for them to be here. Have a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's so fabulous. You know what, the British people are wonderful. It's so exciting to be part of the whole pomp and circumstance. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm proud of our monarchy and our country. I'm glad we've got them rather than some of the prime ministers and presidents that are around at the moment that you're not so proud of. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's our history. It's what makes us British. We are different from other countries. The monarchy may be shrunken (ph) beyond all recognition. But our monarchy brings in a lot to the economy of Great Britain. And they are really important. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Let's bring in broadcaster and royal watcher Bidisha Mamata. The rains, the heavens have opened, people have got their umbrellas
 
 out. That is not dampening their spirits. Give us a sense of what it is around the world, what's the mood is like right. Now because we feel, here, it is very special. 
 
What is the mood around the country?
 
BIDISHA MAMATA, BROADCASTER AND ROYAL WATCHER: It's undeniably special but the mood around the world isn't a rebellion. It is one of watchfulness and thoughtfulness. People around the world are saying to themselves, OK, so here is King Charles. We know his history, we know about the monarchy. 
 
We know that it teeters between being an absolutely grand opera, full of ceremonial costumes and being sometimes a soap opera. I think we like that. We like those dramatic elements. 
 
But there'll be whole generations asking themselves, what is this for?
 
All of this beauty, this grandeur, this culture, this history, this glorious day which has been fine-tuned for months on end, what does it really mean in the real world?
 
SOARES: We've been looking at images from inside Westminster Abbey. Doors have been open for almost 1.5 hours. We have been listening to the Monte Verde Choir. They have been greeting us in the last 20, 30 minutes or so. 
 
You beg the question, how people feel?
 
Does it relate to them?
 
This is something that King Charles wanted this coronation to feel, that it could relate to them, it was accessible, modern Britain. 
 
Does it reflect that?
 
MAMATA: It actually does. It also reflects King Charles III's own interests in the arts and culture, this ceremony, the entire coronation -- I don't know if you can hear it in the background, but the drummers are here as well. It's all about music. It's about poetry. It's about art. 
 
SOARES: I'm going to stop you for a second. They are coming into our shot right. Now the drums. It's about cue but it's also about this, the pageantry. The British do this so well, don't they?
 
It doesn't matter. Everyone in the crowd has their photos out. It is raining but that doesn't stop this moment. Many of us haven't seen this in 70 years.
 
MAMATA: It's very hard to stay still in one seat. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: I'm getting all the time because they are right there. You are saying, do you think that younger generations can relate to
 
 this?
 
MAMATA: I think they can absolutely enjoy every little bit of this. Of course, this is meant to impress. 
 
SOARES: It is meant to impress. 
 
Do you think, though, that King Charles, who wants a more slimmed down -- he's got members of other faiths. He has fewer peers. I think people have applauded that, have they not?
 
MAMATA: People really appreciate the fact that, even though he comes from such wealth and privilege, he cares a lot about how he comes across. He also wants to use his privilege for the greater good as much as he can. 
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
MAMATA: Ever since he was a younger prince, he has stretched the importance of community, closing the gap between the rich and the poor and social equality. 
 
SOARES: This is something, what I have noticed of those who have been invited, so much about service, which means so much to him. That's what his life has, been a life of service. 
 
MAMATA: His entire role, for 74 years, has been duty, showing up, be attentive, be mindful, always bear in mind what people expect of. You his way of paying it forward to the community is to say, for those people who did not have the opportunities that I did, here is a little bit of a way. In here is a little bit of a leg up. 
 
The Prince's Trust hasn't just helped do-gooders in the community. That doesn't work. It sounds insincere. It's helped young actors, performers, it's connected Charles' sense of charity with his love of the arts, culture, history, archeology, architecture. 
 
Really appreciate you taking the time to talk to. us we leave you with these incredible images. 
 
That does it here for me. I'm Isa Soares, coming to you live from Buckingham Palace. Now you are outside Westminster Abbey. We will have the rest of the coverage of King Charles' coronation after this break.

NOBILO: Welcome back to those in the United States and all around the world. I'm Bianca Nobilo, live from Westminster Abbey with our continuing coverage of the coronation of King Charles. Heads of state from roughly 100 countries are arriving at Westminster
 
 Abbey for the coronation of King Charles III. The streets of London, also filling up with thousands of people coming to witness this historic event. Many will be able to watch on viewing screens that are being set up across the city. 
 
The procession will feature some 7,000 troops, the most seen in any state occasion since Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953. 
 
To mark the historic day, newspapers have published memorable headlines, with some calling this, quote, "a day of destiny." Sharon Carpenter joins us now. She's the former host of "Royal Report" on People TV. 
 
Sharon, lovely to have you with us. So the papers are calling it a day of destiny. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
NOBILO: What is the historical significance of this?
 
SHARON CARPENTER, BROADCAST JOURNALIST: Oh, my goodness, I mean this is a celebration of basically a thousand plus years of history and tradition. It's going to be incredible to see the ceremony take place, obviously the processions are going to be an incredible display of royal pageantry. 
 
But I'm really interested in seeing the ceremony take place, where we are going to see a medieval oath. There is a coronation spoon from the 12th century. There is a coronation chair that is 700 years old that had to go through a restoration process because naughty schoolboys from the 18th and 19th centuries would carve their initials into that chair. 
 
The Stone of Scone or the Stone of Destiny that has come all the way over from Scotland, they say that goes back to Biblical times. An incredible amount of tradition and history here. And of course, King Charles is giving it a bit of a modern-day remix as well. 
 
NOBILO: We are just looking at arrivals right now. We are seeing dignitaries from all over the world, reminding us of the diplomatic importance and power of the celebration and the service today. 
 
Sharon, how effectively do you think, from what we know so far about the coronation service, the monarchy is blending the ancient with the modern?
 
Because you just outlined hundreds of thousands of years of tradition behind today.
 
I'm just going to pause for a moment while the first lady of Ukraine. We are just taking a look at some live pictures right now; sorry for the communication difficulties. 
 
We are seeing the first lady of Ukraine alive, as well as the vice president of China, which has been a controversial invitation in reference to that soft power we were just discussing. It's something which many lawmakers in the U.K. actually disagreed with. 
 
They say he is known as a repressor of Hong Kong, a former British colony. But it underscores that this is an event which is above politics, about projecting Britain on the international stage. 
 
Now, Sharon, back to you, asking this question about, to what extent do you think this coronation is merging the ancient with the modern?
 
I'm here surrounded by broadcasters, people streaming, people posting on their smartphones but the traditions inside are truly ancient. 
 
Have they done a good job to try to bring in the younger demographic?
 
CARPENTER: I think that they are doing the best possible job that they can do. King Charles has made a number of additions to the coronation service, including having women bishops, women clergy as part of this service; having leaders, faith leaders of multiple faiths, to really show British society that I am a king for all of the people. 
 
Just looking at the guests filtering in, as well. I think it is a good representation of what modern-day Britain looks like today. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
CARPENTER: Very different from the brunt of 70 years ago, when the queen was coronated (sic). There's also a gospel choir, which is going to be performing. Diversity is the name of the game, diversity, inclusivity. 
 
And I do think, so far, it looks like they've done a great job and it is resonating. 
 
NOBILO: We've been looking at pictures of the president of Ireland arriving, Michael Higgins; the heads of state from around 100 countries are slowly filtering in to Westminster Abbey. I believe we just caught a glimpse of Prince Andrew on his way as well. 
 
The importance of this event is something which is above politics. It's interesting to note, we just spoke about the Irish president but the first minister designate from Northern Ireland, as well as the heads of the administrations in Scotland and Wales, also both Republicans, they will all be attending today, which is a remarkable combination of individuals which have not been brought together by any other event. 
 
Sharon Carpenter, what are you looking out for most today?
 
CARPENTER: Well, I have to say I am very interested. I live in America myself and, of course, the Americans truly have a love for Harry and Meghan. And I am interested to see; we know that Harry will not be a part of the procession. I am very interested to see if he does make it onto the balcony for that grand finale moment. 
 
It doesn't necessarily look right now as if he will. But I'm holding out hope that, if that was to happen, it will be a step in the right direction, a step toward reconciliation. Certainly, I'm interested to see where Harry is going to be sitting, the interactions he has with his family. 
 
Also, Prince George. Prince George has a formal role in this coronation. He is the youngest future prince to have a role like this in a coronation. Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, has said he is excited about it. 
 
The kids are also a little nervous today. So I am looking forward to see how well George does. I'm sure he's going to do a great job. 
 
NOBILO: You are based in America. 
 
How interested is the world in this coronation?
 
What do you think is drawing them in?
 
CARPENTER: Absolutely. I'm in London right now but I am based in America. There is an incredible amount of interest from the world in the royals. I have to say, in America, a big part of that is because one of their own, Meghan Markle, married into the royal family. 
 
And then, of course, everything that has followed, the scandal, the controversy that has followed. The discussion about race is something that Americans have been very interested in and certainly been behind Meghan to a good extent when it comes to that particular issue. 
 
So, yes, there's a great deal of interest. I know lots of people are going to be watching. There is a big time difference. In L.A., in Los Angeles where I live, it's an eight-hour time difference. But diehard loyalists are going to be up at 3:00 in the morning to watch the coronation. And there are a good number of them. 
 
NOBILO: Sharon Carpenter, do stand by; we will be getting back to you later on in the hour. 
 
But as Sharon brings up, there are some conspicuous absences in the coronation today as well, not to mention the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, is going to remain in California with her children. It is Archie's birthday on the same day today. 
 
Also, dignitaries and heads of state from around the world, Xi Jinping and obviously President Vladimir Putin and other pariah nations who have not been invited and will not be in attendance. Let's go now to Nada Bashir, she's out with well-wishers and people who are camping out through the night, who, I'm sure have their umbrellas up. 
 
It's just started to rain again. But that is not putting a dampener on the celebratory mood surrounding. 
 
BASHIR: Not at all. Everyone seems to be still in high spirits despite the rain which was expected. There are people here who have been camping out for days now, waiting for this day, the coronation, the opportunity to see King Charles pass by in that procession on the way toward Westminster Abbey. 
 <br>[04:40:00] BASHIR: And then return to Buckingham Palace after that coronation ceremony. We've been speaking to lots of people here who have arrived today. We saw hundreds of people filing in in the morning. 
 
And now the procession line from Buckingham Palace is at capacity according to the security teams on the ground. They had been issuing security guidance (INAUDIBLE). 
 
NOBILO: We have first lady Jill Biden arriving inside Westminster Abbey now. This is a hugely significant relationship for the United Kingdom, the oft-called special relationship. 
 
Can't help but notice, as well, the colors which her (INAUDIBLE) are dressed in, blue and yellow, the symbolic colors that people often wear in support of Ukraine. 
 
President Joe Biden not in attendance. It is not convention for U.S. presidents to attend a coronation. In fact, not one has since the U.S. declared its independence. But Joe Biden has been at pains to maintain it is very much not a snub. And Jill Biden is the first member of a president's family to attend a coronation. 
 
Nada, tell us about the mood.
 
BASHIR: I feel like everyone is still in a very great mood. They are all very excited. I was speaking to some who came down today. 
 
Why was it so important for you to come be a part of this today?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were actually both really disappointed that we didn't make it down for the funeral. We saw how moving of an event that was. And we thought this coronation would be a massive celebration of a new United Kingdom. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, and to experience also a part of history. 
 
BASHIR: How do you feel about this being a new era?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think, yes, it's definitely quite exciting. People don't know what to think because no one has known anything else. The queen was such a staple. But I think people talk a lot about the royal family. But I think that they are actually excited to see what's going to change and what is to come. 
 
BASHIR: And it is set to be a long day. There are a couple of hours before we see King Charles. 
 
Are you ready for more fun?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, hopefully.
 
BASHIR: In the rain of course. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, despite the rain, I have to say, it shows how committed people are to being here. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our hats are keeping us nice and dry. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BASHIR: Thank you so much.
 
I have to say, Bianca. The (INAUDIBLE) are of the deterred by the rain. They are ready to see King Charles and Queen Camilla. This is, of course, a moment of history, one that everyone wants to be a part of. 
 
We have seen families with kids of all ages, many of them also camping out for days, now, of course. This is a significant moment. And I think you saw there that many who will remember the huge crowds that have turned out for Queen Elizabeth II after she died. 
 
This is now a moment of celebration and they're welcoming a new era of the British monarchy. 
 
NOBILO: Thank you so much and joining me now. 
 
Joining me now is Sally Bedell Smith, CNN contributor and author of the book, "Elizabeth the Queen." 
 
Right now we've been looking at the pictures of first lady Jill Biden as she is sitting next to the first lady of Ukraine. 
 
What is the significance of today, as far as the world is concerned and concerning diplomatic ties?
 
SALLY BEDELL SMITH, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think it is, on one hand, it is unusual that it is a state occasion as well as a religious occasion. So obviously there will be heads of state from all over the world. 
 
And they are coming to witness this extraordinary series of rituals that really make the monarch into the monarch that he is. He has been the monarch obviously since his mother died. But this is a particular celebration. It is both solemn and serious and joyful. 
 
But because he is, in addition to being the head of state, he is also the supreme governor of the Church of England. What I think is going to be so fascinating today and what will be for many more later a real sort of education in what the British, the unique British constitutional monarchy is all about. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
SMITH: And that will be displayed in the five different stages of the coronation, much of which has been explained. 
 
I've been struck not only by the diversity of what we are seeing here in the congregation but also in the weeks preceding, the way that monarchy has used social media to explain what the meaning is of various pieces of regalia, what is involved in the actual religious observances. 
 
But I think it is going to be completely fascinating. I have in my mind's eye not only the coronation of the queen, which I wrote about, but also the coronation in 1937 of the last king and queen. And it looked vastly different. 
 
There were hundreds and hundreds of robes. There were lots of tiaras. I don't think, as I've been watching people coming in, I don't think I've seen one tiara. I don't know if there's a ban but I think it's just more of a reflection of the 21st century, the involvement of women in various elements of the ceremony. 
 
People from around the world, from Jill Biden and all the other countries, we will be seeing something quite unique in the world. And also there is, of course, the involvement of the Commonwealth, which is singular to the United Kingdom.

NOBILO (voice-over): As 70 years have passed since the last coronation, we have seen changes between the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and today. You've touched on some of them. 
 
But what else should be looking out for as a window into society today and the adjustments that are being made to reflect that?
 
SMITH: I think, first of all, as I mentioned earlier, the role of women; really had no role in 1953 or 1937 because, well, no role other than the fact that the queen was the one who is being crowned. 
 
And the queen in 1937, as Camilla is going to be crowned today. I think what we are seeing is a much different representation of what Britain is right now. This is a 21st century coronation. 
 
So as we look at the congregation, we see people who would not have been there in 1953 or 1937. We see representatives of the king's charities. We see people recognized for their service. 
 
And I think it's going to be fascinating to have a 14-year-old boy greeting the king and the king telling him that he is there to serve and that is going to be a real theme of this coronation, the notion of glad service. 
 
NOBILO: One of the reasons that the world and the United Kingdom still remain fascinated in, if not entirely supportive, of the royal family is the relationships between the members. Obviously, some have come under intense strain in recent months and years. 
 
What family dynamics might be on display today, Sally?
 
SMITH: I think certainly a deference to the king and queen, I don't expect to see -- I'm sure people will be watching very closely to where Prince Harry and Prince Andrew are seated. Neither of them has any kind of a role in the proceeding. They haven't been participating, for example, in any of the rehearsals. 
 
In fact, I know Prince Andrew was out on Wednesday playing golf with a bunch of his friends. So he is certainly is not going to be part of the ceremony. The main event is going to be the anointing, the oath of the king. And the anointing and crowning and the anointing and crowning of the queen. 
 
And Prince William will have a very important role. He is the heir to the throne, and he will, after the king has been around, he will come and he will pay homage to him as his liegeman. This will be a bit different from when Prince Philip did it to the queen. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
SMITH (voice-over): In 1953 there was a sort of almost militaristic, warlike part of it that has been cut out. I think that is basically all we are going to see from anybody in the royal family. 
 
And is going to have a role (INAUDIBLE) we will see what that looks like. But the most important innovation -- and it's been a little bit controversial because of the way it was originally expressed. 
 
But at the time, right after Prince William pays his homage to his father, the king, there will be a call for those who are so moved to join in that homage to the king. 
 
NOBILO (voice-over): The place of the monarchy in society today, Sally, it's often framed as an inexorable march toward lower popularity ratings. Society has changed. Currently Britain is in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. As they say the coronation is streamlined because of that. 
 
Do you think that King Charles still has the capacity to surprise people and get more Brits on the side after today?
 
SMITH (voice-over): I absolutely do. There has never been a person who has had more experience than he has -- enterprises, charities, his interactions with people, all across the political spectrum and socioeconomic spectrum. 
 
He has the legacy of helping people who are disadvantaged, people who are forgotten, small farmers who are struggling to exist. A lot of people realize that. But I think more and more people will recognize that this is what he stands for and that he serves people. I think he will prove to be popular. 
 
Obviously he is not going to have the same long reign as his mother did and he has already announced in his speech right after her death that he was putting aside what he did so often (INAUDIBLE). 
 
He does have a profound interest in healing and bringing people together. That has been demonstrated today, really, by the way he is incorporating people of different faiths. He's the defender of the faith. 
 
But even as his mother said in 2012, that role includes protecting other faiths. That is very much what he is about. I think people will be surprised that he will be in many respects, as his mother was, an abiding force. 
 
But the most important aspect is that he will be representing the nation and not representing one political party or another political party. As the wonderful philosopher Rogers Uten (ph) said, he will be the (INAUDIBLE) of politics.
 
He really understands that at age 74 he has put all the wild dogs and outspoken comments behind him. He is ready, he knows that the role of monarch is more limited, actually, than what he was able to do as the Prince of Wales. 
 
And he has, if not resigned himself, he has reconciled himself to doing that. And within that, I don't think he's going to be silenced. I think he will do everything he can to use his convening power to bring people, opposing people, together and try to find harmony. 
 
NOBILO (voice-over): Sally Bedell Smith, thank you for being with us today. 
 
Isa Soares with us now.
 
You are where the procession will lead from taking King Charles and Queen Camilla to Westminster Abbey where I am. 
 
What can you see at the moment?
 
SOARES (voice-over): Let's take in this moment just outside Buckingham Palace. We see the drape on, it's just majestic as we look there right now. As the guards of honor prepare to mark this occasion, you are looking at live images now. Many people making their way inside. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
SOARES (voice-over): But outside Buckingham Palace what we are seeing is the guard of honor getting in line in front of Queen Victoria's monument, preparing, of course, everything leading up to King Charles getting into his carriage and beginning the procession. 
 
The shots we are seeing behind you, that scene, the drapery outside the abbey has been there for some time. That's because the heavens have opened. It's not dampening spirits, as I'm sure you've heard. 
 
People brought raincoats, umbrellas, some brought swimsuits, preparing for any sort of occasion depending on what the weather will entail. 
 
On the left of your screen, if you are looking, is the guard of honor. This is made up of the Navy, the Army, the RAF, nine officers and 159 ranks that will be in front of Buckingham Palace for this memorable and historic occasion. 
 
This one will start to see the king, about 20 past the hour, in 25 minutes or so getting into his carriage. The diamond jubilee carriage, of course. This is the one you I have spoken about. We will see the diamond jubilee state coach making its way, probably in the next minute or so, in the quadrangle inside Westminster Palace. 
 
Everyone gets in line for this procession, 1.3 miles inside this jubilee state coach. It is air conditioned, it has hydraulic suspension. It weighs three tons, in fact. So still quite heavy. Nothing like the gold state coach. But it was built back in 2012 in Australia to mark 60 years of Queen Elizabeth's reign. We are seeing at the moment, if you're looking at these live pictures, all the troops getting ready for the moment we've all been waiting for, the beginning of King Charles and Queen Camilla leaving Buckingham Palace and start making their way inside the abbey. 
 
We are seeing on your screen right now the Household Cavalry. They're going to be leading the king's procession. 
 
And I'm sure you have heard of this day of spectacular pageantry we've been seeing for the past few hours. This is what people are lining up for, many of them camping out for days for not just to get a glimpse of the king but for this moment, a moment in history. 
 
It will be a slimmed down ceremony but so many elements of tradition and history that we are witnessing right now. People prepared to brave any sort of weather. And, of course, for King Charles, he is the head of the armed forces. There's a special connection to so many. 
 
We saw many arriving in the early hours of this morning. You see the blues and royals. Next you have the lifeguards, the next two divisions the procession just behind. What you are seeing is them getting ready in front of Queen Victoria's monument. 
 
I've never seen it so beautiful, so vibrant, for that moment when we will see King Charles leave Buckingham Palace alongside Queen Camilla, making their way to Westminster Abbey. 
 
NOBILO: Isa Soares, thank you so much. 
 
I'm sitting outside Westminster Abbey, where the rain is drizzling, the pavements are wet, it's quite chilly but that is not putting a dampener on any of those lining the path today getting ready to give their well wishes to King Charles III. 
 
The atmosphere here is one of expecting anticipation but the preparations have been so well-planned that it truly feels like a calm before the storm. It is very quiet. You sense that something is about to happen but not quite yet. 
 
And that is what we are waiting for. We have seen dignitaries enter Westminster Abbey. We've seen celebrities, national figures like British broadcasters we've seen Katy Perry who will be performing at the coronation concert. 
 
We've seen first lady Jill Biden with her granddaughter, next to Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska. We've seen the vice president of China, a controversial invitation. He also has taken his seat in the abbey as well as leaders from all nations in the United Kingdom and, of course, the Commonwealth. 
 
This is a truly historic and unprecedented gathering of individuals, kings and queens, who don't usually attend the coronation of another king.</pre>
