JOHN VAUSE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. John Vause. Ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM --
 <br>[00:00:29]
 
Russia launches ways of drone and missile strikes again targeting Ukraine's power grid and other infrastructure. Most. but not all, was shuts down.
 
One of the deadliest days in the West Bank in decades. Ten Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and fears are growing of an escalation in violence. 
 
And Memphis waits. As authorities to release video of a traffic-stop confrontation, which left one driver dead and five now former policemen charged with second-degree murder.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with John Vause. 
 
VAUSE: A wave of drone attacks followed by missile strikes targeted Ukraine's power grid has left at least 11 people dead, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calling for increased air defenses and more military assistance. 
 
Ukrainian officials say all the Iranian-made drones were intercepted; and most, but not all, of the missiles were also intercepted. But that meant dozens of buildings and power facilities still took heavy damage. 
 
The Russian airstrikes came hours after Western allies agreed to send their main battle tanks to Ukraine. In response, the Kremlin accused the West of direct involvement now in the war. But the Ukrainian president said increased firepower is the only way to stop the Russian attacks.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This evil, this Russian aggression, it can and should be stopped, only with adequate (ph) weapons. The terrorist (ph) state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield, weapons that protect our skies. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: And in Eastern Ukraine, reports a Russian ground offensive is ramping up with intense fighting across parts of the Donetsk region. Intense clashes have been reported around the city of Bakhmut, where Russian forces have been trying to break Ukrainian defensive lines for months. 
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports now, not far from Bakhmut.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine's tanks taking aim at the invading Russians. Kyiv's forces rallying to try to halt the massive assault on Bakhmut. 
 
This city, where there are still some 6,000 civilians, has become a cauldron of fire. 
 
PLEITGEN: From this vantage point, you can see and hear just how fierce the fighting is. You can hear impacts from heavy weapons, not just every minute, but literally every second. 
 
The Ukrainians say the Russians are pouring a massive amount of personnel and weapons into this area, because they seem to want to take Bakhmut at nearly any cost. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): There are plenty of regular Russian troops fighting around Bakhmut now. But the Ukrainians say it's still the Wagner private military company that's leading the charge. 
 
With waves of fighters trying to storm Ukrainian positions both North and South of the city, as well as specialized forces like these snipers, claiming to have killed a Ukrainian soldier. 
 
"All I could see was a curtained window," the sniper says. "The person who was paired with me saw a thermal outline, and I just determined where to shoot." 
 
Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, often touts his militia's successes, but the cost is immense. This is a Wagner cemetery in the Krasnodar region of Southern Russia. Row after row of fresh graves, a disposable force used to take just a few kilometers of land. 
 
Wagner acknowledges recruiting prisoners straight out of jail and throwing them on the battlefield with minimal training and only slim chances of survival. 
 
That same indifference shown in Russian strikes that kill and maim Ukrainian civilians every day. 
 
These folks are cleaning up after a Russian missile landed in their neighborhood near Bakhmut. 
 
"We were getting heating from the heating plant which was hit," Yuri (ph) tells me. "Yesterday at 3 p.m., it was destroyed, so now we have no electricity, no heating. We have nothing." 
 
And a few miles away, one person was killed in another densely- populated area. 
 
PLEITGEN: Some of the long-distance drones and missiles that Russia uses to attack Ukraine come down right near civilian areas. This here is only a few yards away from a kindergarten. 
 
However, others are used to directly target critical infrastructure. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): More than 50 missiles fired just on Thursday. And while many of them were intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, some were not brought down, adding to the daily toll of destruction. 
 
The missile terror, more motivation for Ukraine's soldiers around Bakhmut to stand their ground and bring Vladimir Putin's invasion to a standstill.

Fred Pleitgen, CNN, near Bakhmut, Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: Live to Washington now. We're joined by CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force colonel Cedric Leighton. 
 
Colonel, good to see you.
 
COL. CEDRICK LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Good to see you too, John. 
 
VAUSE: So just quickly, explain this Russian obsession with Bakhmut. If it does fall to the Russians, what do they win? 
 
LEIGHTON: They win -- rights in their view. What they're winning, John, is the idea that they can succeed at something. And that's really the main reason to capture Bakhmut. There is a highway that goes through the area near Bakhmut. 
 
But strategically, it has minimal value, compared to other places that they could be going after. 
 
VAUSE: OK. Good explanation. That explains some -- that doesn't really explain the high cost of life, though, the amount of blood and materiel which has been put into this fight. 
 
But, you know, the German defense minister has insisted on Thursday that now this decision to send tanks -- the reason why it took so long is not because of any hesitation, but it was all about negotiations among allies. 
 
And the other two tanks will be delivered to Ukraine before that spring offensive by Russian forces. Here he is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Minister, can you get the tanks to Ukraine in time? 
 
BORIS PISTORIUS, GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER: Of course we will.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How long will it take to get there? 
 
PISTORIUS: At the end of the first quarter of the year. That's what we are going to do. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How many months? Two, three, four? 
 
PISTORIUS: I just said. At the end of March, I think. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: The Ukrainians spring is, what, 37 days away? The end of March is ten weeks away. Do you agree with the German defense minister there's enough time for adequate training on the Leopard 2? There's also enough time for the tanks to get to the front lines? 
 
LEIGHTON: I'm a bit skeptical, to be honest with you, John. I think that it would be great if the Ukrainians could hold off the Russians in the meantime. But it's going to be very critical. 
 
This is going to have to work like a Swiss swatch. Because it's going to have to move the training pipeline, the logistics pipeline; and, of course, the actual tanks themselves are going to have to be in place in Ukraine, where they do the most good. And that is a real tall order to meet within ten weeks or less. 
 
VAUSE: The situation now with Bakhmut, with the Russians, essentially, you know, just spilling lives and blood for these, as you say, bragging rights, for taking Bakhmut.
 
But overall, are they now in a position to bring forward this anticipated offensive? Can they go on the front flip before those Western meetings actually reach the Eastern part of Ukraine? 
 
LEIGHTON: It depends on how much they really have in place. So, they're not quite ready, in my assessment, to do that. But it won't take them, you know, ten weeks. It will perhaps take them three, four, maybe five weeks to get a large proportion of their force into place. 
 
Now, that force may not be very well-trained. So this offensive may be a dud. But it could certainly be something that they could use to get attention. 
 
And, of course, the other part is that they have to have their own tanks there, their own offensive vehicles. And those, of course, are fairly vulnerable to attack from the Ukrainians. 
 
VAUSE: And the Ukrainians, they've reupped this almost, what, a year- old request for fighter jets. And you may recall, initially they wanted MiGs from the former Soviet republics. 
 
Now they're talking about F-16s. So, how much more likely are they now to get the fighter jets, compared to about a year ago? 
 
LEIGHTON: Certainly, a bit more likely than they were then. However, there is a training pipeline that is required for a fighter jet. You can't just go from a MiG 29, which the Ukrainians have, into an F-16 and expect to be able to fly it that quickly. 
 
So, there are several months, usually up to a year, of -- that's required. So, if this training hasn't been done in secret, it's high time that it gets started now, if any F-16s or anything like an F-16 is going to make it into the Ukrainians skies. 
 
VAUSE: And just reach (ph) up on the tanks. The Russians could have anywhere North of 10,000 tanks. Or so we're told. Most of the Soviet era. 
 
But they also have a few newer, high-tech tanks, like the T-14 Armata, which Pamela? Which is when first revealed, the British ministry of defense wrote in an internal briefing, which was obtained by "The Telegraph," "Without hyperbole, Armata represents the most revolutionary step change in tank design in the last half century." 
 
But the reality is the T-14 has been plagued with a lot of problems. It comes nowhere close to the early hype. And Russian troops in Ukraine, according, again, to British military intelligence, have refused to accept the T-14, because they're in such poor condition. 
 
The story of the Armata seems to be kind of the story of Russia's military modernization, writ large. 
 
LEIGHTON: It does. And you know, you go from the T-14 Armata, all the way to the doctrine itself, the Gerasimov doctrine. You know, a lot of this stuff is the stuff of paper tigers. 
 
And that is a very dangerous position for the Russians to be in, because what they're doing by using these types of weapons and them not being able to use these types of weapons, this doctrine, being able to use this doctrine, is really exposing a lot of their own weaknesses. And that is a very serious problem for them.
 <br>[00:10:12] 
 
And of course, the Ukrainians can exploit those weaknesses in fairly good order. 
 
VAUSE: Yes. Colonel, good to see you. Thanks for being with us. 
 
LEIGHTON: You bet, John. Any time. 
 
VAUSE: Thank you. 
 
The city of Memphis, Tennessee, is expected to release graphic video on Friday, showing the violent encounter between police and 29-year- old Tyre Nichols on January 7. 
 
Nichols died of his injuries three days later. Now, all five fired officers have been charged with second-degree murder, as well as other serious offenses. 
 
CNN's Sara Sidner has the latest now from Memphis. And a warning: some images in her report may be disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Memphis, candles burned for a life snuffed out, the life of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols, being remembered, where friends say he felt the most free, a skate park. 
 
Twelve years ago, Nichols seen here doing what he loved. Twelve years later, he ended up dead, officials say, beaten by five men sworn to protect and serve. 
 
STEVE MULROY, SHELBY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: The grand jury returned indictments against all five with the same charges. 
 
While each of the five individuals played a different role in the incident in question, the actions of all of them resulted in the death of Tyre Nichols. And they are all responsible. 
 
SIDNER (voice-over): Justin Smith, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills, and Emmitt Martin III were all fired from the Memphis Police Department and now stand charged with seven crimes: second- degree murder, two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct, and official oppression. 
 
And there is police body cam and sky camera video showing it all. Something police will soon release to the public.
 
DAVID RAUSCH, DIRECTOR, TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: I'm grieved (ph). Frankly, I'm shocked. I'm sickened by what I saw. 
 
What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. This was wrong. This was criminal. 
 
SIDNER (voice-over): Attorneys for two of the former officers responded to the TBI's damning statement. 
 
SIDNER: When you heard that, what did you think? And have your clients heard all of the charges against them? 
 
WILLIAM MASSEY, ATTORNEY FOR EMMITT MARTIN III: I thought, I wish I'd seen that video so I could evaluate what he said. 
 
BLAKE BALLIN, ATTORNEY FOR DESMOND MILLS: To say things like that when you have a tinderbox that we're all concerned about, I have questions about whether those were the right words to use, whether this was the right timing, and whether the government should be saying those things about people who are innocent until proven guilty when you know that's going to be broadcast to potential jurors. 
 
SIDNER (voice-over): But Nichols's family wants people to know more about Tyre Nichols than how he died. RAVAUGHN WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS'S MOTHER: Nobody is perfect. OK? Nobody.
 
 But he was damn near. My son was a beautiful soul. And he touched everyone. 
 
SIDNER (voice-over): Nichols had his mama's name tattooed on his arm. He wasn't just her beautiful boy. He was also a father, who loved having fun. 
 
His friend, who knew him in Sacramento, told a local newspaper, "He had such a free spirit and skating gave him his wings." 
 
He worked at FedEx but had other dreams: photography. In his own words, he posted, "People have a story to tell. Why not capture it? Instead of doing the norm and writing it down, and speaking it." 
 
It turns out, what led to his death was captured on camera. 
 
SIDNER: Bail has been set for the officers as high as $350,000. Some of them have already bailed out of jail.

VAUSE: When we come back, Haiti's capital is in turmoil after a day of violent protests. But this time, some police are among the protesters. Dramatic video just ahead. 
 
And one of the deadliest days in the West Bank in decades. Ten Palestinians killed by Israeli forces, and fears are growing the violence could escalate. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:16:20]
 
VAUSE: Israeli airstrikes have targeted an underground rocket manufacturing site in Gaza, which the Israelis say was operated by Hamas. This is part of a series of cross-border strikes after what became the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in more than a year. 
 
Earlier, sirens blared in Ashkelon. Israel said several rockets were fired from Gaza. At least one was intercepted. 
 
That's after Israeli forces launched a deadly raid of a Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. The Palestinian health ministry says nine Palestinians were killed there, including a woman in her 60s, and several others were wounded. A tenth Palestinian was killed hours later in what Israeli police called a violent disturbance. 
 
Israeli border police released helmet video from the raid. An IDF spokesperson told CNN the military was responding to intelligence about an imminent attack and moved into apprehend a terrorist squad belonging to the Islamic Jihad organization. 
 
Israeli forces say they came under heavy fire when they arrived at the targeted building and returned fire. 
 
Thousands of Palestinians marched in Jenin during funerals for those killed. The Palestinian Authority has since announced it will halt all security cooperation with Israel. 
 
Live now to Jerusalem and Yaakov Katz, editor in chief of "The Jerusalem Post." Thanks for being with us. 
 
YAAKOV KATZ, EDITOR IN CHIEF, "THE JERUSALEM POST": Hi. 
 
VAUSE: Hi. So, start with the Palestinian Authority. Nabil Abu Rudineh made the announcement that security cooperation with Israel will be put on hold. Here he is. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NABIL ABU RUDINEH, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The life of the continuous hostilities on the front of our people, and the complete disregard to the signed agreements, including the security agreements, we consider the security coordination with the government of occupied Israel as non- existent, starting now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VAUSE: It's not the first time Palestinians have played this card. They did in 2020. They did in 2017. Explain how this move seems to always end up hurting the Palestinian, and in the past, security cooperation has resumed within a fairly short period of time. 
 
KATZ: Well, I think the reason the security coordination ultimately comes back together and doesn't completely fall apart is because it is in the interests of both sides, John. Right? 
 
The fact is that both Israel and the Palestinian Authority benefit from working together to stop terrorist actions that are operating in the West Bank. 
 
Israel, for the obvious reasons: it doesn't want terrorist attacks inside its towns and inside its borders. But also, the Palestinian Authority, which is still controlled by the president, Mahmoud Abbas. 
 
Fears that these terrorist groups will undermine his rule, will undermine the stability in the West Bank in the areas that are controlled by the Palestinian Authority.
 
And therefore, working together with Israel and cracking down on these terrorist factions is what helps keep him in power, keeps his institutions intact. 
 
VAUSE: Well, the Israeli minister for national security and very senior member of the coalition, Ben Gvir, made a point of publicly thanking security forces who were involved in that deadly raid in Jenin. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ITAMAR BEN GVIR, ISRAELI NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER (through translator): I want to congratulate anti-terrorism forces, the Israeli army, Shibath (ph), who last night fulfilled a successful operation, and we give support to our combat soldiers in the war against terrorists, against the militants. Every policeman, every combat soldier, every soldier should know that they have full support of Israel's government, from the ministry of national security from the chief of police. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: And Israel's Channel 13 reporting the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Itamar Ben Gvir clashed at a special security discussion held on Thursday, regarding the question of whether to allow a march by right-wing activists at the Damascus Gate in light of fears of a potential security escalation." 
 <br>[00:20:08]
 
What is different here? Unlike previous Israeli governments, this far -- this new far-right coalition, it does not seem too concerned about increasing tensions with the Palestinians. 
 
So does that elevate concerns elsewhere about an escalation in the violence overall? 
 
KATZ: Well, I mean, look -- we saw what happened, right? There was an Israeli operation to crack down on the terrorist cell that was operating in Jenin and to prevent a terrorist attack. That's what happened yesterday. 
 
And then overnight, automatically, there's linkage. Overnight, there are rockets that are being fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel. Israel then responds to those rockets in the Gaza Strip. 
 
So, you see a link between everything. And it can create a cycle that can quickly snowball and -- and fall out of control and spiral into something that's a far greater escalation. We've seen that happen in the past and you and I have spoken about this. 
 
So, I think that what we're -- what we're looking at now is definitely -- there are some characters in the government who might be a little less hesitant -- let's say that -- to lead towards something of a greater tension or tenuous atmosphere. 
 
But I would say that Prime Minister Netanyahu has always been very cautious, very hesitant. He's not one that jumps into a military adventure. And he still is in control. He is the prime minister. 
 
So, I wouldn't be overly concerned that even someone like Itamar Ben Gvir, who comes from the far right, has a constituency that he wants to pay lip service to, that he is going to be the one who's going to be controlling what's happening. 
 
VAUSE: OK. Well, for the past few weeks, we've seen these protests across Israel. They've gathered in many cities. The biggest so far was in Tel Aviv last Saturday. More than 100,000 demonstrating -- the government plans to weaken the authority of the supreme court. 
 
Among them was the former prime minister, now leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YAIR LAPID, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): People who love the country have come here today to defend its democracy, to defends its courts, to defend the idea of coexistence and of common good. 
 
There are people here who love Israel, who came to demonstrate for a democratic Jewish state, according to the values of the declaration of independence. And we will not give up until we win. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: You know, this right-wing religious coalition, it's been in power for less than a month. And it has a good, steady majority. So, it could be there for some time. 
 
And it's locked in the standoff with the supreme court, and it's being accused of endangering democracy. So, where does this all go from here? Because it seems unlikely that there will be another election anytime soon, right? 
 
KATZ: Look, this is a government that is 100 percent determined and bent on changing the state of Israel. They are looking to institute a set of judicial reforms that, like you mentioned, would weaken the supreme court, but also have the potential to change the democratic character of the state of Israel. 
 
And the balance of separation of powers that we have between the legislator, the executive branch, and of course, the judicial branch.
 
So this is something that's of great concern for a lot of Israel. There's a standoff right now. Netanyahu and his government are looking to steamroll ahead with these reforms, with ignoring the opposition. 
 
The opposition is also saying, we're not willing to accept any this. 
 
I think that ultimately, where we're at, is people are trying to find a way to reach some sort of compromise that gives the coalition what they're looking for, but also tries to ease many of the concerns among the public. 
 
But you're right. This is a government that came into power. They got their 64-majority coalition. They have the ability to make some significant changes to Israel. And they're very ideologically driven. Right? 
 
That's in contrast to, maybe, some past governments. There are members of this coalition, one of them you mentioned before, Itamar Ben Gvir. But there are others -- Bezalel Smotrich (ph) and other people who are really looking to make a significant change to the state of Israel. I have to say, they were democratically elected. There was an
 
 election, our fifth. There is now a stable government that's in place. Does that mean that they should be able to do whatever they want? Of course not. But they do have the -- the power right now and the authority and the majority to move ahead. 
 
VAUSE: So you're say they essentially say they have a mandate to do what they're doing.
 
KATZ: Look, they got the mandate from the people. They received the votes. They have the majority in the coalition. They're able to push through these reforms and the bills that will be needed to institute, to implement them in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. 
 
VAUSE: Yes.
 
KATZ: But, you know, just because you have the majority doesn't mean that that is the definition of democracy. Democracy also is the preservation of human rights, of minority rights, ensuring that you still have a strong judiciary, ensuring that you have a strong rule of law and institutions and freedom of the press and the media, and speech. 
 
And there's many other aspects to this. It's not just the tyranny of the majority. 
 
So, I think that this is something that's going to continue with us for a while. But I also think, you know, to be honest, is that it shows the vibrancy of Israel's democracy, the fact that over 100,000 people can take to the streets and can protest about something that this government is doing.
 <br>[00:25:14] 
 
When I look around this region, John, and I see other countries, I know that in those countries, you can't do that. You can't speak up freely. You can't say what you want. 
 
VAUSE: It's a good point to finish on, Yaakov, so thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it. 
 
KATZ: Thank you. 
 
VAUSE: Well, the biggest ever joint U.S.-Israeli military drills were held this week. Politically, though, the White House has concerns about the far-right ultra-nationalist coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
In this exclusive report, CNN's Hadas Gold found out what's motivating both countries now to quickly assemble such massive military exercises.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): CNN granted exclusive access to the danger zone on the super carrier USS George H.W. Bush, to see part of the largest ever American and Israeli joint military exercise, covering all aspects of warfare, from the air, on land, to the sea, online and even in space.
 
The timing is no accident: meant to send a clear signal to Iran and other adversaries in the region that, despite the attention on Ukraine and U.S. concerns over the new right-wing Israeli government, the Americans remain deeply aligned and committed to a military partnership with Israel. 
 
GOLD: For the Americans and the Israelis, these types of exercises are a show of force, a show of partnership, and a way for the both of them to show the world that they can walk and chew gum at the same time. 
 
GEN. MICHAEL KURILLA, COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: Only through a firm commitment to this partnership are we able to plan and organize such an incredibly complex, high-end operation, with so many elements across such a large geographic area against all aspects of war fighting. Some of which are seen, some of which are not. 
 
GOLD (voice-over): For the Israelis, the exercise is crucial. They've long opposed a return to the Iranian nuclear deal and have argued that a credible military threat needs to be on the table to deter Iran from fully developing a nuclear weapon. 
 
LT. GEN. HEZI HALEVI, ISRAEL DEFENSE CHIEF OFF STAFF: Israel and the U.S. s hare the same values. The IDF and the U.S. CentCom see eye to eye the threats on this area. 
 
GOLD: More than 6,400 American personnel joined 1,100 Israelis as part of these exercises that utilized more than 142 aircraft, including these F-18s. 
 
GOLD (voice-over): And while the Israelis and Americans regularly carry out joint exercises, this one shifted the focus more on the offensive rather than just defensive capabilities. 
 
It also came together in just two months, incredibly quickly, especially for something of this scale, compared to the typical year or so of planning. 
 
While officials shy away from drawing a direct connection between the speed and recent events in Iran, and the breakdown last year of negotiations over the nuclear deal, it is hard to ignore the context. 
 
COL. JOE BUCCINO, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND SPOKESPERSON: I think it's fairly clear that we can very quickly move assets in the region to respond to crises. And we can do so alongside our partners. 
 
And we can fight and conduct offensive operations in every domain alongside our partners. 
 
GOLD (voice-over): The military option, which President Biden called the last resort to deal with Iran, seems to be on loud display.

VAUSE: Still ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM, detained over a documentary. India detained students who had gathered to watch a film about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Why?

 <br>[00:31:07]
 
VAUSE: Welcome back. I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Haiti's capital is reeling from violent protests, many left outraged by a string of recent police killings. Protesters, including some police officers, attacked the country's main airport and the prime minister's residence at Port-au-Prince on Wednesday. At least 10 police officers have been killed in armed gang -- by armed gangs, rather, over the past week.
 
Reuters reports the prime minister was flying back from Argentina, was able to leave the airport for a short time before returning to his home.
 
India has banned a BBC documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and now is taking action against students who tried to watch the film.
 
CNN's Anna Coren tells us how the government is cracking down on what it describes as propaganda.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Police in India have detained at least a dozen university students over attempts to screen a banned BBC documentary critical of the country's prime minister, Narendra Modi.
 
COREN (voice-over): The two-part documentary, "India: The Modi Question," looks at Modi's alleged role into the deadly 2002 Gujarat riots that claimed more than 1,000 lives, mostly Muslim, when he was the state's chief minister.
 
Last week, the government blocked the documentary from airing in India after it enforced emergency powers under the country's new Information and Technology Act that allows it to suppress any information that appears online.
 
Both YouTube and Twitter have complied with the order.
 
The government has called the documentary a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative.
 
The BBC responded, stating the documentary was, quote, "rigorously researched according to the highest editorial standards."
 
Students at two prominent universities in New Delhi this week tried to screen the documentary but were faced with power cuts and an Internet shut-down, according to student leaders. Police then detained 13 students, saying they needed to ensure peace in the area.
 
SANAM HUSSAIN, STUDENT (through translator): Stopping the screening of the film and then attacking the students in such a manner, this is a complete violation of all kinds of, you know, democratic, fundamental rights of every citizen of this country.
 
COREN: Critics of the ban have expressed dismay at what they view as censorship by the Indian government. The Committee to Protect Journalists also weighed in, saying this was an attack on the free press that flagrantly contradicts the country's stated commitment to democratic ideals.
 
The BBC documentary explores an unpublished British government report that reveals the violence in Gujarat back in 2002       had all the hallmarks of an ethnic cleansing, claiming there was widespread and systemic rape of Muslim women.
 
Modi has denied accusations that he failed to stop the violence, and in 2012, the Supreme Court appointed a special investigation team; found there was no evidence to suggest Modi was to blame.

VAUSE: The crash of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 killed 346 people from all around the world. 
 
Both planes were faulty 737 Max jets from Boeing. And so far, no one from Boeing has been held responsible.
 
Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro is awaiting trial at a maximum- security prion in Italy after his arrest from being elder-run for decades. But there are questions now about how he was able to live in relative freedom, despite being one of Europe's most wanted men.
 
Barbie Nadeau has more.

BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Infamous Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro's arrest has taken Italy by storm.
 
Every detail of his life in hiding for the last 30 years, scrutinized to the Nth degree. He may have been hiding from the law, but he certainly wasn't hidden away.
 
Moments before his arrest on January 16, Messina Denaro can be seen in police video, walking freely and alone into a private healthcare clinic in Palermo.
 
Raids of three of the 60-year-old's hideouts have turned up a collection of high-end sunglasses and other luxury goods.
 
Journalist Roberto Saviano has been living under police protection since 2006, when he wrote his book about the Maria, "Gomorrah."
 
Authorities say they also found a collection of movie memorabilia, including posters from "The Joker" and "The Godfather."
 
Saviano tells us that the "Godfather" movie is fundamental in the formation of mafiosi. They see themselves in the portrayals of the inner conflicts. They live the same realities.
 
But he also knows that the fact that Messino Denaro wasn't handcuffed after his arrest sends a message.
 
"The Carabinieri want to show the boss is totally collaborative," he tells us.
 
Messino Denaro chose not to attend his first court date last week, which is his right under Italian law. His next court date is March 9, for the deadly bombings of two anti-Mafia judges in Sicily in 1992.
 
Prior to his arrest, the last time Messino Denaro was thought to have been seen in public was in 1993. But it's becoming clear that he led an open life in a small town in Sicily, where some of his alleged hideouts were found. And that the omerta, the code of silence that protects mafiosi, also protected him.

VAUSE: Ukraine's ambassador to Australia wants an apology from Novak Djokovic. On Wednesday, Djokovic's father took part in a pro-Russia rally outside the Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open in Melbourne. He's standing next to a man holding a Russian flag, with Putin's face on it, wearing a T-shirt with the "Z" symbol, symbolizing support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
 
The ambassador says it's provocation. He wants Djokovic to state his position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
 
And the children shall lead the way. Talented musical children, that is, who might just be thawing some more Cold War-era frosty relations between the United States and Cuba.
 
Cultural exchange programs that were once halted by the United States are being reinstated. Our man in Havana is Patrick Oppmann.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's not the kind of music you typically hear in Cuba. But then, this is not a typical group of musicians either.
 
For a week in January, four college-age U.S. musicians and their teachers travel from freezing Minneapolis to sunny Havana to try their hand at cultural diplomacy.
 
Exchanges like this are just restarting after the pandemic all but closed Cuba to the world and the Trump administration once again made it harder for Americans to travel to the communist-run island.
 
While tourism remains off-limits for U.S. citizens, in 2022, the Biden administration eased some restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba. These Americans brought musical instruments to donate and say they're coming away with a respect for Cuban musicians' ability to overcome adversity.
 
RENA KRAUT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CUBAN AMERICAN YOUTH ORCHESTRA: There's something inspiring about how the lack of the best instrument in the world does not stop anyone from working and putting out the most beautiful musicianship.
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): For hours each day, musicians from the two countries practice together, carry out workshops, and perform in local schools. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) On tempo.
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): Their budding collaboration is overseen by renowned Cuban conductor Daiana Garcia.
 
DAIANA GARCIA, CUBAN ORCHESTRA DIRECTOR: That's more difficult, you know.
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): "I think the greatest benefit is spiritual," she says. "How a culture that's apparently so different can have the same interests, the same dreams."
 
Organizers say they're planning on bringing the Cuban students taking part in the exchange to Minneapolis in the spring so they can show their skills to a new audience. 
 
GARCIA: We have the passion, the emotion, the feelings and the music inside of our blood.
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): At the end of their time in Cuba, the American musicians and their Cuban counterparts play a show at the house of the head of the U.S. embassy in Havana.
 
This kind of exchange isn't about solving the long-running problems between the two countries' governments, the musicians say. 
 
ROAN FLOER-MARTINEZ, U.S. MUSICIAN: Whatever you might think about, you know, the respective governments of any two countries, it's not about the government. It's about the people. And it's about getting to know them, getting to connect with them. 
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): And when there is that connection, beautiful music is sure to follow.
