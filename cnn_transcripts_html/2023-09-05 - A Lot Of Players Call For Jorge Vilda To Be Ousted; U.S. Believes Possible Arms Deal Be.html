ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello everyone, I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is One World. We want to begin with a major development in 
 
 Spanish football. Just weeks after winning Women's World Cup title, the head coach of the Spanish team has been fired. The head coach of the 
 
 Spanish team has been fired. 
 
Jorge Vilda has certainly been a controversial figure in Spanish football for quite some time, with a lot of players calling for him to be ousted. 
 
 He's also been one of the fiercest allies of embattled Football Federation Chief Luis Rubiales, who has, of course, faced worldwide criticism for that 
 
 unwanted kiss on the lips that he gave Jennifer Hermoso during the World Cup championship celebration. 
 
Let's get right to it. CNN World Sports' Patrick Snell for the latest on all of this. So, you know, there were a few complaints about this 
 
 particular coach even before the Women's World Cup tournament. He certainly was a controversial figure. And then on top of that, during that defiant 
 
 speech that Luis Rubiales gave, he actually applauded and stood by Rubiales. So, a lot of people were angry at him for that. But just give us 
 
 more context in terms of this move to fire him. What more do we know at this point, Patrick? 
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, thank you, Zain. This is a highly significant development. And you're quite right. He was applauding 
 
 Rubiales. But he did later come out and say that he would regret. I beg your pardon, that he would condemn the actions and the behavior of 
 
 Rubiales. So, he did make that point, but I think there was initial regret on his part. 
 
But as I say, a highly significant development indeed. Jorge Vilda, he is considered a close ally of Rubiales. There's no question about that. I 
 
 don't think anyone would doubt that at all. He was the manager. This is important for context here. He was the manager who led Spain -- Spain's 
 
 women's national team to their first ever Women's World Cup title in Australia when they beat England's Lionesses in Sydney. 
 
Despite Spain's success, you're absolutely right, Zain, the build up to this World Cup, very, very problematic indeed. Vilda had been in charge of 
 
 the Spanish national women's team since 2015, but there'd been all kinds of unrest in the camp. 
 
Remember Las Quince, the 15 players after their defeat in the quarterfinals of the Euros to England last year -- the 15 players. Las Quince coming out 
 
 and basically saying they would not play for the Spanish national team again until all kinds of differences with the Spanish Football Federation 
 
 were resolved and of course the manager himself Jorge Vilda. Twelve of the 15 did not play in the Women's World Cup, only three would go on to take 
 
 part in the triumph.
 
I do want to get to a statement now because we just got this statement into us from a short while ago, this is a statement from Spain's Football 
 
 Federation on Vilda's departure. It reads like this, in part, "The federation appreciates his work at the head of the national team as the 
 
 maximum sporting figure of the women's national teams, as well as the successes reaped during his term, crowned with the recent achievement of 
 
 the World Cup." So, that statement just into us a short while ago from the Spanish Football Federation. 
 
Meantime, let's get to some video, powerful video. Hundreds of demonstrators gathering in Barcelona on Monday to show their support for 
 
 Jenny Hermoso as the outrage at the country's suspended Federation Chief Rubiales continues the Spanish Court of Arbitration for Sport agreeing to 
 
 open a case against Rubiales but rejected the government's argument that his offenses were quote very serious, preventing his immediate suspension, 
 
 forcing ministers, as well, to ask the Tribunal to do it, instead.
 
And earlier on Monday before that rally, Zain, the Spanish men's team coming out criticizing Rubiales for what they called "unacceptable 
 
 behavior" after the kiss on Hermoso which he says was consensual, she says it was Alvaro Morata, one of the four joint captains of La Seleccion Roja 
 
 was speaking ahead of the country's European qualify against Georgia. He said they regret the ongoing saga has overshadowed the success of the 
 
 women's team. Let's hear from him now. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVARO MORATA, SPAIN CO-CAPTAIN: We would like to express our regret and solidarity with the players who have seen their success tarnished. We want 
 
 to reject what we consider to be unacceptable behavior on the part of Mr. Rubiales, who has not lived up to the institution he represents. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
We stand firmly and clearly on the side of the values that sport represents. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL: So, I said at the top, Zain, that Vildas, a close ally of Rubiales, what now? What is next for Rubiales? Other developments today, the Spanish 
 
 Football Federation issuing an apology now for Rubiales, is what it called inappropriate conduct at the Women's World Cup Final. That apology, not 
 
 just to the sport of football, Zain, but to society at large, society as a whole. Just to remind our viewers once again now, all eyes on Rubiales. 
 
 He's currently suspended by the football governing body FIFA and is still refusing to resign. It's fast moving, that's the latest for you. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, and in the meantime, the Spanish women's team are saying, look, we're not gonna play under this man at all, and he's refusing to step 
 
 down. So, the big question is what happens next? 
 
SNELL: And a whole bunch of coaches have done, as well. So, you know, watch this space very carefully. Right, fast moving, Patrick Snell, live for us 
 
 there. Thank you so much. And, actually, we're going to be talking a little bit more about this later on in the show, as well. 
 
All right. Russia needs weapons and ammunition for its war in Ukraine, and North Korea has them. And now the U.S. believes North Korean leader Kim 
 
 Jong-un and Russian leader Vladimir Putin are hashing out an arms deal, and that Kim may be traveling to Russia to meet President Putin for further 
 
 negotiations. 
 
"The New York Times" reports the meeting could happen at next week's Eastern Economic Forum in Russia. Here's what's worrying the West. In 
 
 exchange for weapons, Russia could provide Pyongyang with technology to advance its satellite capabilities among other things. Paula Hancocks has 
 
 the very latest from Seoul. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The first and last meeting between the current leaders of Russia and North Korea was more than four 
 
 years ago. Since then, Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and his military efforts are faltering. So, for Kim Jong-un, the power dynamics 
 
 have changed. 
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: A large power is now dependent on him. That hasn't happened in a while. The second thing he gains is the possibility of 
 
 access to more oil. At the moment that Kim Jong-un is testing his ballistic missiles, particularly the long-range ones, many of which have design 
 
 commonalities with Russian missiles, he can get a lot of help there. 
 
HANCOCKS: U.S. officials believe Moscow could receive multiple types of munitions from Pyongyang in any arms deal, which could be used on the front 
 
 lines in Ukraine. The Biden administration believes North Korea already delivered infantry rockets and missiles for use by Russian mercenary force 
 
 Wagner late last year. 
 
DOO JIN-HO, RESEARCH FELLOW, KOREA INSTITUTE FOR DEFENSE ANALYSES (through translator): Russia and North Korea have something in common, 
 
 interoperability of conventional weapons. For example, North Korea's 152- millimeter artillery ammunition and 122-millimeter multiple rocket launcher ammunition can be used on Russian weapons immediately. 
 
HANCOCKS: U.S. officials assess Kim Jong-un may travel to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin this month. There is an Eastern Economic Forum in 
 
 Vladivostok next week. Letters of support have been exchanged between the two leaders. Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was given the red 
 
 carpet treatment by Kim in Pyongyang in July. 
 
The North's military capabilities were on full display. And South Korea's intelligence agency says a second Russian delegation visited at the start 
 
 of August. By August 8th, a Russian plane is believed to have transferred unknown military supplies from Pyongyang, no evidence or destination given. 
 
 Pyongyang and Moscow deny any potential arms deal. 
 
CARL SHUSTER, FORMER DIRECTOR, U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND, JOINT INTELLIGENCE CENTER: Kim is becoming more paranoid than normal over the last four or 
 
 five years. And so, for him, this alliance achieves, makes him look less isolated, provides a psychological boost for him and his inner circle. 
 
HANCOCKS: Politically, both Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un stand to benefit greatly from a closer alliance. They are united by a common enemy, the 
 
 United States, and they both want an alternative world order. A world where the U.S. is less powerful and where U.N. Security Council resolutions are 
 
 less able to be imposed. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER: All right. Let's bring in Nic Robertson to explain and give us a little bit more context here. So, Nic, just walk us through what a 
 
 potential arms deal would mean for both countries and how sort of closer alliance between the two countries. What does that mean for both of them 
 
 politically? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yeah, they both have a need of what each other has. North Korea has an abundance and the ability 
 
 to produce more of those weapon systems, the 152-millimeter, the 122- millimeter systems that the expert in Paula's report was talking about.
 
That interoperability, it's the same era of weapons, it's the same type of stock, you know, generally sort of called Soviet era type weapons. That's 
 
 what Russia uses on the battlefield. In Ukraine, it's in a war of attrition. It's using up its own stocks, it's put its factories on high 
 
 production, some of them on 24-hour production a day to just to get the armaments into the fight. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
Whoever comes out on top in Ukraine is essentially the one that's going to be able to put down the most fire. That's typically, you know, the outcome 
 
 of most wars. So, Putin is desperate for that, those weapons, with the ammunition in particular, but more weapon systems, as well, for those that 
 
 are lost on the front line that North Korea can provide. 
 
And we know, Kim Jong-un is dedicating a large part of, you know, his nation's wealth to developing offensive military capabilities to keep his 
 
 enemies wrong footed nuclear-powered submarines if this information is correct would be ideal for him. It would give him a launch platform from 
 
 unknown locations -- a stealthy launch platform, if you will, for the ballistic missile systems that he's developing. And to be able to put his 
 
 own satellites into orbit and to use the information intelligence vaguely, again, would be potential benefit for him. 
 
So, you know, both these leaders need each other. But it also feels at this time that Putin, you know, talking about Iran in this context as well, 
 
 going to them for weapons and selling cheap oil to China, you know, he is perhaps in the more desperate situation. His need is absolutely urgent 
 
 because if he doesn't get it, that does diminish his chances of winning the fight in Ukraine.
 
ASHER: And let's talk about President Erdogan trying to sort of encourage Vladimir Putin to rejoin the Black Sea grain deal? I mean, A, how likely is 
 
 that to actually happen? And B, what does Vladimir Putin want in exchange? 
 
ROBERTSON: It was interesting from that meeting yesterday that President Erdogan speaking afterwards said that really it was Ukraine that needed to 
 
 soften its position and become a little more aligned with Russia's position. And that he said President Putin was right to say that, you know, 
 
 he didn't really see how if Ukraine was exporting its grain to a lot of it to Europe. You know, richer nations, how that was an economic and a 
 
 humanitarian benefit around the world, and therefore questioning the need for the Black Sea grain deal, at least for Ukraine. 
 
We've got more information from President Erdogan today, which I think is revealing. What Putin is trying to do is roll back sanctions that have been 
 
 imposed on Russia, financial sanctions that have blocked him from the swift international financial mechanisms. And that, according to President 
 
 Erdogan today is one of his red lines for coming back into that grain deal. So, Putin wants back into the grain deal only if some sanctions, important 
 
 ones that are hurting his country and economy are rolled back. 
 
And I think, you know, it was very clear that was the read from Kyiv as well, because Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, said very much the same 
 
 at the end of yesterday. What Putin is doing is blackmail. So, is the deal ready to be done? It doesn't appear to be so. 
 
ASHER: All right, Nic Robertson, thank you. Cuba says it has uncovered a human trafficking ring that recruits its citizens to fight for Russia in 
 
 Ukraine. Authorities are saying that the ring operates from Russia and targets Cubans who are living there as well as Cubans who are back home in 
 
 their own country. Cuba's foreign ministry says that Havana is not part of the war in Ukraine and is working to, quote, "neutralize and dismantle the 
 
 network". 
 
Patrick Oppmann joins us live now from Havana. So, Patrick, just explain to us how these human trafficking rings actually work? How are Cubans, 
 
 especially the Cubans who are in Cuba, not in Russia, how are they ending up on the front lines in the war with Ukraine? 
 
PATRICK OPPMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's cold-hard cash. Russia's offering over $2000 to foreign fighters and path to citizenship. And that 
 
 is very tempting if you're a young Cuban and you look at that salary, salary that a doctor doesn't earn here in an entire year. And Russia 
 
 doesn't require a visa, so you can, you know, get on a plane. 
 
Perhaps someone will buy you -- an intermediary will buy you the plane ticket. And what a lot of people we've been hearing from, several reports 
 
 the last few days on social media from Cubans who say they're essentially trapped in this war, is that they were told that they would be doing 
 
 something differently. They'd be working construction, that they would be working on bases, and when they arrive in Russia they're given a weapon and 
 
 told to go to the front line. 
 
And certainly, there's a large Cuban community in Russia because people go there and they either have family there or they are buying items you can't 
 
 find here and bringing them back, working what's called mules here, known as being a mule where you're bringing back hard-to-find items. And so there 
 
 are lots of opportunities for a country, apparently as hard up as Russia is when it comes to recruiting, to try to get young Cubans who perhaps don't 
 
 know any better to get involved in this war. And the Cuban government, which receives a lot of aid from Russia, has not said anything up until 
 
 now. 
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
But as more and more of these accounts have started to trickle out, a statement came out late last night from the Cuban foreign ministry, a quite 
 
 extraordinary statement, because there is some daylight between the Russia war and the Cuban government, which up until now have been saying, 
 
 essentially parroting the Russian propaganda line and saying that it's the U.S.' fault and NATO's fault that there's a war going on at all. But Cuba 
 
 now is saying that they do not want their citizens involved in this war, that they do not permit Cubans to work as mercenaries abroad. 
 
And so, the question remains, has anyone been arrested? Will anybody be arrested? And perhaps most importantly, if there are Cubans that have been 
 
 trafficked and find themselves in the middle of a war zone, how will they now be brought home? Because it appears that there are tens of Cubans, 
 
 perhaps as many as hundreds, that have now been illegally recruited somehow into this war. 
 
ASHER: You've got to wonder how it's affecting relations between the two countries on a political level as you point out. Cuba has been very 
 
 dependent on Russia financially for quite some time. Patrick Oppman, live for us there. 
 
Thank you. All right, coming up, celebrations turning violent. Eritreans marking the 30th anniversary of their independence, face off with opponents 
 
 of the regime on the streets of Tel Aviv. We'll tell you how the Israeli government is responding to that next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: All right. Festivals are being held around the world to mark the 30th anniversary of Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia. But in some 
 
 countries, those celebrations have erupted into violent clashes between supporters and opponents of the Eritrean regime, which is said to have one 
 
 of the worst human rights records in the world. Those clashes turned particularly bloody. 
 
In Israel, of all places, on Saturday, in Tel Aviv, rival Eritrean groups faced off with lumber, rocks. Metal and police in riot gear fired tear gas, 
 
 stun grenades and live rounds while trying to control the crowds. More than 100 people were injured during the violence over the weekend. 
 
Now, Israel's government is considering deporting some of the Eritreans who took part in these protests. The U.N. says that nearly 600,000 Eritreans 
 
 have fled the country. Nearly 20,000 of them are actually believed to be seeking asylum in Israel. Eritrea is considered to be one of the world's 
 
 most repressive countries. 
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
Rights groups say that it's one man dictatorship. Elections have not been held there since 1993. That's when it gained independence. There is no 
 
 freedom of religion. Human Rights Watch says the government continues to force many Eritreans into military or civil service indefinitely for low 
 
 pay and with absolutely no say in their profession, in terms of what they end up doing for a living and in their work location, as well. 
 
Sivan Carmel joins us live now from Tel Aviv. She's Country Director at HAIS Israel, a non-profit organization that helps provide vital services to 
 
 refugees and asylum seekers. Sivan, thank you so much for being with us. I do want to talk about the violence in Tel Aviv over the weekend, but I 
 
 think that a lot of people might be surprised at the number of Eritrean asylum seekers that live in Israel in the first place. 
 
I don't think that's something that's particularly publicized, just how many African migrants, African asylum seekers, particularly from Eritrea, 
 
 are in Israel. Just give us more context in terms of, yes, you have all these Eritreans that are fleeing this very oppressive regime, but how do 
 
 they end up in Israel, of all places? 
 
SIVAN CARMEL, COUNTRY DIRECTOR, HAIS ISRAEL: Yeah, sure. Hi, Zain. And thanks for having me on the show. Yeah, so just a little bit of context. 
 
 There are currently around 17,000 asylum-seekers from Eritrea in Israel. And most of them have been here for over a decade, some for even 15 years. 
 
And as you mentioned, they fled from a very oppressive regime, probably one of the most oppressive in the world and, you know, from forced 
 
 conscription, very, very few personal freedoms. And they came to Israel -- I think many, when they left Eritrea, didn't necessarily intend on coming 
 
 to Israel, but just wanted to leave. And eventually ended up coming here, you know, through a long journey, sometimes through Sudan, through 
 
 Ethiopia, and eventually through Egypt and Sinai to Israel. 
 
I think many came here from what we've been hearing from them over the years, because Israel is a democratic country with a land border to Egypt. 
 
 And they believed that they would safe here. Israel is a signatory to the Refugee Convention, has a functioning court system, and so they hope that 
 
 coming here they would be safe. 
 
ASHER: There were a lot of countries around the world where you had sort of simmering tensions between Eritrean refugees who support the regime and 
 
 Eritrean refugees who are opposed to the regime. And because of the simmering tensions, there were a lot of nations in which the planned sort 
 
 of protests and marches and celebrations were cancelled because people saw, people saw, you know, the potential for violence. 
 
In Israel, they decided to go ahead with it. They weren't canceled. A, why not? And just give us a sense of what actually happened on the streets of 
 
 Tel Aviv over the weekend. 
 
CARMEL: Right. So, as we know, on Saturday, the Eritrean Embassy planned to hold an event in support of the Eritrean regime. And leading up to this 
 
 event, also on social media, the tension was building. You could feel it on the days leading up to the event. And we know that many members of the 
 
 Eritrean community, including religious leaders, community leaders, went to the police and said, we really fear what's going to happen. 
 
It's the other places in the world where these events turn violent and they really asked for the event to be canceled. But these voices, unfortunately, 
 
 were not hated and the event was about to take place. And so, we did see a lot of violence erupt there. You know, unfortunately it ended up with 170 
 
 people injured, including police officers, but also with stun grenades and live gunfire into the crowd. 
 
And so, some people are still hospitalized. And today we know that there's at least 50 people under administrative detention. So, yeah, unfortunately, 
 
 there was a lot of violence that broke out there. And if the event had been canceled. We wouldn't be seeing all that. 
 
ASHER: Right. We wouldn't be talking about this. Just in terms of the rhetoric now in Israel, you know, you have some Israeli politicians who are 
 
 saying, well, listen, a lot of these migrants need to be deported. They shouldn't even be in our country to begin with. A lot of these migrants 
 
 didn't really have that many rights in Israel to begin with. Now, they're that much more vulnerable. What sort of uncertainty is there in terms of 
 
 their future now? 
 
CARMEL: Yes. So, I mean, I have to say that most of these asylum seekers from Eritrea and from Sudan, mostly have been living under instability and 
 
 uncertainty for a long time. And this rhetoric since Saturday, it's the newest. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
I think we're seeing the atmosphere grow even more in that sense. But the fact is that most of them, the kind of status that they have here, protects 
 
 them from deportation. It doesn't grant them like basic social rights, including health care and other social rights. 
 
And so, you know, being in this kind of situation and not having their asylum claims heard really puts them in a very vulnerable, unstable kind of 
 
 situation. And unfortunately, following the event on Saturday, we are hearing many voices calling for deportation. I have to say. You know, this 
 
 group asylum-seekers from Eritrea under temporary group protection in Israel as they are in other places in the world. 
 
And so, deporting them back to Eritrea is not realistic, nor would it be legal. Also, considering the fact that many of them have asylum 
 
 applications that have not been heard. But I think it's important to mention this regard that deportation is not -- is not the only threat. 
 
 We're hearing voices also in the government calling to enact a bill, an immigration bill that would even limit the rights that they have further. 
 
Over the years, there have been different measures by the government to encourage or to pressure asylum seekers to leave, including long detention 
 
 period, economic measures. This bill will really resurrect or bring back to life all these measures and immune it from judicial review. So, we're very 
 
 worried about that. 
 
ASHER: Well, Sivan, do keep an eye on what's happening there on the ground for us. I'm so glad we were able to cover this story. And just keep us 
 
 posted in terms of what you hear, in terms of what is decided. Obviously, as you point out, deportation is the worst threat. It's not the only 
 
 threat. Silvan Carmel, live for us. Thank you. 
 
All right, coming up there, greatest achievement, and no one is talking about it. Our Spain's World Cup winning players have become an afterthought 
 
 in the wake of the "kissgate" scandal. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:46]
 
ASHER: All right, hello and welcome back to One World. Let's catch up on the headlines quickly. In Sudan, nearly four million people have been 
 
 displaced since fighting began in April. That is the word from the International Organization for Migration. In addition, more than a million 
 
 people have fled to neighboring countries like Chad, South Sudan, and Egypt. 
 
The U.N. Refugee Agency and other humanitarian groups are asking for a billion dollars to provide aid and protection for them. Thousands of 
 
 Burning Man festival goers finally made their mass exodus on Monday after a weekend filled with downpours and mud. More than 70,000 people were stuck 
 
 in ankle-deep muck in a Nevada desert. When conditions improved, they hit the road. But plenty of people stuck around for the main event, the burning 
 
 of a giant wooden effigy of a man. 
 
A 10-year-old boy survived flooding outside Madrid by clinging to a tree overnight. A Spanish state broadcaster reports his family's car fell into a 
 
 river on Sunday night. The boy's mother and sister were found and then taken to the hospital. His father is still missing, though. At least three 
 
 people are confirmed dead following torrential rains. 
 
All right. I want to give you a quick update now to our top story. Spain has now named a new head coach of its World Cup-winning women's football 
 
 team, Montse Tomei was the assistant coach and now, and this is huge, she is the first woman to be named head coach of the Spanish national team. The 
 
 first woman has been named head coach of the Spanish national team. 
 
The move comes just hours after coach Jorge Vilda was sacked. We have not heard why exactly Vilda was fired. There has been speculation because he 
 
 was facing so much criticism from Spanish players for more than a year, even before the World Cup, actually. And he's been widely seen as one of 
 
 the fiercest allies of embattled Football Federation President Luis Rubiales, who is at the center of all of this because of that forced kiss 
 
 with Jennifer Hermoso. 
 
It has, of course, been a tumultuous two and a half weeks since Spain won the Women's World Cup title, with Rubiales defiantly refusing to step down 
 
 earlier on Tuesday. The Football Federation apologized for the, quote, "totally unacceptable behavior" of Rubiales. The Federation says it's 
 
 trying to give the spotlight back to the players who have seen their World Cup victory overshadowed by scandal. 
 
Time now for The Exchange. Joining me live now is U.S. Today Sports Communist and CNN Sports Analyst Christine Brennan. Christine, so good to 
 
 have you with us. I just want to start with a breaking news story that Spain has now hired its first woman's head coach for the Spanish national 
 
 team. This is significant. Obviously, this news just coming to us five, 10 minutes or so ago. There's still not much that we know about her, but just 
 
 give us a sense of really how significant. I mean, this is monumental. 
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Oh, it is Zain, absolutely. Exactly what they should do. And they've done the right thing for the first time in 
 
 about 16 days with the firing of Vilda and then, of course, the hiring of Tomei. She is 41 years old. She was a great player in her day in Spain and 
 
 did play on some national teams. And then she's been an assistant coach for the national team. And obviously, she's exactly the right person. The 
 
 Spanish Federation feels to be this team and what a breath of fresh air. A woman finally leading the Spanish women's national team. 
 
I've written columns over the years that all federations around the world, including the United States, should have women coaching women. This is a 
 
 big part of the Title IX conversation here in the United States, the law that changed American playing fields. Well, around the world, too. And it's 
 
 just a wonderful, wonderful sign by the Spanish Federation that they get it. They understand the magnitude of the problem. They understand that men 
 
 have been the magnitude of the problem. They've created all the issues with Rubiales and of course Vilda. 
 
And so now, hiring a woman, someone who the players know and respect, they've got to qualify for the Olympics in a couple of weeks. This is a 
 
 very important time for Spanish women's football and now they're going to be led by a woman. What a wonderful statement that is, wonderful news event 
 
 in 2023 and I guess I could say it's about time. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
ASHER: Absolutely. I mean, it's 2023. And you would think that this should not be the first time we'd be talking about this sort of thing. The idea 
 
 that it is novel and extremely new for a woman's team to have a female coach. But as you point out, it is. I mean, this is -- this is significant. 
 
 And the only reason why there has been this sort of spotlight on this level of misogyny in women's football, just in terms of Luis Rubiales and the 
 
 unwanted kiss, is of course because the Spanish team won. 
 
That is the reason why we're talking about this. That is the reason why these changes are being forced to happen. But it's important to note that 
 
 Rubiales is not the only problem. He is one person, but the problem is deep-rooted and it is widespread, Christine. 
 
BRENNAN: Oh, and it was almost a year ago now that 15 players from the Spanish national team, their best players 15 of the best wrote individual 
 
 letters and email them to the Spanish Federation. Obviously, that was Rubiales complaining about Vilda, then the head coach, the man who was 
 
 fired today, complaining about his coaching tactics, the health and well- being of the players, great concerns that they had about him as a leader. 
 
They complained and they said they didn't want to play for him anymore. They were going to actually strike or you know, boycott and not play. Well, 
 
 what did the Federation do? Instead of listening to those players, in a different scenario we might have had over the last year, but instead of 
 
 listening to the players, they totally went in for Vilda. Obviously, men supporting men, men defending men. 
 
And now, we see the quality of the men we're talking about here. And those 15 players, only three of them actually made the national team and won the 
 
 World Cup. They were only three. The other 12 never got that chance, even though all they did was the right thing and complain about the conditions 
 
 under Vilda. So, they must feel great today, even though I'm sure that they'll feel terrible, that of course they did not make that World Cup 
 
 team. 
 
ASHER: What I find also quite interesting is that when you know, we saw the sort of video of Luis Rubiales giving that very defiant speech at the 
 
 General Assembly of the RFEF and sort of saying that he was going to dig his heels in, he was going to fight and he wasn't going to quit, you saw 
 
 the level of applause that he got, just how many men, and women to be fair, but especially men, really stood by him, applauded him and supported him. 
 
 It's only when their careers were under threat did they say, whoops, sorry, we made a mistake, we're going to distance ourselves from him. But he got a 
 
 lot of support, especially initially. What does that tell you? 
 
BRENNAN: It tells me it's a very big two weeks in Spain and around the world because those men thought they could get away with this, saying they 
 
 really did. They thought it was business as usual. And of course, if Rubiales thinks it's okay to kiss, forcibly kiss, unwanted kiss, sexual 
 
 assault, is what it is. Jenny Hermoso on the lips, right in front of the world, what in the world is going on behind the scenes? 
 
ASHER: Right.
 
BRENNAN: And of course, you got a glimpse of that a year ago when those players were so angry. But now, things have changed so dramatically. These 
 
 guys have got to be shocked and that's a wonderful thing for girls and women around the world, frankly.
 
ASHER: All right, Christine Brennan, live for us. Thank you. Thank you for coming up on this story so quickly. We just literally got the news about 
 
 this new appointment, this new female coach just moments ago, and you were up on this story. We're so grateful. Thank you, Christine. All right, 
 
 coming up, we are tracking a dangerous storm pounding Greece in the wake of those devastating wildfires. We'll have the details of those wildfires up 
 
 ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:41:11]
 
ASHER: All right. We're following severe weather in two parts of the world simultaneously. We've got Greece being lashed with torrential rains, which 
 
 have flooded homes, businesses, roads as well, as you can see here, and left at least one person dead. The storm, dubbed Daniel, has dumped 
 
 hundreds of milliliters of rainfall over some areas in the past 24 hours, in what the prime minister describes as a totally extreme weather 
 
 phenomenon. 
 
And then Southern China, typhoon Haikui has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall early Tuesday. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam 
 
 is tracking both storms from the CNN Weather Center. Derek, what more can you tell us? 
 
DEREK VAN DAM; CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah, two big stories to cover here, Zain. We're going to start with the remnants of that typhoon Haikui, which 
 
 continues to bring rainfall to the Fujian province and even into Taiwan, as well. But remember, this is on the heels of what was another powerful 
 
 typhoon that impacted that region, Doksuri, at the end of July. 
 
So, two back-to-back typhoons impacting the same location of southern China. That means a lot of rain. That means flooding, landslides, 
 
 mudslides, you name it. Look at these rainfall totals exceeding 1,100 millimeters. That's in a three-day storm period. And you can see that 
 
 impacts kind of the mountainous regions of Taiwan. But look at the additional rainfall that will take place anywhere from Taipei westward into 
 
 the western and southern sections of China. 
 
Now, to the other big story that we're covering. Look at this. Your eyes are not deceiving you. This is not a hurricane. This is a low-pressure 
 
 system across the eastern Mediterranean. Sometimes we refer to this as a medicane, think hurricane, but in the central portions of the 
 
 Mediterranean. But you can see clearly that counterclockwise rotation on the visible satellite imagery. It's all because of a very exaggerated 
 
 weather pattern across Europe. 
 
We've got hot air blasting northward with this jet stream, well-elongated into Norway. But on the other side of that jet stream, it's cutting -- 
 
 causing this cutoff low to develop and form and strengthen over the relatively warm waters of the eastern Mediterranean. And what this has done 
 
 is it's taken advantage of the environmental conditions and produced significant amounts of rain. 
 
Look at the flooding happening across portions of Greece. These pictures are just a drop in the bucket of what we've actually been seeing pop up on 
 
 social media. So, we believe that this could be a significant weather- maker, a weather headline going forward. 
 
Look at the latest infrared satellite imagery. The storm system is not slowing down and it really is going to just produce more rainfall than what 
 
 you see here. So, there are some totals here that will easily exceed 200 millimeters here going forward. This is the current radar. You could almost 
 
 pick out a little bit of an eye like feature just off the west coast of Greece.
 
Again, we call that a medicane for lack of a better term, but the potential here for excessive rain, flash flooding and mudslides exists anywhere you 
 
 see that shading of red, particularly over the eastern coast of Greece just north of Athens. That's where we're focusing a lot of our attention right 
 
 now because some of the computer-generated models indicating the highest level of rainfall totals here. 
 
We've got some satellite derived imagery showing rainfall totals there potentially exceeding several hundred millimeters. So, flash flooding will 
 
 be an on-going threat at least for the next 24 to 36 hours. So, Zain, a big story for us. 
 
ASHER: All right, Derek Van Dam, live for us. Thank you. We'll be right back with more. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:47:18] ASHER: Amid cries for rich nations to step up and help Africa deal with the impact of climate change, some countries are actually doing just that. On 
 
 Tuesday, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told the African climate summit that his nation would spend $30 million to help African nations combat food 
 
 insecurity specifically. But it was really the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, that really turned heads when it pledged $4.5 billion to invest 
 
 in clean energy on the African continent.
 
Still, officials say the need is so great that an economic transformation is needed. Let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo in Nairobi. I mean, listen, 
 
 four and a half billion dollars, that's not nothing. But U.N. officials are saying that Africa needs over $100 billion a year, not just a one-time fee, 
 
 $100 billion a year at least to combat climate change and to ensure that the continent becomes that much more resilient when it comes to weathering 
 
 climate disasters. Just explain to us the reaction though in terms of this $4.5 billion pledge by the UAE. 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a welcome pledge from the UAE, and the pledge is what it is. It's not that many will be available tomorrow or 
 
 next week. It will take some time, probably phased out. But it's the sort of investment that African leaders are hoping for. That's what President 
 
 William Ruto of Kenya said when he opened this Africa Climate Summit, the first of its kind, that there's an opportunity here and the renewable 
 
 energy potential especially is really great. 
 
And the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres speaking today said there needs to be a whole lot more investment here. Over the last two decades 
 
 only two percent of renewable energy investments came into Africa, despite that massive potential. So that's one angle that's coming up here. The John 
 
 Kerry announcement of $30 million to combat food insecurity is also welcome, but it's still a drop in the ocean. 
 
But one of the other major side events here has been on the Nexus, between health and the climate, specifically about one of Africa's most deadly 
 
 tropical mosquito-borne diseases, malaria. As temperatures warm, mosquitoes are becoming more resistant. They are popping up in more places and this is 
 
 a major problem. These are some of the people who are affected by it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Mary and both her sons are in hospital for malaria. Four-year-old Mark says he's doing better, and so is his big brother, 
 
 Joseph, who's 12. They keep getting malaria, Mary says, and she can barely afford the treatment. 
 
MARY ACHIENG, MALARIA PATIENT (through translator): Malaria has hit my family hard. In a month, I use about $35 on drugs. And the following month, 
 
 one of them falls sick gain.
 
MADOWO: Mary lives in Western Kenya, a hot region where residents have a specially high-risk of malaria. 
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
More than 10,000 people die each year from the mosquito-borne disease in this East African nation, but kids are especially vulnerable. Researchers 
 
 are collecting mosquitoes here to study how they're evolving. Rising temperatures let them grow faster and live longer. Why do you come to 
 
 collect mosquitoes here specifically? 
 
UNKNOWN: The mosquito densities here are very high.
 
MADOWO: They're tracking the full life cycle of mosquitoes to get ahead of this tiny insect before it does even more damage. This is a typical high 
 
 malaria zone. It's hot and humid, swampy. Those are rice-growing fields back there. A lot of water right next to where people live. But as 
 
 temperatures warm across the board, scientists are concerned about malaria causing mosquitoes breeding in new places. 
 
DAMARIS MATOKE-MUHIA, PRINCIPAL RESEARCH SCIENTIST: Mosquitoes are the deadliest animals on earth. 
 
MADOWO: Damaris Matoke-Muhia has made it her life's work to neutralize the insect that causes malaria, the female Anopheles mosquito, after her 
 
 brother died of the disease. Her team of scientists at Kenya's largest research institute is studying mosquito samples from around the country to 
 
 guide Kenya's response to malaria and how to beat it. Are we any close to eradicating malaria? 
 
MATOKE-MUHIA: We were, but with the change of, now, climate, we're seeing more mosquitoes than they were before. We're seeing new species. We are 
 
 seeing it going to places where we didn't expect before. Then we are taken back to zero. 
 
MADOWO: Climate change is helping mosquitoes responsible for transmitting malaria reach colder parts of the continent, scientists at Georgetown 
 
 University Medical Center found, drawing on data going back 120 years. But heat is also helping mosquitoes live longer and to become infectious 
 
 sooner, worrying public health officials. Are you concerned about a resurgence of malaria in your work across the continent? 
 
GITAHI GITHINJI, DOCTOR, GROUP CEO, AMREF HEALTH AFRICA: We are concerned here that the child seem to eliminate malaria are now having malaria and we 
 
 are seeing actually the public health system is not prepared for these resurgence. 
 
MADOWO: Malaria is having devastating effects on more people suffering from serious cases. Steve Ngugi says he was sick for nearly three months. Your 
 
 malaria was very serious. 
 
STEVE NGUGI, MALARIA SURVIVOR: Very, very serious. 
 
MADOWO: Were you afraid you could die? 
 
NGUGI: Of course, yes, because by the time I reached the hospital, I couldn't even manage to move my head. Ninety-six percent of people who die 
 
 from malaria are in Africa, the World Health Organization says. As the continent warms faster than the rest of the world, malaria persists, and 
 
 experts warn it risks spreading into -- a threat. 
 
RICHARD MUNANG, CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM COORDINATOR, UNEP AFRICA: What is happening in Africa will gradually see itself elsewhere, because, with the 
 
 warming climate, with the changing temperatures, malaria, mosquitoes are migrating to other areas that are conducive for them. Malaria will displace 
 
 people. They will migrate to other areas within the continent and out of the continent. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (on-camera): That displacement is already being seen in parts of the world, but also those changing temperatures mean that the World Bank 
 
 estimates that by 2050 you will see malaria in places that previously didn't have malaria, such as in China, in South America, in other parts of 
 
 Sub-Saharan Africa. And the other one, which Dr. Munang talked about, Zain, is we, something we touched on yesterday that migration because of changing 
 
 weather patterns that's already happening in the Sahel, it's happening in other parts of the continent, and as this continues, if global temperatures 
 
 rise by just two to three degrees Celsius, you see this at a much larger scale. 
 
ASHER: All right, Larry Madowo, live for us there. Thank you. All right, one more note on the African climate summit. Some have complained that the 
 
 summit is far too focused on how Western nations can help Africa rather than looking at ways for Africa to actually help itself. CNN's Becky 
 
 Anderson asked Kenyan President William Ruto about that exact criticism. I want you to listen to what he said. 
 
((BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
Becky Anderson; CNN ANCHOR: President Ruto, more than 500 civil society organizations have written to you saying that they look up to you as 
 
 Africa's most senior leader on climate change. They though believe this summit has been co-opted, writing, and I quote, "Rather than advancing 
 
 Africa's interests and position on critical climate issues, the summit has been seized by Western organizations hell-bent on pushing a pro-West agenda 
 
 and at the expense of Africa. Your response? 
 
WILLIAM RUTO, KENYAN PRESIDENT: We have clear parameters, we have a clear understanding, and we will not blame any person. We will blame ourselves if 
 
 we don't get what we want, because we intend not just to push, we intend to push very hard, because that is our new posture. Blame game, apportioning 
 
 blame, trying to say -- because now that's new, that oh-you-see, this is being pushed by so and so. 
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
If others are pushing, we will push very hard. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: The three-day African summit -- African climate summit will wrap up on Wednesday. Greek tourism officials are now limiting visitors to the 
 
 Acropolis. They're testing a new booking website that will cap daily visits at 20,000 per day and create an hourly slot system. Ancient landmark draws 
 
 on average 23,000 people every single day, and usually in the early morning hours, which can overwhelm the staff. The trial will last until April, when 
 
 it's expected to formally take effect. 
 
An iconic symbol of Florence, the fountain of Neptune, has been damaged by a German tourist trying to get a photo. Florence police say they arrested a 
 
 22-year-old man after he climbed atop the statue of Neptune and posed while his friends took photos. You can actually see him jump down from the 
 
 statue, and on his way down, he broke off a piece of red marble attached to Neptune's carriage. The city says the damage is around $5400.
 
All right, thank you so much for watching One World. I'm Zain Asher. Amanpour is up next. You're watching CNN.
