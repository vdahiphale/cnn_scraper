JOHN KING, CNN HOST: Thanks for your time today on INSIDE POLITICS. We will see you tomorrow. 
 
Abby Phillip picks up our coverage right now. 
 
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN HOST:  Hello. I'm Abby Phillip in Washington. 
 
We begin today in Richmond, Indiana, where a massive fire at a recycling plant is now spewing a cloud of toxic smoke. The fire chief there says it started yesterday in a semitrailer on the site, and it quickly spread to a building filled with plastics. Health officials are urging residents now to evacuate.

CHRISTINE STINSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WAYNE COUNTY, INDIANA, HEALTH DEPARTMENT:  These are very fine particles and, if they're breathed in, can cause all kinds of respiratory problems, burning of the eyes, tightening of the chest.
 
It could aggravate asthma, cause bronchitis and all kinds of things. So we are stressing to the public to honor the evacuation zone.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHILLIP:  CNN's Sanjay Gupta is standing by to break down all the possible health risks from this fire. 
 
But, first, let's go and check in with CNN's Omar Jimenez, who is on the ground there in Richmond, Indiana. 
 
So, Omar, what is the latest about the status of this cleanup effort? 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Abby, I mean, you can see the fire a little bit behind me -- or the smoke, I should say.
 
It's a lot better than it was. But it still does pose that risk, as the Indiana state fire marshals described, with fumes that are definitely toxic. So, a lot of that smoke going up into the air, and that actually is the primary concern, the smoke. 
 
And that's partly good news. And I say that because, well, one -- let's take a look here. One is that a lot of these toxic fumes are going up into the air. But the tests that have now been taken of the ground-level air quality, which is I guess what most people here are breathing, outside of those in the immediate area there, that there were no signs of toxins. 
 
However, they did find signs of particulates in there, so little particles that oftentimes we see with smoke. So, at the very least, smoke inhalation could be an issue for a lot of folks here, which, of course, we know can be troublesome. Around 2,000 people are being affected by evacuation orders. 
 
This is a town of about 35,000 between Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio. Now, these are plastics that are burning. It's a plastic recycling factory. And officials believe it started with the semitruck trailer that burned, that then spread to piles of plastics, that then spread to the entire compound. 
 
And while the specific reason for this or the specific cause, we're still trying to figure out, the mayor here says that they have had issues with this property for a long time, particularly about fire hazards, that, for them, talking among officials, it was never a matter of if something like this would happen, but when.
 
And it seems like we have gotten to that point now. Good news, they have got the flames or the -- at least the smoke contained. So it doesn't appear that there will be more flame threats, other homes and things like that around the area. But, obviously, that major concern is the smoke and toxins that are going up into the air. 
 
And the last point they mentioned for something to watch for in the future is, while a lot of those toxins are going up into the air now, as the smoke dies down, as they get this more under control, a lot of those toxins will end up staying around the ground level. 
 
And that's something they're really watching for. And it's why EPA officials told us here on the ground they are testing air quality constantly to make sure that we're just worried about particulates, and not necessarily toxins. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes, that's the major concern. 
 
And so we do have Dr. Sanjay Gupta here with us. 
 
So, Sanjay, tell us a little bit about what the concerns are here. You heard that health official telling people, take this evacuation order seriously, because you're talking about very fine particles here that could cause a health problem. 
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, right, and the smaller the particles, the bigger the concern. 
 
This is a challenging sort of situation, in part because it's an uncontrolled burn. And the impact is sort of measured over space and time, meaning, that smoke that Omar's describing, it obviously will travel. That's dependent on the conditions, weather conditions, windy, for example, but also over -- over time. Right now, if you were to sort of dissect that plume that you're looking at, some of the more concerning toxins will probably be near the top of that plume. They tend to be lighter. They tend to be more volatile. They rise up faster. 
 
So, it's not as much of a surprise that, if you're doing ground level testing or lower-level testing, you're not going to find evidence of those toxins. You will find evidence of the particulate matter that Omar was describing. And that's what the people need to be the most cautious of.
 <br>[13:05:02]
 
But, over time, some of those volatile organic compounds, those -- those -- some of the things that you worry about, they can rise up, move, and then eventually fall back down to the ground. And that's why we need to be thinking about some of the longer-term testing that happens, as high up as you can do it, but also, over time, making sure you see, is this causing contamination later on and even in different locations? 
 
So it's a lot of work to basically continue to monitor and measure something like this, Abby.
 
PHILLIP:  Yes, absolutely. 
 
And for the people in that area, what should they be concerned about as it relates to the plastics? And, if they do have health concerns, what signs would they take on at this point? 
 
GUPTA:  Yes, so, with regard to the smoke, call it the smoke right now, I mean, you see it, you smell it, you feel it. That can cause health -- health issues in just about anybody, even healthy people. 
 
I think people who say, look, I'm healthy, don't need to worry about it, that's probably not the case. But people who are most at risk are the people who have underlying heart disease, underlying pulmonary disease, lung disease, things like that, young children, babies, in particular, at risk. 
 
But I think if you start to look at, again, some of these compounds, you got this uncontrolled burn. There's all these different things that are spewed into the air. Some of the ones that they have talked about earlier today at that press conference and that you worry about with plastics are things like styrene and benzene, for example.
 
Styrene, we know less about. In the short term, it can cause irritation of eyes and difficulty with breathing. Still, the long-term impact of that is not as well-known. Benzene, we know more about both in the short term in the long term. It can cause people to have headaches, feel confused. It can affect their heart, just like the particulate matter. 
 
In severe cases, it can lead to unconsciousness as well. So, again, I don't want to unnecessarily alarm people. And, as Omar mentioned, so far, the testing has not shown evidence of this. But keep in mind, where those toxins, potential toxins, would be right now, if they are present, is near the top of that plume of smoke, where it's harder to do that testing. 
 
You got to follow this to see, does that start to come down, literally down to the ground over time? And where it most likely falls in some of the lowest-lying areas around the community. So, that testing needs to happen over the next several days and even weeks. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes, it could be a long road ahead for the folks living in that community. 
 
Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Omar Jimenez, both of you, thank you very much. 
 
And now on to Louisville, where investigators are trying to figure out what drove a 25-year-old bank employee to gun down five of his co- workers on Monday. They recovered items from his residence overnight, and the shooter's family broke their silence, saying that he was dealing with -- quote -- "mental health challenges."
 
We also have newly released body camera footage from police showing officers storming that bank where the attack was in the lobby -- where the attacker was in the lobby, and they were -- and ready to ambush them. This is that video. And I warn you that it is disturbing.

PHILLIP:  We will, in a couple of minutes, speak with the Louisville police chief about all of this. 
 
But, first let's check in with CNN's Adrienne Broaddus, who is on the scene there. 
 
Adrienne, what are we learning now about the shooter, now that this investigation is very much well under way? 
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Abby, overnight, the shooter's family released a statement saying in part that they knew he struggled with depression.
 
And, in that statement, the family said they were actively working to address the mental illness he lived with. However, they said they saw no signs and they did not know that he was planning, nor that he was capable of such violence. 
 
And I want to read to you part of that statement. 
 
It says: "No words can express our sorrow, anguish and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people." It also goes on to say: "We mourn their loss and that of our son Connor. We pray for everyone traumatized."
 
And later this evening at 5:00 here in town, there will be a vigil to honor and recognize and remember the five people who lost their lives. Their lives ended here at the bank, Abby, where they worked. You can see now the front of the bank. The windows that were shattered by gunfire are now covered with plywood -- Abby. 
 
PHILLIP:  Adrienne Broaddus, thank you very much for that. 
 
And now we are joined by the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department, Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel.
 <br>[13:10:00]
 
Chief Gwinn-Villaroel, thank you very much for joining us.
 
We were just discussing that investigators did search the shooter's home. What can you tell us now about anything that was recovered there that might give us some sense of what happened? 
 
JACQUELYN GWINN-VILLAROEL, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, METRO INTERIM POLICE CHIEF:  Well, thank you, Abby, for actually having me here to just discuss this, this incident, this tragic incident. 
 
Our investigators, along with additional local partners and federal partners, did do a search on the individual's residence. And we did recover numerous items. But, again, the investigation, it's ongoing. And we really want to make sure that everything that we recovered, that we're actually going through it detail by detail, so that we're able to provide all of the necessary accurate information to the family and to the community here in Louisville, and to the nation as to why this incident was carried out. 
 
So, the family understands that we want to make sure that any information that we provide, there is with accuracy, because everybody wants to know why. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes.
 
GWINN-VILLAROEL:  This should have never happened, but the answer to the question needs to -- you need to know why. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes, I think that is absolutely front of mind for so many families searching for some semblance of closure here. 
 
Would you be able to say, without disclosing any confidential information, are you all learning more about the motive? Are you closing in on a motive here? 
 
GWINN-VILLAROEL:  Well, we're learning more about who the individual is. We're learning more about his acquaintances. 
 
And so, right now, it's just piecing all of this together and what motivated that individual to intentionally take so many lives and -- but I'm just so grateful that my officers responded in such a brave manner in order to just bring a stop to that violence. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes. And we do want to talk about that bravery that we saw on display there. But I want to ask you another thing about -- just to clarify some of
 
 the information that's been out there. There was some information, conflicting information, about whether this gunman who was employed at the bank had either been terminated or was set to be terminated. 
 
Can you clarify what you know about that? 
 
GWINN-VILLAROEL:  Yes, thanks for asking that question. 
 
We did get clarification. There was no discussion about him being terminated. And, of course, he wasn't fired. So he was an active employee there at Old National Bank, but there was no discussion about this individual being terminated. 
 
So that is, with confirmation, what I'm able to give you -- that information to you today. 
 
PHILLIP:  OK. 
 
And there was, we know, a voice-mail that was apparently left by the shooter saying he was going to kill people. As we look at the situation and try to understand the timeline here, how -- how soon did law enforcement or authorities know about that voice-mail? Was there any warning time?
 
GWINN-VILLAROEL:  We didn't receive any initial warning time on that voice-mail. 
 
But I'm just truly grateful that, as soon as the call came in that we had an active shooter situation that was actually occurring, within three minutes, my officers were on scene, and they were engaging that individual. 
 
So, timing is -- as we all know, is everything, but not having officers to hesitate, but to actually really go in and say:  I need to stop this threat. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes.
 
GWINN-VILLAROEL:  And that is what you saw on that video. 
 
PHILLIP:  We saw in that video, as you were just saying, the officers really charging up that staircase to a deadly threat.
 
One of those officers, Officer Wilt, a rookie in your department, was seriously injured. What is the latest on his condition?
 
GWINN-VILLAROEL:  He is still in critical, but stable condition. We're hopeful that he will be able to continue to recover and be stabilized. 
 
But, right now, the next four or five days is critical, is critical because of where he got shot. And the doctors are closely monitoring him. And they are giving, of course, the much-needed update on his status. And we are getting an update on his status as well. We're all praying, and we're so concerned. And I'm just -- I'm just hopeful. 
 
I truly am hopeful that the officer will be able to pull through. 
 
PHILLIP:  And we are joining you in our prayers for a speedy recovery for Officer Wilt and for all the others who are injured there.
 
Chief Gwen -- Gwinn-Villaroel, thank you very much for joining us on what I know has been an extraordinarily tough week for you and your entire department. Thank you very much. 
 
GWINN-VILLAROEL:  Thank you for having me. 
 
PHILLIP:  And we are now standing by for a major ruling on abortion access nationwide in this country. 
 <br>[13:15:01]
 
At any moment a federal appeals court could decide whether to put on hold a Texas judge's order that would halt the sale of an abortion pill, mifepristone, come Friday, 
 
CNN senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic is joining me now. 
 
So, Joan, walk us through what could happen when this appeals court makes its ruling and how that could potentially set us up for a -- another major showdown at the Supreme Court. 
 
JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST:  Yes, Abby. Good afternoon. 
 
As of this moment, all the filings are into the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. It's the regional appellate court that will be handling the arguments from both sides on what to do with Judge Kacsmaryk's order from last week, as, remember, when he invalidated the FDA approval of the first pill of this two-drug medication abortion, he said that his order should take effect on Friday, this -- at the end of this Friday.
 
He gave it seven days. And what the Department of Justice and the drug manufacturer, Danco, have said is that this -- this ruling has to be put on hold for a longer period of time, so that appeals can work their way through the system. 
 
If this order were to take effect so immediately, it would cause substantial harm to women, to physicians, to pharmaceutical companies, to so many different players, because not just would it throw in doubt access to this crucial abortion medication that has become the most common way that women end pregnancies in the early stages; it also cast lots of doubt on the FDA's approval of other existing drugs and new drugs. 
 
So, just so much chaos would ensue, the Department of Justice says, again, joined by the drug manufacturer. Now, the group that brought the original complaint against the FDA submitted its filing just overnight, saying, look, this order should take effect. The judge found that the approval process was flawed, it did not take into account the proper scientific groundings and harms caused by this drug. This is the argument from these challengers, these anti-abortion
 
 doctors and medical groups. So those are the competing views that are now before the First Circuit -- Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 
I have to say, Abby, this is a very conservative Fifth Circuit. It has a very -- it's very top-heavy with Republican appointees and Republican appointees who tend to tip further to the right wing. But this issue right now is not a straight abortion rights one. It has to do with the approval process and, most specifically, right now, if everyone can just wait, have what's called an administrative stay, so that the actual legal arguments can be presented. 
 
One final thing. If the Department of Justice does not get relief with the Fifth Circuit, it says it's going to go immediately to the U.S. Supreme Court to try to have the justices put this matter on hold, so that the legal case can play out -- Abby. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes, one way or another, it's going to be a very pivotal next couple of days here, Joan.
 
BISKUPIC:  Right. Right. 
 
PHILLIP:  I know you will be on top of it. Thank you very much. 
 
BISKUPIC:  Thank you. 
 
PHILLIP:  And still to come for us this hour, "How easily these beasts kill," strong words from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy after chilling video shows the beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. 
 
Plus, supporters of the ousted Tennessee lawmaker Justin Pearson rallying right now outside of the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis. Shelby County commissioners vote next hour to determine his political fate. 
 
And, later, a frightening warning from the Biden administration. Why the White House's drug czar is now calling a fentanyl cocktail known as tranq a national threat.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:22:52]
 
PHILLIP:  Ukraine is investigating possible war crimes after disturbing video surfaced appearing to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier. 
 
It is the second video just this week to emerge on social media showing graphic violence against Ukrainian soldiers. And now Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is vowing to hold those behind those videos accountable. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  There are things nobody in the world can ignore, how easily these animals murder. 
 
What kind of creatures are they? They don't care about a human being, a son, a brother, a husband, someone's child. This video shows Russia trying to make it a new normal. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
PHILLIP:  CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is live in Eastern Ukraine. 
 
So, Ben, what are other Ukrainian officials and even the Kremlin saying about this video? 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ukrainian officials, Abby, are, not surprisingly, very angry about this horrific video. 
 
In one of the videos, you see two beheaded Ukrainian soldiers who also appear to have their -- have had their hands cut off. In the other, you actually see what appears to be a Russian soldier, from the white leg band he's wearing, actually cutting off -- using a knife to cut the head off of what we believe is a Ukrainian soldier who is alive at the time. 
 
Now, we have heard from, for instance, officials with the Ukrainian defense intelligence service, saying that this is an illegal execution by terrorists, by the occupying state. He said that it's a violation of all the norms and laws of war. And, of course, the Ukrainians are going to be launching a war crimes investigation.
 
But that's just the latest. They -- their files of war crimes by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion in February of last year is very thick, indeed. As far as the Russian reaction, we heard Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, actually describe the videos as terrible, but he said the veracity, the authenticity of these videos still has yet to be determined.
 <br>[13:25:06]
 
Now, it's widely believed that, at least in one of these videos, that the perpetrators of the beheadings are forces of the Wagner Group, and the head of that group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said that he sees no indication in these videos that his men were involved in the beheadings -- Abby.
 
PHILLIP:  All right, Ben Wedeman, thank you very much. 
 
And a second expelled Tennessee lawmaker could get his seat back as soon as today. Right now, supporters have gathered for a rally in Memphis.
 
And we will take you there live next.
