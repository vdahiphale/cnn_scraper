(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  A third fertility clinic has now shut off IVF services because of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling in that state. The CEO of Infirmary Health says that the decision, "Left us with no choice but to pause IVF treatments for patients." So many patients are now being left in the dark and in limbo. Here's one.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GABRIELLE GOIDEL, ALABAMA IVF PATIENT:  I've gone through three miscarriages and it -- it honestly felt like a very similar feeling. It doesn't feel very supported here and now they're just going to make it less accessible, more expensive. They're taking away people's chances, women's chances to have children.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  The impact of the Supreme Court decision in Alabama is still being felt. Joining us right now is two people -- will be two people, who are experiencing this in real time. First with us is Rebecca Matthews, who has been an IVF patient living in Alabama. Her two children were born through IVF. And joining us shortly will be Dr. Mamie McLean. Who is Rebecca's reproductive doctor, who's helped her through this process.
 
Rebecca, thank you so much for joining me. We were talking a little bit in the break. This is as personal, truly, as it gets because at its core, what this is about is the patients and about how these impacts so many families. What went through your mind when you first heard this news? And what does this feel like for you?
 
REBECCA MATTHEWS, ALABAMA IVF PATIENT:  Yes, I was shocked. I could not believe that this is where we are. I -- after the dust sort of settled of what had happened in the ruling, I started to really worry about what our options were with our remaining frozen embryo going forward and what we choose to do with that embryo, how that could affect our lives and our family. BOLDUAN:  Rebecca, IVF has helped you and your husband have two children. What is -- what does this mean for your journey? What does this mean for you and your family?
 
MATTHEWS:  IVF is so personal. Infertility is so hard. It is truly nothing anyone would wish upon themselves or anyone they love. So, you have to be really strong to do it mentally and emotionally, and even physically because your body is going to go through it. So, to now be told that there are even fewer options available is heartbreaking. And I can't imagine the families right now who are going through an active IVF cycle that is being canceled. My heart breaks for them.
 
BOLDUAN:  Dr. McLean is joining us now. And, Doctor, your clinic is one of the facilities who has been forced to halt some IVF treatments because of this ruling. And you wrote an op-ed yesterday. And I want to read -- I normally wouldn't do this, I would just dive into a question, but I want to read what you wrote off the top because it gets to exactly what Rebecca's talking about, who's one of your -- who's been one of your patients.
 
You wrote this, I just want my baby, she sobbed, having trouble taking a breath. I know, I know, I said. There was nothing else to say. My heart was heavy and I felt powerless since I was now unable to complete the course of treatment that she, her husband, and I agreed to months ago since the loss of their third pregnancy.
 
And that, I assume, is just one of so many families that you've had to talk to. What position does this put you in? What are you hearing from patients?
 
DR. MAMIE MCLEAN, FERTILITY SPECIALIST, ALABAMA FERTILITY:  So, the position that it puts me in is an impossible position. As a reproductive endocrinologist, I need to be able to offer the state-of- the-art modern medicine for our patients in Alabama. This ruling makes it impossible for me to offer IVF. This means that my patients won't be able to access the best fertility care in the state which leads to fewer babies and fewer grand babies in Alabama.
 
BOLDUAN:  And Doctor, Rebecca shared with me in the commercial break that of her two children, her little one, her one-year-old, is named McLean named after you.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
I mean, that just -- to me, that just hits at everything. How personal this is and the connection that you have with your patients. I mean, talk to me about that and what this journey with Rebecca has been, and now what this means for so many patients like Rebecca for you, Doctor.
 
DR. MCLEAN:  So, it really is an honor to be able to practice in my specialty. Our relationships are deep. They're intense and they're long lasting. There truly is no greater gift than helping a couple have a child. We love meeting the grandparents and sharing the news with them. But this really is just a far-reaching field.
 
We are worried. Our patients, though, are brave. They're resilient and they're fighters. And the women of Alabama and the couples in Alabama are not going to stand for this ruling. So, we are working as hard as we can to continue to be able to offer advanced fertility care to the couples of Alabama.
 
BOLDUAN:  You know, Rebecca, another fertility clinic in the state, says that it is now planning to send frozen embryos out of state to an off-storage facility. I heard that and you kind of scratch your head. Like, what does this mean for a family who's in the middle of it? I mean, what would that have meant for you and your family if that was what was presented to you?
 
MATTHEWS:  Yes, I've even been asked that question of what we will do with our remaining embryo when we move it across state lines. I think ultimately, so much goes into these cycles. So much goes into the process of IVF. And emotionally, we already feel like we're being held back and we're having to wait. When it comes to infertility, we feel like it's one step forward, two steps back at all times to have this huge, huge bump in the road for these families has to feel debilitating in a way.
 
BOLDUAN:  And that's such a good point. I mean, the journey so many of my friends have had setbacks is, unfortunately, part of so many families process when it comes to infertility and IVF. And when you think about that, that it's already such a hard and long enough road, Doctor, that you are trying to help your patients go through. It shouldn't be an issue for politics. But the mere fact that IVF has become one in this moment -- I don't know. What does it say to you? How do you react to that, Doctor?
 
DR. MCLEAN:  So, in my clinic, this is not a political issue. This is a human issue. This is about having the American right to decide whether to have children, when to have children, and to be able to make the choices with your doctor about how it is best for you to have a child.
 
We know that there are patients considering moving embryos across state lines. That's not in their best interest. In Alabama, we need to be able to offer the most advanced fertility care to our patients and to the citizens of the state. We've actually just heard word that the two largest shipping companies are no longer offering to ship within Alabama. So, unfortunately, the -- this new development this morning limits my patients' options even further and is completely unacceptable based on this ruling.
 
BOLDUAN:  It's -- you know, the ruling comes. We hear -- you hear the news headline. And here's the thing with this one, it's like a cascading effect of fallout because we're seeing that now with clinics having to stop services, with families having to let this set in.
 
Now, you have shipping companies, all along the chain, that you need in order to bring -- really, make this miracle happen. It's -- it is tough. But both for coming on. Doctor, thank you for what you do. Rebecca, it's wonderful to meet you. It's really beautiful naming your little one after the doctor that you see right there in the screen with you. That's something special. Thank you both.
 
DR. MCLEAN:  Thanks.
 
BOLDUAN:  Sara.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Kate, that was incredibly impactful and necessary. What a great, great interview with those two.
 
Coming up, we're waiting on the Supreme Court. Big decision on Donald Trump's election cases. What the justices might be considering that could be causing the hold up in a decision.
 
And any moment we expect to hear from President Biden for the first time since slamming Russia and Vladimir Putin with major new sanctions. All of that ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. You are looking at live pictures from the White House right now. This is a meeting of the National Governors Association. You can see many of the nation's governors, as well as members of the cabinet, seated there in the East Room of the White House. You also see a microphone set up.
 
We are waiting to hear from Vice President Kamala Harris and then ultimately President Biden. A number of very important topics could come up. I expect we could hear about the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on IVF, particularly from Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been leaning into campaign issues. And President Biden, for the first time, could address these new sanctions. This huge round of new sanctions just announced this morning on Russia. So, we will monitor these speeches from the East Room. Stay with us on that.
 
In the meantime, when will we hear from the Supreme Court on two cases that could determine the course of the criminal prosecutions against Donald Trump?
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
The Supreme Court is set to meet today, this time for a private conference to discuss current cases. But will we hear whether they take up the appeal on the issue of presidential immunity, or will they issue the ruling on whether Trump can be kept off the ballot in Colorado because of the 14th Amendment ban on insurrectionists?
 
Let's get right to CNN's Joan Biskupic. Joan, what does it tell us that we haven't heard from the court yet, particularly on presidential immunity? Does this indicate there are no rush?
 
JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST:  Good to see you, John. The Supreme Court is on its own schedule. You know, it heard important cases this week that had already been scheduled. It's in the middle of writing that Colorado ballot case regarding whether Donald Trump can be kicked off state ballots. That's underway behind the scenes. So, they are thinking of other things other than Special Counsel Jack Smith, the immunity issue, and Donald Trump. But that said, they do have a private meeting that's underway right now in a small conference room off the chambers of the Chief Justice John Roberts in which they're handling some of the business from this week, including an important environmental protection case that they heard -- on Wednesday.
 
But among the business that they are likely going to consider this morning is what to do with Donald Trump's appeal of a lower court opinion that said that he should not be shielded from criminal prosecution in the election subversion case that Special Counsel Jack Smith has brought on behalf of the Department of Justice. Just to remind everyone, that's the one that's testing whether Donald Trump will go to trial on charges related to his 2020 election aftermath behavior before the 2024 election is held.
 
So, we could, as early as this afternoon, see an order from the justices that would set perhaps -- this is one option, perhaps a schedule for filings and oral arguments on the merits of that question, that could be pushed into next week, or John, one other possibility is that the justices outright deny Donald Trump's appeal of the lower court ruling and just let stand what is actually a very comprehensive opinion from the D.C. Circuit. Saying, whatever protection Donald Trump had while he was in office from prosecution evaporated once he became a former president.
 
BERMAN:  If they do let it stand, Joan, just very quickly, how would we hear about it?
 
BISKUPIC:  OK. That would come in a much longer order that I don't think that they are ready to issue yet, if that's what's happening. Because, John, it's likely that a couple of the nine justices would dissent from that denial. And if that's happening, which I think is -- you know, there's a small possibility that's happening, I frankly am one person who thinks that the justices want to themselves have the last word on this. But let's say, you know, under your scenario, they're going to deny Trump's appeal, any kind of extra writing from any justice who doesn't think that's the best course, that would be being drafted right now, and likely not ready to be issued immediately.
 
Again, we don't know exactly what's happening, but I think -- again, just -- this is speculation at this point, the more likely possibility is that they will hear this case, and we're going to get some sort of timetable of how expedited that hearing would be. Would it be something that would lead to a decision that would come, you know, early in the spring, or frankly, just by June, or even at the end of the year when the election's already kind of come and gone.
 
BERMAN:  Joan Biskupic, you speak from vast experience with this court. And as you say, it's possible as soon as this afternoon, we could get some direction here.
 
BISKUPIC:  Yes.
 
BERMAN:  Thank you so much for being with us. We know you're watching this closely.
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  So, the legal guardian for Wendy Williams has now filed a lawsuit against "Lifetime's" parent company, just as her life-altering diagnosis is revealed. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
SIDNER:  We are just learning this morning that the legal guardian for former talk show host Wendy Williams is now suing the parent company airing a documentary about Williams' life and health struggles. And this is coming just one day after the world found out that Wendy Williams has been diagnosed with aphasia and dimension -- dementia.
 
CNN Entertainment correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WENDY WILLIAMS, TALK SHOW THE WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW:  Hi. Welcome back.
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A daytime TV icon with unfiltered commentary and off the cuff celebrity gossip. Wendy Williams talk show redefined daytime television and ran for 13 seasons. With an audience who had a front row seat to her extreme candor and at times, personal demons.
 
WILLIAMS:  And you know I've had a struggle with cocaine.
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  In 2019, she tearfully revealed that she was living in a sober house. Two years prior, she fainted live on air. Williams while documented health concerns often resulted in hiatus after hiatus. In her absence, the series ultimately ended in early 2022. The years after, however, have been somewhat mysterious for her fans and even family.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At the peak of her career, she was God.
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  A new docuseries on "Lifetime" explores the Williams saga. It's executive produced by Williams herself. She pitched it as a behind the scenes look at her life with hopes of launching a podcast. But producers soon realized that they were capturing something very different from a comeback.
 
ALEX FINNIE, WENDY WILLIAMS' NIECE:  You are bigger than this. You are better than this.
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Her niece, Alex Finnie, participates in the documentary. Producers say they finished shooting Wendy's portion last year.
 
WILLIAMS:  Are we ready?
 
WAGMEISTER:  Where is your aunt today? FINNIE:  Well, you know, she is away at some, sort of, facility, and she is healing.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
You know, Elizabeth, part of what has been so complicated and challenging about this for myself, and I'll speak for my family in this instance, and that is, we don't have an exact location in terms of where she is. We have no way to actually call her personally.
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  A care team for Williams says the former host has been diagnosed with aphasia and dementia, which can impact communication, personality, and the ability to understand language. Her niece also says the former host has been suffering from alcohol abuse.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Did you drink this whole thing today?
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Shortly after her talk show was cancelled, a New York court appointed a legal guardian to oversee her finances and health. The case has been sealed along with the identity of the guardian.
 
WAGMEISTER:  Can you explain the process of this guardianship and how involved the family is, if at all?
 
FINNIE:  To put it really simply, the family has been shut out. My aunt was placed under this guardianship in April of 2022. She went into court. It was closed, so we don't know the details. And when she came out, she was under this court appointed guardian. And here we are now in February of 2024, and that information is still really limited.
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  CNN has been unable to speak directly to Williams about the project or verify her family's account of their conversations. But we reached out to the care team and they declined comment. As for Finnie, she says she speaks to Williams over the phone and she's hopeful for her aunt's progress, but still has concerns.
 
FINNIE:  Some stuff that people are going to see in this documentary is just not adding up. I think a lot of people are going to have questions in terms of where is the guardian? Where is the oversight?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WAGMEISTER (on camera):  Obviously, the family has concerns about this guardianship. And just this morning, I have a source who tells me that Wendy's legal guardian has filed a suit against "Lifetime's" parent company, A&amp;E. Now, this suit is under seal, so we do not know the contents of it. But obviously, it comes right ahead of this documentary.
 
So, a very sad situation all around. But Wendy's niece does tell me that even though they have concerns about the guardianship, they are happy that now she seems to be getting the proper care that she so desperately needs. SIDNER:  There are so many questions, but it is really hard to see Wendy Williams like that. Even though she has been a polarizing figure, she has been a big figure in entertainment. Elizabeth Wagmeister, thank you so much for your reporting.
 
John.
 
BERMAN:  Thanks so much, Sara.
 
So, this entire show is moving to a whole new time starting on Monday. That seems like a big deal.
