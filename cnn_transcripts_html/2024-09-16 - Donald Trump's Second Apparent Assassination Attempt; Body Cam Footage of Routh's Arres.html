JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: It's 6:00 a.m. in Shanghai, 3:00 p.m. in Los Angeles, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. 
 
 And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome, as always, to "First Move," and here's today's need to know. Another assassination attempt. The Secret Service say a quick acting 
 
 agent prevented the alleged assassin from targeting Former President Donald Trump.
 
Shanghai shaken. China's financial hub brought to a standstill by the strongest storm in over 70 years.
 
TikTok trials. Lawyers and users of the social media giant fighting to overturn a law demanding a forced sale by January 19th.
 
And -- 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And the Emmy goes to "Shogun."
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  -- "Shogun" show good. The Japanese language drama winning an epic 18 Emmys in L.A. All that and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, we begin with Donald Trump's apparent assassination attempt. A clearer picture is now emerging about the investigation, the arrest and the 
 
 criminal past of the suspect, 58-year-old Ryan Routh.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Take two steps to your right. Driver. Walk straight back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Hands in the air, surrounded by police. Body cam footage shows how the suspect was stopped on Sunday near West Palm Beach in Florida. 
 
 Authorities say he fled the scene after getting within just a few hundred meters of the former president at his golf course.
 
According to the criminal complaint, agents found a loaded rifle with a scope. And according to cell phone data, he may have been lying in wait for 
 
 nearly 12 hours. Routh appeared in court Monday to face two federal gun charges. And a short time ago, authorities held a news conference on the 
 
 investigation. Officials are trying to search Routh's cell phone data and social media posts. They say they have interviewed witnesses and the 
 
 suspect's family members, friends, and former colleagues in both Hawaii and North Carolina. At the news conference, the acting director of the U.S. 
 
 Secret Service commended his agents.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RONALD ROWE JR., ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICE:  But what was critical to this was the quick reaction, the response, the hyper vigilance 
 
 of the men and women of the United States Secret Service, who since July 13th have been rising to meet an unprecedented and hyper dynamic threat 
 
 environment. And they are rising to this moment, and I could not be more proud of them and the way they have executed, not only yesterday, but what 
 
 they're doing today and what they are doing tomorrow, and what they will always do because it is their duty.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  And Randy Kaye has more on the day's developments.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Does that mean right there at that spot in those bushes, or could it have been, you know, down the street at a 
 
 restaurant?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was in very close proximity to where he was spotted by the Secret Service. In terms of your first question, whether he was 
 
 there earlier, our investigation is still looking to determine that.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Ryan Wesley Routh may have been lying in wait for his spot in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club for nearly 12 hours. 
 
 That's according to court documents unsealed today, showing Routh's phone was in the vicinity of the area, starting as early as 2:00 a.m. Sunday 
 
 morning. Prosecutors also revealed in court documents that the serial number on the rifle recovered from the area where Routh was spotted was 
 
 unreadable to the naked eye.
 
Just before 2:00 p.m., Secret Service noticed the barrel of a rifle poking through a fence at Trump International Golf Club. Trump was somewhere 
 
 between the 5th and 6th hole at the time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When you look at the map, you see a roadway very close to holes five and six, which it would make sense that that would be a 
 
 location, if you were going to try to take a shot, it would be closer and would give you an opportunity to do so and also give you an escape route.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  The Secret Service fired on the man with the gun before he fled.
 
ROWE JR.:  He did not fire or get off any shots at our agent.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  A quick-thinking witness at the scene provided authorities with a description of the suspect, as well as a picture of the 
 
 car and license plate. Martin County deputies detained Routh a short time later. CNN obtained this body cam video of Routh's arrest.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The witness from the incident at Trump International was flown to the scene by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, and he 
 
 was able to make a positive I.D.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
KAYE (voice-over):  In the bushes at the golf club, authorities recovered an SKS style rifle with a scope, two backpacks equipped with ceramic tiles 
 
 for a makeshift bulletproof vest, and a GoPro. Since then, a complicated picture has emerged of Ryan Routh.
 
A 58-year-old small business owner from Hawaii. CNN has learned that Routh supported Trump in 2016, but later dismissed him as a buffoon and a fool. 
 
 Routh also mentioned Trump in his book titled "Ukraine's Unwinnable War." Routh traveled to Ukraine in 2022 and encouraged others to sign up to 
 
 fight. He did an interview with AFP news agency from Kyiv in April that year.
 
RYAN WESLEY ROUTH, SUSPECT:  Putin is a terrorist and he needs to be ended.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Court documents also detail past run-ins with the law, including felony convictions in North Carolina. In 2002, he pleaded guilty 
 
 to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction and carrying a concealed weapon. Other charges over the years included possession of 
 
 stolen goods, driving without a registration, and failing to pay his taxes on time.
 
Still, unanswered questions remain, including how safe is Trump, and others, given the current political environment?
 
ROWE JR.:  I have ordered a paradigm shift. The Secret Service's protective methodologies work. We need to look at what our protective methodology is. 
 
 We need to get out of a reactive model.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Randi Kaye reporting there. Now, this just in, President Joe Biden spoke with Former President Donald Trump Monday afternoon, and the 
 
 two men had a quote, "cordial conversation," that's coming from a White House spokesperson.
 
Biden also conveyed his relief that Trump was safe, and the former president expressed his thanks for the call. And in a statement to CNN, 
 
 Former President Trump says, quote, "We had a very nice call. It was about Secret Service protection."
 
Earlier Monday, Trump blamed the rhetoric from President Biden and Vice President Harris for the apparent assassination attempt. Both Harris and 
 
 Biden have announced to any political violence.
 
And we're also learning new details, as you were hearing there, about the suspect in the case and his criminal past. It appears 58-year-old Ryan 
 
 Routh, who owns a small construction business in Hawaii voted for Trump in 2016, but he eventually turned on the former president, fixating on issues 
 
 like Ukraine, and even self-published a book about it.
 
Here he is in 2022 at a rally in Kyiv where he called Vladimir Putin a terrorist. Record show Routh has an extensive criminal history in North 
 
 Carolina. Kyung Lah is here with more. I know you've been looking at his background extensively, criminal convictions also, and I pointed to it 
 
 there in terms of his location in Kyiv, some of his travel and social media posts perhaps giving some indication that certainly investigators will be 
 
 looking at in terms of a motive.
 
KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and try to get a fuller picture of exactly what was happening in this man's mind. As far as 
 
 that rap sheet that you're talking about, his criminal history, we have learned that it does date back to the early 2000s. It was really in 2002, 
 
 though, when he became known to North Carolina law enforcement.
 
Our investigative team spoke with a retired sergeant in Greensboro, North Carolina, who was part of a 2002 traffic stop. Listen to this officer, this 
 
 former officer, as she describes what she saw.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRACY FULK, FORMER GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA POLICE SERGEANT:  He reached over into the center seat and opened a black duffel bag and there was a gun 
 
 laying in there. And he kind of held his hand over the bag for a second as I'm backing up and issuing commands and then he just put the car in gear 
 
 and drove two businesses down and pulled in his business and ran inside.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAH:  And once he ran inside, he was barricaded for some time. He eventually came out. He pled guilty to felony possession of a weapon of 
 
 mass destruction. Sources tell CNN that was a fully automatic weapon. Public records also do reveal some other minor financial crimes in North 
 
 Carolina. We have learned, Julia, that he did, as you mentioned, moved to Hawaii.
 
But it was really in the last couple of years that this obsession with Ukraine really came into the picture, and it was at that point that we saw 
 
 that he was traveling directly there. He became personally involved. He went to Kyiv. He wanted to join the fight, but he was too old. He was told 
 
 at the time, 56 years old. So, he set up camp in the main square and he did multiple interviews with a number of journalists like that journalist you 
 
 see in that video there.
 
He also reached out to Ukraine's foreign legion. And we reached out to that spokesperson. They say that Routh had contacted them several times saying 
 
 of those reach outs quote, "The best way to describe his messages is delusional ideas." Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Kyung Lah, there. Thank you so much for your reporting. Now, as the investigation continues, the suspect, Ryan Routh, will remain in 
 
 custody for now and we'll be back in court next week.
 
In the meantime, the FBI will continue to interview witnesses and collect further evidence. For more, we're joined by Senior National Security 
 
 Analyst, Juliette Kayyem. Juliette, great to have you with us. There's two things for me. There's this event and the individual that we're talking 
 
 about and his potential motives. And then, there's the broader security arrangement around the former president and what it says about a second 
 
 apparent assassination attempt in a number of months.
 
First to the individual and what you make of what we've seen in the last 24 hours.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST AND FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  So, I mean, his motive is 
 
 one of the most interesting aspects of it. He seems to -- I mean, he has a criminal record. He's for Trump and then he's against Trump. He has a 
 
 fixation on Ukraine. I think we're always looking for, you know, is someone on the left, is someone on the right, pro-Trump, anti-Trump. And I think 
 
 what we're seeing is that it's a. A complicated issue as regards to what would have brought someone like this who's lived on social media, but has 
 
 not been particularly focused on Donald Trump to try to assassinate him. There's some gap there.
 
One of the things that people like me would look at would be to the extent to which the Butler, Pennsylvania assassination attempt served as a sort of 
 
 trigger or he -- or copycat. We always worry about copycats.
 
The second thing is, is the security -- lapse is a strong word, but the fact that he was there for more than 10 hours waiting for Trump, that 
 
 strikes me as a big vulnerability. It is because the entire area isn't closed down because Trump was -- is a private citizen doing -- is in 
 
 private. And so, that's -- those are the issues that they're going to have to address.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Because certainly, when we heard the press conference earlier Monday, they were saying that this was a success by the security forces, 
 
 that this individual was located and found. But you raise a great point, which was that what was happening for the 10 hours preceding when allegedly 
 
 he was in place and admittedly the former president wasn't there, but then obviously was.
 
More broadly, do you think there needs to be a rethink about the security arrangements surrounding, actually, both the former president, the current 
 
 president, the vice president, that's now a presidential nominee? It's three rather than two heading into a presidential election. And that the 
 
 suggestion really is that the resources are tight?
 
KAYYEM:  Right. And President Biden has said that, that the resources are tight. Some of it is because the Secret Service is part of the Department 
 
 of Homeland Security, which has been very, very focused on the border. We have an internal threat.
 
Here's what needs to happen. We need to base security on sort of constitutional status. So, Trump falls outside of that now. He's not the 
 
 president. He's a former president, but also the risk to the individual. And what we're seeing now is we had seen with President Obama as the first 
 
 African American president is that the threat level is higher for that particular individual.
 
So, you're going to have to have some sort of combination. Not every -- you know, not every former president is as public or politically involved as 
 
 the nominee as Donald Trump. Most of them retire. Most of them go play golf or go to their ranch or -- and are not in the public eye like this. So, it 
 
 is going to require a rethink.
 
CHATTERLEY:  This attempt was thwarted. The alternative is unthinkable, and we had a brush with that, I think, with the first attempt on the former 
 
 president's life. But I think we have to consider the toxic forces that will be unleashed in the event that something isn't thwarted. How do you 
 
 even prepare for that kind of eventuality in such a divisive environment, 50 days before a presidential election?
 
Because I think you raised a good point about the risk of copycat events, whether or not this one is and whether it raises the risk that perhaps 
 
 other people now in light of two and one apparent, as we're calling it, raises the risk of more.
 
KAYYEM:  -- worry that here in the United States if someone says, well, they've tried to -- you know, someone on the other side says, well, they're 
 
 trying to kill Trump, rightfully so, if you believe. And so, why don't we try to go after someone on the other side? We've seen at least Nancy 
 
 Pelosi, the speaker of the house at the time, husband attack for political reasons.
 
So, that is the fear. And it is a threat environment that is like nothing we've ever seen before for this democracy. We've had heightened threat 
 
 levels in terms of, say, September 11, the terrorist attack, but those weren't existential threats. Right now, we, as a democracy, are facing one. 
 
 It is -- first, it is because violence has become, in a weird way, a natural extension of our democratic differences. It is we're way -- in the 
 
 United States, we are way too casual about it now. And I think, you know, everyone needs to see where this is leading.
 
I think the second issue is, we are, you know, a highly armed society. And so, the ability of someone who maybe has a thought that -- to become 
 
 famous, to videotape, as we saw in this case, with a GoPro and assassination also would have the capacity to do it because of weaponry.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
I -- you know, and how do you prepare for an assassination? The answer is you don't. That we cannot allow these kinds of vulnerabilities anymore. If 
 
 it's resources, get the resources. If it's planning, change the planning. If it is getting Donald Trump or Vice President Harris to change the way 
 
 they campaign, then do it. Because the alternative is sort of, given the environment, is somewhat unfathomable.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Words, every word should be weighed, I think, to your point. Very quickly on this, obviously, very powerful owner of the social media 
 
 platform X in a post that's now been deleted, raised a question with an emoji that this was a targeting of the former president and that we're not 
 
 seeing the current president and vice president being targeted.
 
Given the you're understanding, the risks associated with the moment, how do you view a post that's now been deleted like that from someone so 
 
 influential?
 
KAYYEM:  Yes. There -- I mean, there's two things. One is, you know, I take these men at their word. And I have been very, very critical of Donald 
 
 Trump as well in terms of the language. These aren't jokes. This isn't trolling, whatever. These are people with incredible platforms. They know 
 
 exactly what that language does to their listeners, and -- not all of their followers, but some percentage, some small percentage may feel radicalized 
 
 before -- because of it.
 
The other is just proof that Elon Musk is just -- he's like a man child. I mean, who does this in the middle of a -- of the -- I mean, you know, the 
 
 investigation had just started and should be criticized for that. His influence on Twitter and X, you know, is without compare. One wishes he 
 
 would use it wisely. He has proven himself not to.
 
The cat is out of the bag though, as they say, he -- the delete means nothing to me or to anyone who may have read it and agreed with him.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, to your earlier point, words should be weighed, whether they're written or spoken. Juliette, great to get your wisdom. Thank you. 
 
 Juliette Kayyem there.
 
All right. Coming up for us. Shanghai soaked. A powerful typhoon bringing the Chinese city to a standstill. The strongest storm to hit the area since 
 
 the 1940s. We've got the details.
 
And succession obsession. Murdoch family members battling it out in court over who gets control of their media empire. The latest on the billionaire 
 
 family feud coming up. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." China's suffering a once in a lifetime storm. Typhoon Bebinca is the strongest to hit Shanghai in more 
 
 than seven decades. It's restricting power use and bringing the financial capital to a standstill. Bebinca made landfall during the Mid-Autumn 
 
 Festival, ruining travel plans too.
 
For more, we're joined by Chad Myers. Chad, great to have you with us. More bad news, though. What more can we expect here?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Well, the rain is done. The wind is done. But there's another storm in the water that is headed to the south of 
 
 Shanghai just in the upcoming days. So, yes, there was wind. Yes, there was some damage. And this thing (ph), it came on shore as 130 KPH storm. This 
 
 was a very healthy storm. It was forecasted to be less than that, by the time it made landfall. But it never really lost that power. It continued to 
 
 have the power because, well, the water is still so warm out there.
 
This is not the end of typhoon, cyclone, or hurricane season. This is the middle of it. So, when a storm gets going, it has that much potential. And 
 
 yes, we had a 187-kilometer per hour wind gust on one of the islands out here. So, certainly a very healthy storm.
 
There's more out in the water as well. One that's going to get to Vietnam. Another that's going to get to China. Here's the one here now with a brand-
 
 new name, Pulasan. Here we go. Just coming on shore. Still not going to be a big typhoon, but when you already have things that are slightly damaged, 
 
 including tree limbs and power lines, and you put more wind on top of it, that is not a good scenario.
 
Here it comes right on shore, going to be making its way right across and parts of Okinawa and then very close to Shanghai, but not with the effect 
 
 certainly we had with Yagi last week and certainly maybe not even with the effect we have so far with this storm that just came through today. The 
 
 rainfall will still be there.
 
Then we look at another storm that came through right in the same place that Yagi did hit Hanoi, and that's the next event that's going to possibly 
 
 make some significant rainfall for Vietnam.
 
Now, look at all the rainfall we're having in Europe. This is a big story. There are places that have picked up at least a third of a meter of 
 
 rainfall. The flooding across parts of Poland, Czechia, all the way through these areas, I can't even name all the countries because everyone has seen 
 
 some type of 370 millimeters will make significant rainfall and significant flooding. And it certainly, certainly did. Over four times the average 
 
 rainfall for the area pretty much in general.
 
And significant snow in the Alps. I don't know if you have a trip to the Alps planned this year, Julia, but they're getting a good start. About two 
 
 meters on the ground already at some of the top of these Alps highest elevation. So, wind gusts are there too. Look at that. I mean, the wind 
 
 gusts from this storm, that wasn't really a tropical system, it was more than we had with the landfall in Shanghai.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. And, you know I love snow, but I'm just not ready to give up the sun yet. The summer's not over yet. Don't make it stop. Chad, thank 
 
 you.
 
MYERS:  I was just teasing you. Just poking you a little bit.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I know.
 
MYERS:  Get those tickets.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Too soon. Too soon. Chad Myers there, thank you. Now, as Chad mentioned, Europe also facing a deluge of rain, and it's the right word. 
 
 Sadly, at least 17 people have died following Storm Boris. For some cities, the catastrophic floods are some of the worst they've seen in decades. Max 
 
 Foster has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Mud and misery everywhere. Shell-shocked residents in Romania say the floods came quickly, knocking 
 
 down walls, upending furniture and drowning livestock that couldn't escape the rushing waters.
 
DUMITREL SOTROCAN, ROMANIAN RESIDENT (through translator):  Total damage. Dead chickens, all the geese everything, everything.
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  In parts of rain-soaked Romania, residents are assessing the damage from Storm Boris which unleashed a month's worth of 
 
 rain in a span of a few days over central and eastern Europe.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  We don't have food, water. Look over there, clothes. Look, the neighbor gave me a dress.
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  And while cleanup is underway in some areas, it's still impossible in others where the waters not only haven't receded but 
 
 they're rising. Swift currents race through streets in one Polish town after a nearby river overflowed its banks making it too dangerous for some 
 
 residents to leave their houses. Firefighters tried to pump out water from a local hospital to keep it operational, but it may be a losing battle.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
MARCIN REISCH, NURSE AT POLISH HOSPITAL (through translator):  Everything is flooded, mainly the cellars where the surgical clinic in warehouses are. 
 
 Everyone is now trying to save what they can.
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  In Austria, the Wien River is gushing with excess rain. And there's more expected for portions of Austria, Germany, and the 
 
 Czech Republic in the next few days, which could mean more work for the Czech armed forces, which have been using helicopters to evacuate people 
 
 from flood zones.
 
So far, emergency services say thousands of stranded people have had to be evacuated and significant flooding is expected to continue. Some Czech 
 
 residents use the break in the weather to try to count their losses. But with many of their homes, shops, and neighborhoods still engulfed in water, 
 
 it's feared the damage they can already see could be even worse when the water subsides.
 
Max Foster, CNN.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Max there. Now, coming up for us, return to our top story today, more details on the second apparent assassination attempt 
 
 on Donald Trump and how the U.S. Secret Service is responding.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more of the international headlines this hour. American pastor David Lin is now free 
 
 after spending nearly two decades in a Chinese prison. That's according to the U.S. State Department, who consider him to be quote, "wrongfully 
 
 detained." His release comes amid increased U.S. efforts to stabilize relations with Beijing. Lin had been sentenced to life in prison for 
 
 contract fraud, a charge he denied.
 
A public hearing is underway into the loss of the Titan submersible in June 2023. The U.S. Coast Guard says the Titan sent its final message just six 
 
 seconds before it lost contact with the surface. The former director of engineering from OceanGate also discussed his difficult relationship with 
 
 the late CEO. All five on board the Titan died when the craft was diving to the wreckage of the Titanic.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
And returning once more to our top story today, we're learning more details about the apparent second assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The acting 
 
 Secret Service head saying the suspect did not have a line of sight on the former president.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROWE JR.:  As Former President Trump was moving through the fifth fairway across the course and out of sight of the sixth green, the agent who is 
 
 visually sweeping the area of the sixth green saw the subject armed with what he perceived to be a rifle and immediately discharged his firearm.
 
The subject who did not have line of sight to the former president fled the scene. He did not fire or get off any shots at our agent.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  The suspect in the case is believed to have been lying in wait for almost 12 hours. He's now been charged on two firearms counts. The FBI 
 
 says it's still investigating whether he acted alone.
 
Randi Kaye joins us now from West Palm Beach, Florida. Randi, the Secret Service and the press conference alluded to the success in the fact that no 
 
 shots were fired, that he didn't have a line of sight on the former president, but questions clearly going to be asked in this investigation of 
 
 how and why he was able to lie in wait for so many hours.
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. And this really is coming out because there was an FBI affidavit that was filed with the court documents, 
 
 and that was unsealed today. And that FBI affidavit was talking about his phone records. They were able to track his phone records, and it shows that 
 
 he was pretty much in the vicinity, as they called it, but lying-in wait for Donald Trump, allegedly, from about 1:30 in the morning. So, that would 
 
 put it at about 12 hours because the shooting occurred at around 1:30 in the afternoon on Sunday. So, he was there from about 1:30 in the morning on 
 
 Sunday morning.
 
The question is how long was he in the State of Florida? I asked him -- the FBI special agent in charge, I asked him about that today, they're really 
 
 not sure how long he was in the State of Florida. And I also asked if they could be a little bit more specific about that in the vicinity, does that 
 
 mean that he was actually in those bushes at that fence with his rifle ready to go or could he have been down the street at a restaurant or 
 
 anywhere else in the vicinity? And they said that it was -- the cell phone data does show that he was quite close to that area where the Secret 
 
 Service spotted him with the barrel of his rifle poking through that fence.
 
So, they're pretty clear on that. They also pointed out that they're still looking into whether or not he acted alone, though they do believe that he 
 
 did. But again, they're still trying to figure out his whereabouts, how he got to Florida, how long he was in the State of Florida and how long before 
 
 this happened, had he possibly been planning it? Because as you know, this was not a scheduled event for the former president. This was a last-minute 
 
 golf game. So, how would he have known if he did know that Trump would be there?
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, vitally important question among many to your point. Randi Kaye in Florida for now, thank you so much.
 
Now, for his part, Trump has blamed Democrats, accusing them on X, of inflammatory rhetoric. For more on this, we're joined by Stephen Collinson. 
 
 Stephen, great to have you with us. You wrote a great article, which I recommend everybody reads. I mean, you're my go-to when things like this 
 
 happen. Big events, whether it's events like this, and there is, and are, political connotations, this crass, as you call it, to perhaps discuss it 
 
 in the immediate aftermath.
 
But we are 50 days out from an election. And to my point there in the introduction, there's already been finger pointing over who said what and 
 
 caused what when.
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITIC SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, and to those who argue that it's too early to politicize something like this, the former 
 
 president politicized it himself, first with sending out a fundraising appeal within four hours or so of this apparent attempted assassination 
 
 attempt.
 
And today, he went a lot further. He reacted to an attack, which he said was the result of inflammatory rhetoric by inflaming the political 
 
 temperature even further. He's arguing that President Joe Biden and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, are responsible for this attack because 
 
 of their rhetoric criticizing him. A lot of that rhetoric, of course, is them saying that he's a threat to democracy. And that is borne out by 
 
 Trump's own behavior after the 2020 election, when he didn't accept his loss and tried to steal the election.
 
So, this is a lot more complicated than the former president would say it is. And of course, there probably hasn't been an American politician in the 
 
 last 50, 60 years or so, certainly not one who was a president who was indulged in as much inflammatory rhetoric as in -- as Trump has.
 
So, you know, this is all very complex and a lot of it depends on what side of the political fence you might be on as to what you find offensive.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  And politics aside and rhetoric aside, I think the initial response is sympathy for the awfulness for a second attempt of what the 
 
 former president has faced. We know that President Biden, the former president has spoken, they've described the conversation is as cordial. 
 
 It's important. But what about the personal impact on the former president?
 
We saw a more subdued Donald Trump in the aftermath of the first attempt against his life. And then he seemed to increase the attacks on political 
 
 opponents, threatening to jail them if indeed there is a belief that the election is stolen. He's talked again about 2020 being a stolen election. 
 
 We, again, reiterate there's no proof for that, Stephen. Whether it's the sympathy or the emotional impact on the former president, it does, and this 
 
 does appear to be taking a toll, even if they're describing him as being in good spirit.
 
COLLINSON:  That's true. I don't see how it cannot take a toll on Trump or, at this point, any other candidate, you know, who is going out there, 
 
 giving speeches in this kind of atmosphere. Both Trump and Kamala Harris have been -- ever since the Trump assassination attempt back in July, have 
 
 been addressing outdoor audiences behind bulletproof glass. Indoor events are obviously a lot more easy to secure.
 
You know, I was -- personally, you know, while clearly the president -- the former president was deeply affected by that assassination attempt in 
 
 Pennsylvania when a bullet grazed his ear, and he did appear chained in at least demeanor in the first few days after that, I think we know who Trump 
 
 is. He's not tried to hide it. This is a very close election. He is running on the premise that he's been persecuted unfairly by the Biden 
 
 administration, and he's going to use everything he can. His entire political persona is based on never letting an attack go unresponded.
 
Remember the first gesture that he made after that attempt in Pennsylvania was to stand up and pump his fist and say, fight, fight, fight. That's his 
 
 instinct. So, while it probably is playing with the former president's mind, I'm not sure, you know, how much it's really changing the way that he 
 
 will run in this election because he is showing as he is, who he always has been.
 
CHATTERLEY:  In the end, all that matters in this presidential election is what voters think and what voters want. What, if any, impact do you think 
 
 events like this and, two, in very close succession have on voters?
 
COLLINSON:  To your earlier point, I think that, you know, you would think there would be an outpouring of sympathy not to downplay this attempted 
 
 attack at all, but it wasn't quite as dramatic, and it didn't get as close to the former president as the one in July. And I think it's fair to say 
 
 that we didn't really see a huge change in the political equation after that attack.
 
You know, Trump has been on the national stage for nine years as a presidential candidate and a president and a former president. It's very 
 
 hard to think that anything can happen that changes the public perception of him. You know, he has this 46 percent of Americans who seem like they'll 
 
 vote for him no matter what. The key is, these few thousand, perhaps in a few swing state voters who could decide the election.
 
I'm not sure that anything Trump has done in the last few weeks and even since the second assassination attempt is necessarily really winning over 
 
 those voters. That, I think, is the key question. But it's, you know, impossible to say. I was just talking to someone, and we were commenting 
 
 about so many strange things have happened in this election that whatever the polls say -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Stephen, I'm just going to stop you there because J. D. Vance is speaking in Atlanta and I just want to get to him and hear what he's got 
 
 to say. We'll come back to you. Thank you.
 
SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. Thank you for all that you're doing, and 
 
 thank you for being people of faith who care about this country and love this country enough to fight for it. I'm fighting right there with you and 
 
 I'm honored to be here. So, so thrilled that you had me tonight.
 
I want to -- before I kick off my remarks, I want to offer a couple of notes of appreciation to so many of the dear friends that I have here. I 
 
 want to start, of course, with Ralph Reed. Ralph, thank you, not just for the kind introduction, but for your years of friendship.
 
I first met Ralph actually when I was running in my primary race in the state -- for the Republican Senate race in the state of Ohio. I think we 
 
 had a connection from the very beginning, I think, because we're both people of faith who care a lot about ensuring that our country lives 
 
 according to the common good. And so, Ralph and I have been close for a long time. And of course, thrilled to be here this evening.
 
I also want to recognize some other VIPs who are here this evening. We have, of course, your incredible patriotic and very effective Governor 
 
 Brian Kemp with his lovely wife, Marty. Brian and Marty, thank you both.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
The lights are really bright. So, I can't see anybody I'm introducing. So, please just stand up or wave. I won't be able to see it, but the people 
 
 behind us will. I want to thank Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. Where's Chris?
 
My dear colleague and one of my favorite people in politics, the great senator from Alabama, Katie Britt. Katie, thank you.
 
You have some of the very best congressmen and public servants in the State of Georgia. I know that Mike Collins is here. We're thrilled to have Mike. 
 
 Thank you so much, Mike.
 
We have, I think the best name in the United States Congress, Barry Loudermilk. Barry, where are you?
 
I know we're so grateful to have, not just here tonight, but on the Trump team, we have the great Tulsi Gabbard, former Democratic Congresswoman, but 
 
 a true superstar and a true patriot. And by the way, you know, people think about our party right now, think about the incredible team that we have. We 
 
 have Brian Kemp, Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Tulsi Gabbard, and Bobby Kennedy Jr. What an amazing team of patriots fighting for this country.
 
But of course, there's a lot of disagreement between those two -- those five individuals I just named. And amazingly, amazingly they're all on 
 
 Trump's team for 2024 because we are the party of common sense. We can disagree amicably, but we've got to get common sense back in the White 
 
 House, and that's why we're going to elect Donald J. Trump.
 
I want to thank Georgia Commissioner of Labor Bruce Thompson. Bruce, thank you.
 
And finally, I want to thank Bishop Kelvin Cobaris. Thank you, Bishop. God bless you and thank you for being here. Thank you, Bishop.
 
Now, I want to just talk a little bit about my own faith journey. And some of you have heard a little bit about this, including probably an event 
 
 hosted by Ralph Reed, but a lot of you probably don't know a whole lot about how I left the faith, but eventually came back to it. And I think 
 
 it's instructive because it lets you know a little bit how -- who I am, but it also maybe lets you know a little bit about how I think about the 
 
 challenges confronting our country.
 
Now, I was raised by a working-class grandmother because my mother struggled with opioid addiction for a big chunk of my early life. And my 
 
 Mamaw, for those of you who haven't read the book, that's what I called my grandmother, she was a woman of profound and very thoughtful Christian 
 
 faith. She -- even though she hadn't graduated from high school, my grandmother thought more about the -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  OK. We're going to leave the former president's running mate, J. D. Vance, speaking there in Atlanta. If he mentions anything about the 
 
 assassination attempt this weekend on the former president, the alleged assassination attempt, we will bring it to you straight away. For now, 
 
 we'll leave it there. Stay with us. More to come.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to a potential make or break moment for social media sensation TikTok. The company had its long-awaited day in federal 
 
 court Monday, arguing that a proposed U.S. ban would be a blow to free speech. The U.S. government arguing that the site and its Chinese parent 
 
 company, ByteDance, is a threat to American security. The hearing ended with neither side striking a definitive blow. Clare Duffy has more.
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  Yes, Julia. During this hearing, we heard from an attorney for TikTok, an attorney for TikTok creators who have 
 
 also sued to challenge the ban, and an attorney for the U.S. government defending the law. Each of them technically only had a short time to 
 
 present their case, but the hearing ended up stretching on for about two hours because of some pretty tough questioning from this panel of three 
 
 judges, especially for TikTok.
 
Essentially, these judges are having to consider two key questions here. Does the law violate the First Amendment? And if it does, is there 
 
 sufficient justification in terms of these national security concerns to crack down on speech in this way? TikTok, of course, is arguing that the 
 
 law is an illegal and unjustified violation of the First Amendment rights of both the app and its U.S. users.
 
And in this hearing, TikTok's attorney really hammered on that point. He argued that for the government to restrict the speech of a specific entity 
 
 like this, it would need to face strict scrutiny and have sufficient justification. And given that essentially all we've publicly heard from the 
 
 government at this point is hypothetical concerns that the Chinese government could potentially seek to access U.S. user data from TikTok, 
 
 they say that bar has not been met.
 
But the judges did push back pretty hard in questioning. They asked if the law would really violate the First Amendment when it still leaves room for 
 
 TikTok to operate in the U.S., just not under Chinese control, they said.
 
Now, it's not clear how the judges will rule based on today's hearing, but we're expecting to get a decision in the coming weeks and for the losing 
 
 side to appeal so that this can go to the Supreme Court before that January 19th deadline for a TikTok sale or a ban. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Clare Duffy there. Now, coming up for us, the 76th Emmy Awards favorites like "The Bear" and "Shogun" had a sparkly 
 
 evening before the night ended with a surprise twist. More on that coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." Hollywood showed up in full force for the Emmys on Sunday celebrating the best of American television, 
 
 "Hacks" and "Shogun" won top awards. And just like a good series finale, the award show ended with a surprising twist too. Elizabeth Wagmeister has 
 
 more from L.A.
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Julia, the big winner of the night was "Shogun," the historical drama winning 18 awards, setting all 
 
 sorts of record with 18 wins. It becomes the show in a single season to win the most Emmys, also becoming the first non-English language show in the 
 
 drama category to win. Also, Anna Sawai, who won for Best Dramatic Actress, is the first Asian actress to win in that category.
 
Now, the biggest surprise of the night was when "Hacks" won for Best Comedy Series. This came after Jean Smart winning for best comedic actress, but 
 
 nobody had predicted that "Hacks" would win in the best comedy category. It was expected that "The Bear" would win. So, this was a huge shock. There 
 
 was a big audible gasp in the room. I was there in the theater.
 
Now, "The Bear" doing just fine, winning 11 awards last night, beating its own record from the last Emmys when it won 10 awards. Last night, walking 
 
 away with three major acting awards, including for star Jeremy Allen White and for star Liza Colon Zayas, who became the first Latina actress to win 
 
 for best supporting comedic actress.
 
Now, in her speech, she spoke to her community, but she also had a message for voters. Let's take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIZA COLON ZAYAS, ACTRESS, "THE BEAR":  And to all the Latinas who are looking at me, keep believing and vote. Vote for your rights.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WAGMEISTER:  That was not the only star to get political on the stage at the Emmy Awards. Selena Gomez, who was the first presenter of the night 
 
 with her "Only Murders in the Building" co-star Steve Martin and Martin Short, made a childless cat lady's joke, of course a jab, to J. D. Vance. 
 
 And Candice Bergen also making a nod to J. D. Vance when she spoke about her legendary TV role, "Murphy Brown."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CANDICE BERGEN, ACTRESS, "MURPHY BROWN":  And in one classic moment, my character was attacked by Vice President Dan Quayle when Murphy became 
 
 pregnant and decided to raise the baby as a single mother. Oh, how far we've come.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WAGMEISTER:  The cast of "The West Wing" also reunited coming at the show's 25th anniversary, and they spoke about how back in the day when they filmed 
 
 that show they had to create storylines, but today, if they were doing the show that they would just take storylines from the headlines. So, a lot of 
 
 politics to talk about, a lot of TV to talk about, but all around an exciting night, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Elizabeth Wagmeister there. And a special award for her top, quite frankly, which we're going to discuss, the two of us 
 
 later. If we're totally underdressed.
 
Now, as Elizabeth said, "Shogun" had a big night at the Emmys. On top of earning the top prize for drama, it did also snag the most nominations with 
 
 star Hiro Sanada winning best lead actor in a drama.
 
Now, if you remember, and are a regular viewer, I sat down with him earlier this year and he spoke to me about bringing his culture to a western 
 
 audience.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HIRO SANADA, ACTOR AND PRODUCER, "SHOGUN" (through translator):  If I could use words, like scattering flowers and falling leaves, what a bonfire my 
 
 poems would make.
 
SANADA:  My role, Toronaga, has a real model in the history called Ieyasu. He stopped the war period and then created the peaceful era for about 260 
 
 years. That's why he became a hero. So, he was my own hero as well since I was a kid. And then, now I'm playing his role. He's mysterious and 
 
 strategist, but also a human being, a family man as well. Not a stereotypical samurai.
 
So, I tried to, you know -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  That was like a Hollywood depiction of the samurai that you just did there, which actually is another part of it.
 
SANADA:  So, we tried to make, you know, more authentic as much as possible.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Actually, for me, that's the perfect word. The authenticity of this, whether it's to Japanese culture in some way, to Japanese history.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
I just wonder whether that is part of the success actually of this series for some reason, and perhaps we look at the broader world and understand, 
 
 we're searching for purpose of life, loyalty, family.
 
SANADA:  I believe so. Because this story is, you know, based on the novel and then fictional entertainment.
 
CHATTERLEY:  But?
 
SANADA:  But, you know, to make the story and the character believable, we had to make authentic to focus on the drama. You know, if -- nowadays, 
 
 people knows about the Japanese culture much more than '80s and easy to research. So, we cannot, you know, make mistakes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  We'll finish the show where we started. "Shogun" show good gets my recommendation. And that just about wraps up this show. Thank you 
 
 for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow.
