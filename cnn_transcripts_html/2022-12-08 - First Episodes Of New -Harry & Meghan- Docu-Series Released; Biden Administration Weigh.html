BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome back.
 
Netflix viewers are getting a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of Meghan and Harry. The first three episodes of their new docu-series are available for streaming right now. CNN has been watching and can report some details.
 
The couple describes their contentious relationship with the media. Meghan calls their engagement an orchestrated reality show, and Harry says physical harassment from paparazzi has been made worse by social media.

PRINCE HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX:  This is about duty and service, and I feel as though being part of this family, it is my duty to uncover this exploitation and bribery that happens within our media. No one knows the full truth. Um, we know the full truth, the institution knows the full truth, and the media know the full truth because they've been in on it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO:  With me now, CNN's royal historian Kate Williams, and my co- anchor and royal correspondent Max Foster, who are both analyzing all of this.
 
Max, let's begin with you. What are the most significant revelations in these first three episodes?
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  There wasn't the big bombshell that a lot of people were expecting. Perhaps that comes out in the second set of three episodes next week, which is where they talk much -- talk much more about the moment where they leave the royal family -- the decision behind that, or their royal roles, at least. And that is where, really, the height of their tensions.
 
This is very much about how they met and how they were introduced to the family as a couple. Harry suggesting that people in the family didn't think this relationship with this American actress would last. And also, Meghan talking about how being an American actress was a bit of a challenge for them. They didn't know quite how to handle her, particularly when she was so smart, and amazing, and intelligent. So there's a lot of that. 
 
I think that the fundamental attack here is on the media and particularly, the idea that they weren't protected by the palace against these media attacks, particularly around the racial slurs, as they saw it, in the tabloid media. Why didn't the palace act on their behalf more vociferously? Why didn't they answer back more? 
 
There is this policy that you don't respond to all the media engagements you get every day as a member of the royal family. If you did, you'd be very busy with it and you'd be dragged down by it, feeling as you should rise up. You should represent continuity. Rise above the fray.
 
But they felt that a lot of the accusations and the -- and the transgressions of the British media weren't addressed properly by the palace. And they're also suggesting that perhaps other members of the palace or the family benefited more from that. 
 
They -- Harry believing that it's the race element that made things different for Meghan and they should have acted on that and they didn't. And that's the big criticism in this first part of the docu- series that we've seen this morning.
 
NOBILO:  Oh, the race element. 
 
We hear from Meghan in the docu-series about her experiences growing up. She talks about it being challenging and sort of an insightful experience to be a minority but not immediately be recognized as one. And particularly, a traumatic experience where her mom is the subject of verbal abuse.
 
But what do we learn about Meghan's experience with race?
 
KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL HISTORIAN:  Yes. Well, Meghan does talk, as you say -- she talks about her experience in race that many people thought that she was not a woman of color and there were a bit distressing experiences when people realized that she was and suddenly, it was oh, no, I don't find you attractive anymore. She's talked about that before.
 
I mean, complete very horrific racism, and that her mother was the target of verbal racist abuse that Meghan really experienced the suffering. 
 <br>[05:35:00]
 
And I think, very clearly, when she came into the royal family this was compounded because there was the usual sexism that is directed towards women marrying into the royal family -- the usual sexism. There was anti-Americanism. There was xenophobia. But on top of that, there was racism. There were stories that we talked about -- exotic DNA. There were --
 
 there were stories that made explicitly clear that they were talking about race and how -- and was that unconventional were used when what she was doing -- things like nail varnish when the -- and things like this, which really were ways of saying this isn't the kind of person we want as a princess and we are not at home with seeing as a Black princess, which is what she was.
 
And David Olusoga, in the series, was saying that the royal family has finally caught up with multicultural Britain and, of course, the majority -- people of color -- Commonwealth. 
 
But certainly, within the family, it's a -- it was about the institution. The house is a very white institution and Meghan felt she was not supported. And she was also often thrown to the wolves.
 
NOBILO:  Speaking of the royal family catching up with modern Britain, Max, there are a couple of statements -- actually, not from Harry and Meghan necessarily, but from others who were speaking in the documentary about how this idea of royal family anointed by God and by blood, ruling over the country, and others in the modern world can sit uncomfortably.
 
How damaging is the 50 percent of the series that we've seen already? How damaging will that be for the palace?
 
FOSTER:  I think -- you know, there is this mystique to the palace and the royal family which is very alluring, and that's been one of the great attractions. And I think they're making the point that there -- it is this -- it's really for people outside the U.K. I think to understand how transcendent, really, the British monarchy is in this country. 
 
But that's what Harry and Meghan are really breaking down by telling the true story of what happens behind palace walls and it's not perfect behind walls. And that's the big challenge for the palace because they don't talk about what goes on behind the scenes and this is incredibly awkward for them. 
 
But a lot of the allegations in here have been made already in that Oprah interview, but they're really fleshing it out. There's almost a historic document. 
 
Their main focus here is on the conspiracy between the palace and the media, and this is where Harry speaks to that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DUKE OF SUSSEX:  I mean, anyone can be a royal expert. The whole point of it is to try and lend legitimacy to media articles and they get paid for it. And that sort of press pack of royal correspondents is essentially just an extended P.R. arm of the royal family. So there's been an agreement that's been there for over 30 years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER:  I think what a lot of those royal correspondents would say is that they are constantly challenging the system and there's a lot of negative stories about the British royal family in the British media, and I think a lot of British people recognize that. So I think that will be one area where they could be challenged by the royal correspondents.
 
He's also critical of the family, particularly the men in the family who don't necessarily -- here's the quote. "I think there are many people in the family, especially amongst the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold as opposed to somebody who you perhaps are destined to be with."
 
I think there is a very clear example there. Perhaps it's Charles and Diana. They were arguably put together and seen as a perfect couple and a perfect future king and queen, and that eventually broke down. But who else is Harry speaking about there? That's quite challenging for the family.
 
But there's nothing here that I think the palace has to respond to immediately. They may be waiting to see the next three episodes to see if there's a bombshell in there.
 
NOBILO:  And it -- you would think that is more likely as chronologically the series is building up to the time where they do part ways and then withdraw from royal duties.
 
Max Foster and Kate Williams, thank you both so much for joining us.
 
The U.S. weighing Ukraine's request for a controversial weapon. A new CNN exclusive next.

NOBILO:  An update now on what we're learning from the new "HARRY &amp; MEGHAN" documentary. The first few episodes recently dropped. 
 
In episode three, the Duchess of Sussex describes her frantic confusion while trying to get ready for her first so-called royal walkabout. And Harry describes a media frenzy that took on a new life online.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DUKE OF SUSSEX:  Back in my mom's day it was physical harassment. You know, cameras in your face, following you, chasing you. 
 
Harassment really exists more online now. Once the photographs are out and the story is then put next to it, then comes the social media harassment. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO:  Much more on the release of the "HARRY &amp; MEGHAN" docu-series coming up ahead.
 
It's considered one of the most controversial requests from Ukraine since the war began. According to multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials who spoke exclusively with CNN, Ukraine has been urging the U.S. for months to provide the Ukrainian military with cluster munitions -- weapons banned by more than 100 countries.
 
Both Ukraine and Russia have used cluster bombs in this war, but according to an investigation by Human Rights Watch, Russians have used them more often and against civilian targets. 
 
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is warning of an increasing threat of nuclear war and says his country will use, quote, "all means available if necessary." 
 <br>[05:45:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We will proceed from what we have. There can be only one answer from our side -- a consistent fight for our national interests. We will continue to do so and let no one count on anything else. 
 
Yes, we will do it in different ways and in terms of means, first of all. Of course, we will focus on peaceful means. But if nothing else remains, then we will defend ourselves with all available means at our disposal.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO:  Ukraine, meanwhile, is getting more weapons. Germany is planning to send 18-wheeled Howitzers along with other items, including 100 drone defense sensors. 
 
This, as the fighting grinds on. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 10 civilians were killed in a Russian strike in a town in Donetsk. In Kherson, in the south, he says four police officers were killed by Russian mines.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Scott McLean to discuss. Scott, what is the military advantage of these cluster munitions? Why does Ukraine want them?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Well, first off, they want them because the U.S. has a lot of an older model that they no longer use on the battlefield that are essentially collecting dust. And so, the Ukrainians are saying we could use these.
 
They're also extremely effective when it comes to killing your enemy, frankly. And one Ukrainian lawmaker said that this could really turn the tide in this war and help bring this war to an end much quicker.
 
And I'll show you what I mean. So, when we're talking about more conventional weapons, typically they have an area that causes maximum destruction about 50 meters wide. When we're talking about these cluster bombs -- these cluster
 
 munitions, the main bomb actually breaks up into dozens of smaller bomblets, you might call them, and this causes destruction over a much wider area -- about 100 meters wide. So you can see why these are quite attractive. 
 
The difficulty, though, is that obviously, it is difficult to be precise -- frankly, impossible to be precise. The Ukrainians say look, we're going to use them on military targets, not on civilian areas. But obviously, war is complicated. It's difficult to find soldiers that are completely detached from the civilian population. That's pretty unusual.
 
Plus, oftentimes some of the smaller bombs don't actually detonate and so they become sort of de facto land mines. And that is why the U.S. Congress has restricted the transfer of these weapons.
 
Now, the Biden administration, according to sources, says that look, it hasn't ruled out explicitly the transfer of these weapons but it also hasn't seriously considered it either, Bianca.
 
NOBILO:  So how have cluster munitions been used in the conflict so far?
 
MCLEAN:  Yes, with extremely deadly consequences. And perhaps one of the best examples of that came back in April. According to a U.N. report, the bomb that was used to hit a train station in Kramatorsk -- a city in eastern Ukraine -- that killed some 60 people and injured more than 100. That was a good example of a cluster bomb according to that report. And the aftermath of this scene was absolutely horrific. 
 
There have been other examples as well. And it's important to stress that both sides have used these. The Russians obviously more often -- more often against civilian targets. But the U.N. says that look, there have been civilian casualties from the Ukrainian side as well. 
 
They've even used them back to 2014, really, at the outset of this -- of this conflict. There was one particular attack that actually killed a Red Cross worker.
 
So, Ukraine is sort of trying to claim the moral high ground in this war and obviously, they are the victims here. There's no doubt about that. But obviously, when we're talking about these weapons and how you go about war, certainly, it's going to be difficult to use these things without causing civilian casualties.
 
NOBILO:  Indeed.
 
Scott McLean, thank you.
 
A castle in eastern Germany has been under police surveillance after an alleged plot by a far-right group to overthrow the German government was uncovered. 
 
The castle belongs to a suspected ring leader who goes by the name Prince Heinrich XIII. He's a descendant of a dynasty that once ruled parts of eastern Germany but his title is now only a formality. Heinrich is among 25 suspected members of supporters of the group who were arrested in a series of police raids on Wednesday. 
 
Officials say their goal was to put an end to democracy in Germany and bring back a monarchy with Heinrich at the helm.
 
Peru was again plunged into political turmoil on Wednesday with the impeachment and arrest of its embattled president. Angry supporters of President Pedro Castillo faced off against riot police as tense drama unfolded in the capital. 
 
Castillo and his family have been embroiled in investigations since he came to power 18 months ago. And early Wednesday, he announced he was dissolving Congress in an apparent bid to stay in power. Critics accused Castillo of attempting a coup. Within hours, he'd been impeached and taken into custody. 
 
The vice president was quickly sworn in as Peru's first female president and became the sixth head of state in just five years.
 
We'll be right back.

NOBILO:  One last recap on our top story. The new royal revelations released by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their new documentary. The unprecedented series dropped about two hours ago. Meghan making it clear why she and Harry decided to move forward with the series.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DUCHESS OF SUSSEX:  I'm not going to say that it's comfortable but when you feel like people haven't gotten any sense of who you are for so long it's really nice to just be able to have the opportunity to let people have a bit more of a glimpse into what's happened and also who we are.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO:  Harry went on to say that to watch another woman he loves go through the media feeding frenzy that his mother endured is hard and that it's basically the hunter versus the prey.
 <br>[05:55:05]
 
It is an intimate portrayal of the couple with private moments shared, some which they filmed themselves before the documentary series officially started shooting.
 
And we'll have much more for you throughout the entire day as we unpack the series and all the revelations contained within it. And also, if we get any reaction from the royal family and the palace itself.
 
That does it here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London. I'll see you next from Buckingham Palace. "CNN THIS MORNING" is next.
