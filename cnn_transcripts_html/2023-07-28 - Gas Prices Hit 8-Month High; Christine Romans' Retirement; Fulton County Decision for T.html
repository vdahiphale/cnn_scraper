THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[08:30:00] 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: It's so in contrast with some of the ads we've seen from other PACs, DeSantis' PAC, et cetera, Trump, but he's doing really well, favorability. He's rising in the polls. 
 
VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. Hey, listen -
 
HARLOW: Can you win on a message like that? 
 
JONES: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Win a nomination on a positive message? 
 
JONES: I hope so. And (INAUDIBLE) my Republican colleague, but I hope so.
 
And, look, there have been these moments in the Republican Party where, you know, there was a black candidate, was it - you know, Herman Cain or a, you know, and others who have gotten the attention, they couldn't hold on to the football. There will be a moment that will be Tim Scott's moment. And it's just a question of, will he be able to hold on to the football? 
 
ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think that's right. I think if anyone is going to have a big moment and potentially overtake Ron DeSantis, it will be Tim Scott. He's got the money to do it. He's got the story. He's got the backing, support of other Republican senators. So, I'll be watching to see how he does. 
 
HARLOW:  Yes, thank you all very much. We appreciate it. 
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Just ahead here, we have a new statement actually into CNN. Senator Mitch McConnell's office says the minority leader plans to serve out the rest of this Congress. The statement does not address his plans after the next Congress, which is set to begin, of course, in 2025. McConnell up for re-election in 2026. 
 
HARLOW: Also, your gas getting more expensive. You're probably noticing it. Highest level since last November. Our chief business correspondent Christine Romans here to tell us when it might go down and why. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HARLOW: Your gas is getting more expensive. Gas prices have hit an eight-month high with the national average for regular unleaded now around $3.73 a gallon. The increase comes as excessive heat is leading to outages at U.S. refineries. 
 
Let's talk to our chief business correspondent Christine Romans about this.
 
Good morning. 
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi. 
 
HILL: Hi.
 
ROMANS: Gas prices have been coming down for months. And so people are starting to notice when they fill up at the gas station that it's more and more expensive. 
 <br>[08:35:02]
 
$3.73 a gallon. You know, that's still a lot less than it was a year ago. We were at $4.28 a year ago. Remember those record high gas prices last summer that were so frightening? 
 
So, they've come off from them. But why are they bubbling up a little bit now? A couple of things. That excessive heat. You can't run a refinery full tilt when it's 115, you know, in the - with the - with the heat index. Just like people can't be outside and can't be working in that - so it's -- that's one of the problems. 
 
The other problem is, you've got commodity prices in general that have been rising because of what's going on in Ukraine. The Russians have pulled out of a really important grain export deal. So, that's - that's what's happening here. So you're starting to see those gas prices rise a little bit. 
 
HILL: So, those are two big factors that are tough to control in many respects. 
 
ROMANS: Yes.
 
HILL: We're hoping the heat backs off a little bit. 
 
ROMANS: Right.
 
HILL: Will that be enough? 
 
ROMANS: Well, this is part of the inflation picture, right? We're going to see for the next eight weeks whether the Fed thinks inflation is under control and can stop raising interest rates. But this is an important part of the inflation picture, the gas part of it, and it's starting to rise a little bit here again, but well below last year's levels. 
 
HILL: Yes. Context is key. 
 
ROMANS: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Context is key.
 
OK, Christine, stick around. We have another huge story to talk to you about.
 
ROMANS: Yes. OK.
 
HARLOW: This one started 24 years ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMANS: No one wants to stand in the way if Argentina is the next emerging markets domino to fall. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Who is that brilliant beauty? Even more beautiful today. That is Christine Romans making her CNN debut in 1999. Since then she has been an integral part of not just this team but this network. She is CNN as the chief business correspondent, anchor of "EARLY START," she has covered six presidential elections, a dot-com boom and bust, the September 11th attack, a housing bubble, financial crisis, a global pandemic. In between it, she fit in a wedding and three beautiful baby boys, three books and ten years of 3:00 a.m. wake-up calls. And today is her final day with us at CNN. 
 
I'm at a loss for words because you have meant so much to all of us and to this network. 
 
ROMANS: Oh. Well, I feel like everybody here, these guys included, are all our friends. You know, this has been a really -- I am full of gratitude for the 24 years here, seriously. I mean this has been an amazing place to work. And I have learned so much. That green reporter that you saw there, I mean I was -- that was the Argentine debt crisis. I was, you know, learning everything I could about Argentina and its economy. And just - I'm just grateful for the platform. 
 
HILL: Well, we'd love to take a look back at some more of that work. So, indulge us for a moment. And everybody at home, indulge this (INAUDIBLE).
 
ROMANS: Twenty years of haircuts.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Christine Romans, the official new co-anchor of the "EARLY START" broadcast. 
 
ROMANS: I know. It' s-it's my first day, so, please be nice. 
 
Welcome to "AMERICAN MORNING," everyone. 
 
This is CNN's "SATURDAY EDITION." I'm financial news correspondent Christine Romans. 
 
Live from The New York Stock Exchange, this is "STREET SWEEP."
 
Welcome to "YOUR MONEY." I'm Christine Romans. 
 
It's an unprecedented tragedy for New York's financial district and for world market and a rare occurrence in financial market history as well. U.S. stock markets will be closed for three straight weekdays. 
 
BERMAN: Christine Romans on the phone right now with the Bureau of Labor Statistics to find out more about what's going on inside that data. 
 
ROMANS: So this is what - so this is what I can tell you when you look inside that data. We're going to get the full press release here in just a minute. You know, a bunch of different tables. But this is essentially better than expected. 
 
About 300 people slept overnight at the New York Stock Exchange. Dick Grasso, the chairman, said he slept on a couch. You had a lot of unshaven, unshowered, pretty grumpy people when the opening bell range. 
 
This oil spill is devastating in so many ways, but it's not devastating so far for BP's bottom line. 
 
Nothing is more critical to your money than your job. And American jobs are disappearing fast. 1.9 million jobs have vanished so far this year. 
 
Do we expect she'll stay at Facebook for the long term? I mean I know that some of her compensation is tied to staying there for a few more years. 
 
HARLOW: Right. It is. But she's got plenty of money. 
 
ROMANS: For some farmers they've never seen, in the fields, this many poor years right in a row. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Probably not.
 
ROMANS: Don't you worry about borrowing all that money? 
 
We've got some money. I have real money from CNN. Thank you CNN for this real money, and we're going to go learn how to spend it.
 
The U.S. State Department now telling Americans not to travel abroad at all because of coronavirus. 
 
Millions are waiting anxiously for help. They have rents and mortgages and bills to pay April 1st. They are losing their jobs or they are having their paychecks cut. 
 
I don't know exactly what they're digesting. They're trying to figure out just how this election race is going to come out. 
 
If George Bush had lost, it would have been just like his father, who lost, and then immediately the economy started showing signs of strength. 
 
What does Barack Obama want to do about so many disparate problems in the economy right now. 
 
There's a little less optimism about the status quo. And they're going to be looking for signs that fiscal cliff movement is happening. 
 
Zero more days until the election. Zero more hours, in fact. Zero more rallies. Zero nor debates. Zero more October surprises. Zero more November reversals.
 
The Trump campaign is spreading more baseless claims of election fraud as it tries to contest Joe Biden's victory. 
 <br>[08:40:02]
 
My grandmother's name is Shirley Jean Pedersen. And she remembers her grandma, Anna Jacobine Pedersen. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And asks, who paid your passage? 
 
ROMANS: Wow. That's so - that's -- you know, I always heard about the ticket for all those years. But then to see it. 
 
They feel persecuted for their success.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, that's the biggest bunch of nonsense ever. 
 
ROMANS: What keeps Jamie Dimon up at night? 
 
JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: Cyber. Cyber, cyber, cyber, cyber. it is a national risk.
 
ROMANS: What was the toughest part or the challenge of creating this land, especially when you're, you know, under the eyes of "Star Wars" fans? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was never too much detail. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know I wanted to try them on. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why don't you?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you mind? OK. Because -
 
ROMANS: Oh, my gosh.
 
DOLLY PARTON, MUSICIAN: Music in general really have pushed through many ideas. 
 
ROMANS: Everybody's different. That's the other thing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I be your friend?
 
ROMANS: You can definitely be my friend, (INAUDIBLE). 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I come over for dinner? 
 
ROMANS: You - what do you like to eat?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I like suet.
 
ROMANS: I can't believe they found the video of the ringing of the closing bell. Oh, my gosh, all those haircuts. 
 
HILL: A lot of haircuts. A great co-host, who was by your side for many years. 
 
ROMANS: And this guy, yes. I know you were - you know, John and I are different kinds of anchors. We're just --
 
BERMAN: You're good. 
 
ROMANS: No. Because in the breaks I like to talk. I like to fill the time and talk and I want to talk to John about his life and everything. And John likes to look at baseball scores. So, we have this thing where I'm just like jabbering away and John's like just looking at baseball scores. But, we got along fine. 
 
BERMAN: Christine Romans informed me this morning that she wasn't my first co-anchor, but she was my favorite.
 
ROMANS: I tell -
 
BERMAN: That's -
 
ROMANS: I'll tell you that until it's true. 
 
BERMAN: That's according to Christine Romans, who also reminded me of a story from one of our first trips on the road when we anchored from the field and she was going out with the whole crew for drinks before the show and she said, come on, you -
 
HARLOW: For drinks before the show? 
 
ROMANS: The night before the show.
 
BERMAN: Well, not before, but the night before.
 
HARLOW: We heard that. 
 
HILL: We're learning a lot here.
 
BERMAN: It will be good - it will be a good time. It will be good to hang out. You'll get to know people. I said - and she claims I said, you know, I didn't come here to make friends. 
 
ROMANS: That's what he told me. And I was like, oh, wow, I got a - I got a lot of work to do on this guy. 
 
BERMAN: It's OK. But - so -- so Romans is right, like, for, like, we anchored "EARLY START" together from four to six -
 
ROMANS: Right. Brutal.
 
BERMAN: For 17 years together. 
 
ROMANS: Yes. 
 
BERMAN: And mostly what I remember isn't the news. Mostly it was like a two-hour conversation -
 
ROMANS: Right.
 
BERMAN: About our kids, who do the same things, about the people we know who are all the same. 
 
ROMANS: Right.
 
BERMAN: You know, we're the same age, almost. And just how wonderful it was to be with someone who I enjoyed so much for so long. 
 
ROMANS: Oh, thank you. 
 
BERMAN: And it's the only thing that made it remotely palatable because it's so early. And the things that I learned about you. I mean, Christine Romans -
 
ROMANS: Because I talk through the entire break.
 
BERMAN: Christine Romans is, you know, who - the author of "Smart is the New Rich," you know, available in book stores, is the most successful French major in financial journalism, right? 
 
ROMANS: (Speaking in foreign language).
 
HILL: True. True.
 
BERMAN: She's - she's Iowa's favorite child. There's Herbert Hoover and Christine Romans. I know more story - I know the concerts she went to in Iowa. I know - I know the pizza store where she would smoke cigarettes in the back in Iowa. 
 
ROMANS: Oh, do not tell that story. 
 
HILL: Now we're getting to the good stuff.
 
BERMAN: I hope your parents are watching with your kids. No.
 
And -- and I feel so lucky that - that I had that in to know you. And though you claim that I said I didn't come here to make friends, turns out that because of you I have ended up with a really, really great one. 
 
ROMANS: Oh, thank you. BERMAN: And I don't - you know, co-anchor, whatever, but you're a
 
 great friend. 
 
ROMANS: Thank you. I - I -- that's a wonderful thing about the gratitude I have for this place is that we are all friends. You know, I - these - a lot of the guys on the - on the camera crew are like, I call them like my other brothers. They really are. You know, I've known them since I was in my 20s. I was single in my - in my 20s, a wire service reporter who walked in this - in this front door and learned - learned TV from all of you guys. So, I really appreciate it. 
 
HILL: We - you know, Poppy and I were talking about all the things that we love about you yesterday. 
 
HARLOW: We were basically sobbing on the phone to each other. 
 
HILL: We were. And what we loved most is what Berman alluded to, but just - and what all of us here feel is just what a - what a wonderful person you are. 
 
ROMANS: Well, thank you.
 
HILL: You bring people together because of your kindness, your empathy and you're so genuine, and I adore you and I will miss seeing you every day. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
HILL: But you cannot shake us.
 
HARLOW: You cannot shake us.
 
HILL: So, we're in for the long haul.
 
ROMANS: I will be watching all of you guys. I'm a super CNN fan. 
 
BERMAN: The things -- the thing that scared me the most was she told me, you know, she's been at CNN since before there were cellphones. So, the only cell phone she has is her CNN one, which she's losing. I'm like, if your number changes, I can't reach you. 
 
HARLOW: Don't change your number.
 
HILL: I said the same thing.
 
BERMAN: I will be so bummed out. I'd better be able to find you.
 
ROMANS: She said the same thing.
 
My first phone was a flip phone from the - from the assignment desk, you know, when they would just pass out a phone when we were on assignment. That's how long I've been here. 
 
HARLOW: That's amazing.
 
Thank you for - to echoing what Erica said, and Berman, that was amazing, in true Berman fashion. Thank you for welcoming me as a cub reporter. 
 
ROMANS: I remember when you came in.
 
HARLOW: Never been on live television. I met you. You were about 11 months pregnant with another 11-pound baby. 
 
ROMANS: Yes. Yes. Yes, I had big ones.
 
HARLOW: Skinny as ever, and then there's the baby. And I meet you at this award dinner for financial journalism. 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
ROMANS: That's right. 
 
HARLOW: And you immediately are so warm. You welcomed me to sit next to you. You showed me the rope here for all of these years. You are a gift to us and to this network. 
 
ROMANS: Oh, thank you very much. 
 
HARLOW: So, thank you for all of it. 
 
ROMANS: Thank you very much.
 
HARLOW: All the fun. 
 
ROMANS: Yes.
 
HARLOW: All the smiles. 
 
ROMANS: Thanks, everybody. It was fun. Most of it. 
 
HILL: We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: This morning, barriers have been put up outside of the courthouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The sheriff's office says this is -- that it is proactively coordinating with agencies to enhance security during high-profile proceedings. A grand jury there is, of course, weighing whether to indict former President Trump or his allies over efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in that state. 
 
Now, keep in mind here, that would be in addition to the federal charges in the classified documents case, that superseding indictment, in addition to charges, of course, coming down yesterday, and an upcoming charging decision in the January 6th investigation. 
 
In a new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER," airing this Sunday night, CNN's Sara Murray is going to takes us inside the events that led to that sprawling investigation in Fulton County. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): We are more than two years past the pressure campaigns. The harassment of public and private citizens. The coordinating of fake electors. The breach of election equipment. And we still don't know, will Trump and his allies face charges here in Georgia? And if so, will there be convictions? 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: They rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. 
 
MURRAY (on camera): Did voters deserve an answer to this question before Donald Trump became, you know, an announced candidate again? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I don't think there's any question about that. 
 <br>[08:50:02]
 
I mean - so, from a national perspective, no question about it. From a local perspective here, no question about it. 
 
MURRAY: We saw former President Trump lie to the American people. You saw him gin up this outrage. Is it a remedy if he's charged with a crime in Georgia?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If they indict him and they can't convict him, it will be an exoneration. Is that better or is that worse? I don't know. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: And Sara Murray joins us now. 
 
Look, the fact that we saw those barriers this morning being put up.
 
HARLOW: Right.
 
HILL: There's been a lot of talk about the timing here. Could we see a decision out of Fulton County soon? 
 
MURRAY: I think we will see one soon. You know, the district attorney has sort of put her security partners on high alert, she's put her core partners on high alert. Technically the window for when we think she could make announcements is going to open on Monday, July 31st. I would be surprised if we see something from them next week. I think they're still kind of getting organized in terms of talking to my sources. But I do think, you know, unless something goes really wrong with this case, that we are going to see an announcement from District Attorney Fani Willis in Fulton County probably in early August about whether Donald Trump or any of his allies or multiple people could face charges in this investigation, guys. 
 
HARLOW: She has been investigating this, and you have been following every single bit of news, for two and a half years. There's been a lot of talk about how she's prosecuted other famous people in Georgia on RICO charges. Why has this taken so long to come together, do you think? 
 
MURRAY: Well, I think the fact that she's looking at a potential racketeering and conspiracy case is part of it. And just in digging into this, and you'll see this in the documentary, there are so many elements of this that prosecutors have dug into. You know, it's not just Donald Trump calling the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and pressuring him to find the votes. You know, it's things Rudy Giuliani said before state lawmakers to try to convince them that there was this wide-spread fraud in Georgia that didn't exist. It's this harassment campaign that was unleashed against, you know, two election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, that in a civil suit Rudy Giuliani recently conceded his statements about them were defamatory. 
 
You know, it's a breach of an election system in this rural county in Georgia. So, there's a lot that she has covered over the course of this investigation. 
 
HARLOW: Can't wait to watch. 
 
Sara Murray, thank you very much. 
 
MURRAY: Thank you, guys.
 
HARLOW: Again, this is a new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER." It's Sara's documentary. It airs Sunday night. She takes us inside the events that led to this sprawling investigation into Fulton County. 
 
Former President Trump charged with new crimes in the classified documents case. And he has a new co-defendant who allegedly said the boss wanted security camera footage erased. The latest on the superseding indictment ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:56:18]
 
HILL: Math and reading scores in the U.S. have dropped to their lowest levels in decades following the pandemic. Black children continue to lag behind their peers when it comes to literacy. And according to a recent report just 33 percent of fourth graders can read proficiently. That number, though, drops to 17 percent for black children. 
 
This week's CNN hero, former teacher, Alvin Irby, is working to change that by bringing books to barber shops. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVIN IRBY, CNN HERO: What's up, man. How you doing?
 
We installed a child-friendly reading space in the barber shop. We literally ask little black boys, what do you like to read? And then those are the books that we distribute to our national network of barbers. 
 
Use the opportunity when they're sitting in the chair to just even talk to them about books.
 
Many black boys are raised by single mothers. So there's this opportunity to support barbers in becoming -
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How's the book doing so far?
 
IRBY: Black male reading role models. 
 
I'm just excited that we get to create a safe space for boys to do something that is really life changing. That's what I really believe reading is. It unlocks potential. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: How inspiring is that? 
 
To learn more about Alvin's program, head to cnnheroes.com. Don't forget to nominate someone you think should be a CNN Hero. Those nominations close on Monday. 
 
It has been so nice to have you with us this week. It has been such a joy to have you by my side. Have a great weekend. 
 
HILL: You, too, my friend. 
 
HARLOW: Have a great weekend, everyone.
