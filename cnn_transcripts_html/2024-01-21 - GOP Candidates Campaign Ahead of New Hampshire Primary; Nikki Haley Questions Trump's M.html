KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. Ahead on CNN Newsroom, it's the final weekend before New Hampshire's primary as the GOP candidates take jabs at one another on the campaign trail. CNN is across all the latest developments.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Roe v. Wade was overturned and so now we -- we really need to stand up and fight for abortion rights for all women. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Hundreds of abortion rights advocates marching in Washington this weekend, as 2024 hopefuls look to rally their supporters on women's reproductive rights. We'll look at how this is playing out on the campaign trail. 
 
And Iran vows retaliation against a deadly missile strike. It blames on Israel, raising fears the war in Gaza could widen even further. We're live in the region. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Kim Brunhuber. 
 
BRUNHUBER: We begin here in the U.S. where the presidential race is becoming increasingly bitter with just two days to go before the New Hampshire Republican primary. The three major candidates are looking to put themselves on a solid path to the Republican nomination. 
 
Former President Donald Trump and ex-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley are ramping up attacks against each other as they campaigned in the state over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not saying anything derogatory, but when you're dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She is not presidential timber. Now when I say that -- that probably means that she's not going to be chosen as the vice president. A woman that I know very well, a woman that is not capable of doing this job, I know her very well. She's not tough enough. She's not smart enough, and she wasn't respected enough. She cannot do this job. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Meanwhile, confusion surrounded Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' campaign on Saturday. The Governor spent the day campaigning hundreds of miles away in South Carolina, whose primary is more than a month away. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Can someone tell me major achievements of Nikki Haley when she was governor? Anybody? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Gas tax.
 
DESANTIS: Gas tax. She tried to raise the gas tax. That's not an achievement. That's a bad one. So nobody can say an achievement. I mean, I just think that's remarkable because I can tell you, like, if you were in Florida and we had, you know, hundreds of people, you started saying, hands would shoot up. They start talking about all the stuff that we've done. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: We have reporters covering all the twists and turns on the campaign trail, CNN's Steve Contorno is in South Carolina, covering Ron DeSantis' campaign later this hour. Kylie Atwood is with Nikki Haley's team from New Hampshire. But first we go to Alayna Treene, who's traveling with former President Trump. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Well, it's just three days to go until the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump is escalating his attacks on his rival, Nikki Haley. And part of that strategy is by using leaders from South Carolina and trying to paint her as not being very well liked by people in her own backyard. 
 
On Saturday, Trump called up a series of South Carolina lawmakers to the stage, including South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a fierce Trump ally who endorsed him back in 2022. And of course, that comes after Friday night where Donald Trump also picked up a massive endorsement from South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. I'm told from my conversations with Trump's campaign that they'd really been courting his endorsement ever since he dropped out of the presidential race last year. But they had really accelerated that timeline because they wanted to try and have it come right before New Hampshire. 
 
Again, New Hampshire is a state where they are worried about Nikki Haley's rise in the polls, especially her popularity with moderates and independence. And so you're seeing the campaign and Donald Trump himself try to implement every tactic they can to undercut her in these final days. 
 
Now, another thing I like to point your attention to was Donald Trump also defended his cognitive abilities while on stage. That comes after a gaffe that Trump had on Friday where he seemed to confuse Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi when talking about security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. 
 
We should point out that Nikki Haley was not in office then and had nothing to do with security at the Capitol during that time. But Donald Trump continuously brought up her name on Friday. And that's your response from Nikki Haley. She had said that perhaps it shows Trump is not mentally fit for office. Take a listen to how Trump responded. 
 
TRUMP: If I'm sarcastic or like I -- a lot of times I'll say, "And President Obama is doing a lousy job," meaning that Obama is running the show. They'll say, "Donald Trump doesn't know who our president is." No, no.
 <br>[05:05:00]
 
Few months ago, I took a cognitive test. My doctor gave me, I said, give me a cognitive test just so we can, you know, because you know what the standards were. And I aced it. I'll let you know when I go bad. I really think I'll be able to tell you. 
 
TREENE: Now, I can tell you that this is an argument that actually bothers Donald Trump personally. We know that Donald Trump often likes to use these attacks on Joe Biden and doesn't really like the fire being trained on himself. And I think that's why you saw him try to bring this up tonight and address it head-on.

KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Nikki Haley is barnstorming the state of New Hampshire. Of course, just days ahead of the primary on Tuesday with her campaign really focused on having a strong showing here in New Hampshire. And she is hitting former President Trump in a more distinct way than we have seen her do previously, questioning his mental fitness after he had a gaffe at a campaign rally where he confused her and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and also going after him for the ads that he has put on the TVs here in New Hampshire, saying that they're full of lies, trying to correct the record when it comes to what her positions are on gas tax and social security. 
 
But former President Trump is campaigning with Tim Scott, Senator of South Carolina and the governor of South Carolina also this weekend. And of course, that isn't a great thing for Nikki Haley. She is from South Carolina. Her campaign for their part says that they are not focused on racking up endorsements that they claim don't matter. They're focused on a strong showing in New Hampshire. They're not defining exactly what that means. 
 
They're also focused on beginning to compete in South Carolina, announcing that they will be investing $4 million in the media ad by in South Carolina starting just next week. Kylie Atwood, CNN, Nashua, New Hampshire.

BRUNHUBER: President Biden says he's hopeful an immigration deal will land in the Senate next week and has promised, quote, "massive changes along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, Texas authorities began arresting migrants at a public park in Eagle Pass in an area the state military took over last week. 
 
CNN's Rosa Flores visits that park on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm inside the area that was taken over by the State of Texas. And ride with me because I want to show you what it looks like. If you look here to my left, you'll see that there is one layer of fencing and then several layers of razor wire before you get to the Rio Grande. 
 
Now, the middle of that river, that's the international boundary between Mexico and the United States. And technically, once migrants cross the middle of the river, they're in U.S. territory. Under normal circumstances, migrants are able to walk up shore and turn themselves into U.S. immigration authorities. 
 
But as you can take a look, there are multiple layers of razor wire, and it goes on for miles. Now, I talked to a group of migrants who wanted to turn themselves in, and Texas authorities asked them to keep on walking all the way to Shelby Park. 
 
Once they arrive at Shelby Park, that's where Texas authorities say that they are arresting migrants. They are arresting single men and single women and charging them with criminal trespassing. Any migrant families or unaccompanied children that turn themselves in to authorities are handed over to Border Patrol. That's according to Texas authorities. And that just shows you the relationship between the Biden administration and the State of Texas, because normally it would be federal law that would be enforced in this area, but right now it's state law. 
 
Now, as for the State of Texas, the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said that he does not plan to surrender to the Biden administration. Rosa Flores, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, still to come, as campaign season gets underway in the U.S. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to make their first joint campaign appearance this week. We'll tell you what's on the agenda. 
 
Plus, new concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could spark a wider conflict. And the international community is responding strongly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's latest comments about a two-state solution. We'll talk about that in a live report, that's coming up. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:13:23]
 
BRUNHUBER: Some news just coming into CNN, the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says over 25,000
 
 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7th. It adds that about 70% of those killed were women and children. Now, CNN can't independently verify these numbers due to the challenges of reporting from the war zone. 
 
Palestinian officials estimate that in addition to the dead and wounded, more than 8,000 people are missing. They're believed to be buried under rubble. 
 
Meanwhile, Israel Defense Forces says it found a tunnel in Gaza that Hamas used to hold hostages. Israeli officials released this image saying the tunnel is in the city of Khan Yunis. Inside, they say they found prison cells, explosives, and blast-proof doors. 
 
The U.N. Secretary General says opposition to a two-state solution is unacceptable. Antonio Guterres tweeted Saturday that, quote, "the right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all." 
 
Now, his comments come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again poured cold water on any notion of a Palestinian state. He posted this on social media Saturday, quote, "I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan, and this is contrary to a Palestinian state."
 
Now, CNN reported earlier this week President Biden came away from a phone call with the Israeli leader saying that, quote, "There are a number of types of two-state solutions possible." 
 
Now, there are growing fears that the Israel-Hamas conflict could turn into a regional war after the latest strikes in Syria and Iraq, involving the U.S.-Iran and presumably Israel. Iran is vowing to punish Israel for this missile strike in Syria that killed five members of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard were on a military advisory mission in Damascus. Iran's president is calling the strike cowardly. Israel is suspected of being behind the attack, but Israeli officials aren't commenting. [05:15:14]
 
Now, in Iraq, Iranian-backed militias have claimed responsibility for an attack that injured Americans on the Al-Asad Airbase. It's not clear how many Americans were hurt. U.S. Central Command says a number of U.S. personnel are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries. 
 
All right, for the latest our Paula Hancocks is live in Abu Dhabi and Elliott Gotkine is live in London. So, Elliott, let's start with you. The implications of Netanyahu's statements and the subsequent reaction continue to reverberate? 
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: They do, Kim. And I suppose what Netanyahu is hoping to do is to portray himself as the only man, the only thing standing between a two-state solution and Israel, to continue having security control over all the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. And one reason he's hoping to do that, or trying to do that, is, of course, the precipitous decline we've seen in his polling numbers since October the 7th. 
 
You know, he used to be known proudly as Mr. Security, among other things. That reputation, of course, has been trashed. And poll after poll since October the 7th have shown that were an election to be held tomorrow, Netanyahu would be out on his ear. One recent poll showing that just 15 -- 15% of Israelis think that he is the best man to be prime minister. So that's the kind of national implications.  
 
Internationally, of course, these comments are not going to go down well either, especially with the United States, where it threatens to broaden the rift or the gulf -- for want of a better word, between the U.S. and its plans, or lack thereof, for what happens the day after this war in the Gaza Strip and what the U.S. is pushing for. 
 
Internationally as well, we've heard from the EU's Foreign Policy Chief saying that perhaps a two-state solution might need to be imposed on Israel and the Palestinians. And of course, we heard from the U.N, Secretary General Antonio Guterres posting on X saying that the refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israel and Palestinians and the demand of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people are unacceptable. But it's worth noting, Kim, that of course this is par for the course for Netanyahu with perhaps the exception of a famous speech in 2009 in which he seemed to accept the likelihood or the inevitability of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. He's pretty much been consistent in opposing one and proudly, from his perspective as well. 
 
And in fact, Martin Indyk, a former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, being quoted in a "New York Times" article just the other day saying that in the wake of that speech in 2009, he spoke with Netanyahu. A couple of days later, Netanyahu said to him, all right, I said it. Now can we get on with dealing with Iran? So Netanyahu's opposition to a two- state solution, nothing new. He hopes that it will bolster his position domestically, but internationally, of course, it's not going to do him or Israel any favors. Kim? 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, thanks so much for that. Elliott Gotkine in London. Now, we're going to go to Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi. So, Paula, I want to talk about those strikes in Syria. What more are we learning about those and the growing fears of a possible regional conflict here? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kim, this happened on Saturday. We understand from Syrian State television that it was a neighborhood of Damascus, the Mazzeh neighborhood, where there are a number of diplomatic compounds, including the Iranian embassy, and it was a strike on a residential building which happened about 10:20 in the morning. 
 
Now, this has been blamed on Israel. Israel itself has not claimed responsibility, but quite frankly, it very rarely does in these kind of situations. We are hearing from Iran, though, from the very top, that there will be repercussions to this. Five members of the Revolutionary Guard were killed. One in particular we understand to be a very high level within Syria itself. And this is the statement that we heard read out on Iranian state television from the President himself. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The continuation of such terrorist and criminal acts show the increasing failure of the illegitimate Zionist regime to achieve its wicked goals and the depth of its desperation against the fighters of the resistance front. And these crimes will not be left unanswered by the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: Now, saying that they would go unanswered. We did also see that there were ballistic missile strikes against U.S. troops at the Al-Asad Base in Iraq later on Sunday. Now, we heard from U.S. Central Command that there were a number of injuries of U.S. personnel. There's no details on how many? But they do say that they were undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries. 
 <br>[05:20:05]
 
Now, these were ballistic missile launches and strikes against this base. Just, it appears only the second time that's happened since October 7, we have seen more than 140 strikes of drones and rockets against U.S. troops in both Iraq and Syria. But this was a higher level of weapon, a more powerful weapon that was used. We understand there were a number of these missiles launched. 
 
Now, there has been a claim of responsibility. The Islamic resistance in Iraq has said that they were responsible. This is an umbrella group that is very much funded, supported, equipped by Iran. And so at the same time that we are hearing from the very top in Tehran that there will be repercussions for that strike in Damascus, we are also seeing yet more attacks against U.S. assets in Iraq and Syria. 
 
So these tit for tat, if you like, attacks between Iranian backed proxies and Iranian backed groups and U.S. and Israel are continuing. And certainly, there does appear to be a higher level of some of the targets that are being taken out in Iraq and Syria, potentially by Israel. Kim? 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, I appreciate the update. Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi. Thanks so much. 
 
Well, Israel has likened Hamas to ISIS following the group's brutal October 7 attack on Israel. CNN's Matthew Chance takes a closer look at the tactics of the terror groups, how they're similar and where they differ. And we just want to warn you, his report does contain graphic images. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's hard to imagine the sheer brutality of the rampage. In more than 20 Israeli communities, Hamas gunmen moving house to house, room to room in an orgy of violence. We can barely show the horrors of October the 7th. But the torture, mutilation and killing of more than 1,200 people as well as abductions of hostages still held in Gaza point to a radical, gut-wrenching shift in tactics. This is one video shared with CNN by an Israeli source that we are showing you. Security cameras at the Nir Oz kibbutz in southern Israel show a knife-wielding terrorist and gunmen soaring at the necks of dead Israelis. Evidence of beheadings cementing an Israeli view that Hamas is now akin to jihadi groups like Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State or ISIS.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Hamas is ISIS and just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed. And Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated. They should be spit out from the community of nations.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): ISIS, which controlled parts of Iraq and Syria before being dispersed in a multinational effort, also used beheadings, torture and sexual violence against their captives. While the two groups use similar brutal tactics, their goals remain different.
 
PETER NEUMANN, PROFESSOR OF WAR STUDIES KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: So Hamas is an Islamist organization, but its principal enemy is Israel. Now ISIS is a global transnationalist, jihadist organization that wants to establish a global caliphate who considers every country in the world to be its enemy. Hamas doesn't attract foreign fighters. Hamas only wants Palestinians to fight for it. ISIS wants people from all over the world to come and fight for it.
 
CHANCE: But is Hamas becoming more, more like ISIS?
 
NEUMANN: So I would say that ideologically it's not becoming more like ISIS, but tactically and strategically it is. It is widening its area of operations. It's considering terrorist attacks abroad. And also its tactics are becoming more like ISIS.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): Recently, Western security services say they've identified several Hamas threats. Police in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands making arrests in suspected Hamas-linked plots to strike European targets. This amid growing international outrage over Israel's hardline response.
 
CHANCE: And that response, in which thousands of Palestinian civilians have been killed in Israeli strikes, has further thrust Hamas into the spotlight, raising concerns, say analysts, that the October 7th rampage and the Gaza war could inspire a whole new generation of terror attacks in the West. 
 <br>[05:25:02]
 
(Voice-over): Attacks with groups other than Hamas exploiting the crisis.
 
NEUMANN: Groups like ISIS, even though they weren't responsible, for October 7th, are now trying to jump on the bandwagon. They are trying to say, look, look what's happening in Israel, Palestine. Get inspired by that. Join us and commit acts of violence and terrorism abroad.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): Revitalizing an ISIS campaign in Western countries may not have been a driving force behind the Hamas attacks on October the 7th. But ISIS could now benefit from the atrocities, Hamas carried out. Matthew Chance, CNN London.

BRUNHUBER: The New Hampshire primary is just two days away, so why is Republican hopeful Ron DeSantis in South Carolina? That's just ahead. 
 
And abortion rights take the center stage at this Women's March to the White House in Washington, D.C. We'll bring you their message after this quick break. Please do stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is "CNN Newsroom." 
 
Let's get back to our top story this hour. We're now just two days from the first primary of the 2024 presidential election in New Hampshire. Each of the candidates in the Republican race are looking to win big there to put them on a solid path to their party's nomination. 
 
Former President Trump and Nikki Haley are both hitting the state hard this weekend and taking swipes at one another. But missing from all the action is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who abruptly canceled his Sunday morning TV. Instead, he's laying the groundwork for what some see as his campaign's last stand far away in South Carolina. CNN's Steve Contorno reports from Lexington, South Carolina. 
 <br>[05:30:13]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The New Hampshire primary may be just days away, the Governor Ron DeSantis spent his Saturday 900 miles away in South Carolina, where he is trying to convince the state's Republican voters it's time to move on from Donald Trump and also their former Governor Nikki Haley. 
 
DESANTIS: I also had one of the Republican debates coming up, and so I was like, you know what? I need practice debating somebody that's almost as liberal as Nikki Haley. And so, we did that, and you know, we got differences on the Republican side too. You know, it is what it is. Now, can someone tell me, I mean seriously, I've been asking crowds what her big achievements were as governor here. 
 
CONTORNO: Those comments were made in Myrtle Beach, and they were actually seen by a Nikki Haley supporter who decided to confront the Governor at his Lexington events later that day. 
 
DESANTIS: Well listen, school choice. Did she do it yes or no? Because she promised it. 
 
But I'm talking about big, I'm talking about big conservative achievements. That's what the name of the game is. 
 
CONTORNO: We caught up with that voter as she was leaving and here's what she had to say about how she felt she was treated. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I did not expect him to shut me down like he did. I expected him sincerely to take my question and be respectful of me and answer. Or at least say, well, you know, OK, but he didn't even acknowledge that I said, as he reads. He heard I was a teacher and that was it. 
 
CONTORNO: The DeSantis campaign contends he is not giving up on New Hampshire just yet and he will be appearing in that state later today. Steve Contorno, CNN, Lexington, South Carolina. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: Hundreds of abortion rights advocates marched the White House Saturday to help rally urgency around the issue. 
 
The Women's March marked the 50th Anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Speakers and participants at Washington, D.C.'s Freedom Plaza stressed an urgent need for equal access to health care. A few counter protesters tried to disrupt the rally before police escorted them away. 
 
Meanwhile, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to push for reproductive rights as they make their first joint appearance of 2024, the campaign event this week. The two will speak in Northern Virginia on Tuesday, the same day as the New Hampshire primary. Officials say they are hoping to describe how abortion rights are at stake in November's election and mobilize voters around it. 
 
Now, since the landmark Roe v. Wade decision which protected abortion rights was overturned in 2022, access to the procedure has been banned or restricted in numerous states, but a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that nearly two-thirds of Americans responding disapproved of the Supreme Court ruling. 
 
Joining us now is Nicole Clegg, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Thank you so much for being here with us. So here we are, you know, two days before the primary there in your state. How much talk has there been on the campaign trail about reproductive rights? 
 
NICOLE CLEGG, CEO, PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND: Well, it depends on the party. Certainly, I think the Republicans who are running for the presidential primary in New Hampshire have done their very best to avoid talking about abortion. They know that their opinions and their views and their actions on abortion rights are deeply unpopular in the state of New Hampshire. 
 
Granite staters, you know, overwhelmingly support abortion rights. And so, for them to talk about the past actions or their continued, you know, commitment to making abortion inaccessible for people is not something that New Hampshire folks want to hear. 
 
BRUNHUBER: On the flip side, we will see President Biden and the Vice President holding a rally on the day of the primary. So, what are you hoping to hear from them? 
 
CLEGG: You know, I think continued support, you know, right now in our country, one in three women of reproductive age are living in a place where they don't have access to reproductive rights and freedoms. And it's going to take, you know, deep commitment and leadership from our president to make sure that those rights are restored. And that's what we're looking for. 
 
BRUNHUBER: And I imagine, you know, for Democrats anyway, a lot of the effort will be to tie the Republicans to these efforts to enact a national abortion ban, which as you've sort of hinted at, there are, you know, fairly unpopular with the majority of voters. 
 
CLEGG: I mean, they're deeply unpopular with the majority of voters. And not only that, they're also incredibly mobilizing. So, I would expect that as these campaigns continue, not just on Tuesday, but, you know, as we look towards November, we're go and see more and more people getting out, getting activated to protect reproductive rights. This is a losing issue for Republicans, and the fact that Republicans continue to sort of, you know, campaign quietly, often, because they don't want to be loud about it. This is going to be to their detriment. It's not a popular position. I mean, more than 60% of granite staters who are Republicans support access to abortion rights. 
 <br>[05:35:21]
 
BRUNHUBER: Now, obviously this goes way beyond politics. I want to get to the actual concrete effects of all of this and the effect of the Dobbs decision. I mean it's hard to come up with definitive figures in terms of the number of abortions since then either going down or some have even said that it's going up. I mean what are you seeing and can you explain what's been happening? CLEGG: So we've been seeing people traveling to Northern New England,
 
 which is, you know, a far distance for many of the states that have banned abortion to access, you know, basic health care. Those folks are traveling to New Hampshire for a variety of reasons. It feels safe to them. They think their privacy is going to be protected. They have family and support systems there. But it's just a tragedy to think that somebody has to travel hundreds of miles, get on a plane and fly to Manchester to be able to access, you know, care and make decisions that are the best interest of themselves and their families. 
 
You know, I think you've heard probably a lot of the examples that are coming out of the State of Texas, but that's not just happening in Texas, where people are getting incredibly sick. I mean, they're not -- you know, they're being told by courts, they're not dying enough to be able to receive life-saving care. 
 
And, you know, we in New Hampshire, we in Maine and Vermont in Northern New England, I mean, we're committed to making sure that we're available and there for those patients, but they shouldn't have to come to us to be able to get that care. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, at least 14 Republican majority states have banned abortion, seven others have limited access. So give us a sense of what's happening right now in terms of the efforts to limit those rights. And legally, you know, are they -- are they going after doctors? Are they going after the women themselves? Where's the trend heading? 
 
CLEGG: I mean, you know, what I've -- what we've seen is that they keep moving the goalposts. They keep saying that, you know, before abortion, when a woman's life or health was at risk, that should be legally available. Well, now we're saying that's not even a consideration. You know, what we saw in New Hampshire most recently was an attempt to ban abortion at 15 days. That's when people don't even know that they're pregnant. 
 
So we're seeing, you know, attempts to target clinicians and physicians and medical professionals. We're seeing efforts to go after the privacy of patients who are traveling to our states to legally access care. 
 
You know, it's really -- it's incredibly troubling and, you know, what has been lost in this conversation is that -- you know, these are deeply personal decisions. And, you know, when you look at Granite staters who really respect the privacy of their neighbors, they want them to be able to make the decisions that are best for them and their family. 
 
And, you know, that's why the positions of these Republicans that are running for president, and it's all of them, is going to be deeply unpopular, especially as we get to November. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, I really appreciate your insights. Nicole Clegg, thank you so much for speaking with us. 
 
CLEGG: Thank you for having me. BRUNHUBER: All right, still ahead dozens have died from dangerous
 
 winter storms here in the U.S. and now the U.K. braces for a powerful storm system.

CNN's Paula Newton has the latest.

PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Encrusted in ice, Milwaukee is frozen over, a frigid snapshot of the winter blast gripping parts of the U.S. right now. Nearly a third of Americans are under weather alerts this weekend. National Weather Service warns that states from Florida to North Dakota could be impacted by dangerously cold temperatures and wind chills. That's on top of snow and ice storms that pelted the east, west, and south of the country over the past week. 
 
Officials say at least 70 people across 13 states have died because of the extreme weather conditions. Parts of Europe are also feeling the chill. Temperatures in Paris dropping to one degree Celsius, making for a frosty commute for those breaking the cold. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): When there's snow on the roofs, it's pretty, but it doesn't last long. It's only in the evening, then on the ground with cars and people walking, it's horrible. 
 
NEWTON: Earlier in the week tourists enjoyed some of France's famed tourist sites sprinkled in snow. But there were heavier accumulations, especially in the north of the country that snarled traffic and disrupted train schedules. 
 
In northern Spain, the army teamed up with local police to help stranded motorists stuck for hours on treacherous roads in temperatures that dropped to minus 13 degrees Celsius. The U.K. is bracing for a different kind of storm Sunday into Monday after its own dose of snow in the past week. 
 
This time, Storm Isha is expected to bring heavy rain and powerful winds with gusts of up to 80 miles per hour in some cases. Forecasters warn there could be very dangerous coastal conditions. Paula Newton, CNN. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) BRUNHUBER: And there's word out of Iceland right now that the latest volcanic eruption there has ended. Without assessment, is doing little to calm the nerves of people who fled their homes in the nation often referred to as the land of fire and ice. Michael Holmes reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Days after the latest in a series of volcanic eruptions threatened the Icelandic fishing town of Grindavik, residents are still being kept away. Last weekend's red hot lava flow reached the outskirts of the 4,000-person town, setting three homes ablaze. 
 
Fortunately, no one was harmed since residents had already evacuated for the second time since November. It's the fifth eruption on the peninsula of Reykjanes since 2021. 
 
KRISTIN MARIA BIRGISDOTTIR, GRINDAVIK RESIDENT: It was devastating. That's the word I can tell you. I was -- this is something that we had been expecting, but seeing it so close to the town was just devastating. 
 
HOLMES: Kristin Maria says she was born and raised in Grindavik and hopes to give her children the same life, after all, she just bought a home there. 
 <br>[05:45:04]
 
But having been evacuated to Reykjavik since November, she says she wonders whether she and her neighbors will ever go back. Although the latest eruption seems to have subsided, magma still flows underground, leaving the threat of cracks opening on the surface. 
 
BIRGISDOTTIR: There is a huge uncertainty when we will go back because the area is really dangerous at the moment. And they just published a risk map and it's a really high risk of danger inside the town. So that's one of the biggest questions we have. When do we go back? Can we go back? Will we ever go back? 
 
HOLMES: Geologists are warning the town's residents there could be more cracks and soil collapses on the way. For now, construction workers have put up barriers to keep possible new lava flows from damaging more buildings. 
 
Iceland's president says it's not clear when residents can return to the town. 
 
GUDNI JOHANNESSON, ICELAND PRESIDENT: Right now people cannot stay in Grindavik and it remains to be seen when residents can return and move valuables from their homes. We wait and see. We cannot control the forces of nature but we can control how we react. 
 
We did our very best to defend the town itself. We built defensive structures and always, uppermost in our minds, is to protect people's lives and we will continue to do so. HOLMES: The President says the vital question is whether it's safe to
 
 live in Grindavik on a daily basis now that the Reykjanes Peninsula is volcanically active after 800 years of quiet. The only thing both authorities and residents know for sure, the future of Grindavik and those who call it home remains uncertain. Michael Holmes, CNN .

BRUNHUBER: Well, a huge weekend is underway in the NFL with four teams left in the divisional round of the playoffs. CNN Sports Andy Scholes joins me live to see who's in and who needs to bring the much-needed heat to the field. That's coming up next. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: All right, you're looking at AC Milan players walking off the pitch on Saturday after alleged racist chants were directed to the team's goalkeeper by opposing team's fans. Now, the incident occurred in the 33rd minute during a tense match against Udinese. Talked to sky sports after the match, 28 -year-old AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maigna, who is black, said he heard, quote, "monkey noises" and chants from the crowd the moment he took the ball for his first goal kick, and again on the second goal kick. CNN World Sports will have more on this story in the coming hours. 
 
The NFL playoffs provide drama Saturday night as the Super Bowl favorite San Francisco 49ers needed a rally to beat the seven-seated Green Bay Packers. CNN Sports Coy Wire joins me now. So, Coy, I mean, this game really came down to the -- to the last minute, right? 
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, absolutely. And Green Bay and San Francisco, Kim, this is one of the best rivalries in the NFL, because when they play more often than not, the season is on the line, 10th playoff meeting between these two teams, most all-time. The 49ers led by Brock Purdy, the last pick of last year's draft. The Packers, the youngest team in the league, led by Jordan Love. And Green Bay was leading by four in the fourth, but Purdy shows up using his arm, legs, and heart. 
 
Incredible pass to Brandon Aiyuk there to keep the drive alive. And with less than two minutes to go, Kim, watch him risk it all. He scrambles and dives headfirst into these defenders. And then he ends up to Christian McCaffrey who breaks a tackle for his second touchdown of the game as the eventual game winner. 
 
Kyle Shanahan's 49ers win 24-21, heading back to the NFC Championship game for the fourth time in five years.

KYLE SHANAHAN, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS HEAD COACH: Anytime you play a game that's do or die is everyone knows what that is about, especially our guys. They've been through that a number of times in the last few years, and we all know what that feels like when you don't get it done. And that's on your mind throughout the week. That's always on your mind during the game, but that's why I'm so proud of the guys. When it's not going right, and you know how big of a deal that is, you still got to perform. And the guys did big time.

WIRE: In the AFC, the Texans were tied at 10 at halftime with the top- seated Ravens. But former league MVP Lamar Jackson takes over in the second, accounting for all of Baltimore's touchdowns, two passing, two on the ground with 100 yards rushing. 
 
Impressive year for Houston, who became the first team ever to make the playoffs after having no more than four wins in each of their previous three seasons. But Baltimore is just too much, and they're going to face the winner of today's Bills-Chiefs game in the conference championship. 
 
How about this, though, Kim? Looking like you after listening to some Nickelback, or Celine Dion, or Gowan, right? I mean, these dance moves are elite. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Boo.
 
WIRE: Boo, he says. All right, two more games Sunday, Kim. Lions hosting the Bucs is Detroit. Tries to reach the NFC championship for the first time in more than 30 years. Then it's those Chiefs at Buffalo in a very snowy Buffalo. Bills fans, once again, asked if they want to come shovel, help shovel the snow out of the state, and they get $20 an hour and get fed. This is the third time in the last four post-seasons these two teams have played. But first time the Bills are at home, surrounded by the most passionate fans in football, Pro Bowl lineman Dion Dawkins says that's going to make a big difference. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DION DAWKINS, BUFFALO BILLS OFFENSIVE LINEMAN: I'm excited because it'll be -- the environment will be different. And not to say it's in our favor, but stadium is our favor. You know, stadium is us, that helps us. I don't care what nobody says. This is the most dopest feeling I've ever had. Like we've -- like we're having two back-to- back playoff games home. Like come on now, we get to leave and go eat wings. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Hop in the car after the win and go eat some wings, that's what it's about. And to all of you out there who don't know, Kim is from Canada so I was just throwing out there a bunch of random Canadian singers.
 <br>[05:55:07]
 
BRUNHUBER: Nickelback. Listen, taking my off-camera comments out of context here, I strongly protest -- in the strongest of terms here. All right, listen we got to get away from Nickelback and turn to tennis and the Australian open. Novak Djokovic. I mean he already owns most of the record book right now. He's doing his best to take care of the rest.
 
WIRE: Yeah, Joker already has more grand slams than any other man. He has been ranked number one in the world more than anyone else. And he's the only fourth player to win all four majors at least three times. And Sunday with an easy straight set win over Adrian Mannarino in Melbourne, he reached a major quarterfinal for the 58th time, that ties Roger Federer's record. For perspective, Kim, that's 75% of all grand slams since 2005. 
 
Djokovic plays 12 seat American Taylor Fritz next against whom he is 8 and 0 all time. Meanwhile, Coco Gauff, she's reached a quarterfinals down under for the first time. She has yet to drop a set, only lost three games in her last match and seems destined for a semifinal matchup with defending champ Aryna Sabalenka. Coco's trying to become, Kim, the first American to win back-to-back Grand Slam since Serena won fourth straight back in 2014 and 2015. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, be a great watch. All right, we'll have to leave it there. Coy Wire, thanks so much. 
 
WIRE: See you brother. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, I'm going to end this on a question. Do you have what it takes to join the next class of hot doggers? Have a look. 
 
(AD VIDEO)
 
BRUNHUBER: Oscar Mayer says, is looking for 12 new hopefuls to join its year-long full-time hotdogger program. You'll drive the 27-foot- long wienermobile, more than 20,000 miles across more than 20 states to advertise the brand, and of course, bringing smiles to faces along the way. Apparently, top dog at the company says the title of hotdogger is a rare and coveted position that's been relished since 1936. Relished. 
 
All right, that wraps this hour of "CNN Newsroom." I'm Kim Brunhuber. For viewers in North America, "CNN This Morning" is next, for the rest of the world, it's "Spirit of Mongolia."
