PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. Ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: We need to hurry up. We need the speed --
 
NEWTON (voice-over): Ukraine's president urging Kyiv's allies to speed up military assistance as his troops brace themselves. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON (voice-over): And a tense court appearance for the former police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. His mother saying the defendants refused to look her in the eye. 
 
Plus nearly two weeks after the devastating earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria, you'll hear from a survivor, who says his young daughter helped keep him alive.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Paula Newton. 
 
NEWTON: A few hours from now, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to deliver a major speech is the Munich Security Conference, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine is of course, dominating the agenda.
 
The U.S. has been a big supplier of weapons and equipment to Ukraine and Harris is leading a large American delegation to the conference. On Friday, she met with French president Emmanuel Macron, who said Europe's stability depends on defeating Russia in Ukraine. 
 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also there, meeting with the German foreign minister. No Russian officials as you can imagine, were invited this year. Ukraine's leader was given the privilege of being the first to speak. In his speech, he like likened Ukrainians' struggle to David and Goliath.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENSKYY: David defeated Goliath, not by the power of conversation (ph) but by the power of this excellence, by the courage and sling. Courage is what we have. There is enough of it, not only in Ukraine but in our entire coalition of victory. The sling should get stronger. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now as Western allies debate more help for Ukraine, Kyiv is accusing Russia of using water as a weapon of war, draining water from a major reservoir Northeast of Kherson. 
 
And according to Ukraine, that could leave more than a million people without enough drinking water. U.S. estimates Wagner mercenaries suffered more than 30,000 casualties in the war, including 9,000 dead, about half of whom have been killed the past two months alone. 
 
U.S. based military think tank meantime believes Bakhmut won't be in Russia's hands by the first anniversary of the invasion. The fighting in Bakhmut is exhibit A of what Mr. Zelenskyy is driving home. Now we're hearing directly from Ukrainian soldiers about why need more firepower. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): In the soggy trenches of Eastern Ukraine, the fighting isn't letting up. Ukraine saying Russian forces continue to viciously assault Bakhmut and the Donbas region. This Ukrainian unit says they're holding the line but need more firepower.
 
Give us more military equipment, more weapons and we will deal with the Russian occupiers. We will destroy them, the soldier says.
 
Ukraine and the U.S. believe a major offensive by the Kremlin might already be underway. And as Russia be self its troops on Ukraine's eastern front, Ukraine not only needs more and better weapons, it needs them fast.
 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Munich security conference via video link.
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We need to hurry up. We need the speed, speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery to strengthen our sling, speed of decisions to limit Russian potential. There is no alternative to speed, because it is the speed that the life depends on. Delay has always been and still is a mistake.
 
PLEITGEN: But as much as the Ukrainians need weapons quickly, Vladimir Putin quickly needs a win. Mercenaries for the Wagner private military company and their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, we're hoping to push Ukraine's troop troops out of Bakhmut in time for the one year anniversary of the war. 
 <br>[02:05:00]
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): But they now admit that's unlikely to happen.
 
A Wagner affiliated social medias channel posted this extremely graphic video, the authenticity of which we cannot independently verify, of alleged fighters asking for more ammo.
 
Every day, we lose hundreds of our comrades in arms. He says. It could have been half as many if our military functionaries had supplied us on time with weapons and ammunitions and the things we needed. Vladimir Putin, meeting with one of his closest allies, Belarusian
 
President Alexander Lukashenko, trying to show he is dealing with a military supply issue. And of course, we will discuss, as usual, the entire range of our relationships, he said, including security issues and military cooperation.
 
Lukashenko then claiming that Belarus, which served as one of Putin's launch pad for the invasion a year ago, will soon start producing warplanes. Yes, the attack aircraft, he said, a real workhorse. We are ready to produce it in Belarus with minor assistance from the Russian federation.
 
Russia is apparently gearing up for a protracted and bloody war, which Ukraine's president warns, might expand beyond Ukraine.
 
It's obvious that Ukraine is not going to be his last stop, Zelenskyy says. If we break, he will consume other countries, including all the other states that, at some point in time were part of the Soviet bloc.
 
Another thing that Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at that meeting in Munich is the Ukrainians really need this war to end during the course of this year. He said that modern weapons delivery would be absolutely key to make that happen. 
 
But from the Russian side, there certainly is no sign that Vladimir Putin intends to back down. One of the things we're looking at is next week, when Putin is set to hold a key speech here in Moscow. And we'll see whether or not Russia might escalate even further -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

NEWTON: Washington is ramping up the response to the toxic train derailment in Eastern Ohio. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA and the health department are expected to arrive onsite in East Palestine early next week. 
 
The Ohio governor said they will set up a clinic to address residents' health concern but many remain worried for their safety. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is worse than what everybody thought it was. And the people in town are afraid. They're afraid. I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my family down in Negley. It's just, you know, it's something that this little town I don't think expected to ever happen. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: The state's governor says so far air quality testing has not detected any contaminants from the toxic chemical spills. CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Both state and federal officials have been scrambling to allay fears in East Palestine, Ohio, about health effects lingering two weeks after the horrific derailment. 
 
Governor Mike DeWine held a press conference and tried to alleviate fears, saying we tested the water repeatedly. It is safe to drink. If you're on the village water system, the plume of chemicals was barely traceable in their measurements.
 
But still questions about the soil, which was not removed when the railroad, Norfolk Southern, hastened to get the tracks put back in so they can get rail traffic going again. There's so much suspicion among residents. They don't know who to believe. 
 
We, of course, live in the age of conspiracy and, after the COVID debates, you have state senators of the same party, of the Republican governor, questioning whether to believe him when he says all is safe. 
 
We have surveillance video from the Norfolk Southern train that showed a faulty axle sparking 43 minutes before the crash and derailment there. It shows what happens when trains lately are running longer, more cars with fewer personnel, the engineer at the front of a 1.8- mile train didn't know what's happening at the back. 
 
On top of that, antiquated braking systems, all subjects that will come up, certainly in the eight class action lawsuits filed so far against Norfolk Southern -- I'm Bill Weir in New York. Back to you.

NEWTON: Five former Memphis police officers accused in the death of Tyre Nichols all pleaded not guilty, including to second degree murder and aggravated assault. The next hearing is scheduled for May 1st. The Shelby County district attorney admits that the burden of proof for second degree murder is high. 
 
He also says his office has begun a review of prior cases involving the so-called SCORPION, the anti-crime squad disbanded after Nichols death. 
 <br>[02:10:00]
 
NEWTON: The DA adds more people could be charged. Nichols' family, meantime, was there in the courtroom Friday but did not speak during the proceedings. CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz has more now from Memphis. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROWVAUGHN WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS' MOTHER: They didn't even have the courage to look me in the face.
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER (voice-over): An emotional day where the five officers charged with murdering Tyre Nichols appeared in court before the Nichols family for the first time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not guilty.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not guilty.
 
PROKUPECZ: All five pleaded not guilty to charges of second degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. Judge James Jones addressing the courtroom emphasizing this case could take time.
 
JUDGE JAMES JONES, SHELBY COUNTY CRIMINAL COURT: We understand that there may be some high emotions in this case but we ask that you continue to be patient with us.
 
PROKUPECZ: After the arraignment, attorneys for the officers began to reveal how their defense will take shape.
 
JOHN KEITH PERRY, ATTORNEY FOR TADARRIUS BEAN: Tadarrius Bean was doing his job at that time and he never struck him and there has been no -- no information that we have seen as of right now that indicates that there is a -- that there is any sort of information that we can rely on to say that it is murder.
 
PROKUPECZ: Another defense attorney invoking his client's race and warning not to rush to judgment.
 
BLAKE BALLIN, ATTORNEY FOR DESMOND MILLS: Let's not forget my client is a Black man in a courtroom in America. This is a country where Black people are incarcerated at five times the rate of white people. 
 
Much has been said about the way the system has failed Mr. Nichols. I will work tirelessly to make sure that the system does not fail Mr. Mills.
 
PROKUPECZ: For Tyre Nichols' mother, relief the legal process has begun but the pain of her loss is clear.
 
WELLS: I know my son is gone. I know I will never see him again. But we have to start this process of justice right now. 
 
PROKUPECZ: The Shelby County district attorney saying his office is reviewing up to 100 prior cases involving the now-disbanded SCORPION Unit. Seventy-five of those cases related to the five officers charged in Nichols' death. The clearest sign yet that more justice could come to the city of Memphis. STEVE MULROY, SHELBY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: We will be making decisions about charges regarding all of those people in the time ahead.
 
PROKUPECZ: The five police officers making their initial appearance in a Memphis courtroom, all charged with murder and kidnapping and assault. This was their first time appearing together in court. 
 
And really, their attorneys clearly making it obvious that they're going to fight, that they're going to launch a vigorous defense, saying that prosecutors here are rushing this case, that there's been a rush to judgment.
 
And they're urging people to keep an open mind as we wait to hear more. Look, we're still waiting for more officers who are under investigation and whether or not they're going to face any criminal charges, disciplinary charges.
 
And also we're still waiting for more video and audio to be released by the city. All of this happening as many of the investigations here still very much underway -- Shimon Prokupecz, CNN, Memphis, Tennessee.

NEWTON: The three students killed in a mass shooting at Michigan State University will soon be laid to rest. CNN confirmed funeral arrangements have been made for all three, two being held in the coming hours and a third this Tuesday. 
 
In the day ahead, the school's basketball team will receive support at their game against the state rival. Those in attendance will wear shirts honoring Michigan State and hold a moment of silence for the victims. Five people who were wounded in the shooting do remain in hospital; four are in critical condition and one is listed as stable. 
 
Ahead for us, a heart warming scene after such a traumatic event. A father and daughter reunite following Turkiye's powerful earthquake. How they survived under piles of rubble for days.

(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
NEWTON: Twelve days after that devastating earthquake in Turkiye and Syria, the death toll has surpassed 45,000 people. My gosh, so staggering. Rescue efforts have been winding down. 
 
But Turkiye's vice president said 35,000 emergency workers are still searching for signs of life. And against all odds, they found more survivors on Friday, including this 45-year-old man. 
 
He had been trapped for almost 280 hours under the rubble. Now the developers of these collapsed buildings are facing more pressure from the governor. Turkish authorities have arrested 83 so far and have identified even more suspects. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I read the news about contractors that were arrested after the earthquake. But when you think about this destruction and its extent, maybe this should not be the number of arrested people. There should be more. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Meantime more humanitarian aid is making its way to Syria. This ship has arrived in nearby Lebanon, carrying 50 tons of material. Elsewhere, the U.N. sent more than 140 trucks to northwest Syria through two border crossings, now open from Turkiye. 
 
Some earthquake survivors are speaking out about what they went through. Can't imagine. CNN's Sara Sidner has some of their stories. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ahmet Ayyan is grieving the loss of his wife and son, while clinging to the one person who willed him to stay alive.
 
My daughter was telling me, papa don't cry, relax. They are coming to rescue us, he says.
 
This is Ahmet four days after he was buried neck-deep in rubble with his wife and two children. 
 <br>[02:20:00]
 
SIDNER (voice-over): Only he and his 4-year-old daughter, Gada (ph), made it out alive. We stayed under the rubble about four days. When the building fell down, my daughter was on my leg. Thank God there was no rocks or something on her.
 
She was rescued first. A half hour later, he was. And the two got separated. He was taken to a hospital. She was eventually taken to social services with barely a scratch on her.
 
For days, he had no idea where his little angel was.
 
Did you worry that you would never see her again?
 
No. Never, he says.
 
You knew you would see her again.
 
And he was right.
 
This is the day they were reunited. They screamed and cried, elated to hold each other once more. On the fourth day, my daughter told me, look, papa, there is light. I did not understand the light at the time, he says. Then I heard some voices. Those were the voices of rescuers and a family member later found her in social services and made the connection.
 
Can Gursoy (ph) is hoping by hope he, too, will also be reunited with his parent.
 
I have one request for you. Please help me find my mother, Shukran Erdin (ph), he tells us.
 
He and his family were trapped inside this collapsed building for 24 hours. He and his sister made it out. His mother has not been seen since.
 
I remember the collapsing of the building. I remember passing out after a piece of the house hit me in the eye, he says.
 
Can you describe what it was like in this type space physically for you?
 
It was so difficult to breathe there. On the other hand there was something crushing my leg, making me suffer, he says.
 
Ultimately, it was his decision to pull on a bit of the curtains that were visible to the outside that alerted someone he was alive. While he continues searching for his mother, Ahmet is nursing his foot injury while thanking God he has at least one person left to love.
 
That's my daughter, he says and she is my little hero, my hero -- Sara Sidner, CNN, Adana, Turkey.

NEWTON: An attack on police headquarters in Karachi, Pakistan, on Friday, left four dead and over a dozen others wounded. A group of militants attacked the station with hand grenades and gunfire. Authorities were able to regain control of the building by Friday, CNN's Sophia Saifi has more from Islamabad. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER: A militant attack in Pakistan's largest city of Karachi has left the people of this country stunned. Militants stormed into the main police headquarters in the city. It was on the sharai festival (ph), one of the many arteries connecting citizens to the airport, close to where paramilitary troops are situated. 
 
It took about four hours for the operation to end. There were army snipers posted on buildings around the police headquarters where this took place. We've been told by the Taliban, who claimed responsibility for this attack. However none of the Pakistani authorities confirmed it was the Taliban behind this. 
 
There's been an increase in militancy ever since the Taliban went back on their cease-fire in November last year. There's been an increase in military attacks in Pakistan since the fall of Kabul in August 2021. 
 
The people of Karachi are still reeling from what's happened. There were sounds of explosions deep into the county. It happened in a very integral part of the city and they're still waiting to hear more as this operation winds up as to what was behind it, what caused the breach of security and whether something like this will happen again. 
 
A real state of panic across Pakistan -- Sophia Saifi, CNN, Islamabad.

NEWTON: How Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said they will help Haiti with its security and humanitarian crisis. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
NEWTON: Canada is sending the Navy to help Haiti with its security and humanitarian crisis, Canadian prime minister said ships will be deployed to conduct surveillance and gather intelligence, in addition to support from Canada's air force deployed in recent weeks. 
 
So far Justin Trudeau has ruled out military boots on the ground and is pushing instead for a Haitian led solution. The Caribbean nation descended into chaos the past year, in protests, gang violence, rapid kidnappings and a resurgence of cholera. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: Ambassador Bob Rae is Canada's permanent representative to the United Nations and he joins me from West Palm Beach, Florida. 
 
Good to see you at the end of a trying and very long week, especially when it comes to Haiti. 
 <br>[02:30:00]
 
NEWTON: Prime minister Justin Trudeau was quite blunt after the meeting with the Caribbean leaders and the prime minister of Haiti. He basically said, boots on the ground right now, at least for Canada, not in the cards. 
 
Why not?
 
BOB RAE, PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF CANADA TO U.N.: Well, I think the prime minister wants to really give the responsibility, make sure the responsibility is taken up by the people living in Haiti and working in Haiti, including the police, including the political elite. 
 
Canada is doing a lot to provide assistance to the police. And we're certainly going to be doing more. 
 
I was able to join the meeting in the Bahamas for two days with our prime minister. It was a very good discussion. It was candid but I think we're emphasizing what we really believe where the responsibility really lies. 
 
And the international community needs to step up as well. We've been doing a lot on sanctions and making sure the police get the training and additional support they need. And we think that the humanitarian assistance, development assistance are critical.
 
But the political dialogue and the conversation in Haiti has to lead the way to people to understand that the corruption has to come to an end. And there has to be much greater resilience and ability to deal with the gangs.
 
And we will provide the assistance together with a number of other countries to push that along. We know that Caribbean leaders agreed to come in; others are coming in. So I think it's about a step at a time. 
 
And everybody understanding that a military intervention from both sides might provide some instant relief but not lasting relief. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
RAE: You really have to look at sustainability here. 
 
NEWTON: In fact, Justin Trudeau was visibly frustrated, talking about decades of aid and other help that Canada and other countries have given to Haiti. 
 
Why has it been unsustainable? 
 
And I lean on you and your experience around the world, including being Canada's envoy to Myanmar; nothing has seemed to work and, meantime, there's real suffering on the ground in Haiti at this hour. 
 
RAE: There is real suffering. I think it's important, Paula, that everybody bear that in mind. 
 
But I think it's also important to recognize that corruption has been a huge endemic issue in Haiti. And there have been corruptors and people taking advantage of it. 
 
I think we have introduced this very tough sanctions policy, adding two more names this week, including people who are former presidents, people who have been actively engaged in Haitian politics and business for last 20-30 years. 
 
And we've done it because we really believe that this is the problem that lies at the core of what needs to be fixed right now. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
RAE: -- make a big difference. 
 
Who controls the gangs?
 
It's these guys who control the gangs. It's these -- the criminal elite that controls the gangs. So we have to deal with that problem. And I think that's really what our focus needs to be in the next while, as well as providing assistance and insisting on a broader dialogue to get us to a more democratic country.
 
NEWTON: Meantime, things in Haiti seem urgent. The prime minister clear he wants an intervention force, that is the Haitian prime minister. 
 
Can you see Canada participating in that in the future?
 
It also seems to be something that the Biden administration is encouraging Canada to do. 
 
RAE: Well, we would encourage internally but encourage the Biden administration to do more on sanctions and stopping governments going into Haiti. That's an issue that the United States has to deal with.
 
So we're having some very energetic and engaged conversations. I spoke the other night with a former senator, who has been named as a special envoy on the Americas. We had a good exchange about what needs to be done. I think we all have a role to play. 
 
Canada will continue to play a very constructive and positive role. We will -- we're working at the U.N. at the moment. We're leading the conversation of what more can be done in terms of creating greater assistance for the -- for the police and trying to deal with the gang issue. We'll continue to do that. 
 
But I do think we have to -- there's no magic solution coming from outside. 
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
RAE: It has to be based very much on decisions being made within Haiti to take responsibility for some of the challenges that the country faces. 
 
NEWTON: Ambassador Bob Rae, thank you so much, we'll leave it there for now. 
 
RAE: Thank you, good to talk to you.

NEWTON: Still ahead for us, some out of this world views from, well, out of this world. Look at that, we'll show you the latest images from the James Webb space telescope, you'll want to see this. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) NEWTON: The powerful James Webb space telescope is giving us the
 
 clearest look yet at young stars as they're forming, appearing inside the heart of spiral galaxies. Until now, dust had prevented us from seeing the formation of emerging stars. 
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
NEWTON: But the Webb uses infrared light to see through it. The creation of stars can create giant bubbles of gas and particles which can look like spider webs, you can see it there. Researchers are studying 19 spiral galaxies, hoping to discover new insights about the life cycle of stars. 
 
A different type of Bigfoot has been found in the U.K. in an area called the Dinosaur Coast. It is a megalosaurus footprint, there you see it. The footprint has been discovered. It measures nearly a meter long, the largest of its kind. 
 
Archeologist Marie Woods made the discovery. Woods said she can no longer tell people, "Archeologists don't do dinosaurs." 
 
Traditionally geologists and paleontologists focus on them. As a rule, archeologists study ancient human artifacts. 
 
We'll take a quick break, our viewers in North America will have more news in a moment. For international viewers, "MARKETPLACE EUROPE" is up next.

NEWTON: With Russia's war in Ukraine nearly a year old, senior diplomats around the world are gathered in Germany this weekend for the annual Munich Security Conference. 
 
In his address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the group not to delay sending the weapons already promised, especially dozens of heavy battle tanks. A few weeks ago, Germany's chancellor was accused of dragging his feet. Now he's among those urging allies to send the tanks quickly as possible. 
 
But he cautioned the war could drag for on a long time and said allies should be prepared for that. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): Despite all the pressure to act that undoubtedly exists, in this decisive question, the following applies: diligence before rash action; cohesion before solo performance. And it is important to design our support from the beginning in such a way that we can sustain it in the long term. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: After the chancellor's speech, CNN asked Mr. Scholz whether he had a sense of how long the war might actually last. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLZ: it is not really a very good idea that in this conference or at this podium the two of us discuss the question when exactly, in which months, this war will end. The really important decision we should take all together is saying that we are willing to do it as long as necessary and that we will do our best.
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Do you believe that NATO -- sorry; the allies will stay united? 
 
And do you believe that your people will stay behind you and behind this effort?
 
SCHOLZ: Yes. First, I am absolutely sure that Putin never expected that there would be that united Europe and that there would be that united world. He never thought that the transatlantic partnership would work that good. 
 
But also he never thought that there would be so much support for Ukraine from many other countries all over the globe. And he never expected that there would be a majority of people voting in the General Assembly, saying that this is a war of aggression that could not be accepted. 
 
And he never expected that, even in the G20 meeting, we had a very strict sentence about this war and the Russian aggression and the absolutely clear sentence that nuclear weapons should not be used in this war.
 
So the unity is something he never expected. And it is our task but also our chance that we stick to it. I am absolutely sure that we will. And looking at the situation in my country, I see that there is a broad support for the strategy and activities of the government.
 
Yes, there are some and we are a democratic country that are not that sure whether it is really a good idea to do all of these sanctions and to deploy all these many weapons to Ukraine. But even the big majority of those is, in the end, accepting, that the government has to take a responsible decision and trust us in doing what we do.
 
And even those who possibly sometimes think we should do something more, really understand that it is very good that we stick together, that we never go alone, and that we just do it together with our friends and partners and especially with the United States. 
 
And this is why I am also sure that we will have the support of our people for the things that we are having to do.

 operations for the suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down off the coast of South Carolina two weeks ago. 
 
All along China claimed the balloon was studying weather but we still do not have any answers to so many questions. CNN's Will Ripley went to find some. Here's his exclusive report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hundreds of miles from Beijing, a place China does not want you to see. CNN, the first international media to come here. 
 
Behind barbed wire and security checkpoints, the base of a blacklisted balloon manufacturer.
 <br>[02:50:00]
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): One of six Chinese entities the U.S. government sanctioned after the suspected spy balloon. 
 
Shot down, pulled up and sent to an FBI lab, each piece providing more proof, the U.S. says, this was no weather balloon, deflating denial after denial by Beijing.
 
China's foreign ministry calls the whole thing an accident, the balloon and unmanned civilian airship. 
 
CNN searched for the truth behind the balloon, took our team from the Chinese capital to a Shanxi province, about 300 miles southwest of Beijing. Days of digging and geolocation technology took us down this road to a place few outsiders have seen.
 
No international media has ever come this close. What did we find?
 
An active industrial complex with ties to the Chinese military's vast and highly secretive aerospace program. Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology or EMAST, blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department. CNN searched corporate records suggesting EMAST has permits to develop and manufacture products for the Chinese military.
 
The first thing we noticed, a giant white dome. A closer look shows the company logo. Inside that dome, a lab.
 
We dug up a 2017 Chinese state media report that says this is where workers test high altitude balloons like the one that flew over the U.S.
 
Our team spotted two more massive structures. They look like giant tents. A search of state media archives reveals their true purpose. Huge stealth hangers helping military choppers evade detection by prying eyes.
 
CNN cameras also captured what seems to be an assault helicopter on display. Listen to this. That same state media report never once does it mention meteorology. It boasts the balloons can carry multiple detectors, communications equipment used for civilian and military surveillance and reconnaissance.
 
CNN tried to get answer from all six companies on the U.S. blacklist. No response from EMAST or the others. They are not talking about the balloon but President Joe Biden is.
 
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I make no apologies for taking down the balloon.
 
RIPLEY: A suspected spy balloon. We may never know for sure who made it. China is sticking to its weather balloon claim dismissed by the Pentagon as nothing but hot air -- Will Ripley, CNN.

MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): John Fetterman in the public spotlight -- battling an illness that millions struggle with in private, clinical depression. 
 
It's not uncommon for stroke victims like Fetterman, who nearly died last May after suffering a major stroke at the height of his high profile Senate race in Pennsylvania.
 
DR. DHRUV KHULLAR, HEALTH POLICY PROFESSOR, WEILL CORNELL MEDICINE: About one and three patients who have a stroke will have a stroke at some point of the course of the year.
 
RAJU: Fetterman remains at Walter Reed Hospital, after checking himself in on Wednesday night. 
 
His symptoms had grown severe. The source tells CNN he had lost a significant amount of weight, not eating properly or drinking enough fluids, contributing to light-headedness that forced him to be admitted to George Washington Hospital. 
 
Last week, after being discharged, Fetterman met with Capitol physician Brian Monahan, who later suggested treatment for clinical depression.
 
A source says that stay could last a few weeks or more than a month as doctors search for the right medication.
 
DR. MEGAN RANNEY, ASSOCIATE DEAN PUBLIC HEALTH, BROWN UNIVERSITY: We know that Senator Fetterman pushed himself so hard in those weeks after the stroke when, in an ideal world, he would have been recovering.
 
RAJU: Just a few weeks before his stroke, CNN caught up with Fetterman in rural Pennsylvania and he engaged in extended exchanges with voters.
 
SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): Hello, everybody.
 
If we legalized it, it would create tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania.
 
RAJU: How much weight is on your shoulders, knowing that the Senate majority could come down to you?
 
FETTERMAN: I don't look at it that way. I just come back to what I have always said. It's like, if you trust me with your vote, I am always going to try to deliver.
 
RAJU: But after the stroke, Fetterman had difficulty communicating, having to rely on closed captioning at a high-profile debate.
 
FETTERMAN: And let's talk about also the elephant in the room. I had a stroke.
 
RAJU: His struggles were apparent --
 
FETTERMAN: I do support fracking. 
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
FETTERMAN: And -- I don't -- I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking.
 
RAJU: In the senate, Fetterman walks the halls with aids that carry around a tablet that helps him understand what people are saying.
 
Just hours before checking himself in at Walter Reed, briefly questioning a witness at the hearing.
 
FETTERMAN: Are there any barriers, any stuff specific kinds of special barriers that, for workers in the fossil fuel sector, to learn skills, in renewable fuel production?
 
RAJU: Last week, when he was in hospital, his colleagues, noting his absence.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we should take a moment and just pray for his health.
 
RAJU: Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill.
