THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
ELLIOTT GOSKINE, JOURNALIST: To avoid this spiraling -- I suppose out of control, into another front. He also gave some updates on the hostages, that there are 203 hostages and 100 people missing -- Kasie.
 <br>[06:00:12]
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: Just stunning numbers. So very difficult on both sides of this conflict at this point. 
 
Elliott Gotkine in London, thank you very much for that report. 
 
And thanks to all of you for joining us. I'm Kasie Hunt. Don't go anywhere. CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk, if we walk away from Ukraine, we turn our backs on Israel, it's just not worth it.

POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Well, good morning, everyone. I'm Poppy Harlow with Phil Mattingly in New York. Erin Burnett is live on the ground in Tel Aviv, Israel. Sara Sidner live for us in the West Bank. And that was President Biden, back from the war zone, calling on Americans to support wartime aid for Israel and for Ukraine.
 
And, today, he will ask Congress to pass an aid package. In his primetime Oval Office address, Biden called it vital for our national security. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Hamas and Putin represent different threats. But they share this in common. They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy. 
 
History has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going. And the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: There is, of course, one problem. Congress is paralyzed without a House speaker and right now can't actually pass anything. 
 
That all comes at a pivotal moment, when Israel's leaders are signaling a ground invasion of Gaza could be imminent. 
 
Earlier this morning, CNN's Nic Robertson witnessed increased activity along the border, including flares and heavy machine gunfire. 
 
Israel's defense minister visited troops massing near the Gaza border and told them, quote, "You see Gaza now from a distance. You will see -- you will soon see it from inside. The command will come." 
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also near the border rallying troops and asking them if they were ready to deliver a, quote, "hard blow." 
 
Israeli officials tell CNN politicians have given the military the, quote, "green light" to enter Gaza. 
 
Let's start with Erin Burnett, live for us in Tel Aviv. Erin, you've been speaking to the IDF. What is the latest? 
 
ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: Right, and, you know, we've been speaking to sources there and, of course, to spokespeople publicly. And they consider it ready. Sources are saying -- and, of course, they don't know either, right -- but some sources at the IDF are saying, OK, 48 hours. Doesn't mean it's going to be that, of course. We don't know when that order will come. 
 
We do know, of course, that the reporting is, our reporting is that the army has been given the green light when they are ready. 
 
The very latest from the IDF spokesperson that we have, though, is this, and let me play you Colonel Jonanthan Conricus speaking with me just a few hours ago, in these early hours of the morning. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESMAN: The reserves are ready, equipped, mission-oriented and standing by for the next stage of our operations. But at this time, of course, we will not advertise when, where and how we will advance or do or enhance our military activities. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BURNETT: All of this is, of course, dependent in part on what happens on that Southern Rafah border that we've all talked so much about. 
 
Sources close to Netanyahu had said they thought that would be open today for aid to come in. Then sources were telling Jake Tapper, M.J. Lee and team that that would not happen today. So there are still a lot of questions about that and whether that would impact Israel's decision on going in. 
 
Sources again, Israeli government say, no, it won't have any impact, but we'll see if that's really the case. 
 
But nonetheless, really on the edge and -- and ready and, certainly, getting those rallying visits from Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday along those front lines, where 350,000 troops are amassed as I speak. 
 
And on this Friday, this, of course, is a Friday. This is a day of prayer in the Muslim community. And there are pro-Palestinian protests expected after mosque in Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Pakistan, other places in the broader Middle East region today as demonstrators around the world have been marching, feeling a grief, a fear, solidarity, for the Palestinians who remain trapped in Gaza.
 
And there are concerns about a possible flare-up of violence when you have this many people in the streets. The State Department is issuing an alert advising all Americans anywhere overseas to exercise increased caution. 
 
Our Sara Sidner is live in Ramallah in the West Bank with more. And, Sara, what are you seeing so far today? I know it's been relatively quiet. But obviously, a lot of this depends on when people are in mosque and when they are gathering. What do you understand is happening there? 
 <br>[06:05:09]
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: It is quiet. You can hear -- you can hear the Muslim singing from the mosque, waiting for the afternoon prayer, which will begin about noon. 
 
But there has been a call by Hamas' political leadership that people come out into the streets and protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza who have now been killed in the thousands. We're talking some 3,000 people and some more than 10,000 people injured there, according to the Palestinians there in Gaza. 
 
We are also here in an area where there have already been clashes. In the West Bank, there have been clashes since the day this started. Two people were shot and killed here, just yesterday, during clashes between Palestinians who were throwing stones and the Israeli military, who was responding and firing back. 
 
There have been upwards of 70-plus people in the West Bank who have been killed in clashes and in fighting with the Israeli military and including settlers, as well, who have been on the attack since all of this happened. 
 
The real concern here, obviously, is how big these protests get and what the response is going to be from the Israeli military as the Israeli military had said it is in war. And they officially declared that back after the attack from Hamas on Saturday. 
 
Here in the West Bank, there are always some sort of clashes. Palestinians, at this point in time, cannot leave the West Bank, because it has been closed off by the Israelis for the most part so that people can't easily get in and out. 
 
And certainly, tensions are extremely high. There are plenty of Palestinians here who have family that live in Gaza, who are living with these dire consequences in Gaza, who don't have water, who don't have food, who don't have fuel. And they are hoping, beyond hope, there will be some humanitarian aid that comes in.
 
But mostly they're concerned about the air strikes that continue to go on and on. And Hamas calling for the entire Arab world and the world at large to come out and protest against what they say is the Israeli occupation of Gaza. And they have been very clear about what they want people to do. 
 
We should start seeing some activity after the prayers, after the noon prayers here in Ramallah -- Erin. 
 
BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Sara. And of course, we're going to be checking back in with you.
 
As Sara says, you know, it is usually after mosque and prayers and that these protests often begin. 
 
President Biden in his primetime speech casting the moment in history as what he calls an inflection point, and a battle for the world's democracies. 
 
But we have some new polling about how Americans really feel about this, how they feel about President Biden's handling of the wars in Israel and Ukraine. 
 
And the defense minister here in Israel telling troops they will soon see Gaza from the inside. What does that really look like? Is that -- is that all those troops on the border? Is that just some of them? What would it really look like? We'll be back.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:11:56]
 
HARLOW: President Biden alerting the nation that providing aid to the war efforts in Ukraine and Israel is, in his words, quote, "vital for America's national security." 
 
In an impassioned address from the Oval Office last night, the president explained the funding is imperative for the future of American leadership and for democracies to be sustained worldwide. 
 
And he also warned that U.S. adversaries and competitors are watching. 
 
Arlette Saenz has more for us this morning from the White House. Good morning. 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Poppy. 
 
President Biden used the Oval Office to paint a stark picture of what is at stake in these wars in Israel and Ukraine. The president drew a direct line between the two very different
 
 conflicts, warning that they pose a threat not just to U.S. national security, but also democracy at large. 
 
Now, President Biden faces the difficult task of convincing skeptical Americans to get on board. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAENZ (voice-over): President Biden appealing directly to the American people, making the case for aid to allies facing existential threats. 
 
BIDEN: Making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America's national security. 
 
SAENZ (voice-over): In a rare Oval Office address, Biden declaring the U.S. must remain a, quote, "beacon to the world." 
 
BIDEN: American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. To put all that at risk, if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it's just not worth it. 
 
SAENZ (voice-over): And warning what happens when dictators don't pay a price for their actions. 
 
BIDEN: They cause more chaos and death and more destruction. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen. 
 
SAENZ (voice-over): Biden casts this moment as an inflection point, arguing that his request for North of $100 billion in aid for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and the U.S. Southern border is necessary. 
 
BIDEN: Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common. They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy. 
 
SAENZ (voice-over): The White House believes it has bipartisan support in Congress for the aid package, but securing the funding will likely be a challenge. 
 
Recent CNN polling shows Americans are unsure of what U.S. involvement in Israel should look like, and the appetite for sending aid to Ukraine is waning. 
 
Congress failed to pass the last White House request for aid made in August. All this while the House sits paralyzed, unable to pass any legislation at all until they elect a speaker. 
 
BIDEN: We can't let petty partisan angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. 
 
SAENZ (voice-over): Biden reaffirming the United States's commitment to Israel's security, but urged its government to reflect on the lessons learned after 9/11. 
 
BIDEN: While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes. So I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage. 
 
SAENZ (voice-over): Biden also acknowledging the high tensions the October 7th terror attack has sparked here at home. After his speech, he spoke to the father of 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume, who was fatally stabbed because he was Muslim. 
 <br>[06:15:04]
 
BIDEN: Let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms, all forms of hate, whether against Muslims, Jews or anyone. That's what great nations do. And we are a great nation. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAENZ (on camera): As the president made this pitch to Americans, we're also getting a look at how Americans view the president's handling of this situation in Israel. 
 
According to a new CBS/YouGov poll, 44 percent of Americans approve, while the majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of this conflict in Israel. That's similar to the marks the president is getting in his approach to Ukraine.
 
And -- but it is slightly higher than his overall approval rating, which sat at about 40 percent in that poll. 
 
But it's clear, Phil, that the coming weeks and months ahead will be critical in determining whether President Biden's strategy is the right one as he's trying to prevent this conflict in Israel from widening into a deeper crisis. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. That's such a critical point. It also underscores both the origin and rationale for the speech last night and the details of the emergency aid package that the White House will be sending up to Capitol Hill in just a matter of hours. 
 
And the details here matter, because they get at what Arlette was laying out. Not just the policy but also the politics and trying to figure out a path forward in a building that doesn't currently have an operating House of Representatives. 
 
So what's in the package? You heard the big kind of rhetorical soaring speech that the president had last night. The details here matter. And here's why. 
 
Not only does it include $60 billion for Ukraine, which roughly aligns with an annual appropriation to continue the U.S. aid towards Ukraine for a long period of time, not to have month-to-month reups that have caused so much political division, given House Republican opposition to much of that aid. 
 
When it comes to Israel, the president and his team having very in- depth discussions, I'm told, about what the Israelis needed, while the president was over there, landing around $14 billion. 
 
But there's also other elements, as well. Humanitarian aid, which has been critical, both Ukraine and other places around the world. But look at this, $14 billion for the border, drug trafficking, fentanyl. That's important, because Republicans will have to support this plan, as well. They can point to that as a critical need. The administration says it's critical, as well. 
 
And also, $7 billion for the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan. That is also a bipartisan issue. 
 
The administration, in this national security package, really trying to drive towards something that can get a majority support in the House and the Senate. They believe it's there, whether or not the House actually has a speaker. 
 
Still at this point an open question. Why the difference between Israel -- aid to Israel and Ukraine? This is an important point here. Because it's not as dramatic as it may look in this emergency package. 
 
In fact, the $14 billion is roughly what the Israelis were asking for in terms of needs. And here's in part why. If you look at the scale of U.S. assistance and you want to understand just how close this alliance is, $260 plus billion adjusted for inflation since World War II is more than any other country that the U.S. gives military aid to. 
 
Obviously, Israel was created in 1948. The difference is critical. Ukraine, so large in part because it's not just money going to Ukraine, it is going to help U.S. stocks and rebuilding those. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: We send Ukraine equipment sitting in our stockpiles. And when we use the money allocated by Congress, we use it to replenish our own stores, our own stockpiles with new equipment. Equipment that defends America and is made in America. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Significant from the president, making that distinction for the American people, especially for those who do not support more aid there. 
 
MATTINGLY: How this works matters. 
 
HARLOW: Yes. So this just in, also the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has announced that eligible Israeli citizens and nationals can now travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. 
 
This speeds up a previously-announced plan which was set to begin on the 30th of November. Israel joins the visa waiver program that covers citizens in more than 40 countries with biometric passports. 
 
MATTINGLY: And new overnight, CNN's team on the ground witnessing increased military activity along Israel's border with Gaza, including several flares. What that could mean for the timing of Israel's potential ground incursion. HARLOW: Also this new overnight. A U.S. Navy destroyer near Yemen
 
 intercepted multiple missiles after bases in Iraq and Syria, we have learned also had to repel drone attacks. The latest on tensions rising across the region, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:21:20]
 
HARLOW: There are new signs the Israeli Defense Force could move into Gaza at any minute. CNN has seen a buildup of military right along the border and now flares late into the night. 
 
This comes as Israeli government officials tell CNN's Nic Robertson that the troops have the, quote, "green light" to enter Gaza. 
 
MATTINGLY: Now, those officials also say that Gaza's 50-mile border with Israel will look radically different after any military incursion. 
 
They tell CNN that a tough buffer zone will be established, one that will essentially be a no-go zone, and the IDF will be able to go into Gaza and arrest people whenever they want -- this is theoretically -- on their terms. Much like they can now in the West Bank. 
 
Joining us now from the Magic Wall, CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. Sir, good to see you. 
 
I want to start with the flares. Because Nic Robertson was pointing this out. We showed video of it right now. And he made clear that that's not the norm, necessarily, in this moment. What does that tell you? 
 
LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It just tells me that the Israeli forces are looking for something or they're trying to use a little bit of psychological warfare against the people inside of Gaza. 
 
This is not that big of a deal. It is just to show potentially the commanders that are on the scene where different crossing points are, what they're looking for. It's to orient those who are new to the area. 
 
HARLOW: Big question is will this become a regional conflict? The president talked about that last night. Let's talk about what we have just seen in the region, the fact that two sources told CNN overnight that Navy warships, U.S. Navy warships operating in the Middle East had to counter multiple projectiles, fired on the coast of Yemen yesterday. 
 
And then you couple that with what the Pentagon says are drone attack attempts in Iraq and where U.S. officials are in Iraq and - and Syria. 
 
HERTLING: Yes. A couple things that happened yesterday. The drone attack out -- off the coast of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden down here against the U.S.S. Carney drew a lot of attention. Integrated air defense from that ship shot the drones and their
 
 missiles down that were coming out of Yemen. That's important. But the range from there to Israel is pretty far. And it's -- they don't have a great missile force, let's put it that way. 
 
But the other things that were occurring are -- would be a normal day in some -- in some countries. Like the drone attack at al-Tanf in Syria, that is a U.S. military base, and that particular reason, it's been there for a while. 
 
Other drone attacks, al Assad Air Force Base. I've been out there many times in Iraq, in Irbil, Baghdad and in the Southern part of Iraq, just tells me that the popular mobilization fronts, the Iranian-backed rebels, are actually targeting those kinds of locations, just as harassment attacks. 
 
There was also two Israeli citizens killed in Egypt, which just shows that there's a swell of a ground movement that is a result of some of the things that have been going on there. And all of these, the Arab street does not want Israel to go into Gaza. 
 
MATTINGLY: Let's take a step back to what your point has been. I think it's very valuable to note that these bases, these U.S. bases are often harassed or often subject to drone attacks or rocket attacks. 
 
All of it happening on the same day, the same day the president gives an Oval Office address, as Israel is preparing for what looks like a ground incursion. Different proxies that we're on --
 
HERTLING: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: -- but does that tell you something? 
 
HERTLING: Yes. It's a call for -- it's a call for harassment, it's a call for attacks, it is a Jihad. They are receiving information from Iran, saying let's up the ante a little bit and show our displeasure at what's going on in Israel. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you. Always helpful. 
 
HERTLING: You bet. 
 
HARLOW: Appreciate it. So take a look at this. These are live images right now. This is the Rafah border crossing, where critical humanitarian aid is supposed to be getting into Gaza from Egypt. 
 <br>[06:25:03]
 
The U.N. secretary-general is on the Egyptian side, where trucks are loaded with aid. They are waiting just to get into Gaza. What we know about when that could happen and why it keeps being delayed. That's ahead. 
 
MATTINGLY: Coming up, we'll speak to a member of Doctors Without Borders who says the main hospital in Gaza is just hours away from losing electricity. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BURNETT: Welcome back. I'm Erin Burnett, live in Tel Aviv, Israel. 
 
Moments ago, a large group of people were seen rallying for the opening of the Rafah crossing, on the Egypt border. You can see this. This is right outside that border. 
 
A few miles around that crossing, there's craters in front of it. We understand about 20 trucks. Some of those drivers have told us they saw the Egyptian moving concrete as if there was maybe the possibility of it opening.
 
But subsequently, CNN has learned that the Rafah closing [SIC] will not open today, as had been anticipated. 
 
That sense of on the ground, and that -- that terrain, that desert, gives you some perspective on where we stand right now.</pre>
