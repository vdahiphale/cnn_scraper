COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What`s up sunshine. Hope you got more treats than tricks last night. Happy Halloween. This year is flying by it`s Wednesday, 
 
 November 1st. I swear it feels like just yesterday. It was October. It`s the start of a glorious galette of holidays. Let`s make it a wonderful time 
 
 of the year. Shall we? 
 
We start today with pop quiz, hot shot. 
 
Ten second trivia. 
 
Caracas is the capital of what South American nation?
 
Venezuela, Peru, Columbia, or Bolivia?
 
Caracas is the capital of Venezuela located in a valley within the Andes mountains. 
 
Venezuela, where we take you now is once one of the wealthiest countries in South America. And did you know that it says on the world`s largest oil 
 
 reserves, but for the past 15 years or so, the economy has been in shambles and that has added to why many Venezuelan have been fleeing. In the U.S. 
 
 that has contributed to a migrant crisis.
 
In August alone, the Department of Homeland Security said, it encountered more than 55,000 migrants from Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua at the Mexico 
 
 border. So, what has happened to Venezuela`s economy and where does all of this leave everyday Venezuelans? CNN`s Stefano Pozzebon explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hundreds of thousands of migrants enter in the U.S. are from Venezuela. But this country`s economy collapsed 
 
 in 2014, almost a decade ago. So what is causing these later spike right now?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Venezuelan among the top nationalities of migrants arriving in the U.S.
 
POZZEBON:  Venezuela was once one of the richest countries in South America, but it never recovers since it enter recession in 2014. When the 
 
 price of oil and other commodities are plummeted in 2015, Venezuela`s revenues dried up almost overnight. And the entire country basically went 
 
 bankrupt. Inflation was rampant and most of everyday goods were impossible to find.
 
Since then, the socioeconomic crisis has not improved under the government of authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro. And research shows then more than 
 
 80% of the population here, still leave below the poverty line. While they may not have all headed to the U.S. between 2014 and 2020, more than 4 
 
 million Venezuelans left the country, according to the United nations.
 
Right now, more than 7.7 millions leave outside of Venezuela. And that is about 25% of the population. To give you an idea, it`s like if the entire 
 
 population of California and Texas left the U.S. in less than a decade.
 
In the last few years, a growing number has started moving north directly towards the U.S. southern border through the Darien Gap, a dense stretch of 
 
 jungle that connects the South America and Central America. 
 
Social media has also played a significant role because more and more people are documenting their trip and posting it on the likes of Facebook, 
 
 WhatsApp, Instagram and TikTok. Informal migrant networks and businesses that help people just at the beginning of the journey have also sped up the 
 
 pace of migration. More than 400,000 people have already crossed the jungle as of September this year. And the largest group are from Venezuela. 
 
Currently, there are over half a million Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. This month, the White House has starting deporting Venezuela migrants might 
 
 enter the country illegally, directly back here to Caracas.
 
Political change in Venezuela is not happening anytime soon, with months deposition candidates bar from running for election. And over 270 political 
 
 prisoners are still behind bars. Countries in the region are saying that they`re looking for conservative solutions to handle this historic 
 
 migration flow. But as long as Venezuela remains in such dire straits, this emergency only since destined to continue.

WIRE:  Now, we continue our coverage of AI, Artificial Intelligence. Developments in the world of AI are happening fast. The hope is that it can 
 
 spur innovation in health science and technology. The fear is that it might harm national security, replace human workers and upend entire industries. 
 
Monday President Biden unveiled an executive order to address concerns over safety. Executive Orders are signed into law by the president bypassing 
 
 congressional approval. But they`re far less powerful than congressional laws because they can be challenged in court and canceled by future 
 
 presidents. Let`s turn to CNN`s Mike Valerio, to learn more about what this order contains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So today matters because this is the first set of federal regulations governing artificial 
 
 intelligence that have been made. But there are still huge challenges ahead. 
 
(Voice-over):  Artificial intelligence technology is advancing rapidly. And the federal government is scrambling to keep up. 
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT:  I`m about to sign an executive order. The executive order, that is the most significant action any government 
 
 anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security and trust.
 
VALERIO:  The White House unveiling, a sweeping new executive order Monday aimed at mitigating the risks of AI while also harnessing its potential.
 
BIDEN:  To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risk, we need to govern this technology.
 
VALERIO:  According to the Biden administration, the order will require all AI developers to share results of their safety tests with the federal 
 
 government. Before they`re released to the public, compel companies to notify the government if an AI model in development poses national 
 
 security, economic, or health risks, ease immigration barriers for skilled workers to study and stay in the U.S., establish standards to prevent AI 
 
 production of dangerous biological materials, and develop best practices to minimize the risks of AI displacing human workers. Among a number of other 
 
 key concerns, Harvard`s Bruce Schneier says getting AI regulation right, is critical. 
 
BRUCE SCHNEIER, HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL:  They`re not freewheeling technology, they`re more like pharmaceuticals. You get them wrong and 
 
 people die. 
 
VALERIO:  He says, AI has the potential to transform the way we live and work for the better. If the technology is kept in check.
 
SCHNEIER:  This is going in the beginning of a very long and national process, but it`s to start, it`s an important start. 
 
VALERIO:  Now, just one more important point to stress, this is an executive order. This is not a law governing artificial intelligence. The 
 
 Congress is hosting ongoing hearings through the rest of the year to talk with experts and figure out the best ways to create legislation, to put up 
 
 guard rails for artificial intelligence. That`s latest here in Los Angeles, I`m Mike Valerio.

WIRE:  Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a coyote trying to absquatulate from an airport. Police on the prowl for a coyote in its howl 
 
 at an airport in LA on the runway dodging planes. Who would win the race of this wild and frantic chase of a coyote on the loose. Here`s CNN`s Jeanne 
 
 Moos.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At least this coyote is smart enough to look before crossing a runway, turns out it was running 
 
 away from the airport police at Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles. A chopper from KCAL was stopping by to refuel when it captured the coyote chase. 
 
We couldn`t tell if the police were beeping. What we do know there was no roadrunner in sight. We can`t tell you much of anything about the coyote 
 
 that did not introduce itself. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My name is Cayote, Wile E. Coyote. 
 
MOOS:  So our wily reporter can do is play comical chase music, and what the video roll. Coyote sightings here in the San Fernando valley are so 
 
 common. There`s a Facebook page devoted to them with posts like, "Coyotes in my house. Two coyotes, just walking to my house through the garage. Dogs 
 
 scared them away."
 
It was the police vehicle`s mission to scare the airport coyote away. Unlike Wile E. Coyote, airport coyote did not end up flattened. A 
 
 spokesperson for Van Nuys Airport told CNN we are happy to report that the coyote was able to find its way safely out. Ready for departure subject 
 
 only to its own, coyote control. Jeanne Moos CNN, New York.

WIRE:  All right, congrats to @amani2626 from Prairie Trail in Olathe, Kansas. You are the winner of #YourWordWednesday for absquatulate, a verb 
 
 meaning to leave abruptly. Well done. 
 
Before I absquatulate on up out here, our first school shout out of November goes to, the Mavericks, the Mighty Mavericks in Mrs. Rams (ph) 
 
 class at United Middle School and Laredo, Texas. Thank you for the epic shout out on TikTok. And thanks to everyone who submitted vocab words. 
 
 You`re making us smarter, words, use them. I`m Coy Wire. And we are CNN 10.
