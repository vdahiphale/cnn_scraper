ELENI GIOKOS, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Hello and welcome to "Connect the World". I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Becky Anderson this hour, 
 
 exclusive new reporting on atrocities being committed in Sudan, CNN has uncovered evidence that Russian Mercenary Group Wagner is complicit.
 
Explosions in Kyiv, just as African Leaders arrive in the Ukrainian Capital on a peace mission. Ukraine's Foreign Minister says it's clear the attack 
 
 show Russia is not interested in peace. UN agencies call for decisive action after at least 78 people are killed in a migrant boat tragedy off 
 
 the coast of Greece hundreds more are fear dead. And sources say the U.S. has quietly restarted indirect talks with Iran in an effort to curb 
 
 Tehran's nuclear program and secure the release of three detained Americans.
 
Welcome to the show. Now Sudanese rights organization say atrocities are being committed in Darfur and CNN has uncovered evidence that the Russian 
 
 Mercenary Group Wagner is complicit continuing to support the RSF Sudan's Rapid Support Forces paramilitary throughout the months of fighting despite 
 
 calls by U.S. and others for support to cease.
 
In an exclusive CNN investigation, we uncovered the Russian supply lines, prolonging the conflict between the RSF and Sudan's armed forces that has 
 
 displaced around 2 million people since mid-April and push the country further into humanitarian crisis.
 
The RSF denies links to Wagner and any involvement in mass rape. Now as part of this investigation, CNN verified and corroborated incidents of rape 
 
 perpetrated by RSF including one which was captured on video.
 
We feel it is important in the face of the RSF's repeated denials to broadcast parts of that video and we must warn you it is graphic and 
 
 disturbing. CNN's Chief International Investigative Correspondent Nima Elbagir brings us the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The fighting on the streets of Sudan is relentless. Ceasefire after 
 
 ceasefire has not helped forces previously accused of genocide returning to a well-worn playbook, terrorize expel and ethnically clones.
 
The paramilitary "Rapid Support Forces" RSF are currently engaged in a fight for dominance with Sudan's army. But years before that rivalry 
 
 spilled blood in Sudan's streets. They were implicated in atrocities in Darfur. Now, once again Darfur to the west of the country is stoked by the 
 
 specter of genocide.
 
The damage wrought by these forces so extensive you can see it from satellite images. This is Al Junaynah, West Darfur, hundreds killed whole 
 
 districts raised to the ground. And it's not only Al Junaynah goes burning, this is Andre and this Kadumi (ph).
 
On the ground, it looks like this, these scenes sadly familiar in Darfur. 20 years ago, the region descended into genocide. The same RSF leadership 
 
 in place as their men killed, occupied and raped. Now once again, women's bodies are part of the field of war.
 
This video is too disturbing to broadcast in full but it goes on to show a girl believed to be just 15-years-old, being raped. You see here a man in 
 
 light colored fatigues matching those worn by the RSF. We've paused the video just before the camera pans to show another soldier wearing the same 
 
 uniform, forcing himself onto the prone girl.
 
CNN verified and geo-located the area where this happened, we're not revealing the exact location in Khartoum to protect our sources and the 
 
 young girl. This is not an isolated incident. We received and reviewed dozens of cases where women say they were raped by RSF soldiers. 
 
 Identifying them by their light colored fatigues and the insignia on their right shoulders, so who is complicit in this pain?
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
The RSF key ally the notorious Russian Mercenary Group Wagner has been sustaining their fight and providing the impetus to slaughter innocent 
 
 people by supplying arms. We're going to show you how. This is an illusion 76 cargo plane operated by Wagner sitting at a Libyan air base.
 
A previous CNN investigation exposed how this Russian cargo plane was providing the RSF with deadly arms from a Russian naval base in Latakia, 
 
 Syria. Via Wagner controlled bases in Libya. This pattern starts just days before the war begins in Sudan.
 
Libya, Syria and back and it picks up pace. What's interesting here is the new focus on the city where it goes next, Bangui the Capital of the Central 
 
 African Republic. After our exposure of the Libya route a route directly from the Central African Republic into Darfur became crucial for the RSF.
 
Eyewitnesses at key transit points and intelligence active in the region told CNN arms and supplies from this illusion transported overland, using 
 
 the truck captured here and others like it. First to a Wagner base in Birao (ph) and then into South Darfur to an RSF base in Darfur.
 
Wagner putting their thumb on the scales here to secure access to Sudan's resources through Darfur creating chaos and terror, helping tip the balance 
 
 of power in their war in Ukraine whatever the cost, Nima Elbagir, CNN, South Sudan.

GIOKOS: The Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker and the -- network earlier released an open letter to the UN, the EU and the African Union and 
 
 the U.S., among others, saying we write to alert you to the escalating violence against civilians in Junaynah, West Darfur which we believe shows 
 
 a pattern of ethnic cleansing that may further increase and qualify as serious international crimes including possibly genocide.
 
Dr. Suliman Baldo, Sudanese Democracy and Human Rights Activist is also the Executive Director of the Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker. He joins 
 
 us now live from West Orange, New Jersey. Sir really good to have you on thank you so much! I'm sure you've seen our reporting exclusive reporting 
 
 from Nima Elbagir.
 
I want to start off with how you're defining what is happening in Darfur right now. And the question is also being asked in terms of what it will 
 
 take to constrain the RSF's progression into Darfur.
 
DR. SULIMAN BALDO, SUDANESE DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Thank you for having me. How I define what's happening in Darfur now it's of course 
 
 not inter-ethnic -- what it is not. It is not a tribal fight. It's not that people versus people fight.
 
It is a systematic campaign by an armed group of militias, going after defenseless civilians, attacking, killing and raping them on the basis of 
 
 ethnicity. And this for us, for the woman constitutes a massive campaign of ethnic cleansing.
 
That is susceptible of escalating into even more serious crimes against humanity, war crimes and even genocide. If the international community does 
 
 not stand up to the challenge and protect civilians in Darfur and in Sudan across the country.
 
GIOKOS: Yes. Look, the RSF a well-armed and we heard from Nima's reporting, that showing the backing of the powerful Wagner Group. A U.S. State 
 
 Department condemning atrocities calling it ominous reminder of genocide, you're talking about ethnic cleansing. Is this a return to the dark days of 
 
 the Darfur war, or as some say, potentially, a scenario that is even worse than what we saw in the early 2000s?
 
BALDO: The potential is really great. And that's why I'm very concerned that this could be worse than 2003 for different reasons. Today, there are 
 
 more rapid communication means among different militia clans that identify with each other and join forces.
 
And they have also faster means of transport, rather than the camels and the horses of 2003. We see them now gathering rapidly on the call of 
 
 mobilization on social media on motorbikes using also four wheeled vehicles coming from all different regions of Darfur, but also from neighboring 
 
 countries.
 
This is a transnational cross border marauding militia set of groups operating today in Darfur and attacking civilians on the basis of 
 
 ethnicity. The groups are of Arab origin those targeted on -- groups that are sedentary that are of African origin.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
And there is a total absence of state authority collapse of the government of Sudan, since the Sudan Armed Forces is not able and capable or willing 
 
 to protect civilians in this case.
 
GIOKOS: Yes. I want to talk about the killing of the Governor of West Duffel. He was outspoken about the atrocities that were being committed by 
 
 RSF. What does his abduction and killing signal do you think?
 
BALDO: It signals the total collapse of state authority. In fact, the collapse of the state simply put. The Governor is the highest executive 
 
 authority in the state and there is a garrison of the Sudan armed forces in the town and it failed to protect not only the Governor but the entire 
 
 civilian population of the city.
 
So it tells you there is no functioning there is a void of government, there is a void of the state in which Darfur state but also across the 
 
 historic region of Darfur in all different states.
 
GIOKOS: Look, we are discussing the dynamics that are playing out, particularly with the dynamics of the violence that is ensuing, including 
 
 that power vacuum that has been created by the fighting in Khartoum.
 
How that is complicated matters? And how confident are you about a ceasefire, which we know the ceasefires keep falling apart? I mean, I guess 
 
 the question is what do you think will bring this current spate of violence to an end?
 
BALDO: I'm very worried because the international community, regional organization, the African Union, the EGOT organization, but also United 
 
 Nations, and the mediator in the agenda process for reaching humanitarian ceasefire negotiations that are led by the U.S. and the Kingdom of Saudi 
 
 Arabia.
 
All of them are focused on the national fight between Sudan armed forces and the "Rapid Support Force". And no one among these organizations is 
 
 paying attention to what's happening in Sudan peripheries where the conflict is taking a life of its own and reaching dimensions that are 
 
 horrendous, with heinous crimes being committed at massive systematic widespread scales, qualifying them for serious crimes against humanity, 
 
 ethnic cleansing and very likely heading into a phase of unicycle killings.
 
So the international community needs to step up to this challenge, to speak out and hold these two armies responsible for what they have unleashed on 
 
 the Sudanese people, not only destroying the capital and the economic infrastructure and the human infrastructure of Sudan but also allowing 
 
 Sudan to disintegrate and fall into violent chaos as it's happening today. So the international community needs to escalate in its treat of the "Rapid 
 
 Support Forces" and Sudan Armed Forces as we speak.
 
GIOKOS: Yes. Dr. Baldo, you gave an important message and of course, a stark warning if we don't see immediate intervention, immediate talking 
 
 between the parties for some solution. Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts with us. We appreciate your time.
 
And you can follow the latest from Sudan online, we have testimonies detailing atrocities, by Wagner backed militia in Darfur, and we have more 
 
 evidence that Russia's notorious paramilitary group is making the violence worse. You can find it all @cnn.com on your PC, or you can go to the CNN 
 
 app on your Smartphone.
 
You're watching "Connect the World". Still to come, the most intense Russian attack on Ukraine's capital region in weeks, it comes as a group of 
 
 African leaders arrive on a peace mission. Plus, imagine being stuck on a plane for 24 hours that happened to some journalists and security officers 
 
 traveling with South Africa's President to Ukraine. We'll talk with someone who was onboard. That is all coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
GIOKOS: Ukrainian authorities say at least six people were injured in an onslaught of Russian missile attacks in the Kyiv region. Residential and 
 
 commercial areas were hit the Ukrainian military claims it took our 12 Russian missiles including six hypersonic Kinzhal.
 
The attack came as a delegation of leaders from African nations arrived in Kyiv for what they call a peace mission. South African President Cyril 
 
 Ramaphosa is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
 
The group is expected to meet Vladimir Putin on Saturday in Russia. We got Sam Kiley, back with us this hour from Kyiv. African Delegation in Kyiv 
 
 while we see this barrage of attacks on the Capital, take us through what transpired.
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well Eleni, there has always been an assumption and understanding that when a particularly a Head 
 
 of State or Head of Government very high level delegations of visiting care, people have noted that the Russians tended not to attack the capital.
 
But with the arrival of Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African President and others in a seven nation delegation, that was not the case, which is 
 
 peculiar because Mr. Ramaphosa in particular, and his government have come under a lot of criticism from Ukraine and her allies for the ties they have 
 
 with the Kremlin.
 
Which lately included joint military exercises, naval exercises with the Russians, allegations of sanctions busting potentially, or weapons supplies 
 
 by South Africa allegedly made by the U.S. out of D.C.?
 
So a lot of these situations would have indicated that perhaps Mr. Ramaphosa would be more welcome here, given that he's going on to the 
 
 Kremlin to meet with Vladimir Putin tomorrow, but clearly, he'll have a question for the Russian President.
 
That's why did you bomb the city that I was in alongside my African colleagues? Ukrainian saying this is sending a message to Africa. Now that 
 
 message is being delivered on an almost daily basis across Ukraine as you know Eleni with the Russians efforts to overwhelm the air defenses here.
 
With the Germans just announcing actually that they've given an extra 64 patriot missiles. Now, these patriot missiles along with all of the other 
 
 anti-missile systems are absolutely essential. Just take a look at what the Ukrainians are facing?
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KILEY (voice over): A graveyard of Russian missiles fired at Ukraine, creating misery and mayhem. They're stored and analyzed here in Kyiv, where 
 
 authorities are determined that Russia will pay for its evil ingenuity. Here in Kryvyi the latest mass destruction by a Russian cruise missile, 
 
 adding to a mounting civilian toll this strike the result of Russia's determination to overwhelm and distract Ukraine's defenses.
 
KILEY (on camera): Oleksander is telling me that these two missiles enormous and complex, though they are actually decoys. They're used by the 
 
 Russians to fire over enormous ranges, trying to distract the Ukrainian air defenses so that other more dangerous missiles can get through.
 
KILEY (voice over): Oleksander's ministry is tracing, cataloging and costing the results of Russia's missile attacks. Each type of weapon has 
 
 its own local history, like these -- that carry half a ton of explosives.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
OLEKSANDER, KYIV SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC EXPERTISE: These munitions are designed to kill people, soldiers and lightly armored 
 
 vehicles. So they knew where they were aiming for.
 
KILEY (on camera): This is the sort of missile that hit the Kramatorsk railway station killing more than 50 people.
 
KILEY (voice over): Five of the dead were children and schools were injured awaiting for a train to escape the war. The latest official estimates 
 
 suggest that Russia's destruction of Ukraine will cost $441 billion. But the human cost is incalculable help with air defense has therefore been 
 
 vital.
 
KILEY (on camera): This is what remains of what Russia says is its most potent missile that Kinzhal is supposedly a hypersonic, traveling up to 10 
 
 times the speed of sound. And Oleksander is very pleased to point out that this is where it was hit by the Ukrainian counter missile batteries. Of 
 
 course top of their list is the U.S. made patriot.
 
KILEY (voice over): But among the most troublesome Russian weapons is this Iranian Shahed drone.
 
KILEY (on camera): Look at that. That is the engine of a Shahed -- -. Sounds like a lawnmower because it basically is a lawnmower engine or 
 
 something very similar.
 
KILEY (voice over): Oleksander and colleagues dismantle the drones, analyze their computers and navigation systems and time and again, find foreign 
 
 made parts inside despite sanctions on Iran and Russia.
 
KILEY (on camera): The Aircraft has 40 kilograms of high explosives onboard down here at the end in Russian there's a play on words. On one flap it 
 
 says, do not touch, but by removing one letter translates into not brothers a message to the Ukrainians.
 
KILEY (voice over): One that often delivered loud and all too clearly.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KILEY: Now, Eleni, those six of those Kinzhals were shot down, as you pointed out by the Patriot missiles. And the NATO partners have also 
 
 pledged a great deal more short and medium range anti-missiles, anti- aircraft missile systems. I think it's likely they'll be deployed on the frontlines as this Ukrainian counter offensive build, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: All right, Sam Kiley, thank you so much. Well, you heard the President of South Africa visited Kyiv. But the visit hasn't been without 
 
 controversy. Members of Mr. Ramaphosa's security detail and local journalists were on a plane in Poland for more than 24 hours.
 
Polish authorities say they didn't have permits for weapons they brought on board. Pieter Du Toit is a journalist for News24 in South Africa. He was on 
 
 that plane and he joins us now from Warsaw. I assume you're now in a hotel. I've been following your tweets.
 
I just see the logistical nightmare that has ensued since you got on that flight headed towards Ukraine. Give us a sense of what you injured and what 
 
 the Polish authorities have been saying?
 
PIETER DU TOIT, ASSISTANT EDITOR, NEWS24: Eleni thanks. Look, it's been a long week, actually more than a week in the making when the news came 
 
 through from the presidency about two weeks ago that we should prepare to join him, join the president of South Africa on this trip, this peacemaking 
 
 trip to Ukraine and Russia.
 
Journalists, local journalists in South Africa were obviously very excited about going on this trip, given the attempts that our president said he was 
 
 going to make to bring peace to the region. Given South Africa's difficult position, it finds himself in the world of geopolitics, rock and a hard 
 
 place between the West and Russia.
 
We were obviously very enthusiastic to see how his efforts will be received unfortunately, after having left alternative Air Force Base in Pretoria 
 
 Wednesday night. Often numerous delays, we were detained in Poland in Warsaw at the Sharper International Airport for more than 26 hours after a 
 
 standoff between Polish authorities and South African officials.
 
The plane as you said earlier, was carrying a number of South African Special Forces operatives tasked the members of the South African Police 
 
 Service tasked with protecting the president. They were not allowed to disembark for more than 26 hours. They were not allowed to disembark to 
 
 move to a different plane that charter plane which was supposed to carry a contingent of those Special Forces personnel to go and protect the 
 
 president on during his visit to Ukraine.
 
GIOKOS: So Pieter, you're not off the plane. You've just disembarked now, correct? You finally have disembarked?
 
TOIT: Yes.
 
GIOKOS: It ended a few minutes ago. Is that correct? OK, so I just want to talk about the fact look, we know what's going on with South Africa. And 
 
 frankly, many other African countries have voted against denouncing the war in Ukraine.
 
And yet you have the peace delegation going to Ukraine and then heading off to the summit in St. Petersburg. And they want to discuss a peace deal and 
 
 to help broker a peace deal.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
South Africa is hosting the BRICS summit later this year. We know there's a race warrant out for Vladimir Putin. There's a question around how the 
 
 South Africans are going to respond to that. In the messaging from the South African government, what did they want to achieve through the strip 
 
 going to Ukraine, and then going to speak to Vladimir Putin?
 
TOIT: Look, Eleni, I think it's very clear that the South African government is in a very difficult position. South Africa is most of our 
 
 economic ties lies with Western countries with Europe, with the United States. But in the world of international politics, it is not clearly and 
 
 firmly aligned itself with Russia, which is starting to have serious effects on the country and country's economy.
 
I think this trip was an attempt to show the world that despite us, you know, proclaiming or non-alignment, but in practical terms has certainly 
 
 not been on the line is trying to play a role to show the world that the country is relevant on the world stage.
 
And that it can bring or help at least to bring Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. It remains to be seen whether or not that can be 
 
 successful, he still has to meet Vladimir Putin, ostensibly tomorrow.
 
But if you talk about messaging from the presidency, the messaging that I've been getting, the messaging that I've been seeing, is that still 
 
 remains a lot of distrust between from South African authorities towards the Ukraine and certainly much warmer feeling towards Vladimir Putin and 
 
 the Russians that the President of South Africa will be meeting on Saturday.
 
GIOKOS: All right, Pieter Du Toit, great to have you on, thank you for making the time. Like our Vladimir Putin has been largely isolated 
 
 internationally during his invasion of Ukraine, he received a show of support at his premier annual events. The St. Petersburg International 
 
 Economic Forum, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE's ruler and President met with his Russian counterparts to discuss bilateral relations and the 
 
 situation in Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: I would like to thank you for your efforts in resolving humanitarian issues happening during the events around 
 
 Ukraine connected with the exchange of those detained and resolving other humanitarian issues of a similar nature.
 
MOHAMED BIN ZAYED AL NAHYAN, UAE PRESIDENT: This partnership with you we are building it actively, so that the link between the UAE and Russia is 
 
 sure. We also hope that the world will become calmer so that we can multiply the strength of our relationship.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS: All right, the UAE is taking paths in the forum as a guest of honor at this year's edition Mohamed bin Zayed is the highest level foreign 
 
 official attending. Well, it wasn't necessarily a headline appearance on stage next to Putin. Mohamed bin Zayed's presence at the St. Petersburg 
 
 forum still holds a lot of political weights.
 
And will likely draw the ire of many Western leaders who have been pushing to alienate Moscow, how it's likely to play out in Washington. And what it 
 
 really says about the UAE's balancing act of discreet neutrality is all in today's edition of "Meanwhile in the Middle East" CNN's Middle East 
 
 Newsletter, you can just scan the QR code on the bottom of your screen right now. You can log in and read all about it.
 
Well, a two year federal investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department has found systemic problems that led directly to the murder of 
 
 George Floyd. Floyd was killed by former police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020. The report announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland found 
 
 the police department discriminated against people of color and didn't act to protect people in custody.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Found that MPD and the City of Minneapolis engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, 
 
 unlawfully discriminating against black and Native American people and enforcement activities. Violating the rights of people engaged in protected 
 
 speech and discriminating against people with behavioral disabilities and responding to them when responding to them in crisis.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS: All right. I want to get you up to speed on some other stories that are on our radar right now. After hernia surgery and nine days in hospital, 
 
 Pope Francis is continuing his recovery back at the Vatican. Security helped him get through the crowds and he joked with reporters assuring them 
 
 that he was still alive.
 
A Chinese football fan wants her to hug football great, Lionel Messi. He's now paying for it with police detention. Beijing Police say the teenager 
 
 stormed the pitch to meet his hero during a friendly between Australia and Argentina and the Chinese capital on Thursday. They aren't saying how long 
 
 he'll be held in custody.
 
Have a look at this, a recreation of a dinosaur given the name -- . Bones found on England's Isle of Wight led to the discovery of this new species.
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
Scientists say this armored dinosaur ate only plants. Families are looking for survivors after migrant boat capsized off Greece. Details on the 
 
 tearful reunion you're seeing right now and what we're learning about a series of arrests. Plus, Elon Musk speaks out about regulating artificial 
 
 intelligence. We're live from the Vivatech Fair in Paris with more on what he said. We'll be back right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GIOKOS: Welcome back to "Connect the World" with me Eleni Giokos coming to you from Dubai. Headlines the hour, authorities in Kyiv called the latest 
 
 Russian aerial attack on the region, the largest in weeks. At least six people were injured as residential areas were hit.
 
Now the attack came as a delegation of African leaders arrived in the capital on a peace mission. It includes South African President Cyril 
 
 Ramaphosa; he is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
 
The U.S. Secretary of State is set to depart for a weekend visit to China; Antony Blinken spoke with his Chinese counterparts earlier this week. 
 
 Blinken postponed a visit to Beijing in February after Washington accused China of floating a spy balloon over the U.S.
 
And Cyclone Biparjoy made landfall late Thursday nights in India's Gujarat States spearing Pakistan its full force. At least nine people have died and 
 
 23 have been injured. Some areas along the coast have been inundated with heavy rain flash flooding, damaging winds and storm surges.
 
Heavy rainfall warnings are still in place for Northwest India through Saturday. Now the International Organization for Migration, a UNHCR and UN 
 
 Refugee Agency want urgent and decisive action to prevent more deaths at sea.
 
This after at least 78 people was killed when a boat carrying migrants capsized of Greece on Wednesday. Some of the survivors have been taken to 
 
 this warehouse in Kalamata. Greek authorities say several people have been arrested but amongst the devastation, one story of hope, as a family is 
 
 reunited. CNN's Melissa Bell has details from southern Greece.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Nine Egyptian men have been arrested on suspicion of people trafficking, just some of those who survived the 
 
 disaster of Wednesday morning here, not far from the coast off of Greece. Those men now under arrest, the other survivors, most of them those who are 
 
 not still in hospital have now been transferred towards Athens where their asylum applications will be processed.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
It is of course, the fate of the other now believed to have been many hundreds who may have lost their lives that has been forefront of the mind 
 
 of so many people hoping for answers. Some of those desperate relatives have turned up here in Kalamata, hoping that their loved ones had survived.
 
As the survivors were taken away to Athens, one man who'd been looking for his brother was able to see him, touch him, hold him through a fence, most 
 
 of those who turned up here in Kalamata, of course, were disappointed given the scale of the tragedy.
 
It's now believed that 750 people may have been traveling on the boat, we may never know their true numbers, and we're unlikely ever to know their 
 
 actual names. We do understand from the survivors that there were women and children on board. They were in the holding, of course, given what the 
 
 Greek Coast Guard say about the 10 to 15 minutes that it took for the boat to sink.
 
They had very little hope, of being able to make it out. What the NGOs that work in places like Kalamata and all around the Mediterranean fear now is 
 
 that given the tightening of European policies with regard to immigration that these kinds of tragedies may actually increase. Melissa Bell, CNN, 
 
 Kalamata Greece.
 
GIOKOS: Well, the man accused of killing three people in Nottingham, England has now been charged with murder. Police say 31-year-old -- has 
 
 attacked three people with a knife Tuesday morning. Two of the victims were 19-year-old university students and the other was a 65-year-old man.
 
Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates has been in Beijing today meeting with President of China Xi Jinping. It's the tech tycoon's first trips of the 
 
 capitals since 2019. And his visit comes amid deeply strained relations between the U.S. and China per state media. Mr. Xi said he was very happy 
 
 to see Gates, he called an old friend of China, and he didn't stop there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA: You're the first American friend I've met in Beijing this year. I often say the basis of 
 
 China U.S. relations is among the people. We've always placed our hopes on the American people. In today's world, we can engage in all sorts of 
 
 activities beneficial to our two countries, to the people of the two countries and all of humanity. We're all pushing forward in this aspect.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS: Well, the future is here, or at least it's in Paris, which is hosting the annual Vivatech Technology Fair. Thousands of industry leaders 
 
 and startups are getting a look at what's on the horizon. Moments ago, they heard from the controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk, who said we all 
 
 have to be inspired.
 
That's not all, he said. He also talked about some of his moves since taking over Twitter, and about regulating artificial intelligence. CNN's 
 
 Anna Stewart is at the Fair, hi, Anna, great to see you. I mean, we're looking at the future. So people are questioning whether we still have a 
 
 future if AI really is as catastrophic as some people are hypothesizing. So what does Elon Musk say about look regulation and what is needed?
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: There was a lot to pack in there. And let me just tell you, Elon Musk wasn't announced to headline this event until last 
 
 week. And actually Vivatech here has had to use a stadium over the road, that capacity for 4600 people. And Eleni, it was packed. It was like being 
 
 at some sort of rock and roll concert.
 
And of course, here at Vivatech, Elon Musk is very much a revered celebrity. He has had such a huge impact on electric vehicles on space 
 
 tech, on payments with PayPal on Twitter. So of course, you can imagine what it was like sitting in the audience there. He got into a lot.
 
Lots of jokes lots about Twitter, he joked right at the beginning, did I if I'm so smart, why did I pay so much for Twitter. He was pushed through on 
 
 stage about whether Twitter should be allowing so much hate speech and misinformation to spread. And what he said was interesting.
 
As you know, he is sort of an absolutist when it comes to free speech. And he said freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach. He says people in 
 
 terms of free speech should be allowed to say whatever they want, but they will not promote those tweets. It's pretty controversial.
 
But you mentioned the other big topic. And this has been a topic on the stage and in the corridors of this event is AI. And all of the warnings 
 
 we've had now from so many pioneers of the technology, calling for a pause and wondering what the risks could be. This is what Elon Musk had to say 
 
 about that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: There's a real danger for digital super intelligence having negative consequences. And so if we are not careful with creating 
 
 artificial general intelligence, we could have potentially a catastrophic outcome. So now I think there's a range of possibilities. I think the most 
 
 likely outcome is positive for AI. But that's not every possible outcome. So we need to minimize the probability that something will go wrong with 
 
 digital super intelligence.

STEWART: It is worth remembering that Elon Musk was an early investor actually in OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, he's very familiar in this 
 
 space. There has been a lot of skepticism, I would say particularly from some of the panelists I've had on stage talking about whether Elon Musk 
 
 might be interested in launching his own AI Company.
 
And therefore maybe he would like a pause on the sector so that he can raise the head on that. All speculation of course, but who knows what Elon 
 
 Musk will put his fingers into next so many pies and so much to get into on stage, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: So and so much money to be able to purchase those pies. Interesting times, Anna Stewart, thank you so much, enjoy Paris, yes. All right, ahead 
 
 on "Connect the World" how close is Tehran to producing a nuclear weapon and what's being done to bring home U.S. citizens that are stuck in Iran. 
 
 We'll bring you analysis right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GIOKOS: Well, one expert is calling it Plan C, new indirect talks between the United States and Iran with a goal of restricting Tehran's nuclear 
 
 program and seeking release for three detained Americans. Multiple sources told CNN about the renewed efforts to reach an agreement saying there have 
 
 been some indications of progress but also adding we're just not there yet.
 
Meanwhile, the White House has said for months that Iran could produce enough material for a nuclear bomb in just a couple of weeks, possibly even 
 
 faster. My next guest is an award winning author who writes about the U.S. policy in the Middle East. And he has written that Iran is closer to a bomb 
 
 than ever before.
 
And in an article that will be published later today, Trita Parsi says the fact that a written and formal agreement seems beyond their reach as a 
 
 reflection of both a lack of political will and changing domestic and geopolitical circumstances.
 
Trita Parsi joins us now live from Fairfax, Virginia, where he is the Co- Founder and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a non-profit research institute and think tank, so 
 
 great to have you with us.
 
I've read your piece. It's really illuminating. I mean, there's a warning in terms of what could transpire if you don't get people talking about the 
 
 future of Tehran. Why is the Biden Administration taking a different and quite diplomatic approach with Iran right now?
 
TRITA PARSI, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE QUINCY INSTITUTE FOR RESPONSIBLE STATECRAFT: Well, part of the reason why the administration has carefully 
 
 moved in this direction is because of the protest in Iran and because of Iran's support for Russia. It was already very politically difficult for 
 
 the Biden Administration to be able to renew the Iran nuclear deal and get it through Congress. Yvonne is not popular in Washington in any stretch of 
 
 the imagination.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
Having seen how the regime has clamped down so brutally and violently against protests for the last couple of months, as well as its support for 
 
 Russia, it's only made that matter much worse. So on the one hand; getting that through in Washington is tough, not doing anything is even more 
 
 dangerous, though, because the Iranians are moving forward with their nuclear program.
 
So the area in which there seems to be some political feasibility of getting it done, while at the same time satisfying the need of preventing 
 
 Iran's further nuclear advances, is to have some sort of an informal agreement that essentially just ends the escalation.
 
GIOKOS: So what would this, you know, understanding looks like? Will the three detained U.S. citizens be freed as part of this deal? I mean, there 
 
 are so many elements to this; this is not just about nuclear.
 
PARSI: Certainly, I think it is crucial that the three wrongfully detained Americans, Iranian Americans in Iran are released. Many of them have been 
 
 there for several years, but more than seven years in one case, and it's time for them to come home. And there's going to be growing pressure on the 
 
 administration, if they don't get this done, particularly mindful of the fact that they were rather quick and get Americans out of Russia.
 
So that's one very crucial element of all of this. But while doing that, it seems that the effort is also to make sure that the volumes do not go 
 
 beyond 60 percent enriched uranium, which would be very dangerous if they did, potentially stopping to increase their stockpile of 60 percent.
 
And in return, there will be there would not be a tightening of the sanctions as they are right now. And some of Iran's own money will be 
 
 unfrozen not in the sense that it will go back to Tehran, but in the sense that the Iran can use those funds to buy food and medicine to pouring back.
 
GIOKOS: Look at and we know the IAEA is currently doing a lot of work on the ground to figure out exactly what kind of enrichment is on the go. I 
 
 want to talk about the 2015 deal. I mean, we know that that fell apart. We've seen a huge shift since then.
 
But regional countries including the likes of Amman, Abu Dhabi also hosting meetings, the Saudi foreign minister, for example, is expected to travel to 
 
 Tehran tomorrow. How important is regional support in all of this?
 
PARSI: The last nuclear deal, that the one from 2015, did not have the support of some regional powers, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Israel. But in 
 
 the rest of the world, it was a no brainer, including other regional powers such as Oman, who helped in the early phases of that negotiation, as well 
 
 as Qatar and others.
 
But these three countries were opposed to it that has now shifted. The Saudis and the Emiratis are now more open to the ideas that Israeli still 
 
 remain as the only holdout and opposing any form of agreement with Tehran. But all of this is now taking place in a context in which regional powers 
 
 are improving relations in between themselves.
 
We've seen the normalization between Iran and Saudi Arabia improve relations between Iran and the UAE, as well as between many other countries 
 
 in the region. So the region itself is moving towards some sort of internal detox.
 
And within that it was important for the Iranians to make sure that they didn't have a further escalation with the U.S., because that could actually 
 
 prevent or undermine their own efforts to improve relations with their own neighbors.
 
GIOKOS: Yes, I mean, and we've seen huge shifts regionally as well, in terms of bringing Iran back into the fray. You know, is this diplomatic 
 
 approach going to require a great congressional oversight? And you've already alluded to the protest action we've seen it in Iran. We know the 
 
 social issues that are playing out right now and the atrocities that are happening to Iranians and of course, the issue of women.
 
PARSI: Part of the reason I think the administration is going for an informal agreement that is also not just a nuclear agreement is precisely 
 
 because it will help them not having to take this through Congress. Congress will still make its opinions known on this matter, but they 
 
 wouldn't have any formal authority to be able to intervene or interfere in this.
 
Had it been a full scale nuclear program, that nuclear deal, then it would have to go through Congress and Congress would have an opportunity to vote 
 
 it down. That would be an extremely bloody fight. One that clearly the administration is not ready for part of the reason, why they're doing this 
 
 is because they just want peace and quiet on the Iran front for the next 18 months before the election.
 
GIOKOS: All right, great to have you on, Trita Parsi, we know that you're going to be publishing your piece online later on today. It's definitely 
 
 worth a read for those of you that are interested in this agreement, the unwritten agreement between the U.S. and Iran, thank you sir for joining 
 
 us, great to have you on the show.

Well still ahead, an American couple reaches the summit of the world's tallest mountain, find out why this climb is one for the history books.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GIOKOS: Prince Harry and Megan are out of the podcasting business for now. Their company Archewell has ended its partnership with Spotify when the 
 
 deal was announced in December of 2020. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were going to produce several programs however; the couple's podcast was the 
 
 only one that came to fruition.
 
This comes two weeks after Spotify announced 200 job cuts. Two deaf American mountain climbers are the first to reach the summit of Mount 
 
 Everest. Here's CNN's Anna Coren with an amazing story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is the moment Scott Lehmann and Shayna Unger reached the top of the tallest peak on the planet. 
 
 In doing so they became the first deaf Americans to summit Mount Everest. Shayna also made history as the first deaf woman in the world to 
 
 successfully complete the climb.
 
SHAYNA UNGER, FIRST DEAF AMERICAN TO CLIMB EVEREST: When we got to the top, we felt like we defeated all the odds, we were really proud of ourselves.
 
SCOTT LEHMANN, FIRST DEAF AMERICAN TO CLIMB EVEREST: It proves that with the right attitude and the right adjustments, the space is available for 
 
 deaf and hard of hearing people.
 
COREN (voice over): Unfortunately, their triumph was later tinged with sadness, as they learned that Muhammad Hawari Hashim, a Deaf climber from 
 
 Malaysia, who they had befriended on the mountain, had gone missing after his successful ascent on May 18. A search and rescue operation has failed 
 
 to find him.
 
Well, summiting Everest is an impressive achievement in itself. Scott and Shayna have even loftier ambitions. The gobbler is aiming to be the first 
 
 deaf individuals to climb the highest mountain on each continent known as the Seven Summits. Their Everest expedition puts them over halfway to 
 
 reaching that goal.
 
UNGER: We are still processing Everest, but for sure next will be one of the three Seven summits, which one, we're not sure.
 
COREN (voice over): The educators from the Washington DC area were both born profoundly deaf due to a lack of accessibility for the deaf community 
 
 and outdoor education. Scott and Shayna learned many of their mountaineering skills from YouTube videos.
 
In turn, they've been sharing their experiences online, documenting everything from life at Everest base camp, to the specific challenges 
 
 they've faced on their expeditions. Scott and Shayna use social media to explain how they manage logistics on mountain routes, and navigate common 
 
 misconceptions about their abilities as deaf climates.
 
The Jewel are committed to making mountain climbing more accessible to people from marginalized communities, especially deaf and hard of hearing 
 
 youth.
 
UNGER: I want all kids to dream bigger.
 
COREN (voice over): A mission that will be top of mind when they scale their next summit. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong.
