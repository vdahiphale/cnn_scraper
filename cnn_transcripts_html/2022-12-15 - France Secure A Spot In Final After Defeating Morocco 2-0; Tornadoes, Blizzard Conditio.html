JOHN VAUSE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Wherever you are around the world this hour, thank you for joining us. Coming up here on CNN NEWSROOM. Returned to the drones. The pre-dawn attack on Ukraine's capital, all 13 Iranian drain modes -- drones rather intercepted and destroyed.
 
Also, counting the cost for a devastating winter storm bringing extreme conditions across parts of the U.S. A live report from the CNN Weather Center.
 
And also, a miraculous and inspirational quest for a World Cup title comes to an end from Morocco. Losing to France and the semi-finals winning worldwide respect, admiration and a place in history.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with John Vause.
 
VAUSE: And then there were two. Sunday's World Cup finals, the defending champions France facing off against Argentina after the Blues beat Morocco two-nil.
 
French football fans there in the coastal city of Nice static over the win. And should France win on Sunday? There'll be the first team in 60 years, the back-to-back World Cup champions. But also the two of the world's great football stars who happen to be Paris Saint-Germain teammates against one another. French sensation Kylian Mbappe and Argentinian national Lionel Messi.
 
These two are both in contention for the Golden Boot Award for most goals scored in the tournament by the piece. 
 
Correspondents covering all the action and the reaction, Jim Bittermann, reporting in from Champs-Elysees and CNN's Ron Riddell in Doha, in Qatar is where we begin.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: The World Champions France are just 90 minutes away from standing on top of the world again. No men's team has won back-to-back world titles since Brazil in 1962. But their progress to the final match means heartbreak for Morocco, whose historic run is now over.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL (voice over): France struck early in the semifinal match at Al Bayt Stadium, a fifth minute goal from Theo Hernandez was only the second time that Morocco had conceded in the tournament. France looks strong, but Morocco kept them on their toes and Jawad El Yamiq almost equalized with a spectacular overhead kick. The French needed their goalie Hugo Lloris and the post to keep it out.
 
But the French effectively put the game to bed with a second goal 11 minutes from time when substitute Randal Kolo Muani found the back of the neck with his first touch. Just seconds after coming off the bench.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Back-to-back, like what else can we say? And like the team, like people came off the bench and did everything that they did like this team is so good. This team is so deep and players were so talented. I'm proud to be French.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, a bit disappointed. I was so proud of the team. They played really well. A great journey. So yes, quite proud.
 
(END VIDEO CLILP)
 
RIDDELL: So, a really disappointing night for Morocco, but they've won so many new admirers for the way they've played during this tournament making history for both Africa and the Arab world. All eyes now looking ahead to Sunday in the final which pits France against Argentina. Kylian Mbappe against his PSG club teammate Lionel Messi. It has all the makings of a classic. Back to you.
 
JIM BITTERMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You can probably tell from the noise exactly how joyful the French fans are tonight. They came out into the streets here just minutes after the match completed and now thousands of people are out on the (INAUDIBLE) there's just no place where the French come to celebrate. This was an extremely hard-fought match.
 
And you can tell how joyful the fans are from the noise but also in the way they express themselves. Here is a couple of examples.

VAUSE: Extreme weather leaving a path of destruction and misery across parts of the U.S. The South has been hit hard with around 50 tornadoes reported over the past two days. Authorities in Louisiana said at least three people have died. Officials all along the Gulf Coast say severe weather has collapsed homes, flipped over cars, downed the power lines. Thousands of homes and businesses are in the dark right now.
 
And CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam reports now from Louisiana after speaking to some residents who have lost so much during the storms.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[02:05:08]
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice over): A tornado over New Iberia, Louisiana caught on camera.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to confirm that at least two tornadoes have touchdown in New Iberia.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my god.
 
DAN DAM: The city's police captain reporting significant damage to Iberia Medical Center.
 
Just one of a string of over a dozen tornadoes in the past 24 hours wreaking havoc across the deep south.
 
DUSTY GATES, SHERIFF, UNION PARISH, LOUISIANA: We had quite a few homes damaged and destroyed. We had approximately 20 to 25 known injuries from minor to a couple of people in critical condition.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEFMALE: Look at the top of my house, you all, house is just gone.
 
VAN DAM: Overnight in Farmerville, not far from the Arkansas State Line.
 
CADE NOLAN, DETECTIVE, FARMERVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT: We had filed several mobile homes that have been thrown out into the nearby woods. Multiple apartments are damaged, multiple vehicles and a whole trailer park has been pretty much demolished.
 
VAN DAM: Beth Tabor survived by sheltering in a bathtub covering her roommate and her roommate's baby with her own body.
 
BETH TABOR, LIVES IN FARMERVILLE, LOUISIANA: It sounds just like they say, it's a freight train. It was pretty bad. Just hearing all the -- everything flying around and you can't do anything about it.
 
VAN DAM: To the southwest families in Keithville, scrambling for safety.
 
TAMMY SEPULVADO, CADDO PARISH RESIDENT: We got in the shower, like I said and then all of a sudden by the time we got hunker down here it was down, the roof was gone.
 
VAN DAM: The storm being blamed in at least two deaths. According to the sheriff in Caddo parish, a mother and child were killed.
 
In Four Forks, mobile homes destroyed, belongings strewn throughout the neighborhood. Trees uprooted and first responders helping guide residents out to safety from their crumbled homes. 
 
Just hours earlier, parts of Texas taking a beating.
 
And in Oklahoma too where residents survey the damage left in the storm's path.
 
With the storm system on the move, severe weather warnings have been issued across the deep south. Government offices and schools closed in Mississippi, with over 14 million people under a tornado or severe weather threat.
 
Meanwhile, out across the plane, it's a deluge of snow and ice. In Wyoming, a white out. In South Dakota, most state offices are closed. And in parts of Minnesota, blizzard warnings are in effect as this massive front pushes eastward.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: For all of this, I'm joined now by CNN meteorologist Britley Ritz here at the CNN weather center. So, what's the forecast looking like?
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, absolutely. We're looking at the threat of tornadoes once again throughout the overnight and early morning hours. Although that threat has decreased significantly. It cannot be rolled out. However, most of the tornadoes that occurred on Wednesday happened within the Lower Mississippi Valley. You'll see that here. Nearly 50 Tornado reports, currently 49 across the deep south back into Texas.
 
Twenty-six wind reports, six hail reports. And this is still an ongoing system across the southeast. Now moving into the Florida panhandle where we can expect more stronger storms. Now, we have a special marine warning. That's what you're seeing highlighted in orange. That just means we have some stronger storms capable of producing some damaging winds, some small hail and isolated tornadoes cannot be rolled out.
 
That's where we have that greatest threat through the overnight hours. Then this pushes further east from Florida on up into the Carolina's coastline, still holding on to the same threats although the tornado threat again much lower, more of an isolated threat damaging winds. Large hail became the biggest concerns from Charleston all the way down into Orlando, Jacksonville, Tampa as well.
 
Flooding threats still in existence from Knoxville to Mobile, what were highlighted in yellow, another one to two inches of rain expected just within the next 24 hours. Like Charles actually hit a daily record on Wednesday, nearly 2-1/2 inches of rain. And still holding on to the winter weather threat as well now pushing into New England in the mid-Atlantic with ice storm warnings for parts of the Appalachians.
 
We're talking crippling conditions here, folks, we could pick up nearly a half an inch of ice over the next 48 hours. John?
 
VAUSE: Britley, thank you. Britley Ritz there with all the very latest forecast. Thanks.
 
This was the scene in southern Ukraine after Russian shelling hit the regional administration building in the recently liberated city of Kherson Wednesday. Rockets also hit a residential neighborhood killing two people, including an eight-year-old boy.
 
Meantime, the U.S. operation to arm and train Ukrainian forces now has its first full time commander. Army Lieutenant General Antonio Aguto, Jr. now heads the security assistance group in Ukraine. This comes as the U.S. set to approve the transfer of advanced patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine. The Kremlin says any patriot missiles sent to Ukraine will become legitimate targets.
 
Meantime, Ukraine air defenses have effectively stopped one of the biggest Russian drone attacks in weeks. All 13 drones, Iranian-made according to Ukrainian officials were intercepted and shut down over the capital before reaching their target. CNN's Will Ripley is in Kyiv with this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[02:10:05]
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A terrifying way to wake up in Kyiv. The chilling bodies of another drone attack on the Ukrainian capital caught on Camera.
 
The rumble was like from a moped, that was the sound it made, says Fitwana (ph). It fell behind the houses and then there was a strong roar and explosion.
 
Some buildings left on fire, hit by remains of the destroyed Iranian- made Shaheds as they fell. Some landed near a local soccer field.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): Did you hear the explosion?
 
ANDRIY SHAKHOV, SPOKESPERSON, DYNAMO KYIV FOOTBALL CLUB: Yes, of course we all wake up (INAUDIBLE) born here first part and the first -- second one part near the entrance on the training base and the third one near the forest.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): A few hours later, the consequences could have been much worse.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): And you have kids playing soccer here?
 
SHAKHOV: No. It's 6:00 half an hour but --
 
RIPLEY: But they would have been here had it happened later?
 
SHAKHOV: Yes, later. Yes, because we have a tournament here.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): Authorities say Russia launched the drones towards Kyiv on Wednesday, aiming them at the already battered power grid to sow fear and chaos and potentially plunge millions into the dark and cold. This time all the drones were shot down.
 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the terrorists started this morning with 13 Shaheds. According to preliminary information all 13 were shot down by Ukraine's air defense systems. Well done, he says. I'm proud.
 
Ukrainian defenses less successful in Kherson. Authorities say multiple Russian rockets hit this administrative building in the heart of the Southern Ukrainian city. Authorities say nobody was hurt. Inside the damage severe. Entire sections destroyed. Ukraine says attacks like this and the one in Kyiv aimed at wearing down the Ukrainian people, trying to break their spirits reduce support for resistance against Russia. But here in Kyiv people refuse to give in.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): You are brave people.
 
SHAKHOV: Yes, children --
 
RIPLEY: I can definitely see that.
 
SHAKHOV: Woman, old man says it doesn't matter. They're so brave.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): Bravery on and off the battlefield.
 
Will Ripley, CNN, Kyiv. 
 
VAUSE: The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for the ninth straight time in the day ahead. Policymakers are trying to tame inflation while avoiding a recession. There was a glimmer of good news on Wednesday as inflation eased to 10.7 percent November. Most economists are expecting a half a percent interest rate increase. Central Bank voted in early November to hike rates by three quarters of a percent. The biggest hike in more than 30 years. 
 
The U.S. Fed increased interest rates Wednesday by half a point. Notably lower than recent rate hikes of three quarters of one percent. But the Central Bank is wanting even though inflation has started to cool, not seven percent. It remains too high and well above the base official target of two percent. Fed Chair Jerome Powell says rates will continue to rise well into next year, and growth will slow.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: I'll tell you what the projection is, I don't think it would qualify as a recession. No, because you've got positive growth. The expectations in the SCP are basically as you said, which is we've got growth at a -- at a modest level, which is to say about a half a percentage point. That's positive growth. It's slow growth, it's well below trend. It's not going to feel like a boom, it's going to feel like very slow growth.

VAUSE: To Los Angeles now and Ryan Patel, senior fellow at the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University. Welcome back.
 
RYAN PATEL, SENIOR FELLOW, DRUCKER SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT: Thanks, John. Great to see you. 
 
VAUSE: OK. You too. OK. So, even though the size of rate increases, has eased a little from three quarters of one percent to half of one percent. Hold the champagne. Here's the Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POWELL: It's good to see progress. But let's just understand we have long ways to go to get back to price stability.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: We have long ways to go. Right now, inflation in the U.S. is seven percent. The goal, two percent. It seems news from Wednesday is the Fed is willing to do more than first expected to rein in inflation and do it for longer. So, what? We should all get used to these higher interest rates for a while?
 
PATEL: Wait, you have champagne? I don't even have it in the house because we're not even close, John. I mean, yes, we're going to be holding it for a while. We're going to -- if you think about it, the Fed, out of 17 to 19 Fed members, they think it's going to be five percent, 5.25 percent. It's right next year. So that means it's going to go above what they thought. On top of that, the real question, the word pain kept coming up in Jerome Powell's statement.
 
And why that word is coming up because they don't know how long they're going to hold it. And based on the statements as of today, based on where we are, from an economic perspective, I don't see them decreasing next year. I think they're going to be holding these rates for a while, like you just mentioned.
 
VAUSE: OK. So, the question now is how high will they go? And the key number here, what's called the terminal rate, you touched on this. The expectation is now 5.1 percent. Official interest rates are expected to hit 5.1 percent. Somewhere around the end of next year. This is the forecast from policy makers, right? This is the median number. And the expectation is it will then start to fall down to 4.1 percent in 2024.
 <br>[02:15:07] But those numbers are not carved in stone. Back in September, the forecast peak for interest rates was 4.6 percent. And what is truly head spinning in all of this? 12 months ago, short-term rates were what? Zero. And then at 4.5 percent getting to five percent next year. You know, in medical terms, this is like being hit with a defibrillator over and over again, it's not pleasant.
 
PATEL: Well, they had to get ahead of it. So, that's why you saw that huge, you know, point, you know, 35-basis points over and over again. And now next year, they're saying as a total of 75 basis points, but what's really driving this, John, which is why, you know, they're saying it's 75-basis points and that's why I think it's the minimum is because job unemployment number is not where they want it to be.
 
They want inflation to be at two percent. John, we're not even close. We're not even -- I mean, middle of next year, you're going to come and ask me, I already know, hey, are we going to revise this number? Two percent? Is it really -- is it really plausible to get down to two? And I think that's where they're looking at, obviously, with high wage growth, right now, they want unemployment to be at 4.4 percent.
 
But they're at 3.7. And not looking like they're going to get there. That's where we're going to see that continuous of that stress that you're seeing, the market thing as well going, are they going to continue to increase it?
 
VAUSE: Yes. There was a lot of -- a lot of excitement because it was only a half a percent increase, instead of a three quarters of percent increase, I guess, that's why, you know, the champagne thing came from. But this was not a great day Wednesday because policymakers revised a whole bunch of forecasts, slow economic growth next year, just point-five and one percent.
 
That was down then earlier than expected, it will pick up at 2024. Inflation next year has been revised upwards to 3.1 percent. So, to unemployment from last month's forecast to 3.7 percent. Now to an expected 4.6 percent. You know, put all those numbers together. And what are they saying here about the economy? This is not good news.
 
PATEL: Yes. You know, unfortunately, I know, we would talk about how this was expected. But, you know, from today's meeting, it wasn't good news, unfortunately, which I would be more hopeful. And this is the best news you can get without any global variables, any supply chain issues. This is Jerome Powell talking about here. Here's the best-case scenario. As of today's economy, where we sit today where consumer, the price index came out, good numbers came out.
 
But when you go into next year, John, when we see supply chain issues or something fragile happens, what do you think the Fed is going to do? Are they going to -- they're taking a step to looking at the economy going? Are we really back? There questioning, is inflation actually still going down? Even though we've seen the last two months to do that? They're not going to really give in real easily and I think that's the news that I'm reading that hey, there's something more here they're seeing as well and they're not willing to take the gas off the pedal right now or anytime soon, truthfully, John, until February's meeting, even then, we'll see what happened.
 
VAUSE: We're out of time. Next time we cover -- next time we talk about -- we'll talk about two percent versus price stability. Two different things all together. Ryan Patel, good to see you. Thank you.
 
PATEL: Thanks, John.
 
VAUSE: You got the data from China, it shows the economic impact of zero COVID before pandemic restrictions were recently eased. Retail sales down nearly six percent In November, the biggest drop since May. Industrial output slowed to just 2.2 percent. Less than half of what it was the month before.
 
All of this comes as COVID infections now surging in the capital. CNN's Selina Wang reports from Beijing.
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: COVID lockdowns are finally over in China. But the irony is that here in Beijing, it still feels like we're stuck in one. Streets are empty. Many stores are closed. Businesses are struggling to stay open because so many people have COVID. It's spreading extremely fast here in Beijing and authority say it's spreading rapidly across the country. But we don't know just how fast.
 
Authority said they've given up on counting all cases. Since there's no way to gauge the number of infections now with people avoiding official tests and staying at home. Here in Beijing. The number of patients going to fever clinics jumped 16 times this Sunday compared to a week before. Authorities also said the number of calls to the emergency hotline have jumped six times. So here in China, there isn't a strong primary care system.
 
So, it's common to rush to the hospital even for minor illnesses. So, it's no surprise we're already seeing long lines forming outside of hospitals. Authorities are now scrambling to increase the number of fever clinics and ICU wards, pledging as well to boost the lagging vaccination rate for the elderly population. The fear from experts I speak to is not how this plays out in Beijing.
 
But the potential devastation that could happen when COVID hits the rural areas with weak medical infrastructure. Take a listen to what Xi Chen, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
XI CHEN, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: China has around like 2800 companies. Many companies do not have any ICU beds. Even they have beds but they do not have medical doctors to serve.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WANG: And now people across China are left to fend for themselves. People are rushing to stock up on fever and cold medicine. But interestingly canned peaches are also flying off the shelves after rumors circulated that canned peaches can treat COVID. [02:20:08]
 
In videos that have gone viral on social media, canned peach factories are talking about how they're working overtime to meet demand. One factory said orders had jumped by 10-fold. Searches for canned peaches have surged more than 2,700 percent on China's search engine Baidu in the past week. It has gotten to the point where state media is now publishing articles stating that the food has no medicinal effect, or ability to cure COVID.
 
I spoke to a health expert who said this whole canned peach craze reflects the lack of communication between health authorities and the public. And it shows just how unprepared people feel that they're willing to follow the hype of canned peaches as a home remedy.

VAUSE: Less than an hour from now, Netflix will release the final three episodes of Harry and Meghan Docu series. Three episodes made history as the most watched documentary debut ever on Netflix.

MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: You just see it play out. It's like a story about someone in the family would pop up for a minute and they go, I got to make that go away. But there's real estate on a Web site homepage, there's real estate there on a newspaper front cover, and something has to be filled in there about someone royal.

When we come back, dozens of leaders from across Africa now meeting in Washington in a rare summit as President Biden tries to counter China's growing influence on the continent. Also, why authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border now worried as a Trump era border policy set to fly next week.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Legendary singer Gladys Knight in attending African heads of state at a White House gala Wednesday night. Leaders wrapped up a three-day Summit in Washington in the hours ahead. U.S. hasn't made this kind of outreach to Africa since the days of the Obama administration. But it has good reason to do so now. And CNN's Phil Mattingly explains why.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: When President Biden took the stage speaking to nearly 50 African leaders, there was one clear point that he attempted to make. It was that this was not viewed as a reboot moment for the U.S. relationship with the continent. This was not an effort to try and resuscitate something that had clearly fallen apart. And more than anything else, this wasn't about necessarily countering other countries, particularly China to some degree Russia that have made clear inroads in front of the U.S. over the course of the last several years.
 
Instead, it was about a clear commitment from the administration. One that wasn't just in this moment wasn't tied to the three-day summit that was taking place here in Washington. It was longer term and it was significant. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:25:05]
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These are long-term investments, they're going to deliver real benefits to people, create new good paying jobs, including here in the United States and expand opportunities for all our countries for the years to come. All of you, all of you, the deals you've signed, investments we've made together, our concrete proof of the enduring commitment we're making to one another. Government to government, business to business, people to people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: And while President Biden was making clear that there is durability to these commitments, that something White House officials, U.S. officials are not simply going to walk away from after this three-day summit. A summit that include administration officials up and down the cabinet, making clear what they are willing to do to increase investment, to increase relationships, to increase the ties to the dozens of leaders that are here in town.
 
The reality is they're going to have to prove that. And while they also say that this isn't about any other country, this is about a proactive effort on the U.S. side, implicit in just about everything the administration is saying including those words you just heard from President Biden is the fact that there's a very real geopolitical competition underway between the U.S. and China.
 
And the U.S. when it comes to the continent of Africa, when you talk to U.S. officials, they acknowledged they are losing that competition to the -- it exists to China. There's no question about it. If you look at investment, if you look at trade, if you look at what's been put into place on an infrastructure side of things over the course of the last several years. Again, U.S. officials not saying this is a purely China-related summit here.
 
However, it's kind of overarching everything that's happening in this moment. Expect more announcements in the days ahead. One thing everybody's keeping a very close eye on, the expectation that President Biden will include the announcement that he will be traveling to the continent at some point in 2023. Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House.
 
VAUSE: Since the early days of the pandemic, the USS used an obscure public policy law enacted by President Trump, known as title 42 to send thousands of asylum seekers in the U.S. to Mexico. While they wait for their cases to be heard by an immigration court. Next week, title 42 expires. Authorities are bracing for a surge of migrants which could overwhelm the resources of cities like El Paso, Texas where already -- well -- and 2000 migrants are arriving each day.
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera is there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN MARTIN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, OPPORTUNITY CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS: We're going to get the women over to the rescue mission.
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's a frigid El Paso night and John Martin is coordinating an outreach team trying to figure out where newly arrived migrants have been released on the city's downtown streets.
 
MARTIN: They're working with the new arrivals that came in just within the past hour.
 
LAVANDERA: So, there's a lot of confusion right now.
 
MARTIN: To a great extent, I'll probably get myself into trouble. I think confusion is an understatement.
 
LAVANDERA: Martin helps run a homeless shelter program in El Paso. Three of its shelters are open to migrants. This Family Welcome Center can fit about 80 people, but in recent days, they've taken in as many as 125 per night.
 
MARTIN: The concern that we have is at some point you just simply run out of physical space. And we don't want to be in a position to say no, but I think the reality is very close.
 
LAVANDERA: To in recent days, the El Paso area has seen a major wave of migrants crossing into the United States. 
 
LAVANDERA (on camera): The average number of migrants arriving here in El Paso has been about 2500 day. And because of that, many people here city leaders in El Paso are concerned about what this could look like if Title 42 is lifted next week.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over): The public health policy known as title 42, which was used during the pandemic to remove some 2.5 million migrants from the U.S. is set to expire next week. But for many migrants, the talk of Title 42 isn't on their minds. 
 
Joel and Rena Velasquez (ph) left Nicaragua six weeks ago with their nine-year-old girl.
 
LAVANDERA (on camera): No. He said they came, they were unaware of Title 42 And the Title 42 could be lifted. So, they really just want to come here to work for a couple of years and go back home to Nicaragua.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over): The family is headed to Georgia to await immigration court proceedings. But El Paso leaders say the humanitarian safety net that has long existed in this border city is stretched too thin already.
 
PETER SVARZBEIN, MEMBER, EL PASO COUNCIL: We need people to step up. We need to stop pointing fingers. We need to work together. We need to collaborate and we need to make sure that we keep folks that are passing through our neighborhoods safe also keeping our communities safe as well.
 
LAVANDERA (on camera): These are the scenes on the streets of downtown El Paso that officials are starting to become much more alarmed about. These are migrants who have been processed through Border Patrol. They have paper work to be able to enter the country and move but really they have nowhere to go right now as they're either awaiting a bus ride out of town or they're waiting for other family members to get released from custody as well and they're trying to get reunited here.
 <br>[02:30:03]
 
But this is the growing concern. Nightfall is coming and it will be another frigid night and these people will be here on the streets sleeping unless they are able to get on a bus out of town. But this is the concern, this is what many people are very concerned about and are worried that this is a site and seen that will only continue to worsen in the days to come.

Huge crowds on the streets on the Champ-Elysees after France defeated Morocco and earned a spot in the World Cup championship. There were fireworks, flares, a lot of drivers sounding the horns of their cars.
 
Defending champions France will face Argentina in the final on Sunday. But never before has an African or Arab team made this far in the World Cup as Morocco. And now, they play for third place against Croatia. Moroccan fans had enjoyed all those upset winds along the way. And now, they're feeling a lot of emotion, including heartbreak, but also at the same time, a lot of pride.

WALID REGRAGUI, MOROCCO COACH (through translator):  Afterwards, I said to the players that I'm proud of them. That his majesty Mohammed the Sixth of Morocco is proud of them, that the Moroccan people are proud of them, and I think the whole world are proud to see the Moroccan team play like that, because we played with their hearts. We did not let anyone down. We fought right until the end. And that's the footballing values we wanted to share. We've given not just a beautiful image of Moroccan football, but also African football. And that's important for us, because we're not just representing our country but our continent.

VAUSE:  There are widespread calls in Nepal for FIFA to stop dismissing compensation comes from migrant workers that they say have suffered abuses in Qatar. Hundreds of thousands of workers from Nepal have played a huge role in building the infrastructure needed to host for the World Cup.
 
The United FIFA says it's deeply saddened over the latest death of a migrant worker during the tournament, he was Kenyan security worker who died while on duty last weekend. CNN's Larry Madowo spoke to his sister who says she is still looking for answers.

LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  John Njue Kibue's family wants to know exactly how he died. They were told on Saturday that he had fallen from the eighth floor of Lusail Stadium. But they feel they're not getting all the information. They tell CNN they have not been allowed to see any pictures or video footage of what happened, and that's all.
 
He came to Qatar in November last year, and he wanted a better life for himself and support his family back in Kenya. And the lack of information is adding to this family's anguish. Listen to what his sister told CNN.

ANN WANJIRU KIBUE, VICTIM'S SISTER:  He was a good person. I remember him as a hard worker. He said he (INAUDIBLE) challenges but he still worked because he knew every work he get could get some changes. But he just worked hard. All he wanted was just to just work for his family.
 
MADOWO:  He is the second migrant worker to die since the tournament began in Qatar. Qatar has been widely criticized for the treatment of migrant workers in the decades since they got the rights to operate to run the World Cup. And only recently, did the World Cup chief of Qatar acknowledged that between 400 to 500 migrant workers could have died in projects connected to the tournaments. This will add to the questions around the conditions that migrant workers even during the World Cup are operating in here in the country. Larry Madowo, CNN, Doha.

VAUSE:  Books of condolences have been placed in Qatar stadiums by FIFA to honor the journalist who've died while covering this tournament. One of them is American sports writer Grant Wahl who collapsed during a quarterfinal last week. He was recovering in a plane.
 
We now know what caused his sudden death at age 49. His widow, Dr. Celine Gounder, says the autopsy shows he died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm that had likely had been growing slowly for years undetected. She said no amount of CPR or shocks would've saved him.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. CELINE GOUNDER, WIDOW OF GRANT WAHL:  The aorta, that's the big blood vessel that comes out of your heart, sort of the trunk of all the blood vessels. And an aneurysm is a ballooning of the blood vessel wall. And so, it's weak. And it's just one of these things that had been likely brewing for years. And for whatever reason, it happened at this point in time.

VAUSE:  CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta shows us what aortic aneurysms actually look like and why they're so deadly.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's so sad. I mean, what Dr. Gounder was describing, thankfully, is rare, but can be catastrophic if it occurs. Let me show you on this image, first of all. If you look at the left side of the screen, that is a normal heart. And you see a large blood vessel right in the middle there called the aorta that leaving the heart, that is what it should look like.
 
On the right side of the screen, you see what happens when you develop an aneurysm, where the walls weaken and it starts to balloon out that unfortunately can -- the walls can become so weak that there can be a rupture or significant bleeding.
 
Let me show you quickly on this model here as well. Again, the heart -- this is the pumping ventricle, the left ventricle, and it pumps blood into the aorta, which is over here, and it's this aorta here, which can sort balloon out and potentially cause problems, bleeding that can occur into chest, and a lot of bleeding because this is the largest blood vessel really in the body.
 
Types of some symptoms that people might have, they can be pretty vague, backpain, cough, weak voice even, just as it the aneurysm expands, it can push on your lung and your trachea. Shortness of breath and pain in the chest. You may remember, Grant Wahl said he thought he had bronchitis. He was -- he thought he had these chest-like symptoms. Again, it is rare, especially the aneurysm that occurs in this part of the aorta. If you look at the overall numbers back in 2019, there were about 9,900, close to 10,000 deaths, but that's the aneurisms that occur any points along the aorta, most of them in men, 59 percent of men. And things like smoking to increase the risk.
 
People with a family history might get screened for something like this, but in the United States there's not a widespread screening. So, that there is a good chance that Grant Wahl didn't even know. 49 years old.
 
I would just add one more thing, John Ritter, people may remember that name, but he had the same problem, and this is what led to his death back in 2003, people thought it was a heart attack initially, but in fact, John Ritter died of the same problem that Grant Wahl did. John Ritter was 54 at the time.

VAUSE:  Thank you, Sanjay.
 
We have another first here for the World Cup in Qatar. This one involves British football fans. Not one has been arrested according to the official in charge of U.K.'s football official policy, or policing rather. British fans are usually arrested en masse at World Cups. A small footnote here, alcohol has been banned from this year's World Cup.

VAUSE:  Dog owners everywhere know that occasionally man's best friend will mistakenly have number ones or number twos where they shouldn't. Usually, it's on the carpet not behind the wheel of a car. Here's CNN's ??.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Dogs tend to be protruding passengers, taking the steering wheel, mostly in movies or books. But here's one for the books, the dog that crashed the car. Sure, we've done jokey pieces about dogs driving.
 
MOOS (on camera):  Look, I know you have a dog license. But do you have a learner's permit? Do any of you have learner's permits?
 
MOOS (voiceover):  And a decade ago, in New Zealand -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Just when you thought you seen it all.
 
MOOS (voiceover): -- they tried to teach several dogs to drive, even shift gears.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Good.
 
MOOS (voiceover):  But the border collie who jumped behind the wheel of this jeep parked in a driveway in Wales, didn't take any lessons.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, no, no. Oh, for God's sake.
 
MOOS (voiceover):  That's the dog's owner who tried in vain to stop the jeep.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My dog's just knocked out the gear stick.
 
MOOS (voiceover):  At least -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That shaggy dog just stole my car.
 
MOOS (voiceover):  -- the border collie didn't commit a felony. The mishap was captured on a security camera belonging to Sean Waller, whose car was damaged. But he says, we're not mad at all. Accident happen.
 
The dog's owner made the pooch relinquished the wheel.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Get over.
 
MOOS (voiceover):  Asked about insurance, Waller told CNN, I doubt the dog is named on the policy. Perhaps we'll have to claim through the pet insurance instead.
 
But before you raise this canine's premiums, consider that he didn't exhibit a single one of David Letterman's top 10 signs your dog is a bad driver.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- always taking eyes off road to lick himself.
 
MOOS (voiceover):  Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
