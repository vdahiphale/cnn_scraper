THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[15:30:00] 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: That is a significant problem for investigators now. 
 
ED DAVIS, FORMER BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER: Oh, there's no question the more people, the more complicated this becomes. So there'll be a lot of people on the campus. But if the suspect is able to jump out of the confines of the campus and get out into the strip, this is a very, very difficult process of trying to locate the person. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, Ed, please stand by. We want to go back to Stephanie Elam, who's been tracking the latest details on this. Stephanie, walk us through everything that we've learned. What we're hearing from witnesses on the scene and the latest from law enforcement on their effort to locate this reported shooter. 
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Boris. What we're learning now is that they're still working through, finding out what is going on in these buildings, working through that. We also see that there's another tweet coming out from UNLV, the university police. The tweets saying that they're responding to additional reports of shots fired in the student union, evacuate the area and then in capital letters it says run, hide, fight. 
 
Now from looking at the map, it looks like this is right next to Beam Hall. The other building that I was telling you about. So not clear right now -- as you were just hearing -- It's not clear right now if this is some -- a different incident that's happening in two different buildings or it's the same incident right now. We're still trying to work through that. And looking through how they're expanding this perimeter and how that may be affecting the entire city of Las Vegas. 
 
If you keep in mind it's pretty contained. The part where like tourists would normally be, but still all of this can have an impact around the area here. So still watching this. Still seeing that all of this started with, we see the first tweet coming from UNLV about -- just over 30 minutes ago. So this is still a very new situation that we're learning about and learning whether or not they have actually found somebody. If they are encountering people. But their origin tweet did say that they looks -- does appear like there are multiple victims here. They are still working through this, but for a law enforcement tweet
 
 to say that that's pretty indicative right now. But it's still unclear how large it can be, but it does seem to be a very large response here as they're looking to contain this and also to secure these areas, these buildings and to find any perpetrator or perpetrators that still may be out there -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Stephanie, thank you so much for the update. Please stand by. We have much more on the breaking news. 
 
I just want to point out we got a word from the White House seconds ago that they are very closely monitoring the situation. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she was just told about the shooting as the press briefing was going on. Multiple victims reported at the UNLV Campus in Las Vegas. More details ahead when CNN NEW CENTRAL returns. 
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: All right, we are looking at pictures from moments ago here. The campus of UNLV, Las Vegas, Nevada where we are following this breaking news. Authorities had reported that there were additional shots fired at the Student Union building there, but we are told now -- we have a tweet from metro police there that the suspect in this mass shooting has been contained, obviously raising a lot of questions about that means. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, they do describe this as an ongoing active investigation. It appears that the immediate danger is over. However, we understand there are multiple victim. And they are canvassing the scene right now to piece together exactly what happened. 
 
We have CNN Stephanie Elam who's been tracking this since we first learned about the shooting. Obviously, very significant. Stephanie, that Las Vegas Metropolitan Police are tweeting out that the suspect has been contained. 
 
ELAM: Yes, that's obviously a massive development here and it will allow people to calm down a little bit. But obviously still so many questions out there. We don't know a lot of information. 
 
But this all started around noon local time. So, just over a half an hour ago, (INAUDIBLE) Metropolitan Police Department actually tweeted that they were responding to preliminary reports of an active shooter on the campus of UNLV near Beam Hall, and there appeared to be multiple victims at this time. And they also said to please avoid the area. 
 
They just now tweeted about less than 10 minutes ago. They tweeted that the suspect is contained. This is an active investigation. Police continue to avoid the area and watch for responding emergency units. 
 
We did see as well tweets coming in from UNLV, the school itself. Asking for people to run, fight. Because they're saying there were still reports of an active shooter. There was also reports of an active shooter at the Student Center. Looking at a map, they look like they're very close to Beam Hall, so still not clear if those are two separate incidents. But calling on people to shelter in place and to protect themselves. 
 
We have seen from some of the students that do go to school there at UNLV saying that they heard at least four shots while they were there sheltering in place. But the developing news as they've expanded the perimeter, it seems, around the campus. The good news here is that the police are saying that the suspect -- and they do say suspect -- is contained at this point. So we also now have this --
 
Stephanie, sorry to interrupt you. Sorry to interrupt you. We just got word from Las Vegas police that the suspect has been killed. 
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
That the suspect is deceased. Obviously, we don't know the specifics of how that happened. You said that's going to obviously allow people to breathe a sigh of relief. But again, we're still trying to get our arms around just how big of a situation this is here. 
 
ELAM: Yes, and you're looking at a very massive response. I mean just these images that we can see here, you can tell that this is a large response that they're taking here. The suspect being contained and then deceased. Yes, that does mean that this immediate threat is over, but it's still unclear how many people may be injured. And of course, sadly, if any people have lost their lives. That's what we're still unsure about. And there still may be very many people who are still sheltering in place who are looking at the tweets and maybe looking at the news on their phones, on their computers, to figure out what to do. 
 
Nerves are going to be rattled, and they're trying to make sure that they contain the area, get the medical response that they need to get In there. But obviously, the way that this looks, it does not look like a good situation right now. Especially with the police actually saying that there appears to be multiple victims at this time -- Brianna and Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, and again, this is a community, sadly, that is all too familiar with the scene like this going back to 2017. One of the deadliest mass shootings in American history at the concert outside the Mandalay Bay Resort. I understand that we now have some witness sound speaking to CNN affiliates on the ground there. We want to listen to what people who were there experienced. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What -- tell me about what you heard, what you saw? 
 
BARTON, STUDENT: To be honest, we were presenting and in a ballroom in the Student Union and I didn't hear much, but we got an alert. All text messages at the. They shut -- they say they put the building in lockdown. They shut all the curtains. Everyone moved to one side of the room. After that was a lot of waiting probably 20 minutes. And then we got told to move out to one corner. And we heard a lot of yelling. That's where stuff started to get a little more hectic, not too hectic like we wanted everyone say calm. Beyond was the officers and then they came in. We all put our hands up, escorted us out all the way out here where we are now. I honestly didn't hear anything. I did see one glass that was shattered. Looks like by two gunshots. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was there any worry? Any concern for you? I mean, what were your feelings? 
 
BARTON: There was a little nervousness, but for some reason I did feel safe. I didn't hear anything which kind of like helped me. They said that was in the building next door. I didn't hear anything. Kind of supposed to be multiple shots, but I heard helicopters. That made me feel better too. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what about yourself? 
 
CASSIDY, STUDENT: I felt the same exact way. I definitely heard, you know, screaming from next door. I thought it was something, but I think it was just the cops coming in to the Student Union. We were located at the student Union, which is right next to the BH building, which is where it all went down. But it was just super scary, you know, hearing that. We all as a class as a, you know, in the ballroom we were just so scared. I feel like we should shut the lights off or something. But we definitely went in the corner, evacuated. And you know, we wanted more because we just got these alerts and we were kind of scared. But, you know, it all -- it all happened so quick and then we see the window and everything as we're leaving and, you know, scary. It's really scary. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So during all that time, what's going through your mind when this is happening? 
 
CASSIDY: Going through my mind honestly, I was just like I need to get out of here. I feel like, you know, everyone should just -- I didn't want to stay in this classroom. I wanted to just like, you know, run from it all. And I was just so scared. Something about it, it's just, you know, my heart was just pounding everything. But when I saw the window, I was like, wow, this is actually happening. You know, I was really scared, but, yeah. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now that you've had a moment to kind of process some of the things, what are your thoughts? How crazy is this situation? What are your thoughts on this? 
 
CASSIDY: Came out of nowhere. I thought we were in the worst situation possible cause it was a ballroom surrounded by glass. That's what I was worried about. But like I said, I didn't hear anything, so that made me feel a little better. But I'm waiting for updates. I haven't heard anything. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I didn't get your name. 
 
CASSIDY: I'm Cassidy, yeah, yeah, yeah. Barton, B, A, R, T, O, N yeah, yeah. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anything else that you want to add? 
 
CASSIDY: Everyone stays safe. Wherever you guys are at, you guys are still on campus. 
 
SANCHEZ: We've been listening to witnesses on the scene of the campus of UNLV describing screaming and shattered glass as well. Those folks were apparently in a building on the campus and they were escorted out by police. 
 
As we're learning that there are multiple victims there at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. And the shooter, as we learned from police just moments ago, has been neutralized. The shooter is deceased. From what we've seen that officials have published online, it appears that there was only one suspect. Of course, these situations are very fluid and the situation may change. But it appears that the immediate danger on the campus of UNLV is over and officials are now trying to assess the extent of the damage and piece together what happened there. 
 
KEILAR: Obviously you can see a lot of law enforcement resources that were deployed there to UNLV. 
 <br>[15:45:00]
 
And we were hearing those students say they saw shattered glass. They saw the results of shooting inside of the Student Union or at the Student Union they heard screaming, though they weren't sure if that was just people scared as they were evacuating. But a scene of obviously, tragedy, horror there on UNLV as we're trying to get a sense of just how extensive this is. We're going to get in a quick break and be right back with some new details.
 <br>[15:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
KEILAR: We are following breaking news out of Las Vegas. Police say the suspect in the shooting on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, quote, has been located and is deceased. 
 
SANCHEZ: We're joined now by Congresswoman Dina Titus. She represents the district where the shooting occurred. She actually also used to be a professor at the school for some three decades. Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us. First, what have you learned about what's happening at UNLV? Have you been able to get any new details from law enforcement? 
 
REP. DINA TITUS (D-NV) (via telephone): We have been in touch with Metro and also with the president's office on the campus, but we don't know anymore than you do. We've just offered any assistance that we might be able to provide. 
 
KEILAR: Obviously, your community is -- unfortunately, it's very familiar with gun violence. The 2017 shooting that ultimately killed 60 people, just horrific. And now you're seeing this as we are certainly awaiting details. But this is something that you know all too well. 
 
TITUS: Well, that's right. And Metro learned a lot of lessons from that. So they are well equipped to deal with this situation. They responded rapidly and have already detained and taken care of the shooter, which is a relief to a lot of people who are there around the campus. 
 
You know, UNLV is a very urban campus. I've taught there for 35 years and my husband taught there and in the building right next to Beam Hall. If you look at a map, you'll see Wright Hall, then Beam Hall, and then the Student Union. So there are a lot of people in that one area at the head of the quad. And in the Student Union at that time, of course, it was the lunch hour. So I'm sure there were a lot of people there, had the violence expanded. 
 
SANCHEZ: And Congresswoman, obviously, given what your community went through back in October of 2017, this must hit close to home for you. Also notable that you were an instructor at that school for some 35 years, that your husband taught there, as you said. What's going through your mind when you see this kind of violence hit an area that you cherish? 
 
TITUS: Well, I just never would have imagined that it happened the first time right there in my district. And then for it to happen again, it just -- It's just devastating. You know, it reinforces to me the reason why I'm on the Gun Violence Task Force and supporting so many of the anti-ammunition, anti-multiple clips, anti-machine guns, anti-bump stocks. All of those things that just put weapons of war on our streets, on our campuses and our churches. And our picture shows it almost takes the words away. 
 
SANCHEZ: Congresswoman Dina Titus, we have to step aside for a moment. We do appreciate your time. Please keep us posted on what you hear. We look forward to learning more as you do. 
 
TITUS: I absolutely will. Thank you. 
 
SANCHEZ: Thanks so much. Stay with CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We're back in just a few minutes. 
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you a student here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mm-hmm.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And what did you see? What did you hear? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE STUDENT: So I was sitting outside. I was just having breakfast and then I heard three, like loud booms and then was like, oh, what is that? And it's kind of ignored. And then two more. And then police showed up and I ran inside. And then it was kind of OK for a second that. But then after like two minutes, boom, boom, boom, more shots. So I ran into a basement, and then we were in the basement for like 20 minutes and I heard it's hearing shots outside and I was hearing police. And then the police just evacuated me out. I had my hands over my head. And yes, I was just hearing, like, a lot of shots. I didn't know how many shooters there were. I don't really know anything. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where were you exactly when there was this was happening? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE STUDENT: There's like a field and there's like steps. And I was just sitting on the steps out in the open. And there was like an event going on, like there was like a Lego party. And everyone was just kind of concerned and looking around and then boom, everyone's running. And I didn't know what was happening. I was like, I guess we're all running. I'm running. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So right now we're at Harmon and Maryland. How far away from that scene are we right now? Approximately.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE STUDENT: Like a block. And then you go into campus and it's directly across from the Student Union. So I guess like a block away, super close. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And did you -- did you see anybody running at that point or what did you see besides that? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE STUDENT: I was one of the first people running. I saw people running. I'm like, I'm going to run. And then for a second, people were like, going outside. I was like, stop, stop, stop. There's a shooting and no one believing it. They're like, what are you talking about? And then you saw people running. And everyone was just going everywhere. Then boom, it was cleared out in a second. Because I had -- where I had like windows at the outside and everything was just gone. And then I saw them get a guy and put him on the floor and I thought it was OK. And then I was hearing more shots after that and that's when I ran and went in the basement. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you say? I'm sorry. What did you say about the person on the floor? What? What were you seeing? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE STUDENT: At first I heard the shots and then I was waiting inside a building before I went in the basement and I saw them grab a guy and take a big gun. And then I saw them put the guy in a car. So I was like, OK, it's over
 
It's going to be clear soon. And then I heard more rounds after that. And that's when I went running. I didn't know where that was even coming. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So I certainly wonder if that was the shooter. So, can you explain that scene -- explained from the moment that you saw this person until they were put in the car? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE STUDENT: So I was looking outside. I was seeing police cars surround the other building and then I see a guy and they pushed him on the floor and the other police officer were holding a big gun. Which I'm assuming was the shooter, and then I saw them throw a guy in a car -- who I'm assuming was the shooter. And then I didn't know what's happening. And then boom, I hear rounds of shots and was coming from police or another person. 
 <br>[16:00:00]
 
So I went running after that. And then I was just -- I didn't know what was happening after that I was hearing gunfire. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we and we know that. So we we're hearing from Metro that a suspect is deceased at this point. So, unclear if that person was the shooter but you certainly saw some activity right there. 
 
KEILAR: We should be clear here, we are told by police or police have announced that the shooter in this case is dead. So what she is saying is raising questions. Obviously police would be there with their own long guns. So, lots of questions here as we try to figure out what happened. 
 
SANCHEZ: A chaotic moment, no doubt. Officials are now trying to piece together exactly what happened. Multiple victims reported at the UNLV camp. 
 
We're staying on top of this the way that only CNN can. We'll be right back in just moments with "THE LEAD" with Jake Tapper.</pre>
