(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM a legal case involving former President Donald Trump is once again heading to court in the coming hours. We will look at which Mar-a-Lago employee is caught up in it and how Trump is reportedly paying for his mounting legal costs. 
 
The hottest month on record is finally coming to a close. We will look at whether there's relief in sight from the blistering temperatures baking much of the United States. 
 
And dozens were killed and many more wounded after a suspected suicide bombing in Pakistan. We'll go live to Islamabad for the latest. 
 
Good to have you with us. Well, the coming hours, we'll see a little- known employee of Donald Trump in federal court as part of the criminal case against the former president and Republican candidate for his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Carlos de Oliveira is a property manager at Mar-a-Lago. He is charged with making false statements in a January interview with the FBI when he was asked about the movement of boxes at the Florida resort. 
 
He is also accused alongside Trump and aide Walt Nauta of trying to delete security footage at the resort. CNN spoke with a former Trump attorney who thinks prosecutors will have a hard time with that particular claim. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TIM PARLATORE, FORMER TRUMP LAWYER: So, here it's interesting because they just have a conversation that apparently wasn't recorded where he's saying the boss wants this deleted. If they don't really have much more than that, they may be have enough to charge Carlos with it, but quite frankly, if you charge Donald Trump every single time one of his employees says, you know, the boss wanted something, you know, I think that it could go on forever because so many of them, you know, just use that phrase. 
 
And so, they would have to actually make the connection that he actually communicated that to Carlos. So, I don't think that they're going to be able to sustain their burden as to others, even if they do have that employee come in and say, yes, you know, Carlos said this to me. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: And Trump is pushing back on these latest charges, denying on social media that security footage from Mar-a-Lago was deleted. But that's not the claim. Trump's accused of an attempt to delete the footage. Meantime, sources tell CNN that Trump is creating a fund to help pay his enormous legal bills. This amid reports that his political action committee, which raises most of its money through small donations has spent more than $40 million on legal fees for Trump and his associates this year alone. 
 
A brutal heat wave sweeping the U.S. is set to continue this week. More than 140 heat records could be broken or tied as temperatures continue to climb across the country. On Sunday, parts of California, Louisiana and Georgia recorded new record highs. And CNN spoke with some people out and about here in Atlanta, Georgia about how they are planning to beat the heat. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's warm, it's fine. I think you can adapt to it if you just keep working through it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're not used to the heat and stuff like this, I would suggest you don't necessarily come out and experience it because it is a lot. This heat's not much for me. Clearly, I love wearing, you know, long sleeves in the summer like this, but I will say for like dogs and stuff we have her packed. She's got booties, she's got her water and everything like that, so you do have to make sure you have stuff for your dogs and stuff. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, stay in light clothes and just drink a lot of water, stay hydrated. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Once you've been living in Atlanta for a long time, time your kind of just know how to handle it you know how to embrace it a little bit like you're going to sweat you're going to be a little bit uncomfortable and that's just part of living here.

CHURCH: Over the next week, nearly 60 million people could see temperatures soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 
The U.S. State Department says it is working to free kidnapped American nurse Alix Dorsainvil and her child in Haiti. They were abducted on Thursday, according to the Christian aid organization where she works. CNN's Athena Jones has the latest. 
 <br>[02:05:00]
 
ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We know U.S. authorities are working closely with their Haitian counterparts and with U.S. government interagency partners to try to resolve this crisis, but there's also a lot of things we don't know. It's unclear right now who is responsible for this kidnapping or whether they've made any demands, whether for ransom or anything else. El Roi Haiti, which is a humanitarian organization, a Christian humanitarian organization this nurse from New Hampshire was working for, put out a statement. 
 
Here's what they said in part. "Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus."
 
Now, El Roi has also said their highest priority is the safe return of this mother and her child and they want to limit the amount of information they're sharing. We also heard from a State Department spokesperson saying that they have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. 
 
But this kidnapping comes at a time of growing concerns about the worsening violence in Haiti. It was just two years ago this month that then President Jovenel Moise was assassinated by a gang, and there's been a power vacuum ever since, with some gangs taking control of various different swaths of the country. 
 
The State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Haiti because of the frequency of kidnappings, crimes, civil unrest, and also the poor health infrastructure. And just last week, the State Department ordered all family members and non-emergency personnel of the embassy to leave the country immediately because it's so unsafe. 
 
This came after at least three days in a row of restrictions where embassy staffers and families were supposed to stay there on the embassy compound because things were so dangerous. The U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, said during a recent visit to Haiti that "Haitians are trapped in a living nightmare with humanitarian conditions that are beyond appalling." 
 
Guterres went on to say, "We are calling for a robust security force deployed by member states to work hand in hand with the Haitian national police to defeat and dismantle the gangs and restore security across the country." But bottom line here, we're still awaiting more details of this scary and dangerous situation there in Haiti. Athena Jones, CNN, New York. 
 
CHURCH: A deadly day in Pakistan, at least 44 people were killed and more than 100 injured in a suspected suicide bombing at a political convention in the northwestern part of the country on Sunday. Members of an Islamist party had gathered in a town near the border with Afghanistan. Police say the attacker detonated explosives near the convention stage. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for that attack. 
 
I want to get more now, let's go to CNN producer Sophia Safi who joins us live from Islamabad in Pakistan. So, Sophia, what is the latest on this suspected suicide bombing? 
 
SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER: Rosemary, like you just said, the death toll is above 40. It still remains at 44. We still do not have a claim of responsibility. It's coming up to almost 24 hours since the attack took place. It was a suicide bombing, which has been confirmed to us by police officials in the Bajaur region of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan. 
 
Now, these kinds of attacks were not uncommon during the war and militancy in Pakistan a couple of years ago, but it's been quite some time since an attack of this scale has taken place in that part of the country. So, it's been a very deadly bombing. We do not have a claim of responsibility. There is a sense of unease, of fear. There was this attack, wars targeting a political convention. 
 
This was a gathering of workers from the Jamiat-Ulema e-Islami Fazl Party, which is one of the parties that is making up the current coalition government. So, a sense of unease around what led to this and why this kind of face of terrorism had reared its head again in Pakistan. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH: And Sophia, what is the significance of the timing of this attack? 
 
SAIFI: Well, that's where it becomes interesting because the unfortunate situation is that whenever there's election season here in Pakistan, there always has been, in previous election cycles as well, an increase in militant attacks on political parties, on political campaign -- on campaigning organizations on different political party gatherings. This has happened five years ago, around the previous election cycle, and previously as well.
 <br>[02:10:00]
 
Now, the JUIF is an Islamist party. They're supposed to be one of the most far-right parties in the country. So, we do not have a claim of responsibility, but we do know that in the region of Bajaur, which borders Afghanistan, there has been an increase in attacks by the Islamic State on the JUIF, who call them apostates. So there hasn't been a claim of responsibility, but there is kind of, you know, an investigation into whom could be behind it. 
 
The Pakistani Taliban, the TTP, have denied being behind this attack. Pakistan's government has often said that it is in neighboring Afghanistan where such attacks are planned. But again, we're not going to know much until there is a claim of responsibility as this day unfolds. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right, Sophia Saifi, joining us live from Islamabad. Many thanks for that report. And still to come, Ukraine seeks security guarantees from the United States as it prepares to hold peace talks. Details on the meeting scheduled in Saudi Arabia. Back with that and more in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:15:00]
 
CHURCH: Ukraine says the northeastern city of Kharkiv has been hit by two early morning airstrikes that have caused a fire in non- residential areas. Emergency services are responding and so far, there's been no word on any casualties. The strikes happened hours after Ukraine announced it would soon begin talks with the U.S. to try to obtain security guarantees as it awaits NATO membership. 
 
Ukraine is also expected to attend an international summit in Saudi Arabia which will focus on a peace proposal to settle the war with Russia. And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now. Good morning to you, Clare. We are also hearing about another drone attack inside Russia. What more do you know about this? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Rosemary, this news this morning coming from the governor of Russia's Bryansk region, which is just across the border in the northern border of Ukraine. This would be the third time in four days that we're seeing Russia blaming an attack on its soil on Ukraine. You can see there just where that Bryansk region is. The region we're talking about, the part of that region that we're talking about is actually right on the border with Ukraine. 
 
So, this is significant. This comes, of course, after we saw Russia claiming that it intercepted a missile in the Rostov region on Friday where fragments injured, it said, 14 people. Moscow, again, targeted, Russia said on Sunday, with drones that it apparently shot down, but there was damage to Moscow's prized business district called Moscow City.
 
So, this, as I said, the fourth time in three days. No injuries reported, though a drone, according to the governor, did hit a building of the regional interior department and there is damage there that he says that they are working to clean up. No claim as of yet from Russia that this drone was shot down. So, that is noteworthy. 
 
But also, this comes, of course, after we heard comments from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine on Sunday. There's been no specific comment on this latest drone attack, but he did say on Sunday, gradually the war is returning to the territory of Russia. He said this is an inevitable natural and fair process. We've seen an uptick in these attacks. We've also seen an uptick in attacks on the Crimean Peninsula. 
 
I think this speaks to not only a strategy from Ukraine of hitting behind Russian lines, trying to disrupt infrastructure logistics, weapons depots, things like that, as it continues with its counteroffensive, but also really a sort of concerted effort now to bring the fight to the Russian people, to the Russian soil, and try to sort of test their ongoing support or at least non-opposition to this war, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: And Clare, what is the latest on the peace talks planned in Saudi Arabia? And of course, Ukraine's planned negotiations to gain U.S. security guarantees. 
 
SEBASTIAN: Yes, so starting with the security guarantees, this will pick up where they left off from the NATO summit just a couple of weeks ago, where really the biggest outcome was that the G7 put out this declaration saying that there would be bilateral efforts by countries to provide these security guarantees, commitments and arrangements is what they called them, to Ukraine. 
 
So, talks are set to start according to the head of President Zelenskyy's office with the U.S., which is of course Ukraine's biggest backer. This week it will be things like strengthening their military for the long term, the industrial base, weapons, training, things like that. Also, it's strengthening Ukraine's resilience as a state, which is, of course, something Russia is trying to undermine, and committing to ongoing sanctions against Russia.
 
Critically important, of course, because if there's any guarantees that we've seen thus far by NATO countries have proved clearly worthless, given that Ukraine has now been invaded twice by Russia. And separately, of course, we see Ukraine also trying to rally support, international support, and alignment around President Zelenskyy's 10-point peace plan, a summit, set to be held according to the "Wall Street Journal," at the end of this week in Saudi Arabia with national security advisers to countries not only in Ukraine's western allies, but developing countries as well. 
 
We really see Ukraine trying to bring in countries that will include India and Brazil, we think, countries that Russia is also trying to court. So, Russia not included in these so-called peace talks, but this is really a strategy by Ukraine to rally support and to sort of get its own agenda for peace on the global stage. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Thanks to Clare Sebastian. Appreciate it. And joining me now is retired Australian Army Major General, Mick Ryan. He is also a former commander at the Australian Defense College. Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
MICK RYAN, RETIRED AUSTRALIAN ARMY: Thank you. 
 
CHURCH: So, we are seeing Ukraine strike Russia again with these drone attacks. So, what's it hoping to achieve with these attacks on Russia? And is this a winning strategy for Ukraine? 
 <br>[02:19:52]
 
RYAN: Well, it's part of Ukraine striking back at Russia. I mean, there's a political imperative for President Zelenskyy to strike back after these terrible Russian strikes at Odessa, at historical, cultural and grain export sites. But also, there's an information imperative after these terrible Russian strikes at Odessa, at historical, cultural and grain export sites. But also, there's an information imperative that Ukraine has to bring
 
 the war home to the Russian people and say this isn't a special military operation restricted to Ukraine. This is a war which you are a part of.
 
CHURCH: So, how do you expect Russia will respond militarily to these attacks on its soil? 
 
RYAN: Well, I think we'll see Russia respond again with more drone and missile attacks, but that's pretty much part for the course for the Russians in this war. They will continue doing that and they'll continue making accusations that this counteroffensive that the Ukrainians are undertaking to take back their territory is preventing peace overtures from Russia. 
 
CHURCH: And what impact might these Ukrainian attacks on Russia have on some Western nations that are currently sending military assistance to Ukraine?
 
RYAN: Well, throughout the war, Ukrainians have gradually expanded their reach in these kinds of strikes. We saw them on the Engels Air Force Base. We've seen strikes on Sevastopol and now three attacks on Moscow. At this point in time, I don't perceive that western countries are nervous about this. These are very targeted strikes. They're not killing Russian civilians. 
 
But certainly, some may be looking at this as a reason potentially not to give Ukraine a (inaudible). If that's the case, that would be a tragedy. 
 
CHURCH: And as we've been talking, of course we know that Ukraine plans to hold peace talks in Saudi Arabia, but Russia will not be taking part. So, what will likely be achieved by this given President Putin insists that a ceasefire is unlikely while Ukraine's counteroffensive continues?
 
RYAN: Well, at the G20 meeting last year, President Zelenskyy outlined his 10-point plan for war termination, and part of that is Russia leaving Ukrainian territory. He will be seeking to build a wider consensus beyond the G20 for that 10-point plan, and I think that makes a lot of sense at this point in the war. 
 
CHURCH: So how do you see this war ending? What are the options in terms of an off-ramp? 
 
RYAN: Well, there's a broad spectrum of potential outcomes in this war. We certainly all hope that Ukraine will win. I expect that they will. But I think that there is a moral imperative on the west and other countries to help Ukraine win more quickly. So, more Ukrainians are alive at the end of this to enjoy the fruits of their victory. 
 
CHURCH: But -- so what are those options then?
 
RYAN:  Well, at this point in time, we need to continue supporting Ukrainians in their current offensive, whilst also ensuring we support them over the winter and prepare them and train them for any subsequent offenses that might be needed in 2024. I think even the most optimistic Ukrainian estimates for the counteroffensive will probably see them maybe reach the sea, but Crimea and parts of the Donbas will probably require future operations. 
 
CHURCH: All right. Mick Ryan, thank you so much for sharing your military analysis with us. We do appreciate it. 
 
RYAN: Thank you. 
 
CHURCH: Well, coming up, the political crisis is growing in Niger. Thousands of protesters are turning out in support of the military coup, while regional leaders are issuing sanctions and threatening force. We will have the latest in a live report. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
CHURCH: Sanctions, threats, chaos, confrontation and diplomacy all coming to bear Sunday in the political crisis in Niger. The president of Chad traveled to Niger's capital hoping to find a political solution. And this image of him sitting with the country's ousted president Mohamed Bazoum may be the first public picture of Bazoum since he was deposed in a military coup on Wednesday. 
 
Meanwhile, thousands took to the streets to express support for the coup leaders. Niger is a former French colony and some of the most tense demonstrations were held outside the French embassy. Protesters damaged the building, chanted against colonialism, and waved Russian flags. In neighboring Nigeria, regional economic leaders hit Niger with a host of sanctions and threatened to use force if the coup leaders don't restore the elected president within a week. 
 
And CNN's Larry Madowo is monitoring this crisis for us from Nairobi. He joins us now. So, Larry, what is the latest on all of this? 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The biggest development is that the battle lines are drawn between the military men that took over the Nigerian government and the regional body, ECOWAS, that is now isolating them. These sanctions include a no-fly zone. They have issued travel bans, freezing financial transactions, freezing assets of the Nigerian government in regional banks. 
 
They are trying to squeeze them so much that they have to negotiate. And the African Union is supporting those sanctions by ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, saying that they hope that their two objectives here, that President Bazoum is released and reinstated in power, but the best way to do that is negotiations. But if that does not happen, then all necessary measures should be taken, which is fighting words from ECOWAS and from the African Union. 
 
But on the streets of Niger, the most extraordinary scenes, supporting the military, rejecting France-Afrique, the influence of France in the region, rejecting ECOWAS and international meddling and standing with the military men that took over. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Angry Nigerians smashing windows of the French embassy in the capital, Niamey. 
 <br>[02:29:58]
 
Thousands of people outraged at the country's former colonial power, a day after it suspended aid and financial support for Niger with the immediate effect. Down with France, some said condemning French support for ousted president Mohamed Bazoum. Unable to get into the heavily protected compound, a window set on fire and French flag trashed, a common sight since Wednesday's military coup.
 
Security forces eventually deployed tear gas to disperse the protesters. France warned it would retaliate immediately and in a strict manner in case of any attacks against its embassy, nationals, army, or diplomats. Elysee Palace saying on Sunday, adding that President Emanuel Macron will not tolerate any attack against France and its interests. The military junta that ousted the West African country's democratically-elected president came to show France and the world that it has the backing of the public.

MAMAN SANI, PROTESTER (through translator): We also came out to tell this little Macron from France that Nigeria belongs to us. It is up to us to do what we want with Nigeria. What we want. We deal with who we want and how we want. We reaffirm our support for the army.
 
MADOWO (voice-over): A sea of people outside Nigeria's parliament denouncing France and some raising Russian flags. As anti-French sentiment has grown in the country, many have warmed up to Russia.
 
Long-live Putin and long-live Russia, the protesters say, demanding that foreign armies leave the country. France has about 1,500 troops in Nigeria, a key ally in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel. The U.S. has about 1,000 troops in the country involved in counterterrorism operations.
 
IBRAHIM, RETAILER (through translation): As citizens in Nigeria, we are against French bases, American bases, Canadian bases, Italian bases. All the bases that are in Nigeria, we don't need them.
 
MADOWO (voice-over): The Head of the President Guard, General Abdourahamane Tchiani deposed his boss and declared himself Nigeria's new leader on Friday, saying he would suspend the constitution and rule with a so-called national consult for the safeguard of the homeland.
 
ZEINABOU BOUKARI, PROTESTER (through translation): They are really brave and I support them 100 percent. We have really suffered a lot. We have suffered a lot because they are our children. A lot of blood has been shed in Nigeria. We want peace. We want peace
 
MADOWO (voice-over): In neighboring Nigeria, an emergency summit of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. Regional leaders announced sanctions including closing borders, a travel ban, a no-fly zone, freezing assets and a deadline. ECOWAS giving the Nigeria junta one week to reinstate President Bazoum or threatened to take all measures to restore his government.
 
OMAR ALIEU TOURAY, PRESIDENT, ECOWAS COMMISSION: In the event, the authority's demands are not met within one week, take all measures necessary to restore constitutional order in the Republic of Niger. Such measures may include the use of force. To this effect, the Chiefs of Defense, Staff of ECOWAS are to meet immediately.
 
MADOWO (voice-over): But many protesters in the streets don't want any ECOWAS military intervention or involvement, and the military junta says it is ready.
 
COLONEL-MAJOR AMADOU ABDRAMANE, NIGER MILITARY JUNTA CNSP (through translation): We once again remind ECOWAS and those who wish to adventure in this, of our firm determination to defend our country.
 
MADOWO (on camera): Fighting words for the military in charge of Nigeria and from the regional body ECOWAS that has effectively isolated them. The President of neighboring Chad, Idriss Deby did make a trip to Niger to Niamey, and he spoke with the deposed president Mohamed Bazoum -- this is the first time we have seen him in public and he also spoke with the man who essentially removed him, that used to be the Head of the Presidential Guard, now called himself President of the National Commission to Safeguard -- National Council to Safeguard the Homeland, General Abdourahamane Tchiani.
 
They sat there almost casually even though they are the two men at the center of this crisis. President Mohamed Bazoum maintains he will not resign and the entire international community supports him. They say he is the democratically elected president of the country. And now, ECOWAS threatening to militarily intervene if he is not reinstated within one week. For now, six days to go. The Chiefs of Defense of ECOWAS are due to meet and this could be escalating into a major political crisis in the West of Africa.

CHURCH: Thanks to Larry Medovo who joins us there from Nairobi. Appreciate it.
 
The Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says a meeting of 14 Palestinian factions was a first step to end division and to achieve national unity. His comments came Sunday, drawing talks between rival factions in Egypt at a time when violence between Israel and Palestinians has surged.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
The talks followed a meeting between Abbas and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week, where the two leaders agreed to find ways to end internal divisions.
 
Still to come, a new typhoon is brewing in the Pacific Ocean, picking up strength as it moves toward land. Plus, China is focusing on recovery efforts after the Storm Doksuri swept through the country. More on the extreme weather just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: We are keeping a very close eye on Typhoon Khanun in the Pacific Ocean as it picks up strength. The storm was elevated to typhoon status on Sunday and is expected to make landfall on the Okinawa Islands in the next 48 hours. Then, it is expected to move north toward China. But forecasters with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center say it is -- its track is uncertain.
 
Well, China is still bearing the brunt of Doksuri, one of the strongest storms to hit the country this year. Thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes because of intense rain and flooding. While typhoons are a common threat to the area, the damage from Doksuri is deeply affecting residents. CNN's Laila Harrak has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR/REPORTER (voice-over): Rescuers in speedboats zoom across the water in southeastern China. It is the best and at times only way to access cities flooded by recent heavy rains. The boats navigating the tight streets, at times floating up to the front doors of homes to ferry stranded residents to safer ground. Officials say over the weekend, more than 500,000 people have been evacuated from the region, where a powerful storm named Doksuri made landfall as a typhoon Friday, after battering the Philippines.
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
It has since been downgraded, but officials are warning of torrential rain and hazardous flooding for any city in its path, and that includes Beijing which has been doused with heavy showers that are expected to continue until Tuesday. Authorities have urged residents in the Chinese capital to stay indoors, and thousands of people have already been evacuated from areas with flood risks. Authorities say there could be potentially hazardous conditions like those seen in other parts of the country.
 
In eastern China, security camera footage captured a man caught in rushing waters on a street. A bus driver stopped to help him as debris surrounds them. But the man is eventually dragged out of the water with the help of some people passing by. In the southern part of the country, some residents are taking stock of the damage and trying to salvage what they can from their water-logged homes, but that break may not last for long as another powerful storm could possibly make landfall in China later this week.

CHURCH: Welcome back to our viewers here in North America. I'm Rosemary Church. Biden Administration officials tell CNN they have launched a website for a new income-driven student loan repayment plan. It will allow borrowers to begin submitting applications for the program. Federal student loan payments are set to resume in October. CNN's Arlette Saenz has more details from Delaware.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The Biden Administration is taking new steps to offer relief to some student loan borrowers, with some borrowers potentially seeing their payments go as little as $0 per month. Now, this was rolled out by the Department of Education in a beta website, opening up applications during a test period for the latest version of the income-driven student loan repayment plan that the administration is called the "SAVE Plan."
 
Now, this would apply to those who have federal student loans. Private student loans are not part of this. And it applies to current loan holders and as well as future borrowers as well. This plan would be based on your income and family size. And the Department of Education is estimating that one million borrowers could see potentially see their payments go to $0 per month. This will be based on discretionary income, so that money that you have after paying your taxes and also other living expenses, and individuals who are making $32,805 or less, and families of four making $67,500 or less, they would see their monthly payments wiped down to $0.
 
Another interesting component of this plan is that as you are paying off the student debt, the interest would no longer accrue on those federal loans. Now others, when this plan goes into full effect next summer, they could see their payments cut in half. And ultimately, could have them all forgiven if they make their payments on time for ten years. Now, this is the latest effort from the Biden Administration to try to offer relief to student loan borrowers after the Supreme Court had struck down President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan.
 
Now, there have been income-driven repayment plans in the past, going back decades and officials that I spoke with believe that they do have the legal standing, the legal grounds for this type of program because Congress has given them authority to build these income-based repayment plans. So ultimately, they do not think that there will be a successful legal challenge since they haven't seen those with this plan in the past.

(END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: In Arkansas, a judge has temporarily blocked a state law that would have held librarians and bookstores criminally liable for providing minors with materials deemed harmful to them. That move came just days before the law was to take effect and weeks after a group of libraries, librarians, bookstores and publishing groups filed a lawsuit arguing that a section of the law violated the First Amendment. They also argue the law could lead to the removal of young adult and general collections with sexual content. Republican Governor Sarah Sanders signed the law in March. Her Communications Director says she continues to support the law despite the ruling which is subject to appeal.
 
A Bay Area man is facing a murder charge after he allegedly stabbed a woman to death and then posted a video of the killing on Facebook. The police say he knew the victim but the motive for the killing is still unclear. CNN's Camila Bernal has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): 39-year-old Mark Mechikoff is facing a felony murder charge after police say he filmed himself stabbing a woman and then posted that video on Facebook. Police saying he filmed her last moments. Now, this all started on Wednesday when the Nye County Sheriff's Department in Nevada actually called the San Mateo Police Department saying that they received a call from a woman saying she watched the stabbing on Facebook.
 
That woman was able to provide a name and a phone number, and that information led authorities to an apartment complex. They say it was actually a large building, so it took them about three hours as they went door to door trying to find the suspect or the victim in this case. Unfortunately, they found that woman that had been killed and authorities say that the two did have a connection. But so far, they do not know what the exact motive was in this case. Now, he was arraigned on Friday and assigned a Public Defender.
 
We have not been able to locate that Public Defender and it is also important to point out that we reached out to Meta to ask exactly why that video was on there.

How long it took or how long it was posted on the website before they took it down. We have not received a response from the company. But of course, it is a horrific crime where we are still asking for those questions and still trying to figure out why he did this. Authorities asking for surveillance video from the area, if anyone saw anything, because they are trying to piece together exactly what happened in this case.

CHURCH: Two separate aircraft crashes before a major air show in Wisconsin have left four people dead and two injured. The first happened early Saturday when a vintage military training craft crashed into Lake Winnebago in the City of Oshkosh. Authorities say the plane went down quickly from around 3,000 feet. The two people on board were found dead.
 
Hours later, two others died in a midair collision between a helicopter and a gyrocopter. Two people injured in that incident are in stable condition.
 
And in New Hampshire, a beach full of people watched as a small plane towing an advertising banner crashed into the ocean. Video shows the aircraft hitting the water nose first and flipping upside down, not far from swimmers in Hampton Beach. Lifeguards rescued the pilot who was not seriously injured. The plane had to be towed out of the water. Federal authorities say they will investigate the cause of the crash.

Well, at the Women's World Cup, eight teams are scheduled to play in the hours ahead including Australia, who will try to qualify for the Round of 16 after their co-host New Zealand fell short. CNN's Don Riddell has more.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN "WORLD SPORT" ANCHOR (on camera): FIFA Women's World Cup is only 11 days old, but already it is over for some of the teams and for the co-host New Zealand, it has ended in absolute heartbreak. Sunday's actions saw the completion of Group A and this was such a tie group that anything could have happened, any of the four teams could have qualified for the knock-out stage but just as equally, any of them could have been knocked down. Norway were always expected to make it through; they arrived at the tournament with a score boasting some of the best players in the world but they left it pretty late to get going, having not even scored in their first two games.
 
They needed something big in their last match against the Philippines in Auckland and they delivered -- Sophie Roman Haug doing most of damage with a hat trick as the Norwegians romped to a 6-0 win. That was emphatic but it still might not have been enough. They also had to hope that New Zealand didn't win their last game against Switzerland. The football fans had made such a bright start to this tournament winning their first-ever World Cup match, but a shocked defeat to the Philippines really set them back. They had their chances, Jacqueline Hand hitting the post. But in the 12 shots they mustered, none found the back of the net. Goalkeeper Victoria Esson hoping to something in the dying moments, her head (ph) went wide. The final whistle was just devastating, confirming that this New Zealand team will no longer feature in the tournament that they are co-hosting.
 
Amidst all of that drama, we also witnessed the biggest upset of the tournament so far, and this one truly was a shocker, as Germany, previously two-time world champions lost their first group game since 1995. They were up against Colombia whose 18-year-old Linda Caicedo was rapidly making a name for herself and living the dream. Just three years ago, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Her second goal of this tournament was an absolute beauty. Colombia brought a physical intensity to this game; Germany never really got into a rhythm. But they thought they would savage the point in the 89th minute when Alexandra Popp split a penalty, her third goal of the tournament. But Colombia were not quite done. In the seventh minute of entry time, Manuela Vanegas headed in a sensational winner, sending the Colombian fans in Sydney into a state of ecstasy.
 
And historic night also elsewhere in Group Eight, as Morocco stunned South Korea for their first-ever world cup win. Morocco had ranked 72nd in the world, Korea 17th, but that all meant nothing as Ibtissam Jraidi scored their first-ever world cup goal in the sixth minute. That turned out to be the winner. History also made by Morocco's defender Nouhaila Benzina, who became the first player ever to wear a hijab in a world cup match.
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
This group (ph) will be wrapped up on Thursday. Here's where they all stand. Colombia have six points, three clear of both Germany and Morocco. Colombia need only a point against Morocco to be sure of advancing. Germany though might have to beat Korea in their final game if they want to stick around a little bit longer. Back to you.

A charity in the U.K. is hosting the world's biggest butterfly survey in an effort to gather data on the environment. Last year's event led to shocking findings. The butterfly conservation claims 80 percent of these species are in decline, with the insects no longer present in nearly half the places they were 50 years ago. The group says it is a grim sign for the state of the planet.

AMU WALKDEN, VOLUNTEER, BUTTERFLY CONSERVATION: Having a yearly record of what is around and what isn't around I think is really good scientific data to indicate changes such as global warming and habitat destruction. Butterflies are sensitive indicators of what's going on. So, it is really important.
 
RICHARD FOX, SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR, BUTTERFLY CONSERVATION: The major causes of the decline are what we have humans have done to the landscape in the U.K. over the past 50, 60, 70 years. And so, that is things like the intensification of agriculture, which is not just chemicals that go into that, pesticides and fertilizers, but also changes to the landscape.
