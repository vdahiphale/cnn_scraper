COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, sunshine, rise up. It`s Friday, best day of the week. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news 
 
 because of you. Thanks for making me part of your day. 
 
Let`s get you your headlines. First, a lawsuit between two tech giants. On Wednesday, Yelp filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google. The local 
 
 business reviews platform is alleging that Google used its dominance to manipulate search results and promote its own local offerings.
 
In early August, a federal judge ruled that Google has an illegal monopoly on search, a decision that has the potential to change both Google and how 
 
 millions of people access information online. 
 
Wednesday`s Yelp lawsuit is the first since that ruling. A Google spokesperson responded in a statement saying, quote, "Yelp`s claims are not 
 
 new. Similar claims were thrown out years ago. On other aspects of the decision to which Yelp refers, we are appealing. Google will vigorously 
 
 defend against Yelp`s meritless claims," unquote.
 
And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention want the public to remember there`s a listeria outbreak and to avoid eating recalled deli 
 
 meats. Listeria, the third leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, is a bacteria that can spread easily on surfaces, and it doesn`t 
 
 die from refrigeration. This current outbreak is the largest in the nation since 2011.
 
In late July, Boar`s Head recalled more than 7.2 million pounds of liverwurst and other deli meats, but the CDC says at least a dozen more 
 
 cases of listeria have been reported since then. So far, reports show a total of 57 people have been hospitalized across 18 states. Nine people 
 
 have died.
 
But the CDC says the number of cases is likely higher than that. Most people have reported becoming sick from eating turkey or liverwurst. Some 
 
 have reported ham was the culprit. Other recalled products include bologna sausage, and roasted bacon. The CDC is asking customers to check their 
 
 kitchen and make sure there are no recalled products. They say to look specifically for EST-12612 or P-12612 inside the USDA mark of inspection on 
 
 labels.
 
Now we travel to Namibia, which is in the midst of the worst drought in 100 years. As a result, about half the population of the country, an estimated 
 
 1.4 million people, are expected to face high levels of acute food insecurity. In reaction, the government has come up with an unlikely 
 
 solution.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Killing hundreds of wildlife to provide food for hungry people is still a controversial move 
 
 that may anger conservationists, but Namibia sees this as a necessary evil. The Ministry of Environment calling it a sustainability intervention. These 
 
 animals will die anyway because of the effects of the drought there, the worst in 100 years.
 
The government of Namibia was forced to declare a state of emergency in May as more than half of the population could face acute food insecurity. That 
 
 is why the Ministry of Environment is contributing these animals as part of the drought relief program by the government. 723 wildlife from 83 
 
 elephants, 60 buffalos, 30 hippos, 300 zebras, 100 blue wildebeest, 50 impalas, and 100 elands have been earmarked for this. More than 150 animals 
 
 have already been killed, providing more than 125,000 pounds of game meat to those that need it, especially in rural parts of Namibia.
 
The drought here has been caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which has led to limited rainfall, but also the bigger picture here is because of 
 
 the effects of climate change. The climate crisis is hitting Southern Africa especially hard right now. So that is the backdrop for this 
 
 controversial move that the Namibian government says will also have reduced human wildlife conflict because of the drought.
 
Limited water, limited grazing lands has led to some deadly human wildlife conflict and they`re hoping this helps alleviate some of that as well.

WIRE:  Pop quiz hot shot. In the northern hemisphere, the first day of fall occurs on which of these? 
 
Vernal Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumnal Equinox or Winter Solstice?
 
Happening on September 22nd this year, the autumnal equinox marks the first day of fall for those living above the equator. 
 
All right, you can have your pumpkin spice latte, you can have your football and all the other fun fall festivities, but we might have to hold 
 
 off on welcoming the actual fall weather. The Climate Prediction Center just issued its forecast for the fall and it`s looking unusually warm 
 
 across the U.S. 
 
This summer is expected to be the hottest on record for nearly 100 cities in the U.S., including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. And while 
 
 fall technically starts on September 22nd, the heat isn`t likely going anywhere. There may be small pockets of cool here and there, but especially 
 
 in the southern Rockies, the South and on the East Coast, higher than average temperatures will persist through November. 
 
Question for you. How many stars do you think you can see when you look up at the nighttime sky? Now, a lot of that would depend on where you live. 
 
 There tends to be a pretty big difference between urban areas and more rural areas that don`t have the same levels of man-made light pollution. 
 
Well, one city in Arizona, Flagstaff, is looking to change all of that and become a destination for astro-tourism, the practice of traveling to view 
 
 objects and events that happen in space.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  For thousands of years, humans have gazed upon the Milky Way with awe and wonder. But for nearly 
 
 80% of Americans, the timeless beauty of the night sky is hidden because of human-made light pollution.
 
DR. DANIELLE ADAMS, CULTURAL ASTRONOMER FLAGSTAFF DARK SKIES COALITION:  This bright star here is Vega. 
 
DAM (on camera):  Wow. 
 
ADAMS:  In a pristine, dark sky, you can see about 4,500 stars on any given night. In a place like Atlanta or Phoenix, that number is 35.
 
DAM (voice-over):  In 2001, Flagstaff, Arizona was recognized as the world`s first international dark-sky city for its efforts to preserve the 
 
 night sky, thanks in part to the city`s innovative work with outdoor lighting.
 
ADAMS:  We don`t allow too much light to go into the sky. We have fixtures that have full cut-off shielding, so it all goes to the ground. We regulate 
 
 the wavelength of light. You`ll see that most of the street lighting is amber, and that scatters less in our sky.
 
DAM:  But Flagstaff`s dark-sky designation isn`t the only reason it`s become a hub for astro-tourism. 
 
(On camera):  Oh, you can see right where the astronauts would be sitting. Cool. You good with a selfie, dude? 
 
(Voice-over):  Less than an hour away, you can visit the Barringer Crater, where NASA once trained astronauts to land on the moon. 
 
(On camera):  Makes you kind of feel small. 
 
(Voice-over):  And at the Lowell Observatory, you can gaze at the heavens through a giant 128-year-old telescope. 
 
(On camera):  Wow. Can I move this thing?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, yeah.
 
ADAMS:  That inspiration from the night sky leads to poetry and art and music and dance. So many different things in cultures throughout the world. 
 
 It all connects to this wonder that we get out under a truly dark sky.

WIRE:  All right, here we go. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, is odor-able. Puppy perfume, y`all. The high-end fashion house Dolce &amp; Gabbana 
 
 just released perfume specifically for pets. A bottle of Fefe, named after Domenico Dolce`s dog, costs 109 bucks. It includes some doggy swag, a D&amp;G 
 
 collar, and tag.
 
Now, the company says the scent includes a touch of musk and undertones of sandalwood. Sounds like a fetching smell, but clearly this is for the dog`s 
 
 parents. If it were about making something that the dogs like, you`d just rub some peanut butter, bacon, or beef jerky on them.
 
All right, I`ll smell you later. But before I sign off, I`ve got to give a shout out. Belvidere South Middle School in Belvidere, Illinois. Go on, 
 
 Bucs. Rise up. 
 
No show on Monday for Labor Day. So let`s cue that Friday music not air. Hope you have a nice, long weekend. Remember, let your light shine. You are 
 
 more powerful than you know. 
 
I`m Coy Wire. It`s been a blessing to spend this week with you.
