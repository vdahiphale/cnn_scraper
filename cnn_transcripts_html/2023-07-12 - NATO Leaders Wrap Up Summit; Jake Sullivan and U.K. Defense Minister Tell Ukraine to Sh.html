CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  And amazing new images from the James Webb Space Telescope. We'll see what they can show us 
 
 about the stars' birth. Now, it's been a packed day in Lithuania where NATO leaders are wrapping up a key summit. Russia's war against Ukraine 
 
 has topped the agenda in Vilnius. Ukraine's president met with a list of foreign leaders today including U.S. President Joe Biden.   
 
This after a tense statement from Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying it was absurd the allies were dragging their feet when it came to offering 
 
 Ukraine NATO membership. That was followed by grumblings by some U.S. and British officials that Ukraine needed to be grateful for the support 
 
 it's received. But they appear to have patched up their differences. 
 
There still isn't a solid timeline for Ukraine to enter the alliance, but Mr. Zelenskyy heads back to Kyiv with security guarantees from the 
 
 G7 and NATO members. And he says he's confident Ukraine will be able to join the alliance eventually. Well, Russia is watching the events in 
 
 neighboring Lithuania, and isn't happy. The summit ends with Sweden on its way to being the next alliance member, turning the Baltic Sea into 
 
 what's been called a NATO Lake.   
 
But the Kremlin is warning security guarantees for Ukraine could lead to extremely negative consequences. Well, President Biden spoke earlier at 
 
 Vilnius University. He said if Russia thinks the U.S. will drop its support for Ukraine, it meant wrong.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Folks still doubt our staying power. He's still making a bad bet, and to conviction, the unity 
 
 among the United States and our allies and partners will break down. He still doesn't understand of our commitment, of our values, our freedom 
 
 is something he can never, ever, walk away from.   
 
(APPLAUSE) 
 
(CHEERS)
 
It's who we are! I mean it. It's who we are!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
MACFARLANE:  Well, as this summit reaches its conclusion, let's just reflect on the guarantees that we have made to Ukraine. Oren Liebermann 
 
 is joining us from the Pentagon. And Oren, we know Ukraine may not have secured the commitment on NATO membership they were looking for, but 
 
 they did receive a long-term security package from G7 members, which is significant. Just talk us through what that entails?   
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Christina, I think Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made it quite clear that 
 
 he wanted something more than this, other commitments for NATO membership or a roadmap to NATO membership, instead what he got and what 
 
 the U.S. and its NATO allies put together was essentially a security guarantee, both in the short term and the long term for Ukraine.   
 
A statement of resolve that the West will continue to back Ukraine, now that it's blatantly obvious to everyone, including Russian President 
 
 Vladimir Putin that this war could keep lasting a long time on top of the year-and-a-half we've already seen it. So what do these security 
 
 guarantees include? Take a look at this graphic. It's essentially a step-by-step, beginning with ensuring a sustainable force capable of 
 
 defending Ukraine.  
 
So, that's a statement about continuing to provide the military support we've seen from the U.S. and others, strengthen Ukraine's economic 
 
 stability and resilience, that perhaps more a long-term goal for rebuilding and recovering when that becomes more possible. And then 
 
 providing technical and financial support for Ukraine's immediate needs.   
 
So, you see how these kind of breakdown into the short term, medium and long term with that western-backing for Ukraine. Now, there hasn't been 
 
 any broad, NATO military aid package announced or anything like that, but Zelenskyy did say a few countries had agreed to provide more aid 
 
 including Germany, which he says will provide another Patriot missile battery.   
 
Ukraine has used that very effectively against Russian aerial attacks. Australia, he also says will provide another aid package, the U.K. 
 
 announced their own aid package which would include ammo and more combat vehicles. And Christina, of course, that comes on top of the U.S. 
 
 announcement of sending cluster munitions which came just a few days ago.   
 
MACFARLANE:  Yes, and to that point on cluster munitions, Oren, we know that Ukraine is still struggling with ammunition supplies. Those cluster 
 
 ammunitions are seen as being very controversial. Was there any more of a plan, sort of talked about, tackled that specific issue?   
 
LIEBERMANN:  So, part of the challenge here is there simply isn't enough ammunition produced in the West, and specifically, in the United States 
 
 to fuel a long-term war with the artillery needs for that type of war. The U.S. is working on that problem. Prior to this war, U.S. armor 
 
 production for artillery was about 15,000 rounds per month. They're trying to get that up to about 70,000 rounds per month, but that will 
 
 take some time.   
 
They've nearly doubled it to somewhere in the 30,000 range, but again, they have to more than double it again to hit that goal. So, in the 
 
 meantime, cluster munitions are essentially the bridge that the U.S. Is using to make sure that Ukraine has that kind of ammo. The U.S. hasn't 
 
 provided that ammo in the past, meaning there are available stockpiles of it that Ukraine can use, and cluster ammunitions because of how they 
 
 operate are effectively more than a single artillery round.  
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
It's not just one for one here. So that will help Ukraine at least in the near term and in the medium term here. But you're right, these are 
 
 controversial. U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said he understands why the U.S. provided them, but the U.K. has signed a treaty as many 
 
 other countries not to use it. So that's part of the solution to bridge this gap until western artillery production and ammo production is able 
 
 to fuel this type of long-term, grinding war that eats away at ammunitions stockpiles. 
 
MACFARLANE:  All right, Oren, appreciate the breakdown. Thank you. Well, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says Ukraine's future is in 
 
 NATO. He spoke earlier with CNN's Melissa Bell in Vilnius. Take a listen.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO:  I fully understand that President Zelenskyy is asking for as much as possible, and therefore 
 
 also grant that he actually at this summit also welcomed the decisions we made on sustaining and stepping up our support.   
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  One of the latest evolutions are the cluster munitions. Of course, the Washington has now pledged, we've just 
 
 heard President Zelenskyy thanking President Biden for what Oleksii Reznikov describe as potentially a game-changer over the course of the 
 
 next  few months. The fact of the use or the delivery rather, such controversial munitions that divide NATO members itself.  
 
Is that not the ultimate proof that this strategy of waiting rather than anticipating the needs, going in harder, faster has ultimately failed?   
 
STOLTENBERG:  Well, what I've seen is that Ukraine, despite the predictions of most experts, actually haven't been able to push back the 
 
 Russian forces. In the beginning, most experts believe that Ukraine were going to lose this war. And of course, its first and foremost, the 
 
 courage, the bravery the Ukrainian armed forces and the political leadership and President Zelenskyy himself, but of course, without that 
 
 enormous support, not least from the United States and the U.S. leadership mobilizing support from the allies to Ukraine, they would not 
 
 have been able to achieve what they have achieved.   
 
BELL:  On that question of American support, we've been hearing from Jake Sullivan speaking to reporters over the last couple of days, 
 
 suggesting that the American taxpayer has borne an enormous proportion of these efforts so far. And wondering perhaps if it is not time that 
 
 other NATO allies step up further.   
 
STOLTENBERG:  But European allies in counter have really also stepped up. They are providing support of tens of billions of U.S. dollars, big 
 
 announcement just during this summit. So they brought a lot of military support. But also, they have received millions of refugees, and they're 
 
 providing a lot of economic and humanitarian support. So, actually, the burden-sharing between North America and Europe is not so bad, 
 
 especially if you look at the big picture including also economic support on top of the military support.   
 
BELL:  This is a war that is costing the alliance, its members huge amounts, not just depleted stocks of their own in terms of ammunition 
 
 and weaponry, but there are also the difficulties that you faced actually, which is holding that steadfast and expensive and politically-
 
 costly unity together. How much longer can NATO do it?   
 
STOLTENBERG:  The act is that NATO is more united now than for many years, because we face the threat of the consequences of the Russia 
 
 swift invasion of Ukraine. And that has united the alliance, it has made us even more determined, and we see that in many ways.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MACFARLANE:  Well, we've seen some tensions today between Ukraine and its allies. And at the sidelines of the summit, U.K. Defense Minister 
 
 Ben Wallace told reporters that whether we like it or not, people want to see gratitude, and that western allies are not an Amazon delivery-
 
 free service for weapons. And earlier, U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan had this testy exchange with a Ukrainian activist.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DARIA KALENIUK, DIRECTOR, ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTION CENTER IN UKRAINE:  What should I tell my son that President Biden and NATO didn't invite 
 
 Ukraine to NATO because he is afraid of Russia? Should I prepare my son to be a soldier and fight Russians when he will be 18 years in seven 
 
 years?   
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, UNITED STATES:  Some of what you said in your remarks about motives, I think was entirely unfounded 
 
 and unjustified. I think the American people do deserve a degree of gratitude from us, from the United States, from our government deserve 
 
 gratitude for their willingness to step up.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MACFARLANE:  Well, Natasha Bertrand joins me now live from Vilnius. And Natasha, I'm wondering how you have been reading those tensions we just 
 
 saw there, behind the scenes today? And what the mood was like when President Biden and President Zelenskyy met earlier?   
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  Well, Christina, I think that Zelenskyy's tone has softened throughout the last two days. 
 
 Yesterday, we saw that scathing tweet from him really blasting NATO for not issuing them a direct -- Ukraine, a direct invitation to NATO once 
 
 the war ends.  
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
But today, you saw Zelenskyy express his gratitude for American and NATO -- and NATO support for Ukraine. And I think that he also got the 
 
 message from not only National Security adviser Jake Sullivan, who said that he believes that Ukraine should show more gratitude to the American 
 
 people for their unwavering commitment to Ukraine, but also from the U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, who had very similar comments.   
 
He told reporters that the U.K. is not like an Amazon. And that they can't just keep providing weapons and equipment indefinitely, and 
 
 especially without any kind of sense of gratitude from the Ukrainians. So, this was a message that we were hearing from two of the top NATO 
 
 allies. 
 
And it appears that Zelenskyy may have gotten that message, because later on during that brief meeting he had with Biden in front of 
 
 reporters before their bilateral meeting behind closed doors, he did say that he is very grateful for the support that he has gotten, 
 
 particularly when it comes of course, to the cluster munitions that the Americans have agreed to send to the Ukrainians.  
 
So, ultimately, he does appear to view what he got out of this summit as a success. And his chief of staff Andrii Yermak said as much, calling 
 
 this a victory. This is not exactly what he wanted. He wanted clear signals about a roadmap to NATO membership, especially a timeline for 
 
 when that might occur. But ultimately, Yermak as Chief of Staff said that this was a victory, especially when it comes to those commitments 
 
 that the G7 countries made to Ukraine's long-term security. 
 
And that was a really strong statement, strong declaration that the G7 put out earlier today, saying that on a bilateral basis, they're going 
 
 to be organizing different security partnerships with Ukraine to ensure that they have the viability, even if they are not a full-fledged NATO 
 
 member to successfully fight off Russia in this war, and no matter how long it takes, Christina.   
 
MACFARLANE:  Yes, and Natasha, last hour, we obviously had this rallying wide-ranging speech from President Biden, ultimately focused or trying 
 
 to refocus matters on that message of unity, and that the United States will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. What did you make of 
 
 President Biden's speech? Is this sort of final swansong of this summit?   
 
BERTRAND:  It was a very wide-ranging speech, and it touched on issues not only relating to NATO in Ukraine and the G7, but also things like 
 
 technology and climate change and broadly, of course, the theme being unity and freedom. That was really the message he was trying to drive 
 
 home during that -- those remarks is that, this is not just a fight that we are experiencing with Ukraine, and just between Ukraine and Russia 
 
 inside Ukraine's territorial borders.   
 
This is actually a broader fight between freedom and democracy and authoritarianism. And he has sought to draw that distinction before. He 
 
 has sought to rally the world in those terms before basically saying that the U.S. and the western alliance and democratic and free countries 
 
 are really the world's best hope here in terms of a good future.   
 
And so, that was the message that he was sending. It was the message that he spoke with world leaders about during his meetings today in 
 
 Vilnius. But he didn't mention really NATO and Ukraine, and that was notable omission. I think he wanted to let the day's events speak for 
 
 itself. But he did not revisit the issue there.   
 
And I think that will probably give some Ukrainians a little bit of heartburn especially given the slip-up that he had earlier in the speech 
 
 where he said that NATO had 33 members, in fact, it only has 31, soon to be 32 with Sweden. Ukraine has said repeatedly that it wants to be the 
 
 33rd member. So, clearly, a little bit of a slip there that Ukrainians would definitely have noticed, Christina.   
 
MACFARLANE:  Yes, if not the rest of the world. Natasha Bertrand, really great to have your reporting in these past two days. Thanks very much. 
 
 Well, it's on Ukraine's battlefield where these western promises -- well, support, will be put into practice. Officials say at least, 18 
 
 people including six children were injured in Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday by an unidentified hostile aerial object.   
 
And Ukraine says it shot down 11 out of 15 drones targeting the Kyiv region overnight. Well, meanwhile, Russian state TV appears to have 
 
 confirmed the death of a Russian General killed in Ukraine. Oleg Tsokov is -- was said to be one of a number of Russians killed in a missile 
 
 strike on Tuesday. Tsokov was deputy commander at the Southern Military District, and would be the most senior Russian General to have been 
 
 killed in Ukraine since the invasion began.  
 
All right, still to come tonight, a symbol of strengthening ties. We'll explain the significance of the first Russian Navy ship to officially 
 
 visit Havana in years.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
MACFARLANE:  U.S. government and Microsoft say Chinese hackers have gained access to some sensitive government e-mail accounts. The hackers 
 
 were able to get into e-mail accounts connected to two dozen U.S. agencies including the State Department. Unlike some hackers who are 
 
 seeking money, U.S. officials say this type of crime was aimed at spying and stealing U.S. secrets.  
 
CNN's cyber security reporter Sean Lyngaas joins us now with more. Sean, do we know how extensive this hacking was?   
 
SEAN LYNGAAS, CNN CYBER SECURITY REPORTER:  Well, Christina, it was actually very targeted. You know, they're going after only a handful of 
 
 e-mail accounts at some of these U.S. government agencies. And while it was two dozen organizations overall spanning the private sector and 
 
 government, we only know from our reporting of two U.S. federal executive agencies that have been breached in this activity.   
 
The State Department was one of them, we were confirmed -- we confirmed earlier today. And another agency we believe targeted was in -- on 
 
 Capitol Hill, one of the legislative branch agencies. So, this is very targeted spying, it's not -- they know what they're looking for, they 
 
 know that they're looking for information that might help the Chinese government, according to U.S. officials in their intelligence-gathering.   
 
And they're very good at doing this, so, they had a month, had starred on the U.S. government in terms of their access to some of these e-mails 
 
 before they were discovered. It's unclassified e-mail systems where you can still clean a lot on what someone is doing in terms of who they're 
 
 contacting, and perhaps their location based on this data, so it's another challenge in terms of how the Biden administration tries to ward 
 
 off some of this Chinese cyber espionage.   
 
And I should point out that Beijing denies a lot of these allegations and they in turn accuse Washington of conducting their own cyber attacks 
 
 on Chinese organizations. So, this is an ongoing duel if you will in cyber space between the two preeminent super powers in the world.   
 
MACFARLANE:  Yes, a month had starred is worrying news indeed. But Sean, thanks very much for bringing us that. Appreciate it. All right, Cuba is 
 
 accusing the United States of a provocative escalation, slamming the presence of a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine at Guantanamo Bay last 
 
 week. Cuba says the sub remained at the U.S. military base for several days, questioning the military reason for such a move.  
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
The U.S. would only say, it does not discuss its military movements. Well, Cuba has long complained   about U.S. base on its soil, which 
 
 houses the Guantanamo prison camp, it says its permanence is an affront to Cuba's sovereign rights. Well, in stark contrast, Cuba is welcoming 
 
 the arrival of a Naval ship that just sailed into Havana from Russia. Patrick Oppmann is joining us now from Havana with more.   
 
And this, Patrick, is an interesting move in light of the tensions between Cuba and the United States. But we know that Cuba is not just 
 
 welcoming Naval ships, but Russian business as well.   
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, from Russia, well, with love as it were. And just take a look at this Naval ship, it's right 
 
 over my shoulder, and throughout the day, we've been seeing buses of Cubans arriving, who have been invited to tour the ship. So this is very 
 
 symbolic. There have been spy ships that have come to Cuba over the years.  
 
But it has been by my account, at least, ten years since the last official visit by a Russian Navy ship like this one, it's a military 
 
 training ship. And then it really is about sending a signal of Russian military might, not just to Cuba, but to the United States.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
OPPMANN (voice-over):  Russian warship sails into Havana. Cuba greets the ship, the Perekop, the first Russian Naval vessel to make an 
 
 official visit in years with a cannon-fired salute. It's just the latest sign of the re-forging of ties between Russia and Cuba. Well, much of 
 
 the rest of the world has denounced Russia for their invasion of Ukraine, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel seen here alongside Vladimir 
 
 Putin inaugurating a statue of Fidel Castro in Moscow in November, defends Russia's war. 
 
MIGUEL DIAZ-CANEL, PRESIDENT, CUBA (through translator):  We are condemning, we are rejecting the expansion of NATO towards Russia's 
 
 borders. He told Russia today, we condemn all the measures and sanctions that have been applied as a way to coerce the Russian federation.   
 
OPPMANN:  In Russia, increasingly is throwing a lifeline to their old ally just 90 miles from the United States.   
 
(on camera):  Since the war in Ukraine began, Russia and Cuba have signed a flurry of new agreements that would open the first supermarket 
 
 selling Russian food here, increase oil shipments to the island, even develop this beach-side community outside of Havana. It appears to be 
 
 the most significant Russian investment in Cuba in decades.  
 
(voice-over):  In February, after Russia donated 25,000 tons of wheat, Russia's then ambassador to Cuba said the aid will continue to flow. "In 
 
 spite of the challenges", he says, "Russia and Cuba continue developing their strategic relationship based on a historic friendship, solidarity 
 
 and mutual sympathy between our two countries."   
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
OPPMANN:  The warming of ties for many Cubans feels like a trip back to the future. In this video from the 1960s narrated by Fidel Castro, 
 
 Cubans are told how visiting Russian experts would modernize the island. And said Cuba grew dependent on Soviet aid. The USSR collapsed and 
 
 facing punishing U.S. economic sanctions, the island plunged into a financial abyss from which it is yet to emerge.   
 
Well, Russian officials have suggested re-establishing a military presence on the island, some analysts feel that Moscow no longer has the 
 
 capability to do so.   
 
SERGEY RADCHENKO, PROFESSOR, JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED INTERNATIONAL STUDIES:  Well, I think this kind of threats are used more 
 
 for taunting the United States, and for a kind of -- for -- it's a kind of a form of psychological warfare, kind of stand up against the United 
 
 States.   
 
OPPMANN:  Whatever the future of the renewed ties, it's clear Russia is once again staking a claim in Cuba. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)   
 
OPPMANN:  And U.S. nuclear submarine in Cuban territory last week, now, a Russian warship here this week. It's starting to feel like a page out 
 
 of the cold war. Of course, Cuba was on the frontlines of the disputes between the U.S. and the then Soviet Union. But I'm talking here to 
 
 officials about this, and they say they would be happy to have better relations with the U.S. 
 
But the facts are that the U.S. has increased sanctions on Cuba, and Russia's come with badly-needed aid. So they say it's really not a 
 
 difficult choice at all.   
 
MACFARLANE:  Yes, and it really is quite something to see the ship sitting there boldly behind you. Patrick Oppmann, appreciate your 
 
 reporting on this. Thank you. Mexican authorities say 13 people taken hostage by protesters in a crime-plagued southern state have now been 
 
 released. They say the captives included police officers, members of the National Guard and government officials.   
 
Mexico's president says the protesters were demanding the release of two suspected members of a drug-trafficking gang. Authorities say they 
 
 transparently negotiated a resolution to the hostage crisis. All right, still to come tonight, extreme heat spreads across the globe. From Italy 
 
 to parts of Asia and even the U.S. We'll have the latest.   
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
And later, stunning new images from the corners of space. We'll have a live report. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
MACFARLANE:  Welcome back. Extreme weather is ravaging communities all across Asia. In China, the state energy company hit a historic high on 
 
 Monday for single day generated power. Beijing is facing one of its hottest Summers on record with temperatures soaring past 40 degrees in 
 
 recent days. And in northern India, officials say flash flooding and landslides have left at least 41 people dead. 
 
The Dalai Lama released a statement saying he is deeply saddened about the situation in his home state which is experiencing the brunt of the 
 
 flooding. Here is CNN's Anna Coren with more.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The rolling frontline of the global climate crisis, right now stretches through Asia from Japan 
 
 and China to India. Across the continent, stifling heat is giving way to torrential rain, swelling rivers and mudslides. In northern India, 
 
 dozens of people have been killed in raging floodwaters.   
 
Bridges, cars and homes crushed in Himachal Pradesh. Roads flooded and washed away. Survivors left to pick through the wreckage.   
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  There was so much rain and flooding, it was hard to evacuate our families to a safe place because 
 
 this area was inundated with water, all our belongings were swept away by the floodwater into the river.   
 <br>[14:30:00] 
 
COREN (voice-over):  Authorities across Asia and around the world are now being forced to treat the symptoms of a climate emergency with no 
 
 immediate cure. 
 
SIMON BRADSHAW, CLIMATE COUNCIL:  This is all a harrowing warning about what is at stake and why it's so important to do everything possible to 
 
 respond to the climate crisis. 
 
COREN (voice-over):  In Japan, eight people have been killed in landslides and flooding just this month. Houses have washed away, 
 
 hospitals have flooded, electricity and water has been cut off. The downpours, the heaviest they've ever been on the mountainous island of 
 
 Kyushu, where the forecast is for more rain. 
 
BRADSHAW:  We are living in an age of consequences for the past inaction on climate change. We are seeing this playing out all over the world. 
 
 Every community is affected. But there is still so much we can do to limit future harms. 
 
COREN (voice-over):  No one nation holds the solution to the climate crisis for China. The world's largest emitter of greenhouse gas holds 
 
 more sway than most. The China Energy Investment Corporation, the world's largest coal fired power generation company, says it produced 
 
 more electricity on Monday than on any other day in the past. 
 
Hundreds of millions in China are sweltering, through what could once again be the country's hottest ever summer. And it is not just people 
 
 who need protecting as our world gets warmer -- Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the extreme weather is also hitting parts of Europe. A deadly heat wave has spread 
 
 across Italy. Temperatures could hit record levels this week reaching 45 degrees Celsius in some areas. 
 
And at least one death has been attributed to the excessive heat. A 44 - year old construction worker collapsed on the side of a road in northern Italian town of Lodi. 
 
Meanwhile, in the U.S. over 80 million people are under heat advisories as well in more than a dozen states. Remind me to set a day record high 
 
 eight times since the middle of June. 
 
Right now in southern Florida, temperatures filled between 103 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit. That is up to 45 degrees Celsius. In other, places 
 
 which were already hot by Texas and across the southwestern U.S., the temperatures will climb even further and set records. Joining us now is 
 
 CNN's Lucy Kafanov. 
 
I know you are in Phoenix, Arizona, Lucy, where they are seeing several days above that 110 degree Fahrenheit. I presume people are using the 
 
 pool behind you to cool up. 
 
But is that enough?
 
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It is not, Christina. You know this is one of the few places where the bravest residents here can come to cool 
 
 off, especially if they don't have working air conditioners or maybe a place that is comfortable indoors. 
 
But authorities are really urging people to stay inside. That is because in extreme heat like, this it prolonged extreme heat like this, 
 
 exhaustion, dehydration, those things can sneak up on you very, very quickly. 
 
The excessive heat warning is expected to last late into next week and temperatures are so high we are actually expecting the mercury to soar 
 
 past 47 degrees Celsius this weekend. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KAFANOV (voice-over):  Scorching summers may be the norm for Arizona's desert cities but the brutal heat wave engulfing Phoenix and much of the 
 
 American Southwest could be the worst on record. Cities sizzling under triple-digit temperatures with no break in sight.
 
CAPT. ROB MCDADE, PHOENIX FIRE DEPARTMENT:  This heat wave that we're experiencing right now can be fatal.
 
KAFANOV:  Firefighters are seeing a jump in calls related to heat sickness.
 
MCDADE:  You should absolutely be leery of extreme heat like this for extended days. And that's what worries us, is the long periods of time 
 
 where we just don't seem to get any relief.
 
KAFANOV:  At the Phoenix Zoo, relief for hippos and elephants came in the form of cold showers, other animals cooling down with frozen treats. 
 
 Humans, however, are being urged to stay inside. Those who have to work outdoors are taking extra precautions.
 
GRETCHEN KINSELLA, DPR CONSTRUCTION:  Where is our access to hydration?
 
Where is our access to shade?
 
When are we planning to take breaks?
 
KAFANOV:  Heat is often an invisible killer. Last year, Maricopa County recorded 425 heat related deaths, with most of the victims people 
 
 experiencing homelessness and the elderly. As one of America's hottest cities, Phoenix created a first-in-the-nation city office dedicated to 
 
 heat.
 
DAVID HONDULA, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF HEAT RESPONSE:  Heat is a really serious public health hazard. We don't talk about it as seriously as we 
 
 should all across the United States.
 
KAFANOV:  To beat the extreme temperatures, the city has opened hundreds of cooling centers and water stations.
 
SCOTT JOHNSON, PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR, THE SALVATION ARMY:  It's life saving. I mean, people are not used to this kind of thing for this many 
 
 days in a row. We have seen episodes like this from time to time. But this is one that's been extreme even by Phoenix's standards.
 
KAFANOV:  A refuge that for some could mean the difference between life and death.
 
What would it mean for you if you didn't have a place like this to go?
 
DEREK JORDAN, HOMELESS RESIDENT:  It would be death. 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
JORDAN:  I can't last very long out there. And most places, to go indoors, you have to be able to spend money, you know, and might not 
 
 have that option. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KAFANOV:  And it shows you the impact on those who are less fortunate and have fewer resources. Look, people in this part of the United States 
 
 are used to hot summers and high temperatures. 
 
What is different this time around is that the population is a lot larger and this heat wave is unprecedented in terms of its length. Right 
 
 now we have had 12 consecutive days of triple digit temperatures Fahrenheit, temperatures over 110 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 
If that continues for seven more days then Arizona will take its all- time record. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Yes, we know as you say that these temperatures are unprecedented but they have been building year on year. For the 
 
 residents in Arizona, has anybody, is anybody talking about the possibility of relocating from the state?
 
As these temperatures continue to get worse every, year is that even something that crosses people's minds at this point?
 
KAFANOV:  I mean I imagine it's something that might cross folks' minds but there is expense of picking up and moving up as well. We travel to 
 
 the state a lot for other unrelated stories that have to do with climate change, for example. The water issues are a really big problem in 
 
 Arizona. It relies on water from the Colorado River. 
 
And there's simply less of it to go around. So a lot of farmers are being forced to close up shop, to end their businesses effectively, 
 
 because they don't have enough water to farm here. 
 
In terms of the city there is actually an unincorporated residential area close to Scottsdale, close to Phoenix where we are right now, that 
 
 has completely run out of water. What those folks are doing in these weather conditions, I don't know. I probably should check up on them and 
 
 do a follow-up story. 
 
MACFARLANE:  You probably should but, to your point, I mean farm stocks, food sources, all of this is going to be impacted isn't it by these 
 
 unprecedented temperatures?
 
Lucy, we really appreciate your reporting from Arizona there. Thank you. 
 
All right, still to come tonight, Japan's prime minister calls a recent North Korean missile launch unacceptable. More ahead in a report from

MACFARLANE:  Welcome back.
 
Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas is vowing to rebuild the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank after a devastating Israeli 
 
 incursion, hailing it as an icon of struggle. 
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
MACFARLANE:  He visited Jenin for the first time in more than a decade today. His government is deeply unpopular among many Palestinians there 
 
 who view it as powerless to end Israel's occupation and deadly raids. 
 
Abbas laid a wreath for the 12 people killed in Israel's massive incursion that destroyed much of Jenin's crowded refugee camp last week. 
 
 He did not tour the destruction but addressed crowds at the camp's entrance. 
 
MAHMOUD ABBAS, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT (through translator):  The renovation of the camp must begin immediately, returning it as it 
 
 was before and better. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
Well, Israel used airstrikes an armored bulldozers in the operation saying it wanted to stop militants from using that camp as a safe haven 
 
 to launch attacks. It says all of those killed were combatants, several children are among the dead. U.N. Experts call the operation collective 
 
 punishment and say it could amount to a war crime. 
 
South Korea's president is calling for a strong international solidarity and response to North Korea's latest missile test. Pyongyang fired an 
 
 intercontinental ballistic missile of its East Coast earlier Wednesday. 
 
And the timing of the launch may be no instance. It comes as the U.S. and South Korea and Japan me to discuss security issues on the sidelines 
 
 of the NATO summit. CNN's Marc Stewart has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This latest North Korean launch is certainly attention getting, it was in the air for 74 minutes. 
 
 This is seen as a marginal advancement from previous tests this year. 
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Let's talk about the context of this all. First, it is happening at a time when there is heightened tension on the Korean 
 
 Peninsula as Washington and Seoul bolster their defense cooperation. 
 
In addition, the NATO summit is taking place in Lithuania. Leaders from South Korea, Japan and the United States are there; North Korea is 
 
 certainly a talking point. We are hearing condemnation of the launch from global leaders, including Japan's chief cabinet secretary. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Such ballistic missile launches violate relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and are a 
 
 serious security issue for our citizens. We have lodged a strong protest against North Korea, through our embassy in Beijing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART:  Wednesday's launch involved what is believed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, otherwise known as an ICBM. And it 
 
 has the range to reach the mainland United States -- Marc Stewart, CNN, Tokyo.

MACFARLANE:  Now NASA has released amazing new images from the James Webb Space Telescope in honor of its one-year anniversary. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE (voice-over): This video shows the birth of a star in a way never seen before. The images feature the closest star forming region 
 
 to, Earth just a mere 390 light years from Earth. 
 
Scientists with the James Webb telescope says the images allow them with new clarity to watch the brief period of a stellar cycle. Joining us 
 
 now, CNN correspondent Tom Foreman. 
 
Tom, no better way to mark the year anniversary than with an image like this. Just talk us through what we are seeing in the image that was 
 
 posted today.
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you're just seeing an absolute wonder; 390 million -- 390 light years away seems very far. You would 
 
 have to take a sandwich if you were going. 
 
Nonetheless, it is close by comparison and with this telescope, which focuses on infrared signals coming out of there, they're able to get 
 
 pictures of this birthing place of stars, about 50 of them being formed in this little cluster with nothing in between, nothing to interfere. 
 
So we are getting some of the clearest pictures ever and some of these actually have the little discs around them, which indicate the formation 
 
 of solar systems, which have other planets and all the stars in this image, about the size of our sun, maybe a little bit smaller. 
 
MACFARLANE:  It's so stunning to look At and so beautiful but so impactful.
 
How transformative has the Webb telescope been to our understanding of the cosmos, just even over the past year that it's been in operation?
 
FOREMAN:  Oh, really much more than anybody thought when they were launching it. It's outperformed what was expected. Let's see some of the 
 
 other images that come up in here. 
 
The image of a proto-star, it looks like an hourglass of exploding gases out in space out there. Those gases are actually both exploding from the 
 
 star being formed and being drawn in toward it, giving us more insights as to how stars form. 
 
We've been able to look out to the edge of the galaxy, get a sense of how much earlier solar systems were forming out there, galaxies were 
 
 forming, to the edge of the galaxy and the edge of the universe. 
 
We're looking way out there and we can probably look even further. We've got unprecedented images of Jupiter, showing us the faint rings around 
 
 Jupiter and some of the maybe 80 to 90 moons around Jupiter. We've even been able to get unprecedented images of Neptune. 
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
FOREMAN:  Way out there, the furthest one out from our sun in our solar system, giving us glimpses into its existence out there and what's going 
 
 on. So it really has been a year of just extraordinary images that are dazzling to see, in part because of the overall performance of the Webb 
 
 telescope. 
 
But also in the way it interacts with the knowledge we already have. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Presumably, during all this time, we've also learned more about the capabilities of the telescope itself. 
 
How much has that broadened expectations among scientists?
 
Is there a bucket list now of what they're looking for, knowing what the telescope could do?
 
FOREMAN:  In a simple sense, I would say the bucket list is farther, farther, farther. They want to see how far they can push this thing out 
 
 and still get information back because it is getting extraordinarily detailed information. 
 
Again, a lot of these images you see don't come in as images like that. They come in as a lot of data that is combined with a lot of other data 
 
 that is then rendered into images, something that we can comprehend and that we can see. 
 
Undoubtedly, not a doubt in the world, this is already giving us insights into how this universe was formed, how galaxies form, how solar 
 
 systems form, all of which gives us a pretty good look at our own past, in a way that we have just never, ever had before. 
 
Every time I see a new picture from here, I just get excited because it's something that humankind has never viewed. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Yes, it speaks to our very origin, it doesn't?
 
Tom, it's always a delight to speak to you on everything space. Thank you very much. 
 
FOREMAN:  Good talking to. You 
 
MACFARLANE:  We'll be right back, after this quick break. Stay with us.

MACFARLANE:  We are turning now to news from the U.K. The wife of BBC's Huw Edwards has named him as the presenter who has been suspended. In a 
 
 statement, she said, Edwards had been suffering from serious mental health issues and is now receiving hospital care. 
 
London's Met Police said there is no indication of a criminal offense. Huw Edwards' wife released this statement a short while ago. 
 
She said, "In light of the recent reporting regarding the BBC presenter, I am making the statement on behalf of my husband, Huw Edwards after 
 
 what have been five extremely difficult days for our family. 
 
"I'm doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children. 
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
MACFARLANE:  "Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues as is well documented. He has been treated for severe depression in recent 
 
 years. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters. 
 
"He has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving inpatient hospital care, where he'll stay for the foreseeable future. Once well 
 
 enough to do, so he intends to respond to the stories that have been published. 
 
"To be clear, Huw was first told that there were allegations being made against him last Thursday. In the circumstances and given Huw's 
 
 condition, I would like to ask that the privacy of my family and everyone else caught up in these upsetting events is respected. 
 
"I know that Huw is deeply sorry that so many colleagues have been impacted by the recent media speculation. We hope this statement will 
 
 bring an end to that." 
 
Scott McLean is following this and joins me here now. 
 
Scott, we know this has been a story that's been building in the U.K. press for many days now following the publication of these allegations 
 
 in "The Sun" newspaper. Just tell us what more we know at this point.
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this is a story that the British press has gone wall-to-wall with. You'll see it on any news channel 
 
 that's on. You'll see it on the cover of every newspaper for the last several days. 
 
It's been like that, in part, because it was, basically, an open secret about who these allegations were referring to. The name was widely 
 
 circulated online. Now we have confirmation from Huw Edward's wife, that it is in fact him. 
 
Also because of the seriousness of the initial allegations, even though the evidence that "The Sun" actually presented when they initially made 
 
 these allegations was extremely thin. Now you have the Metropolitan Police in London, whom the BBC had asked to investigate, quickly turning 
 
 around and saying that there is no evidence of criminal activity. 
 
I'll read you part of their statement. 
 
They said that the special -- The Met specialist crime command have now concluded their assessment and have determined that there's no 
 
 information to indicate that a criminal offense has been committed. 
 
They've spoken to a number of parties, including the BBC, the alleged complainant and the complainant's family, both by another police force. 
 
 There is no further police action. 
 
So basically, they're saying the BBC can go ahead and carry on with its internal investigation. But it raises the question for the tabloids in 
 
 this country and also for the broader British press about what precisely the wrongdoing is that's being alleged. 
 
There is no evidence that anything has been criminal thus far. Perhaps immoral; we don't know. We need to know more, based on what the BBC will 
 
 find, more allegations that will come out. 
 
But it is remarkable how quickly this story has grown into a frenzy, with all of the speculation about who and what was done. Now here we are 
 
 with more of a varied picture. 
 
One point about Huw Edwards' mental health. The wife rightly points out, this has been well documented in the media house, his struggles. In 
 
 fact, he said that, at one point, things got so bad that he couldn't even get himself out of bed. 
 
MACFARLANE:  And to your point, we'll have to wait and see what comes of that, out of that internal investigation. We know the BBC are now 
 
 undertaking or have been undertaking. 
 
It does seem, as though the BBC have stumbled, of, late from one crisis into the next. The director general, Tim Davies, has struggled to manage 
 
 these crises. The BBC are a state broadcaster; this individual, Huw Edwards, is very much a beloved figure and a central figure of the BBC. 
 
So knowing what we know at the stage, where does this leave the BBC?
 
MCLEAN:  You're right, Huw Edwards is one of the most famous faces in journalism in this country, if not the most famous. And just put it into 
 
 context, when the queen died, last fall, it was Huw Edwards that was on air to broadcast the news. 
 
He led the coverage of the coronation. Virtually any big news event over the last few decades, Huw Edwards has been there at the forefront of. 
 
 It, sort of guiding the country through. It he's famous for his Election Night coverage. 
 
But surely, the BBC is breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief at this point, given the allegations do not contain, at least based on what the 
 
 police are saying thus far, anything that is criminal. 
 
But there will surely still be questions for the BBC about their initial handling of this, considering that this complaint was initially made 
 
 back in May. It was passed up to their corporate investigations team; they tried to call. Apparently the call did not connect. They didn't 
 
 bother to call a second time. 
 
They emailed; the email was not replied. Essentially, they set it aside after that. Certainly, not the kind of journalistic rigor that we would 
 
 expect of those kind of allegations. 
 
It was only once "The Sun" newspaper came to the BBC saying, they were going to publish this, suddenly this investigation got quite serious. 
 
 And these allegations were passed on to the police. 
 
But the BBC says the allegations that they received at that point were of a different nature than the original ones. But surely, this will 
 
 raise questions about the BBC's internal handling of things. Obviously, as you mentioned as well, there have been --
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
MCLEAN:  -- scandals in the bad press for the BBC in the past, involving their most highly paid football or soccer broadcaster; about the 
 
 chairman of the BBC as well. So this is just one more thing to add to the pile. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Still, many outstanding questions. We will wait to hear more on this in the days to come. Scott McLean, thank you. 
 
Now something totally different to end the show. The stage is set for the women's semifinal showdown at Wimbledon. Defending champion, Elena 
 
 Rybakina, was ousted by the 6 seed Ons Jabeur. She'll take on the Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka on Thursday. 
 
The first semifinal to take center stage will be a match against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina and Czech player Marketa Vondrousova, a 
 
 fitting end to the Wimbledon on a wild card, knocked out by the world number one to reach the grand slam semifinal, for just the third time in 
 
 her career. Svitolina gives credit to an unlikely source for making her stronger. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELINA SVITOLINA, UKRAINIAN TENNIS PLAYER:  I think war made me stronger. And also, made me like mentally stronger. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE:  Looking forward to those semifinals tomorrow. 
 
All right, thanks for watching tonight. Stay with CNN, "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS" is coming up next.
