JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR: Lebanese Ministry of Health says more than 180 people have been killed today and CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Northern Israel for us. Jeremy, you just heard air raid sirens where you are. What can you tell us?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, very close to us, Jim. We saw multiple rocket interceptions by the Iron Dome system and that system has been working overtime across Northern Israel as we have been seeing rockets coming in from Hezbollah on the ground, further south than they typically do, near Haifa, a major population center where there is also a major Israeli airbase, the Ramat David Airbase.
 
And then, all across here, a little bit further north in the Galilee, we have also been hearing a number of rocket sirens. This as the Israeli military is conducting the most intense bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon since the beginning of this conflict. And it is also the deadliest day, we should add for Lebanon since October 8th, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Northern Israel and Israel began responding in turn with airstrikes throughout Lebanon.
 
More than -- at least 182 people are dead, more than 700 people are injured in Lebanon as of now, but that death toll is very likely to continue to rise. And that's because the Israeli military has just begun expanding that air campaign from Southern Lebanon, where they were striking earlier today to the eastern part of Lebanon, known as the Beqaa Valley, where Hezbollah is believed to have brought in many of its munitions and weaponry of via Syria from Iran originally.
 
Earlier today, the Israeli military ordering -- or urging, we should say, civilians in Lebanon in that area of the Beqaa Valley. to begin evacuating from their homes, in particular, according to the Israeli military spokesman, if they know that there are weapons in their homes or near their homes. In many cases, though, civilians in these neighborhoods may not be aware of Hezbollah weapon stashes in those areas, and certainly just giving a couple hours' notice for civilians to evacuate may at times be impractical and difficult for those warnings to be heeded, as we have seen so many times before in the Gaza Strip.
 
What is clear is that the Israeli government has made a decision now to continue driving up this ladder of escalation to attack Hezbollah targets no longer in the kind of tit for tat that we have been seeing for much of the last year, but rather trying to deal a very decisive blow to Hezbollah in an effort to effectively cow Hezbollah into submission to stop firing rockets into Northern Israel.
 
So, far, at least, it is only resulting in Hezbollah escalating its rockets -- rocket attacks on Northern Israel. So, we will see where this is going. But we are heading towards a very dangerous place at this hour, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Jeremy Diamond, please keep us posted as things develop. We appreciate it. Let's bring in Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland. He chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He also serves as a U.S. representative to this year's U.N. General Assembly.
 
Senator, I have a suspicion that it's going to be busy for you in New York this week. What's your reaction to what we're seeing in Lebanon this morning?
 
SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD), U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND FOREIGN RELATIONS CHAIRMAN:  Well, Jim, first, it's good to be with you. We recognize that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. They have sent missiles into Israel targeting civilian populations. Hezbollah, like Hamas, are enabled by Iran.
 
Our objective in trying to de-escalate the conflict is to move forward with an opportunity for a ceasefire and return of the hostages from Gaza and then to have the regional security arrangements so that the Palestinians and Israelis can live together in peace. So, it starts with trying to get this off ramp in Gaza, but we recognize Israel has a right to defend itself.
 
ACOSTA:  And Lebanon's prime minister is calling on the U.N. to pressure Israel to rein in these airstrikes. The U.S. has already asked Israel to de-escalate. That has not happened. How big of a part of the conversation will that be at the UN this week?
 
CARDIN:  Well, we hope to also have a focus in the United Nations on Iran, which is enabling these terrorist organizations. It would be nice for the United Nations to spend some time recognizing that Iran has enabled the terrorist activities by Hezbollah, by Hamas, by the Houthis. There's so many organizations operating because of Iran. We'd like to see more of a focus on Iran.
 
ACOSTA:  And do you think Israel is preparing for a wider conflict, an escalation of what it's doing right now? Is that possible?
 
CARDIN:  We expect Israel will defend itself, but an escalation of the conflict is not in Israel's interest, not in the United States' interest. We want to see a de-escalation of the conflict, and we want to see the countries in the region come together and isolate Iran so that the Israelis and Palestinians can live with security in the region, respecting each other's rights. That's our objective, that's what we're going to work on, and that message will be delivered here at the United Nations by this senator. [10:35:00]
 
ACOSTA:  And President Biden is due to address the General Assembly tomorrow. It's going to be one of his last major appearances on the world stage. Last address to the U.N. General Assembly. What do you expect that message to be? I assume some of it will be -- much of it will be about this conflict you and I are discussing right now.
 
CARDIN:  I think the president will challenge the United Nations by when we come together, we can solve world problems. He'll point out that how we came together in regards to the COVID pandemic. Now, we need to come together in regards to isolating the terrorist organizations and their enablers.
 
Look, we have a lot of hot spots in the world from Ukraine to the Middle East. I hope he also will mention Sudan. It doesn't get the attention, but there's a critical need in Sudan. The warring factions are causing a humanitarian crisis. We need to put a spotlight on Sudan.
 
ACOSTA:  Now, I do want to ask you one other quick question on Israel. It might be a bit indelicate. But do you think that there is a recognition the part of the Israelis that Kamala Harris' campaign could be damaged if this war escalates in October? You know, here we are right before the month of October heading into this presidential election in places like Michigan. Is that even on the minds of the Israelis and should it be
 
CARDIN:  You know, international events are occurring. I don't think they're directed towards American politics. The timing of elections are always inconvenient in regards to international events. The Biden- Harris administration has an excellent record of trying to engage the International Community to calm things down. They're doing that right now in the Middle East.
 
Quite frankly, I think the way that the Biden-Harris administration has been able to get the International Community to help Ukraine to deal with some of the crisis we have around the world works to the advantage of Vice President Harris' campaign.
 
ACOSTA:  I do want to ask you about Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, will be at the U.N. this week. He's also expected to present to President Biden and other leaders, his blueprint to defeat Russia. Zelenskyy says this fall will determine the outcome of that war. What's your sense of things right now when it comes to how Ukraine is defending itself right now against the Russians? In particular that recent incursion into Russia. Is that part of the Zelenskyy victory plan?
 
CARDIN:  Well, I met with President Zelenskyy two weeks ago. I will meet with him again later today. He will point out the need for help in regards to Ukraine defending itself from Russian missile attacks. He wants longer-range missiles. We'll talk about that. It will help him in regards to finding an off ramp so there can be a secured Ukraine sovereignty protected. We strongly support Ukraine. We'll give him that message again today. We'll listen to his plans. I give him a lot of credit for the courage that he has demonstrated, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated standing up against Russia and his willingness to find a way forward for peace with Russia.
 
So, Russia is the aggressor. Russia should remove all of its troops from Ukraine. President Zelenskyy is showing tremendous courage. He's made progress, but there's still challenges.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Senator Ben Cardin, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. You'll be busy this week. We appreciate the time. Thanks so much.
 
CARDIN:  Thank you.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Coming up, police are still searching for the people behind a mass shooting in Birmingham, Alabama. That's where we find CNN's Rafael Romo. Rafael.
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Jim, authorities here in Birmingham significantly increased the reward money for information leading to the capture of the suspects. We'll have the full information coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
ACOSTA:  Right now, police are looking for at least one shooter who opened fire Saturday in Birmingham, Alabama. Four people were killed and 17 others were hurt. Officials say the weapons may have been illegally modified to operate as machine guns. Police believe the shooters had a specific target and that most of the victims were caught in the crossfire. Here's what the police chief just said moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHIEF SCOTT THURMOND, BIRMINGHAM, AL POLICE:  Here's the kind of unfortunate side of that. There were some individuals that we kind of talked about a few minutes ago that had criminal pasts. If you're not at a criminal game or that criminal circle, you probably don't have anything to worry about.
 
Just quite -- you know, there were some innocent victims we know that were injured at the mass shooting. But the crux of the people who were targeted had criminal histories. And unfortunately, being in that lifestyle, you know, that culture and things, unfortunately, ended in their demise.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  CNN's Rafael Romo is in Birmingham for us. Rafael, what else do police know? And I understand you're hearing from a survivor. What can you tell us? ROMO:  Yes, that's right, Jim. In the last few minutes, the FBI announced that it will offer a $50,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction of any individual or individuals responsible for Saturday's mass shooting.
 
Special agent in charge, Carlton Peoples, said. This reward is being offered to incentivize, he said, the public to come forward with information to solve this case. Add to that amount an additional $50,000 being offered by crime stoppers, and you get $100,000 in reward. Mayor Randall Woodfin said, quote, "We cannot give safe harbor or shelter to people who simply just want to kill other people.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
We also heard from Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmond who said that his department has received a significant number of tips since the shooting. He also said, Birmingham police are getting tremendous help from the FBI and other federal agencies. Thurman also gave an update regarding the 17 people who were injured in the shooting, he said, 12 of those have been released from the hospital.
 
One of them is a 24-year-old man who happened to be standing in line outside an establishment where the Birmingham's Five Points south area here when the shooting started, it was Saturday night just after 11:00, and the place was crowded with people just trying to have a good time. All of a sudden, he said, a group of men arrived in a vehicle, got out, opened fire and then fled in the same car, leaving three people dead at the scene and one more who died later in the hospital, then an additional 17 other -- others injured, including Gabriel Eslami. This is how he described the horrifying moments after the shooting.

GABRIEL ESLAMI, GUNSHOT VICTIM:  The thought of me being shot wasn't even in my mind yet. Because, you know, you're like, how could that happen to me? You know, So, I get up and I kind of turn around and look. And it's literally a horror movie. There's bodies just laid out all over the sidewalk. There's gun smoke in the air. There's people's, you know, shoes, that they ran out of their shoes trying to escape.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO:  And, Jim, Birmingham police has identified all four victims. They included a last name to the list. His name was released this morning as 26-year-old Roderick Lynn Patterson Jr. Jim, back to you.
 
ACOSTA:  Just awful. All right. Rafael Romo, hopefully, that reward money will help bring about a break in that case. Thank you so much.
 
Coming up, embattled North Carolina candidate for governor Mark Robinson has a fiery response to CNN after our explosive investigation. That's ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
ACOSTA:  Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs survived a late comeback in Atlanta. Lots of Falcon fans are crying foul over a controversial no call. CNN's Carolyn Manno joins us now. The Falcons just can't catch a break, my goodness, with Kirk Cousins, and the Chiefs look like they're just heading towards a three peat I just -- you know, I can't believe it.
 
CAROLYN MANNO:  I was going to say such as life for a Falcons fan, right?
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, that's true.
 
MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  I mean, you think about what the Chiefs have done, though, Jim. I mean, they've won their three games by a combined 13 points. So, it hasn't been pretty, but the defensive has been there. Patrick Mahomes shaking off an interception to throw a pair of touchdown passes. The Falcons able to stay close in the fourth quarter of this game. They were down by five with just over four minutes left to play.
 
And you mentioned Kirk Cousins, the Atlanta quarterback, throwing to Kyle Pitts, a tight end on fourth down. Drawing that heavy contact from Chief Safety Brian Cook, there wasn't a pass interference flag thrown and the Falcons got the ball back for one more drive in the final minute. Once again, Kansas City's defense rising to the occasion, stopping Bijan Robinson for a three -yard loss on the fourth and one. The Chiefs winning a nail biter, 22-17 the final.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PATRICK MAHOMES, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS QUARTERBACK:  It was a team effort. I mean, that's how this season's been. We've been in these moments before. We're going to try to not have them every single week. But I'm glad anytime we get a win and we get to fly home and we'll have a tough opponent this next week. So, we'll get ready for it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MANNO:  The Vikings also improving to a perfect 3 and 0 with the dominant win over the Texans. Minnesota quarterback Sam Darnold matching his career high with four touchdown passes in the 34 to 7 win. It was the biggest margin of victory for the Vikings in five years.
 
And week three comes to a close tonight with a Monday night doubleheader starting with a matchup between the 2 and 0 Buffalo Bills and the 0 and 2 Jacksonville Jaguars. Kickoff set for 7:30 Eastern. Then it's a game that Jim has been waiting for all week, the Washington Commanders and their flashy rookie Jayden Daniels on the road to face Joe Burrow in the Bengals. This is a rare meeting between Heisman winners from the same school, Jim. Looking forward to it?
 
ACOSTA:  I can't -- I cannot wait. I'm so nervous. I kind of wish that these games were -- the Commanders to play on Sundays because I know I'm going to be up all night if -- win or lose. But we're very excited about Jayden Daniels in Washington. No question about it. All right.
 
MANNO:  Good luck tonight.
 
ACOSTA:  Carolyn Manno, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. We'll be right back.

ACOSTA:  Thank you all for joining me this morning. And I want to welcome Pamela Brown. There she is right there, who is now anchoring our 11:00 a.m. hour. First of all, welcome.
 
PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR:  Thank you. What an honor it is to be anchoring the 11:00 show after you, Jim, really a dream come true. And thanks of course, to Wolf Blitzer, my amazing colleague with that touching handoff Friday.
 
Really, it's amazing, Jim. I mean, we were together covering the Trump White House together, then on the weekends, back-to-back shows. And here we are weekdays, 10:00, 11:00, back-to-back for a package deal, whether you like it or not.
