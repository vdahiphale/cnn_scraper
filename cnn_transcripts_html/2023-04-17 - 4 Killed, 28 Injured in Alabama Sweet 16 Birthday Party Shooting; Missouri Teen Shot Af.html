CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Green's attorney tells me they plan on moving forward with seeking parole in the coming months. As for clemency, that requires the support of Governor Ron DeSantis, as well as two out of three cabinet members, and one of them is Florida's attorney general. Guys?
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Man, what a story. It just -- it doesn't seem right but we'll see what happens. Carlos, thank you, I appreciate it.
 
CNN This Morning continues right now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LEMON:  The start of the Dominion/Fox News defamation trial abruptly delayed until tomorrow.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Settlement would avoid weeks of further embarrassment for Fox, including testimony by its highest profile stars and executives.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's something about being on the eve of trial that can really sober up both parties. It's a reality.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  Another mass shooting this time at an Alabama sweet 16 birthday party.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It appeared that someone just started firing from within, and then he just saw the bodies of teenagers dropping.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to do exactly what we need to do to ensure justice is brought to those families.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  These children had very great features. They just wanted to have fun.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The blame game continues in Sudan over who exactly is responsible for this fresh round of violence.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The majority of fighting is happening in the capital of Khartoum, as the country's army and a paramilitary group fight for control. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People in Sudan want democracy. Sudan needs to return to that path.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Kansas City community protests after 16- year-old Ralph Yarl was shot.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is not something that has been dismissed. But, anyway, this is something that is getting the full attention of the Kansas City Police Department.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm listening and I understand the concern that we are receiving from the community.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That right there is a lot of hate. This right here is a lot of love.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  SpaceX eyeing a nine am testified at its most powerful rocket ever.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Starship rocket system is the centerpiece of must goal of commercial space travel to Mars.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To think that humans will be walking on Mars in 20 years is completely reasonable.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
LEMON:  Can you imagine?
 
HARLOW:  We were just saying to think 20 years --
 
LEMON:  Would you go?
 
HARLOW:  No. But it's still amazing.
 
LEMON:  I think I would.
 
HARLOW:  My (INAUDIBLE) at seven years old talks about living on Mars one day. Isn't that incredible that they're actually, it maybe it will happen in her lifetime.
 
Good morning, everyone. We're glad you're with us.
 
LEMON:  Future is now the future is now.
 
HARLOW:  but we are focusing very closely on what is happening in this small town in Alabama that has become the scene of one of the latest deadly mass shootings in America. Police say four people were killed in 28 others injured during a sweet 16 birthday party at a dance studio in Dadeville. This happened on Saturday night, and investigators still have not released any details about a possible motive or suspect.
 
Yesterday night, the community held this vigil outside of the church. They hugged each other. They cried together. They prayed, and this morning, we're learning more about the victims. Among the dead, a high school football player who was about to graduate and playing college. His sister was the birthday girl.
 
Isabel Rosales is live at the scene of the shooting. Isabel, thanks for being with us again this hour. So many questions this morning, especially about this investigation.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Poppy, so many questions, and that's been a part of the frustration with so many here that I've spoken with, they want to know more about what exactly happened at this dance studio right behind me. And they are saying that they're not getting these answers from law enforcement.
 
We did have a press conference and heard from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency who claim there is no public safety risk. But as you mentioned there, they have not answered any questions as to the status of the shooter or shooters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are village that will come together.
 
ROSALES (voice over):  Hundreds gathered in Dadeville, Alabama, Sunday evening, seeking solace --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We will never be the same.
 
ROSALES:  -- and answers --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Heavenly Father, we come before you, Lord, with trouble in our hearts? Father, we have questions on our mind.
 
ROSALES:  -- after shots rang out at a weekend sweet 16 party.
 
SGT. JEREMY J. BURKETT, ALABAMA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY:  There are still four lives lost. Four lives were lost in the tragic event that occurred here and Dadeville. As far as the injuries, there are 28 individuals that were injured during the course of the incident.
 
ROSALES:  On Sunday, hospital officials said at least 15 teenagers were treated for gunshot wounds, including several who are in critical condition.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There wasn't a fight. They started shooting.
 
ROSALES:  One of the victims killed was Philstavious Dowdell, a stellar high school football player and the brother of the birthday girl. His coach at first in disbelief.
 
MICHAEL TAYLOR, COACH, DADEVILLE HIGH SCHOOL:  It can't be true. It cannot be true.
 
ROSALES:  Michael Taylor, describing Dowdell as a dedicated and gifted athlete.
 
TAYLOR:  Phil just actually got a scholarship to play football that Jacksonville State University.
 <br>[07:05:04]
 
ROSALES:  A second victim has also been identified by family as Kiki Smith, also a senior in high school and the student manager of the track team looking forward to attending the University of Alabama.
 
TENEESHIA GOODMAN-JOHNSON, DADEVILLE COUNCIL MEMBER:  These children have very bright futures, the ones that I knew from Dadeville, very, very athletic, very humble children, very respectful children, smart.
 
ROSALES:  As the investigation continues, police have not released any information about the assailant or a possible motive.
 
CHIEF JONATHAN L. FLOYD DADEVILLE POLICE:  What we've dealt with is something that no community should have to endure. I just ask for your patience.
 
ROSALES:  They're asking for the community's help.
 
BURKETT:  I cannot stress this enough, every how manner you think it is, absolutely need you to share it.
 
ROSALES:  As the stunned town of Dadeville, grieves, another American city rocked by gun violence.
 
Could you ever imagine an act of violence like this happening in Dadeville?
 
TAYLOR:  Never, don't happen. We don't have gun violence, you know what I mean? Unreal, still unreal.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSALES (on camera):  And President Joe Biden reacting to this mass shooting, issuing a statement Sunday, part of it reading, what has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear? This is outrageous and unacceptable. Guys?
 
HARLOW:  It is, all of those things. Isabel, thanks very much for being there.
 
LEMON:  Meantime this morning, Kansas City, Missouri, bracing for more protests after a homeowner shot and wounded a 16-year-old boy who accidentally went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. Ralph Yarl's siblings were at 115th Terrace but he mistakenly went to a house 115th Street instead. The shooter was taken into custody in place on a 24-hour hold, then released while police investigate.
 
Now, Yarl is recovering in the hospital, in stable condition. His aunt says that he had been looking forward to graduating high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, where he hopes to major in chemical engineering. His aunt also says that he is in the sectional -- he is the section leader in a marching band, a scholar and one of the top bass clarinet players in Missouri, and we wish him well. We wish a recovery. That's that photo that the world is seeing of him this morning with the bass clarinet that he loved so much. We hope he is going to be okay.
 
LEMON:  Yes, and gets to play the clarinet once again.
 
HARLOW:  All right. Well, let's surprise twist just hours before Fox News was set to go on trial for defamation. A judge has delayed opening statements until tomorrow. The Wall Street Journal reports the network is trying to settle this lawsuit before trial.
 
LEMON:  So, Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion. Dominion has accused the network of spreading lies and conspiracy theories about the company and its voting machines after Donald Trump lost the election, even though Fox News hosts and executives allegedly knew that they were false.
 
And some analysts have already dubbed this the media trial of the century. Rupert Murdoch and a whole lineup of Fox News stars, including Tucker Carlson, are expected to testify if the trial moves forward.
 
CNN Media Analyst Sara Fischer live outside the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. Good morning to you, Sara.
 
So, you were all ready to go. Everybody is already to go, report, to get ready to do the trial, and then all of a sudden nothing. Sources are saying that, in this case, it is being reported that maybe Fox is looking for a settlement but will Dominion accept it? What is going on with the delay?
 
SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST:  Well, we're going to find out more at 9:00 A.M., Don, because the judge will allow reporters in so he can explain a little bit more about the delay. Now, if Fox were to settle, that would set a huge precedent for a lot of the other defamation cases that it faces. You'll know it, they face a $2.7 billion defamation case from Smartmatic.
 
So, its settlement might be advantageous because they could avoid a huge spectacle here in court. We would avoid being here for six weeks covering a trial, but it would put Fox in a little bit of a precarious legal situation.
 
Now, to your point at the top, Dominion has been holding fast to its claims. It has not wanted to settle because it believes, and legal experts believe that it has a strong case. But if we don't get a settlement within the next 24 hours, Don, we will be back here for the finalization of the jury selection for this trial and the opening statements as it begins.
 
HARLOW:  Can we move on and talk, Sara, also about Google, and A.I. and this just remarkable interview last night on 60 Minutes, because that has just terrifying people? I want everyone to listen to this exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Scott Pelley.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE:  There is an aspect of this which we call all of us in the field, call it as a black box. You know, you don't fully understand. And you can't quite tell why it said this or why it got wrong.
 <br>[07:10:02]
 
We have some ideas and our ability to understand this gets better over time, but that's where the state of the art is.
 
SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS ANCHOR:  You don't fully understand how it works and yet you've turned it loose on society?
 
PICHAI:  Let me put it this way. I don't think we fully understand how human mind works either.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  What should we take away from that?
 
LEMON:  Yikes.
 
FISCHER:  Well, in a separate interview, Sundar Pichai said that they were in a rush to get this out in part because of the consumer demand around generative A.I., but it does pose some questions, Poppy and Don, about the risk that these technologies pose when we're introducing them and rolling them out. As smart as this stuff is, the smarter it gets, the more dangerous it gets.
 
And you heard that in the interview with the CEO of Google, even he says, he can't fully understand how it works. It kind of harkens back to where we are today here in Delaware. You have this interesting time where information landscape is changing so rapidly, it's hard for us to all wrap our minds around it.
 
HARLOW:  And Scott Pelley did ask him about disseminating more disinformation because of A.I., right, and that goes to sort of the core of like the case that may go to trial there this week, disinformation, misinformation, lies, et cetera.
 
I spoke to Sundar Pichai, this was in 2019, about A.I. So, this was four years ago, and here's what he told me then.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PICHAI:  We may need to slow down some development in some areas. But I think it creates jobs in the way people don't expect either.
 
HARLOW:  Slow down some developments?
 
PICHAI:  Sometimes. You know, we may say, well, if it is going to be very disruptive in a certain area, you may want to be more thoughtful that the pace at which something happens.
 
HARLOW:  But that's not something I would expect to see of Google to say. I mean you are basically saying we have to weigh our technological advancement and competitiveness with what it means for humanity.
 
PICHAI:  Absolutely. And I think it's important and I think it's important, that's what society expects us to do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  That's what society expects us to do. But now look at the competition they're up against with Microsoft's A.I. Where do you think this goes?
 
FISCHER:  I remember that interview well, Poppy, because it felt explosive to me. You very rarely hear tech CEOs saying that they need to slow their role when it comes to innovation because it is a very competitive landscape.
 
I think the difference between now and then is that, one, they have a huge competitor and open A.I. that's starting to roll this stuff out commercially and to the public, and then, two, you also are at a time when tech stocks, even though, they're rallying in 2023, saw a huge loss in 2022. Google, of course, had sweeping layoffs along with other companies in the tech sector. They're likely feeling that competitive pressure.
 
LEMON:  Sara, so, you're waiting for Dominion right now to see what happens. So, any idea you said we're just -- all you do now is wait for the judge tomorrow? That's it?
 
FISCHER:  Well, we're going to see what he says at 9:00 A.M. and then we're going to wait and see if there is any sort of settlement news between now and then. If there isn't, we will be going into court tomorrow at 9:00 A.M. for that jury finalization and for the trial to start and then it will look like we'll be here for several weeks.
 
LEMON:  Yes, there's a lot that could happen between now and then. And so we'll check that again at 9:00 A.N., if not, before with Sara Fischer. Sara, thank you so much.
 
Now to the Pentagon leak investigation, the 21-year-old Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira is scheduled to return to court on Wednesday. His arrest last week is raising questions about how the military handles top secret clearances. So, here's House Intel Chairman Mike Turner. Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  The access that he was having to this information should have been cut off. He should have never been having access to this level of classified information that could hurt the United States.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON:  So, former Homeland Security Official Juliette Kayyem, who oversaw the base where Jack Teixeira worked, writes this, I am at a loss to explain why a 21-year-old member of the state intelligence wing who does not appear to have been working in any federal capacity would need access to that kind of materials whose release has so unnerved the Pentagon.
 
HARLOW:  Juliette is with us now, and we should note for people, this is sort of hard for me to believe, from 2006 to 2009, you ran this space where he worked. You oversaw the Massachusetts Air National Guard. So, you have a real understanding of what they do. Why would he have this kind of security clearance?
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Right. So, serving as homeland security adviser, I mean, the governor is the decider, but served Governor Deval Patrick at the time, so oversaw the National Guard, their planning. So, we have the state National Guard, which reports to the governor. We have a lot of federal facilities in Massachusetts, including at this Air Force wing and the men and women in the National Guard serve in the state capacity.
 
But some of them, and this is what we don't know yet or what we call federalized, they're put into Title 10 status and work essentially for the Pentagon. And I have to say that's probably what happened here. But the Pentagon has been quiet about what his status was.
 <br>[07:15:03]
 
HARLOW:  Right. But top secret, right, a lot of people --
 
KAYYEM:  That's a lot of people.
 
HARLOW:  1.25 million people have this clearance?
 
KAYYEM:  Yes. So, I'll break it down for you. So, it is a lot of people. The top secret clearance is simply the disclosure of the information that they have would cause sort of grievous harm to the United States' interests. Most of them are government. But they are not just the Intelligence Community. They are -- think about the commerce department and some of the stuff that they're working state and local governments, some of them in the NYPD. Some of them would have access to classified information.
 
Then you have our contractors and a lot of them are the people building the planes and the networks that keep us safe. And then other is sort of your catch all at this stage, but it would include private citizens and others who may have it.
 
HARLOW:  I would just note in 2019, he would have been about 19 years old getting this clearance.
 
KAYYEM:  Yes, exactly. That's exactly.
 
HARLOW:  In terms of access, what's interesting is one defense official told CNN this. It's not like a regular I.T. guy. Teixeira was not like your regular I.T. guy where you call the desk and they can fix your computer. They're working on a highly classified system, so they require that clearance.
 
KAYYEM:  Yes. So, they require the clearance because he's essentially a pass through. So, if anything were to happen, he may be exposed to the information. But he doesn't need to know the content. He's not doing anything with the content.
 
So, the way I describe it is sort of my background. So, I had top secret when I was in government. I didn't have access to everything. There'd be no reason for me. So, I would know, say, that there was a terrorism threat. I wouldn't need to know what are the sources of methods that they found out or that we had a spy in a terrorist organization.
 
It appears that he had access to all of that and then takes it out. So, that's the -- the access question is one and then his handling of it is another, exactly.
 
HARLOW:  But I just keep coming back to your point exactly, which is just because you have the clearance, it doesn't mean you need to get all this stuff. Couldn't it be shared on a need to know basis?
 
KAYYEM:  That's exactly right. And I guess, you know, what we don't know yet is did he need access to all of it simply because of his role as essentially an I.T. pass through, and then that's something that the Defense Department is going to have to determine whether that's actually smart, does he actually need -- do those people actually need access?
 
The Pentagon is going to have to get this in line and whether he was in National Guard status or federal status because this sensitive information and how we get the information. And now that it's disclosed is not only a threat to us, our allies are looking at us and thinking, you know, what the heck.
 
HARLOW:  Why do we want to share?
 
KAYYEM:  Yes, exactly.
 
HARLOW:  What do we want to say? Juliette, thank you very much, fascinating.
 
KAYYEM:  Thank you.
 
HARLOW:  The House Judiciary Committee is taking a field trip and holding a hearing right here in New York City on crime. How city officials are responding, next.
 
LEMON:  Plus, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis banning certain books from libraries and restricting abortion after six weeks, why he is now losing the support of a Republican mega donor, ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:20:00]
 
HARLOW:  This morning, Congress back in session after a two-week recess. Lawmakers set to face a fast approaching deadline to address, the debt ceiling.
 
Also today, the House Judiciary Committee chaired by Trump ally Jim Jordan will be holding a field hearing here in New York City targeting District Attorney Alvin Bragg. It comes just over two weeks after the former president was indicted in connection to Bragg's investigation into Trump's alleged role in a hush money payments scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels.
 
According to the committee, today's hearing will zero in on how Bragg's, quote, pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.
 
CNN's Sara Murray live outside the Javits Federal Building in New York City with the very latest on this. Good morning, Sara.
 
This is just the latest in a growing feud between Bragg and Jordan. What is today going to look like? Please tell us.
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORESPONDENT:  We are going to see an escalation of that here today. I mean, Republicans on this committee are seeking to highlight victims of violent crime, including a bodega clerk at Bragg's office had charged with second-degree murder, later dropped those charges amid a public outcry from people who felt this was self-defense from a clerk who is protecting himself in an altercation. So, that's what Republicans are going to focus on.
 
Democrats are going to try to pivot this to talk about gun violence. We're going to hear from Mayor Eric Adams before this hearing today, as well as with the top Democrat on this committee. You know, Eric Adams already said on another network this morning that this hearing is going to be the height of hypocrisy.
 
But the broader backdrop here is this is really Republicans trying to give cover to Donald Trump, trying to stick it to Alvin Bragg on his own turf, right after Alvin Bragg brought this indictment and as Republicans are trying to investigate the investigation into Donald Trump, Don.
 
LEMON:  And the mayor was on Friday saying that he believed that this was just a deflection from the real issues. He was on this very program. How is Bragg responding to the hearing Jordan has put together, Sara?
 
MURRAY:  Well, the D.A.'s office is unamused. And in one statement, they said, if Chairman Jordan truly cared about public safety, he could take a short drive to Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Akron or Toledo in his home state instead of using taxpayer dollars to travel hundreds of miles out of his way.
 
And, again, this comes after Bragg has sued Jordan and the Judiciary Committee, saying that they are trying to meddle in his criminal investigation because Jordan and other Republicans have asked Bragg and other former prosecutors in his office for documents and testimony. So, this is a sort of rolling feud that will continue here in New York today, Don.
 
LEMON:  And Sara Murray will be covering this rolling feud. Thank you, Sara. We appreciate it. HARLOW:  New this morning, a major Republican donor is now turning on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, halting his support because of the potential 2024 hopeful's extreme positions on social issues.
 <br>[07:25:04]
 
That is the reasoning that Thomas Peterffy gave.
 
Let's talk about what he told the Financial Times, quote, because of his meaning, DeSantis' stance on abortion and book banning, myself and a bunch of friends are holding our powder dry. So, who are they holding it for?
 
Michael Smerconish is here, CNN Political Commentator and host of CNN's Smerconish. Good morning.
 
LEMON:  Hi, Michael.
 
HARLOW:  Hi. Money talks, money matters. Is this a big deal?
 
MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  It could be a big deal. I mean, I think Ron DeSantis right now is checking all the boxes in terms of what you do to try and secure a Republican nomination not necessarily win a general election, and I think that's what this donor is focused on.
 
Can I just say bigger picture, it looks like this is really going to happen, meaning Trump and DeSantis because I've had my doubts. I have to believe that Ron DeSantis gave pause, said to himself, I'm 44, I've been twice elected governor of a big state and important state. Do I really want to get in a cage with this guy?
 
The polls have been consistent, Trump at about 50, DeSantis at about 25, but it looks like he's doing all the things that one has to do to really run for president as a Republican. So, I guess this is the start.
 
LEMON:  So, you think it's going to happen? You say --
 
SMERCONISH:  Yes, Don, I think it's going to happen. I think when you sign a six-week abortion bill ban in Florida, I think when you reject an A.P. course for African-American studies in the state of Florida, I think when you're super PAC, even though you've got to stay disconnected from them, runs an anti-Trump ad, I think you really are getting into the race. But I continue to believe that Donald Trump's real opponents are not named DeSantis and Pence and Haley and Scott. They are named Bragg. They are named Merrick Garland, they are named Jack Smith and they're named Fani Willis.
 
LEMON:  Yes. You mentioned the ad, the super PAC. Let's play and then we'll discuss. Here it is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Donald Trump is being attacked by a Democrat prosecutor in New York. So, why is he spending millions attacking the Republican governor of Florida? Trump is stealing pages from the Biden-Pelosi playbook, repeating lies about social security. Trump should fight Democrats, not lie about Governor DeSantis. What happened to Donald Trump?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON:  I mean, it seems like he's running. Why run that ad if he's not running?
 
SMERCONISH:  You know, Don, what's interesting to me is the very first line, which says that Donald Trump is being attacked by a Democratic prosecutor, is a Democrat prosecutor in New York. No, he's been indicted, right? But the indictment thus far of Trump in the Stormy Daniels related case has been a political advantage for Donald Trump. So, it's like they don't want to hit him too hard with the fact that he's -- it's crazy when you stop and think about it. They don't want to hit him hard for being indicted because that has bolstered his fundraising, meaning Trump's fundraising.
 
HARLOW:  It's interesting just also what happened over the weekend at this donor retreat, and I think, you know, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's interview with Jake and State of the Union yesterday was also really telling in terms of essentially saying, move on, right, move on, Republican Party, focus on the issues, and then Governor Chris Sununu saying about Trump, I don't think he can win in 2024.
 
SMERCONISH:  Well, I think that a lot of the major donors are keeping their powder dry, right? They probably would like to move on from Donald Trump. But Trump has raised tens of millions of dollars since being indicted and he's done it on a grassroots basis, almost Bernie Sanders-style except on the GOP side of the aisle. So, you know, they don't know how to deal with them. They don't know how to derail him, and he remains consistent in the polls.
 
HARLOW:  Who is they?
 
SMERCONISH:  They, meaning, I think that the major Republican donors would rather.
 
Poppy, you know what I really believe? I believe that the intelligence (ph) of the GOP, if they could go behind a curtain and vote yay or nay on Donald Trump, it's a big nay vote, but they're scared to death of the base. And, therefore, the emperor might have no clothes but nobody is going to say it.
 
LEMON:  Michael, can we just go back real quickly to this abortion bill that Ron DeSantis signed? Because it's not -- the abortion issue is not working and not polling well for Republicans, so he -- maybe he thinks it's going to bode well for him, but it doesn't it doesn't look that way.
 
SMERCONISH:  Hey, Don, here's something else to think about, twofold. One, he signed it in private. He signed it in private. If he wanted to make a big deal out of it, he would have handled it differently. But think about Donald Trump. I mean, if you want to take credit for the overturning of Roe versus Wade, Donald Trump is the guy who ought to be able to do it because he appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices, and yet he doesn't.
 <br>[07:30:01]
 
He doesn't say anything about it because I believe Trump recognizes that the issue is a net loser in a general election, general election.</pre>
