ANNOUNCER:  Live from CNN Abu Dhabi, this is CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson. 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST (voice-over):  Welcome to what is the second hour of the show. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 6:00 in the 
 
 evening. 
 
Major changes are underway in Ukraine. The country's foreign minister, the latest top official to tender his resignation ahead of a government 
 
 reshuffle there. This as one of the deadliest attacks of Russia's war killed over 50 people in Ukraine on Tuesday. 
 
A diplomatic source in this region tells me there will be no deal in the Gaza hostage ceasefire talks as long as the dispute around what is known as 
 
 the Philadelphi corridor remains unresolved. 
 
This as pressure builds on Israel's prime minister to end the war now. 
 
And the clock is ticking. The U.S. presidential election just two months away. The hope for candidates are out in key states campaigning. And in one 
 
 city, mysterious blue dots are popping up on people's lawns. 
 
Why? 
 
We'll get you there just ahead. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, Ukraine's president says the next few months are critical in his country's war with Russia and it has to be ready, he said. A big 
 
 cabinet reshuffle is expected in the coming days. Here's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Autumn will be extremely important for Ukraine and our state institutions must be set 
 
 up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need, all of us. 
 
To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government and we have prepared personnel decisions. There will also be changes in the office. I'm 
 
 also counting on a slightly different weight (ph) for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Some ministers are already handing in their resignations, including the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. He spoke with CNN's 
 
 Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday after one of Russia's deadliest attacks of the war. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DMYTRO KULEBA, UKRAINIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  So I don't know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for full promises to be 
 
 fulfilled and for all new commitments to be made. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, how many more tragedies indeed? 
 
A new attack today, killing several people, including children, in the western city of Lviv. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen joining us now from Ukraine's 
 
 capital. 
 
The resignation of the foreign minister just this morning and we are expecting a significant government reshuffle as Ukraine endures more 
 
 attacks, more deadly attacks from Russia.
 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy talking about a critical, crucial period in this war for Ukraine. 
 
What is he talking about at this point?
 
What does he mean by that? 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think he's talking about the fact that, right now, the Ukrainians are under a lot 
 
 of pressure, Becky, in the east of the country with the Russians advancing toward the Pokrovsk area specifically. 
 
But they've also started their own incursion into Russia. And the Ukrainians really believe that that is something that could bring this war 
 
 to a culmination point. 
 
One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that Volodymyr Zelenskyy most probably is set to travel to the United States, to the U.N. General 
 
 Assembly in the next couple of weeks, where he not only will attend the U.N. General Assembly but is also set to meet with U.S. President Joe 
 
 Biden. 
 
And one of the things that the Ukrainian president has said is that he wants to present U.S. President Joe Biden with a plan for what he calls 
 
 Ukrainian victory but essentially to try and bring the Russians to the negotiating table. 
 
One of the parts of that plan, the Ukrainians have already said, is that incursion into the Kursk area to try and put pressure on the Russians. But 
 
 the Ukrainians are also going to ask for fewer restrictions on long distance weapons and potentially an absolutely substantial new weapons 
 
 package to try and fight back against the Russians. 
 
And for that, the president of Ukraine, apparently, wants to reshuffle his cabinet and wants to have, as he himself is saying, the people in place in 
 
 order to put different weight on certain areas of foreign policy, as he said in that sound bite that we just played before going live to air. 
 
I'm actually standing, Becky, in front of the Ukrainian foreign ministry, where presumably very soon there'll be someone else at the helm. 
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, very prominent since the war started and before that as well, someone who was also very big at drumming up 
 
 international support for Ukraine. He's one of the ones who tendered his resignation in that big shuffle, which already appears to be underway. 
 
So far, we have three government ministers handing in their resignations, two deputy prime ministers and the head of Ukraine's property fund as well. 
 
One of the things that still needs to happen is that the parliament here in Ukraine needs to approve those resignations. They have not decided on the 
 
 resignation of the foreign minister just yet. 
 
There's two people where they've actually refused the resignations or that they have accepted. But it seems as though that reshuffle of the cabinet -- 
 
 and that was very much underway as Ukraine goes into this critical period, which they hope could bring, at least in the longer run, an end to the war 
 
 -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  We've been reporting that Ukraine has delivered a four part victory deal, is the way I think they've been describing it, to the Biden 
 
 administration in Washington. 
 
When you're talking to your sources there, do we have any sense of the parameters of this document, what Ukraine is seeking next and whether there 
 
 is evidence at this point that there are substantive negotiations going on for a peace summit, something that would end this conflict?
 
PLEITGEN:  Well, I think there's something that the Ukrainians want to force the Russians into as part of that victory plan there, as they call 
 
 it, that they want to put toward U.S. President Joe Biden. 
 
Because one of the things that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said and at various times over the past couple of weeks is that everything hinges on the United 
 
 States and some of the other key allies. He mentioned Germany, you mentioned the United Kingdom and you mentioned France as well. 
 
Because they have so much diplomatic weight behind them but also because that's where the bulk of the weapons that Ukraine receives from the West 
 
 come from. And that certainly is also part of that four-point plan as well. 
 
Number one of what he said is that obviously the Kursk incursion of the Ukrainians, that's a key part of that. They want to force the Russians to 
 
 exchange some of the territory that the Ukrainians have taken in return for some of the territory that the Russians have taken from the Ukrainians. 
 
That is definitely part of what they're looking at. But one of the other things that the president of Ukraine has also made very clear is that the 
 
 Ukrainians are going to need, as he put it, substantially more weapons than they have received so far. 
 
And also substantially more weapons that can strike at further distances than the ones that they currently have. 
 
One of the things that the Ukrainians have been bemoaning over the past couple of weeks is the fact that they are not allowed to strike large parts 
 
 of Russian territory or deep into Russian territory with some of the longer distance weapons, the few longer distance weapons that they do have. 
 
They believe that those restrictions need to be lifted in order for them to really turn the tide on some of the battlefields. Right now, the situation 
 
 that we're seeing, Becky, is that the Russians are still pushing very much so on the eastern front. 
 
But it seems as though the Ukrainians right now in a little bit of a better position to try and stabilize that front but certainly they're saying, as 
 
 part of that four-point plan, they're going to need a lot more weapons. 
 
One of the other things they're also looking for is obviously diplomatic initiatives. And then also economic initiatives as well. Obviously to keep 
 
 the Ukrainian economy afloat and to help it be strong in order for the state to survive in the long term -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Yes. It's good to have you, Fred, outside the foreign ministry there in Kyiv in Ukraine. Thank you. 
 
Well, an Israeli newspaper reports the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, effectively spiked a draft hostage and ceasefire deal in July by 
 
 introducing a raft of new 11th hour demands. 
 
The newspaper cites a document that it has obtained and reinforces reporting by CNN about demands made by the prime minister at that time. It 
 
 also says at least three of the six hostages killed by Hamas this past week were set to be freed as part of this deal that has, until now, at least, 
 
 been in negotiation. 
 
We've got new reporting today about the prospects of any future deal. A diplomatic source tells me it will not happen as long as Israel insists on 
 
 keeping control of what is known as the Philadelphi corridor, that small strip between Egypt and Gaza, right to the south there of Gaza. 
 
That source telling me, quote, "As long as the Philadelphi corridor issue is not resolved, there is no deal. Things are very tense," they said, "very 
 
 much up in the air." 
 
Nic Robertson and Kylie Atwood back with us this hour.
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
Nic, let's start with you. Benjamin Netanyahu is under a lot of pressure, not least from officials who have been aligned with him, at least until 
 
 recently, and those in the opposition. And this is with regard this strip of land, the Philadelphi corridor, where Israel has its troops at present. 
 
Take a listen to what Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):  Let's be honest. Philadelphi corridor is an operational challenge. But it is not the 
 
 existential threat to the state of Israel. Iran's axis of evil is the existential threat to us. (INAUDIBLE) Netanyahu can no longer take care of 
 
 the reelect schedule throughout (ph).
 
YAIR LAPID, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (voice-over):  Netanyahu talks so much about the transparent political spin of the Philadelphi corridor that 
 
 everyone mentioned that he said one more thing. 
 
He said, the war must not end. The citizens of Israel should know as long as this government exists, the war will continue. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Nic, what do you make of what we've heard from those officials and from this extensive reporting from one Israeli newspaper? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  The reporting puts meat on the bones to everything that CNN has been hearing and learning over the 
 
 last several months, that these last minute adjustments made by Israel, made by the prime minister, are the thing that collapsed the talks. 
 
Hamas has repeatedly said during the recent negotiation period that they were on board with the version before Israel added, at the last minute, 
 
 these other conditions that, they say, weren't part of that plan that the president had articulated. 
 
The U.N. Security Council had essentially voted on. This really adds some real detail to it. And the prime minister is clearly making a priority out 
 
 of the Philadelphi corridor. 
 
And one of the things that Benny Gantz, who was in the war cabinet until very recently, leading opposition politician, you heard him speaking there. 
 
 He said the prime minister was actually offered an alternate technical military solution to having troops along that border. 
 
The prime minister said, the border, we need to have troops there but to stop Hamas getting weapons in tunnels underneath the border, that Benny 
 
 Gantz, who was part of the war cabinet and a former defense minister here, said, that's just not the case. 
 
There are other solutions and the prime minister knows about it. 
 
So what does all of this add up to?
 
Well, the protesters are saying just these same sorts of things. And what they're saying is, by coming out on the streets in big numbers, as they did 
 
 at the weekend and continuing to come out, that helps create a better political environment for these for these opposition politicians to come 
 
 out and speak. 
 
And this is exactly what's happening. Yair Lapid, Benny Gantz, there'll probably be others, we're hearing from them now in this -- at this moment, 
 
 when there's this huge upswell. 
 
What does it mean for the prime minister?
 
Well, as long as he's, as long as his cabinet stands by him and people like the defense minister, who've already spoken against him and voted against 
 
 him and against the Philadelphi corridor idea, inside of -- inside of the cabinet, unless they can round up and pull away some members of the Knesset 
 
 from the prime minister's government. 
 
Then the government under prime minister Netanyahu will just continue. That's where we're at (ph). What we may be seeing is the beginning of a 
 
 groundswell toward that. But the cracks in the government, big enough cracks that made that happen aren't there yet, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  And Kylie, we just heard from Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition, talking about the fact that, in his speech just 24 hours ago, 
 
 prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu very specifically said this war will not end. 
 
This war will not end. 
 
And this line from Yair Lapid, I think, is important. 
 
He said, "This forever war will go on as long as this government is in power." 
 
Look, he's no fan of Benjamin Netanyahu, he wasn't before this war and he won't be going forward. But Washington has been very critical of Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu's behavior, suggesting he's not doing enough to bring about a deal. 
 
The U.S. itself also being criticized for not doing enough to bring pressure to bear on Israel to get a deal across the table, that it keeps 
 
 saying, it's nearly there, it's close. 
 
Talk to us about the U.S. role in this, even as it today, we learn, is bringing charges against the leaders of Hamas. 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. 
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
So the Biden administration is claiming that they can do two things at one time, that they can continue to try and push for a deal but they can also 
 
 continue and begin even in a more real way with those DOJ charges against the Hamas terrorists today to hold Hamas accountable. 
 
The question is, just how much more challenging these conversations to try and bring both parties to actual -- an actual agreement will be, now that 
 
 these charges are in place and now that we have the prime minister of Israel really digging in on the Philadelphi corridor. 
 
We have been talking about sticking points in these ongoing talks, these ongoing quiet negotiations for quite some time now. And there have been 
 
 multiple of them. But what has become extremely clear in recent days is that it is the Philadelphi -- excuse me, Becky -- it is the Philadelphi 
 
 corridor that is the primary sticking point at this time. 
 
And when you talk to U.S. officials, they don't have a magic wand. They don't have a solution that they have in their minds for how to resolve this 
 
 issue because you -- they don't see necessarily a path forward here. 
 
Now that doesn't mean that they're not going to put something on the table. We know that U.S. officials are working with Qatar. They're working with 
 
 Egypt to try and put something again back on the table as soon as this week, potentially next week. So they're still trying here. 
 
But there is not a sense of optimism when you talk to U.S. officials in Washington right now about where these conversations are headed. 
 
And it will be interesting to see, if we see any more public criticism of prime minister Netanyahu from U.S. officials, like we have seen so loudly 
 
 from some Israeli politicians in recent days. We saw a bit of that from President Biden earlier this week. 
 
But he refused to really expand on his criticism of Netanyahu. So that's a space that we will be watching incredibly closely. 
 
ANDERSON:  It's good to have you. Thank you, both. 
 
Pope Francis says an upsurge in conflicts around the world can be blamed on a lack of mutual respect. The pope's remarks came in Indonesia, the first 
 
 stop of his 12 day tour of Asian countries. 
 
He also spoke out against religious extremism, saying that the Catholic Church would step up its efforts to tackle the problem, though through 
 
 dialogue with other faiths. 
 
Bold words as he visits the world's most populous Muslim country. 
 
CNN's Christopher Lamb following the pope for us in Jakarta. 
 
And this is a pontiff who has been on the move. It seems, quite often during his time and, consequently, I think perhaps we overlook just how 
 
 important and historic this tour of Asia and very specifically of Indonesia is. Just set this tripping context for us, if you will. 
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right, Becky. Throughout Pope Francis' pontificate, he has made dialogue with other 
 
 faiths, particularly Islam, a top priority. He's here in Indonesia, as you say, the world's most populous Muslim countries. 
 
But he's made a number of trips to Muslim majority countries. And in 2019, he signed a historic declaration on the importance of interfaith harmony 
 
 with the grand imam of al-Hasakah. 
 
He also has been to Iraq, the first pope to go to Iraq, where he met the Grand Ayatollah Al Sistani in Iraq, a historic meeting. And here in 
 
 Indonesia, he's also breaking new ground with his addresses and which are emphasizing interfaith dialogue. 
 
But also on Thursday, he's going to the Istiqlal mosque here in Jakarta, the biggest mosque in Southeast Asia, where he's expected to sign another 
 
 important declaration to visit the mosque, to take part in an interfaith dialogue and to talk with Muslim leaders, including the grand imam of 
 
 Indonesia. 
 
Now symbolically and powerfully symbolically here in Jakarta, the mosque is opposite the Catholic cathedral. The cathedral and the mosque are linked by 
 
 a tunnel, a tunnel of friendship. They're connected physically. 
 
And that in many ways embodies what Pope Francis is calling for, which is greater dialogue, which he believes is a way of breaking down prejudices, 
 
 of tackling extremism and making the world a better place, making it a lot more harmonious and peaceful place. And he's doing that really through 
 
 these very bold trips. He's 87 years old. 
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
He's made this long journey from Rome to be in Indonesia and to travel across Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the longest trip of his pontificate. 
 
 And it's already having quite an impact. The reception to Francis here was very enthusiastic. 
 
There are people gathered outside the cathedral this afternoon where he went to address the Catholic community. Expect more crowds to be there 
 
 tomorrow, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Fascinating. It's good to have you. Thank you very much indeed. 
 
Well, the economy, one of the top issues for voters in the U.S. presidential election and Kamala Harris will lay out plans for it in a 
 
 speech today. Later, ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD, we'll get the latest read on the economy and what it could mean for the coming months.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
ANDERSON:  Well, some breaking news now on the upcoming U.S. presidential election and alleged Russian interference. CNN has learned exclusively that 
 
 the Biden administration plans to accuse Russia of a sustained effort to influence voters. 
 
It plans to say that Kremlin-run media is a chief culprit. CNN's Evan Perez has this exclusive. 
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Becky. 
 
Well, what we know is that the Biden administration today is going to accuse the Russians of this-- of this broad effort to try to influence the 
 
 U.S. electorate. Now a lot of this has focused, as you pointed out, on the Russian, the Kremlin-controlled media. 
 
But in particular, were talking about "RT," formerly known as "Russia Today" and their efforts, the use of "RT" to try to influence voters with 
 
 some of its stuff online. We also know an organization called Social Design Agency, which the U.S. Treasury has placed sanctions on for running fake 
 
 news websites in Europe. 
 
Now one of the things that we know, in recent months, the Justice Department accused an "RT" employee of running about 1,000 social media 
 
 accounts. And the point of that was essentially to try to pit Americans against each other. And that's part of the Russian playbook, according to 
 
 U.S. officials. 
 
And so we are expecting to hear more about this from the U.S. attorney general, Merrick Garland, and the FBI director, Chris Wray, in a few hours. 
 
 They're convening what's known as the Election Threats Task Force. 
 
And a lot of that will be focusing on the activities of foreign countries that are trying to get a hand or try to play a role in the U.S. election 
 
 this year. That includes efforts by Iran. In recent months, you've seen them hack or attempt to hack both the Biden-Harris campaign and the Trump 
 
 campaign. 
 <br>[10:25:04]
 
In the case of the Trump campaign, they're actually successful in breaching and be able to get some documents from inside the campaign. We also know 
 
 the Chinese have been working to try to do some influence operations as well, not nearly, however as intrusive, according to the U.S. officials, as 
 
 what the Russians are trying to do. 
 
They're essentially trying to replay some of what they did in 2016 when they successfully tried to pit Americans against each other and they were 
 
 in favor of Donald Trump's election back in 2016. This time, it appears it's an even bolder effort by the Russians to try to accomplish some of the 
 
 same goals -- Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Good to have you. Thank you. 
 
Well, this just in to CNN. The number of available jobs in the U.S. fell for the second straight month in July, hitting the lowest level since 
 
 January of 2021, a sign that the demand for workers is dropping. 
 
The report is the first in a series of key data out this week about America's labor market. And it comes as Kamala Harris is set to reveal 
 
 brand new details about her plan for the economy, including tax relief for small businesses. Harris will speak in New Hampshire later today. 
 
So to tee up what we can expect and in light of what we've just learned from this latest economic data, we've got Julia Chatterley in New York for 
 
 us -- Julia. 
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR:  Thanks very much, Becky. I'll talk first about the data that we just got in. You're quite right. It's all about jobs 
 
 and the labor market this week and we know from the Federal Reserve this is where their focus now is honed (sic).
 
The data today was weaker than expected. The number of job openings, as you said, the lowest level since early 2021. It's consistent with a cooling 
 
 jobs market, not a collapsing jobs market. That headline number is the most important one. 
 
The other two ratios that we look at, just to give you a sense, the hiring rate, how willing are workers or employers to hire workers at this stage, 
 
 that is at a decade low. It's a softening labor market. 
 
The quit rate, the confidence of workers themselves to say, hey, I'm not working for you anymore, I'm going to go somewhere else and find a job, 
 
 that actually ticked a little bit higher. It plateaued a couple of years ago. And we've stayed at these levels. 
 
Look, the bottom line is this is an important snapshot of where the labor market is, Becky, and the most important data we get is Friday. This was 
 
 July data. We know it was weaker based on payrolls. 
 
The question is for determining what the Fed does later this month. Friday's payrolls are going to be key. 
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, and we know that the Fed has said that we shouldn't expect them to get involved in politics. Obviously, everything is being 
 
 politicized at this point. But we are expecting this Fed cut in September. 
 
This stage, as I said this week, sort of sets up both Trump and Harris, who are expected to be really laying out their economic vision. And polling 
 
 suggests that it is the economy that is front and center on people's minds in the U.S. 
 
So what can we expect?
 
CHATTERLEY:  Certainly and I think the key is in all of the polls really that we're looking at, he still has the edge in terms of trust to handle 
 
 the economy. So anything that the Harris campaign can come out and say, look, we're going to try and help you, whether it's on inflation.
 
And we've seen that with prices or tax credits for families or indeed what we're expecting to hear today, which is support for startups. And this is 
 
 something quite interesting. 
 
Tax deductions for startups, which currently are $5,000 that they can use in the first year that they spend, she's going to come out and give us a 
 
 really splashy number and say, look we're going to give you tax deductions up to $50,000 and you can use them over a number of years.
 
Even wait until the point where you're actually making profits. The hope is that they get 25 million applications for new businesses and startups over 
 
 the course of her future administration. 
 
The record high, by the way, at 19 million now. I can give you some challenges to this. Ultimately, what a small business needs in the 
 
 beginning is cash or credit, not necessarily a tax deduction. The early expenses that you have are payroll, for example, product equipment. 
 
How are you going to afford those?
 
And the hope is that someday down the line, you're actually making profits that then you can shield with these tax deductions. 
 
I will say that anything that cuts red tape, allows better access, encourages startups to form is a great idea. Questionable, as always, on 
 
 the execution on this one. But the good news is, Becky, the cost minimal compared to the splashy billions of dollars on some of the other things 
 
 she's announced. We'll see what she says today. 
 
ANDERSON:  Fascinating, isn't it. It's good to have you as ever. Thank you very much indeed. 
 
The revised indictment against Donald Trump. 
 <br>[10:30:00]
 
Giving some of his allies new hope that they can escape prosecution. So we give you some detail here. 
 
This is after the U.S. Supreme Court granted broad immunity to Donald Trump for official acts that he did as president. Special counsel Jack Smith 
 
 reworked his indictment, removing some references to communications between Trump and federal officials. 
 
And that includes former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark and Trump's former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. CNN senior crime 
 
 and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz is in Washington. 
 
Certainly there is some optimism amongst Donald Trump's allies that they are perhaps less under the cosh, looking at getting out of the woods as it 
 
 were. 
 
What do you read into where we are at, at this point?
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Becky, it's not just reading into it. We have sources that are telling us that 
 
 it's a sigh of relief across the Trump world with this new version of the indictment against Donald Trump. 
 
It's because a number of people who were around Trump are cut out of it -- or the amount that they're present in this indictment, they're cut back in 
 
 the way that the prosecutors are telling the story of the allegations against Trump. 
 
That means that people who were on the hook potentially to testify at a trial in the future against Donald Trump, they're no longer possible 
 
 witnesses because that part of the case is on the cutting room floor. 
 
People like the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone; his deputy, Patrick Philbin. And then there are the bold-faced names that were around Trump and 
 
 really present in that indictment before and are looking at their own cases, their own criminal accusations in state courts. 
 
Mark Meadows and Jeffrey Clark, they are facing a total really new world because of what happened in federal court with the rewritten charges 
 
 against Donald Trump. Jeffrey Clark, that official, the Justice Department, he's not part of the case at all. 
 
And so his lawyers are using that to try and get him as a way to try and convince courts to help him maintain his ability to practice as a lawyer in 
 
 the United States. 
 
And then Mark Meadows, the chief of staff in the White House, the way the federal prosecutors are framing him now in the case against Donald Trump is 
 
 he's a chief of staff who, at times, was doing some campaign logistics for Donald Trump. That's the way the new indictment is written. 
 
And Mark Meadows' team, they're running with this. They have some proceedings where he is facing criminal charges in Arizona, proceedings 
 
 that are upcoming tomorrow. And they already are telling the court, look at how the federal guys are talking about Mark Meadows. 
 
He was just an underling of the president and that, they hope, will help him as he faces these state level charges on his own. 
 
ANDERSON:  Yes. Well, more to come and the push by Donald Trump to get his hush money trial moved into federal court, all of that is massively 
 
 important with just, what, 60 odd days to go or less to the election. Good to have you as ever. Thank you. 
 
Ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD, stinging criticism from the United Nations on Israel's incursion into the West Bank. The U.N.'s new warning today. And I 
 
 talked to an Israeli human rights lawyer who says Israel is now adopting tactics there that it has been using in Gaza. More on that is coming up.

ANDERSON:  Welcome back. 
 
You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson, time here in the UAE in Abu Dhabi, it is 6:36 in the evening. 
 
Now Israel's incursion into the West Bank has entered its second week. Today, the United Nations warning about, in its words, "lethal, warlike 
 
 tactics" used by Israeli forces there, including airstrikes. 
 
And it counts more than two dozen fatalities, including children, and says damage to houses and civilian infrastructure is leaving the population 
 
 traumatized and in need of psychological support. 
 
The images that you're seeing came to us at CNN here just from Tuesday this week. And earlier this week, when prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
 
 addressed the nation and the media following widespread protests, he drew the ire of many in this region. 
 
Standing in front of a wall sized map of Israel and Gaza with the occupied West Bank erased from view, now the Palestinian foreign ministry said the 
 
 use of the map, quote, "reveals the true agenda of the racist, colonial, far-right Israeli government," to quote them. 
 
And it goes on to say, "Netanyahu's expansionist policies, openly displayed to the world, are part of an attempt to displace Palestinians from their 
 
 homeland." 
 
Michael Sfard is an Israeli human rights lawyer and he joins me tonight from Tel Aviv. 
 
And it's good to have you, sir. And thank you for making the time. 
 
Why -- what do you make of what we are seeing unfold in the West Bank and what would you call it from a legal perspective?
 
MICHAEL SFARD, ISRAELI HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER:  Well, thank you, Becky, for having me. 
 
I think we've seen a lot of trends of -- annexationist trends that Israel has applied to the West Bank even before October 7. But after October 7, 
 
 all these trends have spiraled. 
 
And settler violence, displacement of fulcrum (ph) of entire Palestinian communities from different sections of the West Bank and the use of air 
 
 force and artillery against militant Palestinians, something that we haven't seen for 57 years of Israeli occupation in the West Bank. 
 
These are kind of tools that are used in order to completely dominate the West Bank and finalize the annexation to Israel. 
 
Now the International Court of Justice has only recently provided its advisory opinion, saying that these kinds of policies and practices are 
 
 illegal and the Israeli presence in the West Bank must end. 
 
Israel is not only violating this decision but actually accelerating its policies toward annexation. 
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
ANDERSON:  I just want to do a slightly deeper dive on what we got out of the U.N. A U.N. report describing Israel's tactics in the West Bank as, 
 
 quote, "lethal" and accusing the IDF of impeding access for ambulances, as you have just been alluding to here, to reach those wounded as a result of 
 
 Israeli fire. 
 
The IDF responded, saying, and I quote them here, "During the operation, the IDF forces are sometimes forced to detain ambulances to check them. And 
 
 this is due to the terrorist organizations' cynical use of ambulances. And we have witnessed many such examples." 
 
The IDF did not elaborate on those examples. 
 
What do you make of those claims?
 
SFARD:  Well, I don't have any direct knowledge of what has happened. But we've seen a pattern of denial of access to journalists, to humanitarian 
 
 aid workers and to medical staff to areas where the IDF has been operating in. 
 
And since Israel is the occupying power the West Bank, with effective control over the full territory, it is its legal obligation to take care of 
 
 the residents of the occupied West Bank. It is Israel's obligation to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid workers and medical crew. 
 
And it seems that Israel is constantly violating these obligations. 
 
ANDERSON:  There's a conversation doing the rounds -- and it's very noisy conversation at this point -- about a, quote, "forever war." The 
 
 intensifying offensive in the West Bank as a means to keep this going for Benjamin Netanyahu and the likes of Ben Gvir and Smotrich, who have 
 
 expressed a desire to annex the occupied territory. 
 
But you say in an op-ed in "Ha'aretz" last month, that annexation has already happened. 
 
Can you just explain for our viewers what you meant by that and why,  why you wrote that?
 
SFARD:  Well, we have an Israeli government that basically advances a policy of Jewish supremacy in all of the territory that is under the 
 
 government of Israel's control, naming between the Jordan River and the sea. 
 
And while the West Bank was, for 56 years, governed by a military government, by a military commander, which is how international law 
 
 envisages an occupation authority, in order to create some kind of buffer between the occupying powers' government, which is committed to the 
 
 interests of its society. 
 
So the government of Israel is not directly managing the occupied West Bank but rather the Israeli army. In recent months, a constitutional revolution 
 
 was taken, was carried out and most administrative powers over the West Bank have been transferred from the military commander to a governor, 
 
 civilian governor, that is answering to minister Smotrich. 
 
And so an elected Israeli, with a representative of the settlement far- right movement, is basically now has all the powers, all the administrative powers, all the public powers in the West Bank. 
 
He controls law enforcement, demolition of illegal construction. And we can see already the results. No enforcement on illegal, unpermitted settler 
 
 construction and a full-blown  enforcement on Palestinians. 
 
New construction of neighborhoods, a huge bubbling approvals for settlement housing units and the interests of the Palestinian residents of the West 
 
 Bank has -- is completely ignored. 
 
So by creating this government, Israeli control directly over the West Bank, this is what annexation looks like. 
 
ANDERSON:  Thank you for joining us. A very important perspective from you. And your insight and analysis is extremely important as we continue to 
 
 cover this story. Thank you. 
 
And still to come on CONNECT THE WORLD, a new grassroots effort hoping to lead to a blue victory in the White House. The story for twine (sic) -- for 
 
 twine! 
 
The story behind what is this very quirky campaign, that is ahead.

ANDERSON:  Well, mysterious blue dots are popping up on some lawns across the state of Nebraska as the U.S. presidential race enters a crucial 
 
 stretch. 
 
The yard signs act as a symbol for Democrats in a state that generally votes Republican. CNN's Jeff Zeleny tells us that the quirky campaign is 
 
 hoping to prove crucial to this year's presidential election. Have a look at this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  These blue dots are popping up on lawns across Omaha. Signs of a campaign where 
 
 not only every vote counts but where every electoral vote is critical.
 
JASON BROWN, NEBRASKA DEMOCRATIC VOTER:  We debated back-and-forth and we went for it and said, well, I think history is kind of cool and it turned 
 
 out to be a huge win because --
 
RUTH HUEBNER-BROWN, NEBRASKA DEMOCRATIC VOTER:  -- because it's starting a conversation.
 
J. BROWN:  Exactly. We had no idea that conversations would go.
 
R. BROWN:  Well, what's the blue dots and that's the important part because as soon as you start the conversation, you have a full conversation.
 
ZELENY (voice-over):  Ruth Huebner-Brown and her husband, Jason, are suddenly having more conversations about the blue dot. Symbolizing a 
 
 Democratic island in a sea of Nebraska Red and the states unique way of dividing electoral votes.
 
J. BROWN:  It's plausible that we could have a tie. And a whole notion of oh, my vote doesn't matter, kind of is really tossed out the window because 
 
 this could be it. This could be the deciding factor.
 
ZELENY (voice-over):  For all of the pathways for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to reach the White House. The race for 270 electoral votes could come 
 
 down to Nebraska's sprawling second district.
 
And here's why -- if Harris carries the three blue wall battleground states and Trump wins the swing states across the Sun Belt, a single electoral 
 
 vote surrounding Omaha could keep the race from becoming a 269 to 269 tie, decided by the House of Representatives.
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Well, hello, Nebraska.
 
ZELENY (voice-over):  A not so secret weapon for Democrats could be Tim Walz, who was born and raised here before moving two states away to 
 
 Minnesota.
 
Tony Vargas believes the Harris-Walz ticket will also help Democrats win control of Congress. Starting with his race here, which is among the 
 
 country's most competitive.
 
TONY VARGAS (D-NB), STATE SENATOR:  We have suburban, we have rural, we have urban, we have all different walks of life, all different races, 
 
 ethnicities, socioeconomic but really this is a truly independent place.
 
ZELENY (voice-over):  Republican Congressman Don Bacon has thrived and survived politically because of that independent streak of the district. 
 
 Trump won here in 2016 but lost in 2020.
 
Bacon said Trump runs the risk of losing again if he doesn't focus on inflation and immigration.
 
REP. DON BACON (R-NE):  When you talk about DEI, race, coming up with nicknames, that doesn't play well in this district. They want to talk about 
 
 the issues. This is an issue district.
 
ZELENY (voice-over):  For months, Trump and his allies have sought to change Nebraska's election law. 
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
And award all electoral votes to the statewide winner rather than by congressional district, a process shared only by Maine.
 
TRUMP:  You better get me Omaha, do you understand that?
 
ZELENY (voice-over):  For now, Republicans are working to defeat Harris here in a district that extends through Omaha's Western suburbs to rural 
 
 towns like Wahoo, where Stephen and Sonya Peetz are ready for change.
 
STEPHEN PEETZ, NEBRASKA REPUBLICAN VOTER:  I would like just to see some hope. I don't see it now.
 
ZELENY:  Which of those candidates do think gets the closest to bringing you hope?
 
S. PEETZ:  I would say Trump.
 
SONYA PEETZ, NEBRASKA REPUBLICAN VOTER:, Absolutely Trump. I have a feeling that he is a person who sticks to his word. He means what he says.
 
ZELENY (voice-over):  They question what Harris stands for and are not sold on Walz no matter where he grew up. Back in the Dundee neighborhood of 
 
 Omaha, the blue dots are in such high demand, Jason Brown ran out of spray paint.
 
Orders are stacking up he said and not only from Democrats but from Independents who may decide the election.
 
J. BROWN:  It doesn't mean, oh, my God, I become a Democrat. No, you're voting for what you feel is right for the future.
 
ZELENY:  So nine weeks before the election, for all the talk of the blue wall states of Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin, that is not enough 
 
 to win the White House without the blue dot here in Omaha. 
 
That is because the electoral votes are divided here by congressional district. Only Nebraska and Maine have this process. Republicans have tried 
 
 to change it. Democrats embrace it. 
 
But the bottom line here is the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign have all their eyes on Nebraska  for that one electoral vote. If this race is 
 
 close, it certainly could matter -- Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Omaha.

ANDERSON:  Right.
 
You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. Next up, new developments in the case over the death of "Friends" actor Matthew Perry. 
 
 More information on when a trial is set to take place. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  Some news just coming on a CNN exclusive. A U.S. service member has been detained in Venezuela. 
 
That's according to four U.S. officials familiar with the matter. The American citizen was detained on August the 30th in Caracas, according to 
 
 the officials. The State Department advises Americans against traveling to Venezuela, warning there is, and I quote them here, "a high risk of 
 
 wrongful detention of U.S. nationals" in Venezuela. 
 
So news just coming in to CNN in an exclusive CNN report. A U.S. service member has been detained in Venezuela. A U.S. citizen, detained in August 
 
 on the 30th in Caracas. One of the officials said he is being held by the Venezuelan intelligence agency. 
 
A trial date has been set for two of the five people charged in connection with the death of "Friends" actor Matthew Perry. They include an alleged 
 
 L.A. drug dealer known as the "ketamine queen" and a doctor accused of supplying Perry with that drug. 
 
They will be tried together from March the 4th next year. Both have pleaded not guilty. The medical examiner ruled Perry died aged 54 in October last 
 
 year from the effects of ketamine and by subsequently drowning in a hot tub at home. 
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
Nick Watt is in Los Angeles and he's got more on the case. 
 
What can we expect from this trial, Nick? 
 
It will be certainly well watched. 
 
NICK WATT, CNN ANCHOR AND NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly will. Matthew Perry was a much loved actor and also -- I don't want to say 
 
 notorious but well-known also for his struggles with addiction. 
 
So what we are going to see in this trial is perhaps a little glimpse into the underbelly of the ketamine scene here in Los Angeles. We have the 
 
 alleged "ketamine queen" pictured there and also a medical doctor, who are facing various counts relating to the death of Matthew Perry. 
 
Now prosecutors claim that this Dr. Mark Plasencia texted another doctor after they'd been contacted by Perry and said, "I wonder how much this 
 
 moron will pay. Let's find out." 
 
The two doctors allegedly charged Matthew Perry $2,000 for each vial of ketamine, vials that only cost them $12. And then apparently, when Perry 
 
 and his assistant were looking for perhaps a steadier, cheaper supply, that is where the "ketamine queen" came in. 
 
So her lawyer says she has no connection with Perry, that we'll see a very different side of her at the trial. As you mentioned, those three others 
 
 have agreed to plead guilty. Unclear if they will testify against the two. We will see in an L.A. courtroom -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Good to have you. Thank you. 
 
That is it for CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, stay with CNN. "NEWSROOM" is up next.
