KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  A Pennsylvania judge has granted a request from the Trump campaigning ordering Bucks County election officials to offer on-demand -- on-demand mail voting through Friday, extending the deadline by three days. 
 
Trump and other Republican lawmakers filed the lawsuit in this critical swing county in this critical swing state -- this county is just outside of Philadelphia -- after voters who showed up to request mail-in ballots were allegedly turned on Tuesday, the last day the service was offered. 
 
Despite the legal win for the Trump campaign, he is still stoking unfounded voter fraud fears about the Commonwealth and now says this about accepting the results in Pennsylvania.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REPORTER:  But if they find no evidence of cheating, will you accept the results?
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Pennsylvania? Sure. Oh, if they find no evidence of cheating anywhere, I'll accept the results. I hope that's going to be the case. Win, lose or draw, I hope that's going to be the case.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  A lot of caveats there.
 
And joining me right now is the Secretary of State of Pennsylvania, the man who is overseeing the elections there, Sec. Al Schmidt. Secretary, thank you for coming back in. 
 
Bucks County -- the application window to get a mail-in ballot was extended through Friday, as I just mentioned, because of the -- after this Trump lawsuit. 
 
What happened in Bucks? Do you agree with extending that window? AL SCHMIDT, PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH:  Pennsylvania doesn't have early voting the way that many other states do. So voters have the option to show up to a local Board of Elections office, apply for a mail ballot in person, receive that ballot, complete that ballot, and return it all in one visit. So it's essentially over-the- counter mail ballot voting. 
 
There was a lot of interest this last election in voting -- or this current election in voting that way. Some of our counties really struggled with staffing to make sure that they could process long lines of people voting this way, which is a somewhat more labor intensive process, and Bucks County was one of those. 
 
BOLDUAN:  So your office has reported some of -- I think I saw 120,000 in-person requests for mail-in ballots. I think that was one that I saw. You've got these mail-in ballots that are coming in. 
 
What do you know so far about who is voting by mail at this point?
 
SCHMIDT:  You know, and Kate, I think that's one of the more interesting developments this election cycle. There are still more Democrats voting by mail than Republicans. 
 
But it's been interesting to see Republicans embrace mail-ballot voting this cycle or at least -- or especially this method that I just described to just showing up to your Board of Elections office, applying in person, receiving the ballot, and returning the ballot. That has been a significant change. 
 
So Republicans have essentially gone from suing to close those offices down to suing them to keeping them open longer. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Which is fascinating.
 
What do you think is attributed to that? Is it the messaging from Republicans themselves?
 
SCHMIDT:  It could be messaging. It could just be a broader acceptance that elections in Pennsylvania are free, fair, safe, and secure. That there are safeguards built into the front of the system when you register to vote. And there's a voter verifiable paper ballot record of every vote that's cast by a voter everywhere in Pennsylvania in every election that's used not just to total the results but in two audits to confirm that those results are accurate. 
 
So elections in Pennsylvania, whether you're a voter or a candidate, should have confidence in the integrity of our elections and that they are free, fair, safe, and secure.
 
BOLDUAN:  I asked about messaging on this, Secretary, because Donald Trump is continuing with his line of messaging on this. He -- the recent post that he put out to all of his social media followers was, "Pennsylvania is cheating and getting caught at large-scale levels rarely seen before." 
 
That's not accurate. We know that. We've established that. But how does the constant drumbeat impact poll workers, impact the county election officials just doing their jobs?
 
SCHMIDT:  Well, I've now visited 67 of our 67 counties to sit down with their county election directors and, when available, their county commissioners to talk about how the Pennsylvania Department of State can be of assistance to them in making sure that this election runs smoothly. 
 <br>[07:35:00]
 
I don't know if they're Democrats, I don't know if they're Republicans. They don't tell me, and I don't care. What I do know is that they are professionals and they're civil servants, and they're working day and night to make sure that when you show up to cast your vote your vote will be counted in Pennsylvania.
 
BOLDUAN:  It's almost surprising that this is a headline, what I'm about to ask you, but that is a statement of where we are today. The Georgia Secretary of State, also a Republican, pledged yesterday to uphold the results of the presidential election no matter who wins. Raffensperger saying he stands ready to defend the results of the election.
 
Secretary, will you make that same pledge -- no matter the pressure that may come at you, come at the Commonwealth after votes are -- after the votes are in?
 
SCHMIDT:  Without any hesitation or reservation, as I'm certain every other Secretary of State would do.
 
BOLDUAN:  Al Schmidt, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, thank you so much -- Sara.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. Joining me now, Christine Quinn, the executive committee chair for the New York State Democratic Committee. And Tricia McLaughlin, former senior adviser and director of communications for Vivek Ramaswamy's presidential campaign. Thank you both for being here. 
 
I want to talk first about something that has sort of taken a life of its own. It's trash talk, pun intended, after a Trump rally comedian set up a firestorm, calling Puerto Rico an island of trash. 
 
Trump is jumping all over this because Biden then made a comment about voters being trash. And now Trump is trying to link those comments to Kamala Harris. So Trump has gotten into a dump truck and wears a garbage worker's vest at his rallies. 
 
Did Biden just give Trump a "deplorable" moment, Christine?
 
CHRISTINE QUINN, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR, NEW YORK STATE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE:  Well, I think what we saw was the -- President Biden say something he probably regrets, right? 
 
SIDNER:  And he said he did so. QUINN:  And absolutely, right. He has walked it back almost immediately.
 
But, you know, the person he directed the comment to, Trump, doesn't have a good leg to stand on because he's a man who has said there are enemies within. That he has a list of enemies within that he is going to follow up with when he is elected. 
 
So, should President Biden have said that? No. Do I think it's right he apologized and walked it back? Yes. But Trump really should people in glass houses not throw stones. 
 
SIDNER:  Tricia, if Kamala has to own Joe Biden's comment as Trump is insisting, then shouldn't Trump have to own the misogynistic, racist comments that were made by surrogates at his rally?
 
TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER AND COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR, VIVEK RAMASWAMY 2024 CAMPAIGN (via Webex by Cisco):  I don't think that Kamala Harris is culpable for the words of George Lopez, who is the comedian the day before at her rally saying that all Mexicans are thieves. And I don't think Donald Trump is culpable for the words of a comedian when Donald Trump was not even in the building. So, no.
 
That being said, I do think Kamala Harris should apologize and I think Tim Walz should apologize for his words saying that Americans who go to Trump rallies are Nazis. I think that's unacceptable. It's divisive rhetoric.
 
SIDNER:  All right, let's talk about this. Trump admits his advisers have told him not to use this line about protecting women. He did not listen, and he added to it -- listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  About four weeks ago I was saying no, I want to protect the people. I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women.
 
Sir, please don't say that. Why? They said we think it's -- we think it's very inappropriate for you to say. I said why? I'm president. I want to protect the women of our country. 
 
Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  "Whether the women like it or not." Doesn't that sound like an odd threat? What's the message to women here, Tricia?
 
MCLAUGHLIN:  I'm certainly less concerned about how Donald Trump said it versus I am concerned that Donald Trump said that he would protect women's health care and women's reproductive health care. That's incredibly important to me -- the fact that him and J.D. Vance back IVF. The fact that he said he would not sign a national abortion ban. This is a real area of -- not only of political vulnerability for
 
 Republicans, but I think a governance vulnerability for Republicans. We've seen major issues in different states where laws have not been carried out the way that they should be, and the result is that women were hurt or put in very bad medical circumstances. 
 
So I'm really glad that Donald Trump stepped up and said that, and I'm looking forward to hearing more specifics.
 
SIDNER:  But Tricia, you said that he's protecting women's health care, and you talk about women being hurt. Some of the women died trying to get emergency care because --
 
MCLAUGHLIN:  Yeah.
 
SIDNER:  -- of the abortion bans that were set off by Donald Trump's --
 
MCLAUGHLIN:  And it's horrible and it shouldn't happen.
 
SIDNER:  -- choice of Supreme Court justices. 
 
So how do -- how do you explain that to women when making this comment that you're going to protect women whether they like it or not?
 
MCLAUGHLIN:  That should not be happening in this country. And unforeseen circumstances -- I think Republicans and Democrats and every American leader needs to really govern appropriately on this and make sure that there is these kind of issues not happening in this country. And that's why I said we have to get into the specifics here and make sure that women's health is not put at risk.
 <br>[07:40:10]
 
SIDNER:  Christine?
 
QUINN:  I just want to say the representation that Donald Trump has firmly said he would not sign an abortion ban is simply not true. He has both said he wouldn't sign it --
 
MCLAUGHLIN:  He had --
 
QUINN:  -- and he would sign it. He has said both. He has waffled back and forth. And he has said this issue should go to the states where he knows many of the states would put in an abortion ban. That is not leading.
 
And women don't need Donald Trump, God knows, to take care of them because much of what he has articulated -- it is against the reproductive and health care freedoms of women. 
 
What we do need is leaders who are going to listen to women. Listen to doctors. Listen to medical providers. Those leaders are Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, not Donald Trump and not J.D. Vance.
 
SIDNER:  All right. Just quickly here, the Affordable Care Act has come up and it's come up because of Mike Johnson who is the Republican Speaker of the House. He was caught on camera saying this about Obamacare, which is very popular when people are polled with Americans -- listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  Health care reform is going to be a big part of the agenda. When I say we're going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we've got a lot of things still on the table.
 
REPORTER 1:  And no Obamacare?
 
JOHNSON:  No more Obamacare.
 
REPORTER 1:  Oh.
 
REPORTER 2:  Get rid of it. 
 
JOHNSON:  Yeah. The ACA is so deeply ingrained. We need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  Christine, massive reform to make this work. No Obamacare. He repeated the question being asked.
 
What do make of this, and what should the Democrats do in this case? Will they use this for down-ballot races?
 
QUINN:  I mean, that is very, very worrisome. It's particularly worrisome because when Trump was asked if he had any real plans -- because remember, they used to always say repeal and replace. That was years ago. When asked now, recently, if Trump had a replacement, he said he didn't. That he had started to work up concepts. What that told us is the truth that the Republicans just want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and not replace it with anything. 
 
And we, as Democrats, know that when we campaign about that it's very compelling to voters. So I would make this a final-day issue on the top level for all of the candidates up and down the ballot.
 
SIDNER:  Tricia, we're going to have to leave it there, but I know you will be back, and we will discuss more of these policy issues.
 
Christine Quinn, Tricia McLaughlin, thank you both so much for coming on this morning -- John.
 
QUINN:  Thank you.
 
MCLAUGHLIN:  Thank you.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. Today, the director of the CIA Bill Burns is in Egypt discussing possible ceasefire deals -- trying to work, at least, on ceasefire negotiations over Gaza and Lebanon.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv this morning. Jeremy, what's the latest?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Well, John, there is a flurry of U.S. diplomatic activity happening in the region right now. Not only do you have the CIA director meeting with the Egyptian president to talk about both ceasefire proposals for Gaza as well as Lebanon, but you also have two top advisers to President Biden, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, in Israel today meeting with Israeli officials.
 
Hochstein has been focused on the Lebanon ceasefire; McGurk more focused on the issues with Gaza. And both of these are very much live balls at the moment. It does seem like there is perhaps more momentum though and more possibility of progress on the Lebanon ceasefire front. 
 
As we reported yesterday, U.S., Israeli, and Lebanese officials have been pursuing a potential ceasefire deal that could include something like a month or two-month-long negotiation or implementation period before you ultimately get to a kind of final ceasefire agreement that would end the war between Israel and Hezbollah. 
 
Israeli officials believe that now is the right time to pursue such a ceasefire after having achieved a significant amount of military gains against Hezbollah. And it also seems like Hezbollah has kind of shifted its position away from linking a ceasefire to the end of the conflict in Gaza after having suffered that drubbing over the course of the last couple of months, including the killer -- the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah. 
 
We heard some optimism expressed by the Lebanese caretaker prime minister yesterday who hoped that a ceasefire could be achieved within days or even hours. We should note though that he does not necessarily hold the cards here. This is going to be based off of whether Hezbollah and Israel can reach a deal, although indirectly, of course, through mediators.
 
As far as the Gaza ceasefires talks, we know that Hamas officials have been meeting with Qatari officials to be presented with the latest proposals there for a potential short-term ceasefire deal. But right now it remains unclear what Hamas will accept and whether or not they will be willing to accept some kind of a short-term deal that doesn't ultimately lead to the end of the war in Gaza -- John.
 <br>[07:45:00]
 
BERMAN:  U.S. officials on the ground pushing.
 
Jeremy Diamond, thank you very much -- Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  So North Korea says it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight just days ahead of the U.S. election. It is believed to be the longest flight time yet for a North Korean missile. The White House called this a flagrant violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.
 
This comes as North Korea appears to be 1) stepping up its nuclear production, and 2) very clearly strengthening ties with Russia.
 
The L.A. district attorney is now pushing for clemency for Erik and Lyle Menendez. The brothers have been behind bars for more than 30 years for shooting and killing their parents in the late '80s. 
 
Now, California's Gov. Gavin Newsom has a choice. If he grants that clemency request, then their sentences could be reduced. They could even also be released immediately from prison. 
 
As of now, the brothers have a hearing set for December 11 for a judge to decide what happens to their sentences after the D.A.'s recent review of the case and allegations that their father sexually abused them.
 
Joe Exotic says he has found love behind bars. The Tiger King star says he's engaged to a fellow inmate serving time for immigration- related issues. Joe Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado, is currently serving a 21-year sentence for 19 counts of wildlife crimes, two counts or hiring hit men to kill animal activist Carol Baskin. 
 
He became -- you see here -- a sensation in 2020 when Netflix's true crime series about the world of private zoos and their eccentric owners became a smash hit. 
 
Exotic says he submitted a marriage application to the prison and is hopeful they will approve it.
 
Happy Halloween, friends. Joe Exotic -- that was a big Halloween costume one year. Remember this?
 
SIDNER:  Yes.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yes. But are you wondering what costume you're likely to see on repeat tonight, or are you not deciding it and need some help? Look no further than Google's annual list of top-trending Halloween costumes. 
 
Here's what's topping based on the search data.
 
Number one, Shrunken Head Bob from "Beetlejuice." That is a winner all over the place. Coming in second, viral Australian breakdancer Raygun, also a fantastic choice. In the top 10 as well, Catnap from the popular video game series Poppy Playtime. That one's lost one me. And "Deadpool's" female counterpart, Lady Deadpool. 
 
Also popular, characters from the movie "Inside Out 2." My children tell me I'm rage. "The Wolverine," "X-Men: Gambit," and a Halloween staple, the "Minions," Sara. 
 
SIDNER:  You know it's Halloween when you see the spirit Halloweens just pop up randomly --
 
BOLDUAN:  Pop up everywhere. 
 
SIDNER:  -- where you're like I don't even realize that store was out there. BOLDUAN:  My kids are -- oh, I would also like to give a shoutout to all people named Sara -- this Sara -- because she gave my girls early Halloween candy --
 
SIDNER:  I did.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- and they were super jazzed about that one.
 
SIDNER:  I'm sure. And I'm sure you were, too.
 
BOLDUAN:  So were their teachers when I sent them to school with jelly beans.
 
SIDNER:  Sugar high.
 
All right, thank you, Kate.
 
The celebrities lining up behind presidential candidates in the final stretch for both campaigns, and the one who is taking their support back from a candidate. 
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:47:25]
 
BERMAN:  I want to talk about where the presidential candidates are going today. Both will be in the state of Nevada. This is a state that Joe Biden did win four years ago. A pretty narrow race there. He won by 33,000 votes. 
 
Look at the polls right now. You can see no clear leader. It's very tight in Nevada. Here is a news flash, OK? It's always pretty tight in Nevada -- at least it has been recently. 
 
As I said, Joe Biden won by about 33,000 votes. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won by 27,000 votes -- very close. There was a Senate race there two years ago. The Democrat won by just under 8,000 votes. It's tight there.
 
What are the dynamics in Nevada that make it this tight? Well, it's an urban-rural split -- one of the biggest urban-rural splits that we see in the entire country. 
 
Clark County, which is where Las Vegas is -- it's 75 percent of the vote -- 75 percent of the population in Nevada. Democrats need to do well in Clark County. 
 
You can see Joe Biden edged Donald Trump there 54 percent to 44 percent. It may not look like a huge margin, but he was able to bank a surplus of about 90,000 votes from Las Vegas in Clark County, and he needed them. Why? Because you look around at the rural counties. 
 
Look at the margins that Donald Trump had -- 84 percent, 78 percent, 76 percent, 75 percent -- just huge margins in the rurals. So he banks thousands and thousands of votes in all these rural counties that need to be offset by Clark County. Now there is one swing county in Nevada and that's Washoe County out where Reno is. You can see the margins here are very, very tight. Typically, as Washoe goes, so goes Nevada. Joe Biden won it in 2016. Hillary Clinton won it.
 
And just one thing I want to show you. You know, Nevada's not big -- not a lot of votes -- so you're fighting over the same votes. And elections can look pretty similar. 
 
Look at the margins in the presidential race in Washoe County in 2000 (sic) -- 50.8 to 46.3. These were the margins in the Senate race -- 50.8 to 46.3 in Washoe County. Exactly the same there. Not a lot of votes at stake. Elections can look pretty similar.
 
One other thing that people know about Nevada who follow politics closely, they vote early -- early in-person and early by mail. 
 
Now, Jon Ralston, who is sort of the Lord Savior of county early votes in Nevada -- he works for the Nevada Independent. This is where the early vote stands in Nevada right now. Of the ballots that have been returned or in-person, Republicans have an edge, 39.2 percent to 34 percent. 
 <br>[07:55:05]
 
Ralston notes this is an edge Republicans -- he hasn't seen them with this kind of edge before. This could bode well for Republicans. 
 
The unknown is this group right here, the other Independents unaffiliated. If Kamala Harris does very well with them, she could still win. There's still time. It's kind of a big unknown right now -- Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  Absolutely. And as John's talking about, that is one key battleground state and one key battleground state where Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are essentially chasing each other and having matching travel itineraries in these final days of the election. 
 
Both headed -- both held big events in Wisconsin yesterday and the heart of the battle there is happening in the suburbs. 
 
CNN's John King is visiting five battleground states in five days as part of his "All Over the Map" series. Here is battleground Wisconsin.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Sunrise in the suburbs. Pewaukee on the red side of a critical dividing line in battleground Wisconsin. 
 
Octane Coffee is a startup. Your morning jolt here prepared by a robot. Adrian Deasy is the founder and CEO.
 
ADRIAN DEASY, FOUNDER AND CEO, OCTANE COFFEE, WISCONSIN VOTER:  This is all of the robotics. KING (voiceover):  He grew up in a Democratic household and voted twice for Barack Obama. He moved to the Milwaukee suburbs a decade ago.
 
DEASY:  Toppings, cold foams.
 
KING (voiceover):  A self-described moderate ready to vote a third time for Donald Trump.
 
DEASY:  I just see that Donald Trump, from a business-minded standpoint, from a let's make a deal standpoint, and from an economics and financing perspective -- I think he's got the right mindset for how the country should be run -- how to support small and medium-sized businesses.
 
KING:  Are there downsides to him, in your view?
 
DEASY:  Does he have some character or personality things that go on? For sure. But I say you have to separate the message from the messenger sometimes.
 
KING (voiceover):  Trump won suburban Waukesha County in both 2016 and 2020, but his margin was smaller the second time and Wisconsin flipped back to blue.
 
Deasy believes Trump is stronger this time.
 
DEASY:  I would say over the last, say, six to 12 months, definitely a large Trump bump, if you'd want to call it that.
 
KING (voiceover):  Waukesha is a key test of whether Trump can reverse his suburban slide. And across the county line in Milwaukee, a pivotal test for Kamala Harris, too. 
 
This is the Tricklebee Cafe on Milwaukee's north side. "Pay what you can" is the motto here. We found a lot of apathy on our first visit to these predominantly Black neighborhoods a year ago. Chef Zakiya Courtney says the switch to Harris ended that.
 
ZAKIYA COURTNEY, CHEF, WISCONSIN VOTER:  You know, you got somebody that is younger. You have somebody that's agenda -- with an agenda. You've got somebody that's relatable. You've got somebody who understands the issues.
 
KING (voiceover):  Courtney hears talk more Black men are for Trump this time. She doesn't believe it's a big number. 
 
COURTNEY:  And I've heard what it is that people have said. I've heard people talk about the fact that she's been a prosecutor and she's put Black men in jail, and things like that. Well, you know, you have to look at that closer, you know. If you've done a crime you deserve to go to jail. And there's nothing that shows that she has a track record of targeting Black men and putting them in jail.
 
KING (voiceover):  This line for early voting is in Sherman Park, one of the northside neighborhoods where Harris needs high turnout and giant margins.
 
COURTNEY:  What I'm seeing right now is an enthusiasm and excitement that's even bigger than when Obama won.
 
KING:  The vice president's chances here depend on Zakiya Courtney being right, or at least close to right about that level of enthusiasm in the Black community. 
 
Joe Biden won only 13 of Wisconsin's 72 counties enroute to his victory here in 2020. How did he do it? Run it up big in the Democratic areas, like Milwaukee, and hold your own in the suburbs.
 
John King, CNN, Milwaukee.

SIDNER:  Our thanks to John King.
 
Now, both campaigns are bringing out the celebrities in their final push. 
 
For Donald Trump, in Wisconsin, Green Bay legend Brett Favre. And the whole-hearted endorsement of legendary astronaut Buzz Aldrin. 
 
Today, Puerto Rican superstar Jennifer Lopez will join Kamala Harris at a Las Vegas rally. And Jennifer Aniston posting this photo after she said she voted for Harris and Walz.
 
CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister is joining us now. We've seen singers, and actors, and athletes hitting the trail with their respective candidates, but we've also seen this. There's at least one who is publicly and -- he's mad -- rescinding his endorsement. Tell us about it.
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Sara. So yesterday, Puerto Rican reggaeton superstar Nicky Jam rescinding his endorsement of Trump. You may remember that last month, in September, he joined the former president at a rally in Las Vegas. He was wearing a red MAGA hat and he gave his endorsement. 
 
Well, after the remarks at Madison Square Garden which, of course, had angered so many Latinos around the country, Nicky Jam then posting on his Instagram yesterday a video saying that he is no longer supporting President Trump. Let's take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICKY JAM, REGGAETON SUPERSTAR (speaking foreign language):  The reason I supported Donald Trump was I thought he was the best for the economy in the United States where a lot of Latinos live, myself included. A lot of immigrants who are suffering because of the economy. And him being a businessman, I thought it was the best move. 
 
Never in my life did I think that one month later there would be a comedian who would criticize my country and speak poorly of my country. And for that, I withdraw my support of Donald Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)</pre>
