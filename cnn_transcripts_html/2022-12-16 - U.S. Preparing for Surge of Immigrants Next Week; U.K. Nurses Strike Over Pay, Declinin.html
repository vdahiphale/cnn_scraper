JOHN VAUSE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: All around the world, this is CNN NEWSROOM.
 <br>[00:00:38]
 
Ahead this hour, Ukraine warns that Vladimir Putin is planning a major offensive on Kyiv, with hundreds of thousands of Russian recruits part of a New Year's push to try again to capture the Ukrainian capital. 
 
The wait-in-Mexico rule is about to expire. A record number of migrants already crossing illegally and legally from Mexico into the U.S. set to surge. 
 
And acknowledging the sins of the pass to build a better future to U.S. and Africa relations. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with John Vause. 
 
VAUSE: We begin in Eastern Ukraine, where the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk has been targeted by one of the biggest attacks by Ukrainian fighters in years. According to officials loyal to Moscow, at least 40 rockets were fired at civilian areas in the city center early Thursday morning.

VAUSE: And to the North in Luhansk, also under Russian occupation, that was another attack, seen there in video posted on social media.
 
A local Telegram channel suggests the huge explosion resulted from an ammunition depot being hit. Neither Russian or Ukraine officials have said anything about these attacks. 
 
Meantime, the mayor of Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, reports that Russian forces were once again targeting critical civilian infrastructure. Authorities say Russian rockets hit a warehouse with no military ties, and two people were killed in the recently-liberated city of Kherson. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): During another Russian shelling of Kherson today, a shell hit the Red Cross aid station. A woman, a paramedic, a volunteer was killed. My condolences to the family. Only since the beginning of this day, Russia has already shelled Kherson more than 16 times in just one day. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: And the U.S. is planning to expand training for Ukraine's military, with 500 Ukrainians being sent to Germany every month, starting next month. 
 
Well, the sure in fighting comes as Ukraine's top general warns that Russia is preparing to 200,000 fresh troops for a New Year's offensive to try and take the capital. 
 
CNN's senior international correspondent, Will Ripley, has more now, reporting from Kyiv. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: On the Eastern and Southern front lines of Ukraine right now, the fighting has been intense. 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): There have been people who have died in Kherson after day after day of Russian shelling, attacks that have destroyed most of the administrative building and have essentially cut the entire city of Kherson off from the power grid, meaning that people who are living there, whether they be children, whether they be senior citizens, they are living in the dark, and they are living in the cold right now, cut off completely from their power grid. 
 
To the east in Donetsk region, the fighting has been fierce, as Russians try to take Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces hold the line after relentless bombardment, and the bombardment is also coming from the Ukrainian side. 
 
Russian-backed officials in Donetsk say that they suffered the worst attack since 2014, some eight years. And even though CNN cannot independently verify a lot of the claims that the pro-Russian-backed government is being -- is making, what we have seen are social media videos that have emerged showing destruction, showing fires. Russians claiming that a cathedral was hit, along with residential and commercial buildings and even entire intersections set on fire after dozens of rockets were fired from Ukraine. 
 
RIPLEY: This is the reality of the frontline conflict. It is draining resources. It is draining energy, and it's straining all of it at a time that the Ukrainians say they need to be looking ahead. They need to focus on what might be happening next. 
 
In an interview with "The Economist" the head of Ukraine's armed forces said, without citing specific or credible intelligence --
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): -- that he believes the Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops. And he said -- this is a quote -- "I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv." That's the Ukrainian capital.
 
And, unfortunately, there's no way to know whether this is, you know, based on specific intelligence the Ukrainians have, or whether they are using a tactic that the Russians have used very successfully throughout this war, and the Ukrainians, as well, which is to use information to their advantage and sometimes put deliberately misinformation out there. 
 
Nonetheless, we did visit the Northern border with Belarus, where Russian troops have been --
 
RIPLEY: -- increasing in numbers in recent weeks, and there have also been joint military exercises in recent days. And snap military inspections on the Belarusian side, as well.
 
And the Ukrainians are there. They're fortifying their Northern border, as well, potentially preparing for yet another front line in this conflict, a conflict that the Ukrainians say needs more advanced air defense systems.
 <br>[00:05:10]
 
So even before an official White House announcement of Patriot missile defense missiles coming to Ukraine, which was first reported by CNN out of the Pentagon, the Kremlin and the Russian embassy are already responding, threatening unpredictable consequences and saying that these Patriot systems, if they do come to Ukraine, would be a legitimate target. 
 
That is, of course, assuming they can find them and hit them. 
 
Now, before Patriots can actually be deployed here, it's going to require a significant amount of training. Military experts say these systems are highly complex. They require sometimes large amounts of people working in unison to operate them effectively, with little room for error. 
 
RIPLEY: In other countries, other U.S.-allied countries, when Patriots have been deployed, American forces are often there. Personnel are often there to assist.
 
But that's not going be possible here in Ukraine. Ukrainians are going to have to learn how to operate these systems autonomously to stave off the constant Russian bombardment that has been targeting the civilian power infrastructure, including some weapons that currently the Ukrainians don't have the capability to defend against. 
 
The Patriot could potentially be a game changer, but there's a long way to go between now and then. 
 
Will Ripley, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: To Cameron, Australia now. Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst of defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. 
 
Malcolm, thanks for being with us. 
 
MALCOLM DAVIS, SENIOR ANALYST OF DEFENSE STRATEGY AND CAPABILITY, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Thank you, John. 
 
VAUSE: So the overall commander of the Ukrainian military, General Valery Zaluzhny, told "The Economist" that he believes Russia is mobilizing 200,000 fresh troops for the second offensive on the capital. 
 
Quote, "Russian forces are 100 percent being prepared. A major Russian attack could come in February, at best, in March and at worst, at the end of January." 
 
So in anticipation of this, he's asking for hundreds of tanks, armored vehicles, Howitzers, other materiel. 
 
So unless the general is spreading disinformation, is this potential assault on Kyiv possible, or likely? Can Putin, you know, conscript another 200,000 men? Or does he have enough already? 
 
M. DAVIS: I don't think the Ukraine are spreading disinformation. I think this is probably going to happen. I think the question is when and how successful. 
 
Certainly, the information that I'm seeing online amongst various different expats and commentators, is that it will probably stage from Belarus South towards Kyiv, that the Russians are going to have another go at trying to capture Kyiv.
 
And the key issue is, will they make the same mistakes as they did at the beginning of the war? I don't think so. I think that the Ukrainians do have more of a challenge here going into 2023, because not only do they have to maintain their forces in Kherson Oblast and Donetsk, where they're being pushed back around Bakhmut, but they could now be facing a third front coming from Belarus itself. 
 
VAUSE: What stock do you put in the theory that the -- the attacks on the Russian -- on the Ukrainian infrastructure, rather, the power grid, is all part of a -- sort of a push to get some sort of cease- fire so that the Russian military can regroup and get ready for this, this you know, massive, major offensive in the new year? 
 
M. DAVIS: Well, certainly, we have yet to get into the depths of winter over there in Ukraine. And so as long as those attacks continue -- continue, the pain and the misery that the Ukrainian people are suffering in the cold will mount up. 
 
The Russians are clearly counting on these attacks to break the spirit and the will of the Ukrainians. I don't think that will succeed. I think because the Ukrainians understand that they cannot afford to give up, because if they give up, they essentially not only give up their country; they give up the lives of potentially millions of their people where Russia has occupied their territory. 
 
So the Ukrainians will continue to fight. But the Russians are clearly thinking that they can continue to attack those critical infrastructure, the power and so forth in a way to break that spirit and weaken the Ukrainian resolve. 
 
VAUSE: We have word now that there's this increased training for Ukrainian troops; 500 Ukrainians every month will be sent to Germany. It's for what's known as training on battalion-level operations. What does that actually mean? 
 
M. DAVIS: Battalion level of operations is generally concentrations of troops between 800 and maybe 1,200 troops in a battalion, at least in a Western battalion. 
 
And so, clearly what they're setting them up for is an ability to do larger-scale battles. And that actually aligns with this suggestion of a large-scale offensive by the Russians in the period between essentially January through march of next year. 
 
So clearly, they're preparing the ground for that, to train them in essentially combined arms tactics. The question is, will they give them the capability to do that? 
 
The Ukrainians are asking for armored fighting vehicles, for main battle tank. That's the sort of capabilities they need to have, if they're going to defeat the Russians, if, indeed, the Russians have the capabilities to carry out this offensive. 
 
It's not certain yet that the Russians will actually have the actual materiel on the ground to be able to carry out this offensive.
 <br>[06:10:03] 
 
VAUSE: And as far as any peace talks, well, neither side has actually entered in negotiations at the moment. But Ukraine's president told "The Economist," "If Putin now withdraws to the 1991 borders" -- in other words, give back Crimea -- "then the possible path of diplomats will begin. That is who can really turn to war from a military path to a diplomatic one. Only he can do it." 
 
I don't think he's going to do it. Is Zelenskyy getting out over his skis here? You know, with Europe heading into winter with an energy crisis, military shipments to Ukraine depleting weapons stockpiles at home? Is he risking the West's support and goodwill if he's seen as the one who's dragging this out? 
 
M. DAVIS: No, because as I said earlier, if the Ukrainians begin to negotiate and, essentially, allow Russia to maintain control over areas such as Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, they're effectively sacrificing the Ukrainian people in those regions to the sort of -- the brutality of the Russians that we've seen in other cities, Bucha and so forth. So I think the Ukrainians understand this is a fight to the end. They
 
 have to win. And for the West, the Ukrainians have to win, because if the Russians manage to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in this conflict, they will be emboldened. 
 
And in a few years' time, the Russians will be back, fully re-armed and ready for a wider war. So we have to ensure that Ukraine wins, and then, we have to deter Russia from ever attacking again. 
 
VAUSE: Yes. If people don't realize that Ukraine is actually the second biggest, largest military in Europe. The biggest, of course, being the Russians. So anyway.
 
Malcolm, good to have you with us. We appreciate it. 
 
M. DAVIS: Thank you very much. 
 
VAUSE: Well, plans by the Biden administration to end the so-called remain in Mexico program have been put on hold by a U.S. federal judge in Texas. 
 
The controversial Trump-era policy allows the U.S. to send certain non-Mexican citizens who have entered the U.S. back to Mexico. Previously, those migrants were either detained or released into the United States while their immigration proceedings played out. 
 
The number of people crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. is on the rise, and the White House is preparing for a surge next week, when it lifts a pandemic-era regulation known as Title 42. 
 
That also started under the Trump administration. It allows federal agents to return migrants to their home countries based on public health concerns. 
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera visited the border to see how people are preparing for this potential surge.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For nearly three months, Jason Biguez (ph) and his wife, Zulaima (ph), have waited for this moment, taking the final steps across the Rio Grande into the United States. 
 
JASON BIGUEZ (ph), MIGRANT: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 
LAVANDERA: Did you think reaching this point was going to be so emotional? 
 
BIGUEZ (ph): (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): He says they never thought the journey from Venezuela would be so painful. 
 
LAVANDERA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): I tell her I can see the emotion in her face and the sense of relief that she's entering the United States with her two sons. With that, they step across the river. 
 
The family says they could not wait any longer to see what might happen with the lifting of the Title 42 public health rule, which has kept 2.5 million migrants from requesting asylum in the United States. 
 
Jason (ph) and Zulaima (ph) are now part of the current surge of migrants entering El Paso. Officials say about 2,500 people per day are crossing. 
 
The migrants spend the night in a long, orderly line in the shadow of the barbed-wire border wall. Here, they wait to be called in by Border Patrol agents. 
 
They are then escorted to a processing facility to find out if they'll be deported or allowed to stay in the U.S., as their immigration case moves through the courts. 
 
MAYOR OSCAR LEESER, EL PASO, TEXAS: It's a band-aid to, really, a bigger problem. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): El Paso's mayor says, if Title 42 is lifted next week, the number of migrants crossing into the city could jump to 5,000 per day.
 
Already, shelters are out of space, and immigration processing facilities are overcapacity. Despite this, the mayor says he doesn't see a need to declare the situation a state of emergency. 
 
LEESER: I can tell you the only thing that I am 100 percent sure today that we will be prepared on December 21st, that if it is lifted, the community and city of El Paso will be prepared. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): At the river, hundreds are still waiting to get into the U.S., and the lines show no signs of slowing down. Before they crossed, Jason and Zulaima (ph) said they will wait in the frigid cold as long as it takes to get past the wall. 
 
I asked them what they will think if that happens? 
 
ZULAIMA (ph): [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 
LAVANDERA: "We're going to thank God, and it's going to be a new life for us." 
 
LAVANDERA: But tonight in El Paso, Texas, once again, shelters are overcapacity. Many migrants with no place to stay, waiting for bus tickets or plane rides out of this area. Once again, sleeping on the streets.
 
But as we see this unfold, a similar scene is also still playing out in Juarez, where there are a number of people who are choosing not to cross just yet.
 
They say they are waiting until next week to figure out what happens with Title 42 to figure out if they will cross. And they're doing that because they don't want to risk being deported, and they're waiting to see if the rules change come next week.

VAUSE: Castillo and his supporters again protested in the capital and elsewhere, undeterred by the government declaring a state of emergency. 
 
Castillo was removed from office last week after he tried to dissolve congress ahead of an impeachment vote. He's accused of rebellion and conspiracy. He denies the allegations. 
 
British nurses walked off the job Thursday, with as many as 100,000 members of the U.K.'s largest nurses union participating in an historic strike. They want high wages but also said the country's healthcare system is in crisis after years of decline. 
 
CNN's Isa Soares talked to nurses on the picket line in London. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's not often you see things like this outside London. Nurses really walking out of hospitals, St. Thomas's hospital over here, and onto the picket lines. 
 
And they are protesting very much what you're hearing: overworked and underpaid. 
 
More than 100,000 members at the Royal College of Nursing taking to the streets. Let's find out why they decided to do this. Let's talk to some of them. 
 
Can I ask you a very quick question? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry.
 
SOARES: Can I ask you a very quick question. We are CNN. How hard of this was for you to come out here today? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've actually been derogated, so I'm on my day off. But I fully support the striking.
 
SOARES: Why is it so important? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because people are fed up. It's been 12 years of cuts and not enough. And we're short staffed. People are exhausted. 
 
SOARES: I want to get some more. Thank you very much. 
 
Can I speak to you, you ladies. Anyone want to talk here. Clearly, you want to get your message across. Can I ask you, what are conditions like? I know so many of you have taken to the streets. What are conditions like? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Unsafe, it's just so unsafe. It's tiring to come in to work, day in and day out. And there's no staff; there's no one to help. You are providing a bed and a minimum care, and it's just not enough, and it's not fair. Patients don't deserve it. 
 
SOARES: Just explain to our viewers, really, around the world, you know, what conditions have been like? This is a historic strike. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. So, we've -- the NHS has been in crisis for many years. It's been steadily growing. 
 
COVID dealt us a body blow, and now our services, actually, I'd say, are in complete collapse. You know, people are waiting two or three hours for an ambulance. There's queues of patients outside A&amp;E. We have -- our wards are criminally understaffed day in and day out, and we can't provide proper care for patients. 
 
So it's really driven us through to take this drastic action. 
 
SOARES: So this is not just about pay. This is about much bigger health care? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, under U.K. law, we're only allowed to strike over pay. But we are fighting for investment in our health service, in better working conditions, in recognition for our profession and all the hard work and sacrifices we make. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: That was CNN's Isa Soares there, reporting in from London.
 
Well, British and E.U. central bankers are following Washington's lead in their efforts to tame record-high inflation. They raised interest rates by half a percentage on Thursday, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve did the same. 
 
Inflation on both sides of the English Channel is still in the 10 percent range. It did tick down marginally last month. 
 
There's growing concerns that more interest rate increases will push economies into recession, which is already looming in Britain. But central bank makers say they just don't have much of a choice. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTINE LAGARDE, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK: We decided to raise interest rates today and expect to raise them significantly further, because inflation remains far too high and is projected to stay above our target for too long. 
 
ANDREW BAILEY, GOVERNOR, BANK OF ENGLAND: Now, we think we've seen possibly this week, the first gimmer that, with the figures that were released this week, that not it's only beginning to come down, but it was a little bit below where we thought it would be. And that's obviously very good news, but it's a long way to go.

VAUSE: U.S. markets were down on Thursday after the Fed predicted the U.S. Economy will barely grow next year, around 0.1 5 percent. 
 
The Biden administration putting billions of dollars on the table for African nations. A three-day summit with African leader wraps up -- leaders, wraps up in Washington. When we come back, we'll have details on that. 
 
Also, new challenges for China as it reopens during another surge of COVID cases. How the government is defending its shift in tone. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:21:56]
 
VAUSE: U.S. President Joe Biden wrapped up a three-day summit with African leaders with a lot of promises, a show of respect and billions of dollars in aid. But will it all be enough to out-compete China? 
 
More now from CNN's Phil Mattingly. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, throughout President Biden's three-day Africa summit here in Washington, there has been one question looming over everything: how serious is this administration about its commitment to a continent that is so often left on the sidelines when it comes to U.S. foreign policy.
 
MATTINGLY (voice-over): And every step of the way, the president has seemed to try and answer that question; answer that question through very clear efforts, whether it's $55 billion committed over the course of the next three years.
 
Several events throughout the course of the day dedicated to trade, to dealing with hunger, dealing with very real, acute issues that African nations are dealing with at this moment. 
 
Outreach to leaders, private meetings, as well, a private dinner, as well, every single step symbolic, no question about it, in the first summit since 2014 and one that they hope will be very different in terms of the aftermath from that of former President Barack Obama. 
 
However, the reality remains, there is very real skepticism about what will actually come next, despite those commitments. This was how President Biden tried to address it. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States is all in
 
 on Africa and all in with Africa. African voices, African leadership, African innovation, all are critical to addressing the most pressing global challenges and to realizing the vision we all share: a world that is free; a world that is open, prosperous and secure. 
 
MATTINGLY: The president also committing to a trip in 2023 to several African nations. 
 
All of his top cabinet officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, planning to do the same, pushing for a place in the G20 for the African Union, on the U.N. Security Council to some degree, as well. 
 
These are all very tangible efforts that the U.S. is putting on the table. Whether or not they can follow through on them, get some of them over the finish line, deliver on the trade and investment commitments, still very much an open question. 
 
One official that I was speaking with earlier today made clear, while you watch the president, you may have watched the broader symbolism, what people should have been paying attention to is what the president's top deputies are doing, what his cabinet secretaries are doing; whether the Treasury Department, the Commerce Department, the Agricultural Department, across the board, each cabinet official holding and extensive set of meetings, making an extensive set of commitments. 
 
That more than anything else, according to this official, should underscore the scale of the commitment that this administration says they want to maintain for years to come. Whether or not that will actually happen, obviously, still, a very open question. 
 
Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House.

VAUSE: Joyce Davis is the outreach and opinion editor for "Penn Live," the online addition of the "Patriot" newspaper, as well as serving as president of the World Affairs Council of Harrisburg. Thanks for being with us. 
 
JOYCE DAVIS, OUTREACH AND OPINION EDITOR, "PENN LIVE": It's great to be here, thank you. 
 
VAUSE: Well, the U.S. president, he did not show up to this summit empty-handed. He promised he'd push for G20 membership for the African Union, and there was more. Here he is.
 
(VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[00:25:01]
 
BIDEN: We plan to commit $55 billion in Africa to advance the priorities we share and to support the agenda of 2063. That number represents a comprehensive commitment from the United States to invest in Africa's people, Africa's infrastructure, Africa's agriculture, Africa's health system, Africa's security and more. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: To be sure, $55 billion is a big chunk of change, but by comparison, China delivered $60 billion in financial support and investment in 2015, another $60 billion in 2018. The annual trade between China and Africa tops $200 billion. 
 
So what can the U.S. offer Africa that China can't? Because if money talks, then Biden walks, in a way. 
 
J. DAVIS: Well, right, but keep in mind, America is still America. We're still -- still the leading power on this planet. 
 
But more than that, America's good graces opens the door to Europe, as well. It opens the door to the West. It's a big deal. 
 
It's a big deal, for one thing, that the United States is starting -- and I say "starting" in quotes -- to take Africa seriously. 
 
This is a continent that is emerging as a major player. Antony Blinken has told us that in no uncertain terms. 
 
So he didn't come empty-handed. It isn't as much as China is doing, but the heft and weight of the United States is nothing to sneeze at. 
 
VAUSE: Well, at a White House gala on Wednesday night, President Biden acknowledged some of the sins of the past. Again, here's the president of United States. Let's listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: We remember the stolen men and women and children were brought to our shores in chains, subjected to unimaginable cruelty. My nation's original sin was that period. 
 
We honor their descendants, who are generations -- for generations have helped built this country and propelled it to higher heights, leading the charge, blazing new trails, and forging a better future for everyone in America. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: How important is it for future relations for the United States to take ownership of the past, or all of the past -- the good, the bad and the horrendous? 
 
J. DAVIS: I think it's very important. I think the honesty that he approaches Africa and the acknowledgment of the sins of America's past is extraordinarily important. It's a totally different attitude than the one of the previous administration. 
 
The previous administration treated Africa, basically -- I don't even want to repeat it -- with disdain. 
 
This administration, what we are hearing is a respect coming to the table and coming to the people of Africa with respect but acknowledging that it has not always been just in its treatment of black people. And of course, I speak as one of the descendants of those people brought to this country in chains. 
 
VAUSE: And while China's growing influences in Africa is one of the reasons why President Biden decided to have this summit, it's not the only country which is causing some concern. 
 
Here's the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Wherever we've seen Wagner deploy, countries find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, and less independent. That's the common denominator. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: He's referring to the mercenaries hired out by the Wagner Group, which is owned by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin -- I always get that wrong -- who is actually very close to Putin. 
 
But so how and where is Russia's presence most notable in Africa? 
 
J. DAVIS: You know, Russia's presence and its influence is all over the continent. But it's because it is also able to influence not only by supporting regimes and supporting strongmen that we would not like supported.
 
But keep in mind that it has been responsible for not having Africa speak with a unified and clear voice against the invasion of Ukraine. 
 
Look at the numbers. If Russia had not had the power and influence that it's had throughout that continent, this indeed would -- they would be stronger in condemning what has happened in Ukraine.
 
And Biden was very smart to connect his comments today with the food insecurity in Africa to that, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That may be one way to convince Africa and these       African leaders to stand with the United States and the West, and to help stop Russia's invasion. 
 
He did announce more than $2 billion in food assistance for Africa, which should be very important, especially given what has happened with the quantity (ph) prices and -- because of the war. 
 
Joyce Davis, thank you so much being with us, we appreciate it. 
 
J. DAVIS: It's great to be with you. Thank you. 
 
VAUSE: Coming up, after causing devastation in the South, a massive winter storm is non pounding the Northern U.S. The very least forecast in just a moment.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:32:33]
 
VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone, I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Well, they're cleaning up in many parts of the Southern U.S., after being hit by multiple deadly twisters. At least three people were killed, dozens were injured in the state of Louisiana. 
 
The National Weather Service confirmed that two EF2 tornadoes struck the New Orleans area. The powerful twisters ripped roofs off homes and brought down power lines. 
 
Well, this massive storm system is not done quite yet. It's bringing miserable winter weather to the Plains and the Northeast. The power outages reported in at least seven states. 
 
For more now, let's go to meteorologist Britley Ritz. So where is this going, and how much longer are we going to have to put up with this? 
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: A few more days here, John, across the Northeast. And back all across the Plains once again, the Northern Plains, to be specific. We'll talk about that here in a minute.
 
But the area of low pressure is now located over the mid-Atlantic. A lot of rain down towards Philadelphia on up until Long Island, and on the coastline of Connecticut, where that steadier rain is falling as of now. 
 
Most of the snowfall, up through the Catskills and back into parts of the Northern Appalachians. These are areas that are dealing with not only snowfall but ice. Numerous ice reports all across West Virginia back into parts of Virginia and Maryland, stretching all the way into New York, believe it or not. 
 
And some of these, you see that flashing dots right there? Picked up three tenths of an inch, and that's roughly about seven and a half millimeters of ice. 
 
And this is going to be an ongoing situation. Now, the ice will begin to melt some point. But on top of it, we're dealing with some snow, which isn't a good situation, because now, we're dealing with slick spots that we may not be aware of. 
 
Lake effect snow, expected up by Buffalo. Watertown could pick up roughly around 18 inches of snowfall. Winter storm warnings all the way up into New England, where we could roughly pick up nearly two feet by the time it's all said and done through the higher elevations. 
 
All right, watch this. Friday, Saturday, still holding onto the chance for rain on the coast, snow through the higher elevations, up through New England. 
 
And finally catching a break, we're left with some lake effect snow showers rolling into Saturday afternoon. 
 
But as for snowfall totals, we talked about picking up roughly about two feet in the higher elevations -- John. 
 
VAUSE: Britley, thank you. We appreciate the update. 
 
Well, Beijing is shifting responsibility for fighting COVID from government to individuals, as cases surge across the nation. This comes as China rolls back its zero-COVID policy, calls it a complete success, despite some heavy criticism. 
 <br>[00:35:05]
 
Despite offers to help from the United States, Japan and South Korea, Beijing says it can tackle this outbreak on its own through what it calls its whole nation system. 
 
And CNN's Selina Wang reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As COVID rapidly spreads throughout China, the Chinese government spin is that everything is fine, that China's COVID policy was a success, and is still a success. 
 
Propaganda has taken a complete U-turn, from declaring an all-out people's war on COVID to suddenly not telling people, our health is in your own hands. 
 
There's a lot of state media headlines like this. In "The People's Daily," the headline reads, "Start by wearing a mask, and be the first person responsible for your own health." 
 
In Shinghua (ph), the headline reads, "In the fight against the epidemic, everyone is the first person responsible for their own health." 
 
Other articles are praising the last three years of zero-COVID and hailing this pivot as an achievement, including this commentary from "The People's Daily" that has gone viral. 
 
The key lines are, quote, "The virus has weakened, but we have become stronger. Chairman Xi's insightful judgment, scientific and firm decisions shows his reliability as a people's leader. It pointed out and provided crucial guidance for us to win this people's battle, total battle and precise battle against COVID." 
 
A lot of people online, they're furious over that article. Some are calling it a lie that completely ignores the devastating impact of zero-COVID over the last three years --
 
WANG (voice-over): -- the trauma and pain that people faced during lockdowns. No apology or no admitting that the government has ever made a mistake. 
 
WANG: State media has instead focused on how the government is responding. The government said it will train volunteers and retired health workers to boost manpower. The government is increasing the number of fever clinics. WANG (voice-over):  This social media video shows people waiting
 
 inside a Beijing stadium that's been converted into a makeshift fever clinic. You can see some lines forming and people waiting on benches. 
 
We're already seeing hospitals under strain here in the capital, but the really big concern is what happens when people go back home for the upcoming Chinese new year, and COVID starts to spread more rapidly in the rural parts of China, with weaker health infrastructure.

VAUSE: Well, suspicions, screaming and a mental health crisis just some of the stunning revelations from the final episodes of the Harry and Meghan documentary. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Twitter has suddenly banned the accounts of several high- profile journalists, including CNN's Donie O'Sullivan and others from "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post." 
 
All of these journalists have covered Elon Musk extensively, the new owner of Twitter. And this appears to be his attempt to wield unilateral authority over the platform and raises questions about Musk's supposed commitment to free speech on Twitter, which he has called a digital town square. 
 
He bought it to save mankind, remember? 
 
Musk has since accused the journalists of doxing or publicly sharing his personal information. He wrote, "They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in obvious direct violation of Twitter terms of service." 
 <br>[00:40:05]
 
But CNN's Donie O'Sullivan never did that. He did report on a separate social media platform that allows an account to post the location of Musk's private jet. 
 
It's unclear whether the journalists' accounts are permanently banned, or they're temporarily suspended. 
 
Well, the last three episodes of the Harry and Meghan docuseries might just offer a rare glimpse into the cause of the bad blood brewing within the British royal family. 
 
The duke and duchess of Sussex alleged there was jealousy, lying, even some screaming. Max Foster has a closer look at the breakdown and the current state of royal relations. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRINCE HARRY, UNITED KINGDOM: Good morning. It's 6 a.m. on the 14th of March, and we are on the freedom flight. We are leaving Canada, and we are headed to Los Angeles. Shh.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The palace may have been spared in the first drop of episodes, but this time, Harry and Meghan didn't pull any punches. 
 
PRINCE HARRY: Everything that's happened to us was always going to happen to us, because if you speak truth to power, that's how they respond. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): In the final episodes of the couple's Netflix documentary series, Harry took aim at his brother. 
 
PRINCE HARRY: It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me, and my father say things that just simply weren't true, and my grandmother, you know, quietly sit there and sort of take it all in. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): The couple sharing their perspective on the royal rift, which in their words, push them out of the fold. It started during their tour of Australia, back in 2018. So successful it created Chelsea in the palace, they say. 
 
PRINCE HARRY: The issue is, when someone who's marrying in, who should be a supporting act, is then stealing the limelight or doing the job better than the person who was born to do this, that upsets people. It shifts the balance. 
 
Within four hours, they were happy to lie to protect my brother, and yet, for three years, they were never willing to tell the truth to protect us. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Meghan says the stress of the media coverage was too much, last year saying she didn't want to live anymore. 
 
MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: It was like all of this will stop if I'm not here. And that was the scariest thing about it, is it was such clear thinking. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): But she also suffered physically because of the stress of the worldwide coverage and in British newspapers, including "The Daily Mail," which published a letter she wrote to her father. 
 
PRINCE HARRY: I believe my wife suffered a miscarriage because of what "The Mail" did. They watched the whole thing. 
 
Now, do we absolutely know that the miscarriage was caused by that? Of course we don't. But bear in mind, the stress that that caused, the lack of sleep, and the timing of the -- timing of the pregnancy, how many weeks in she was, I can say from what I saw, that miscarriage was created by what they were trying to do to her. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): The family's response? Well, on Thursday, they showed a united front at a planned engagement, and the palace said they had no plans to comment on the series. Max Foster, CNN, London.
