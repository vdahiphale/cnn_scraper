ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Abu Dhabi, this is CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson. 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Welcome back. This is the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. Wherever you are watching in the world, you are 
 
 of course as ever more than welcome. 
 
I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is just after 7:00 in the evening. 
 
Dutch Police have launched a major investigation into multiple incidents of violence on Thursday night. Israeli football fans were attacked in what 
 
 authorities described as antisemitic attacks after video showed some fans chanting anti-Arab slurs and praising Israeli military attacks in Gaza. 
 
And in Gaza, the United Nations has found that nearly 70 percent of Palestinians killed there were women and children in what it describes as 
 
 systematic violation of international law. 
 
We'll speak to one of the organization's highest level officials, who has just returned from the besieged strip. 
 
And about 14,000 people in Southern California are currently under evacuation order as wildfires rage in the area. The fast-moving Mountain 
 
 Fire that you can see here has charred a vast amount of land in a short time and destroyed dozens of homes. 
 
Well, President-elect Donald Trump is said to be rolling up his sleeves and getting ready to move on his agenda on that much touted day one. Sources 
 
 tell us he's going through executive orders and policies that he wants to implement, as well as regulations that he plans to reverse. He's made his 
 
 first big appointment naming campaign manager Susie Wiles as his chief of staff. 
 
One person who is staying put, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. He's had a fraught history with Mr. Trump but he says he's not leaving until his 
 
 term expires in 2026. Now, his comments came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates again on Thursday. 
 
Well, more staff picks expected within days and job hopefuls aren't going far. 
 
CNN's Alayna Treene is in West Palm Beach, and "FIRST MOVE" anchor Julia Chatterley is in New York. 
 
Alayna, let's start with you. Susie wiles perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise, but she is the first female chief of staff, and Donald Trump 
 
 certainly touting that and her skills as innovative and exceptional. That is the first. What else is going on behind the scenes? 
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's a lot going on behind the scenes, Becky. A lot of jockeying and battles really taking place over who 
 
 is going to be selected. We know a ton of people have been calling up Trump, trying to, you know, meet with him at Mar-a-Lago, mingling with him 
 
 on the patio as they try and get their names in front of him. 
 
But I do want to talk a little bit about Susie Wiles because she's going to be, of course, a very important and integral part of what happens at the 
 
 White House once Donald Trump is sworn in. And it makes sense that she was the first person selected partly because he knows her so well. She has been 
 
 by his side really ever since he left the White House back in 2021, in many ways in a disgrace when a lot of people had abandoned Donald Trump, 
 
 particularly after the January 6th attack on the Capitol. 
 
Susie Wiles was still by his side. She remained loyal to him. That was a huge reason why he selected her first. Now one key thing about her as well 
 
 that I think will give you some insight into how perhaps Donald Trump will operate come next year is that she is someone who really believes in 
 
 controlling the chaos. That is how she puts it. She is someone and she's really said as well that if she were to get this role and once she has this 
 
 role, she wants to make sure that the clown car does not follow Donald Trump to the White House. 
 
That really means harpooning or hunkering down on one of the key things that she thinks is so important, which is to try and cut off access to some 
 
 of the controversial figures trying to get to Donald Trump, trying to pitch him on some crazy ideas or other things that they do not want him to be 
 
 thinking about. That is going to be something that she very much tries to implement. Again, she's done it very well on the campaign trail, but she's 
 
 going to try to implement again come their time in the White House. 
 
Now, as for other picks, look, I've been told that Donald Trump right now is very much focused first of all on finishing who his Cabinet will be. He 
 
 has been talking with a ton of, like I said, his allies, his advisers. But one key difference from this time around than in the aftermath of the 2016 
 
 election is they argue that Donald Trump is much more personally involved. 
 <br>[10:05:01]
 
He wants to sign off on every single Cabinet position, and really, any of the other major positions that will be filling out his administration. And 
 
 the reason that is a departure, it doesn't seem like, of course, the president-elect would want to be the one to make those decisions, but it is 
 
 a difference. It is a departure because last time Donald Trump came to Washington really without any political -- major political or knowledge of 
 
 Washington, D.C., and how it operated. 
 
But this time he feels way more confident, these sources say, about being able to make those decisions himself. He regretted not being the one to 
 
 really make the call last time around. And that is a big difference now. Part of the reason he also feels that confidence I'm told is because he's 
 
 feeling emboldened by receiving the popular vote. He is arguing that he now has a mandate and more flexibility to really carry out some of the key 
 
 agenda items that he had touted throughout the 2024 campaign trail. 
 
ANDERSON: That is fascinating. Let's turn to the world of business because we know the economy is front and center as far as Donald Trump is 
 
 concerned, as far as voters were concerned in this election. 
 
Let's bring in Julia Chatterley. The Federal Reserve taking a decision to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter of 1 percent, just a 
 
 day after this election. We've got another couple of opportunities for the Fed to move ahead of the inauguration on January 20th. So let's just talk 
 
 about that cut, why that cut now and what might happen next. 
 
I also want to talk about the politicization of that key position, the Fed chair and Jerome Powell and what was said yesterday about his position 
 
 going forward. Let's start with the business of what the Fed does. So what about this 25 basis point cut? What do you think of that move now and what 
 
 do we expect going forward? 
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: I think that was baked into the cake, Becky, so there wasn't going to be any other decision made today, 
 
 particularly as a result of the fact that we got a clean election result and everything was calm. I mean, the stock markets tell the story. There 
 
 was euphoria. 
 
December he left the door open for another cut and that was starting to come into question, primarily because, keep that payrolls number aside, 
 
 that was weaker. The data has been relatively solid and he suggested that in the meeting. Then comes the question of what they can do next year. And 
 
 this is the real challenge. It's not just about what they can do in terms of what the economy is telling them to do and the data. 
 
It's about the wild card which is the policies that the president-elect will choose. Obviously, we know that if he does enact in a worst-case 
 
 scenario huge limits to immigration, I'm talking illegal and legal, that could push up wages. And he enacts tariffs across many countries around the 
 
 world, that could be inflationary and raise prices, too. So that could in some respects tie the Fed's hands. 
 
What's interesting yesterday, someone asked him whether they could consider raising, not cutting raising interest rates next year. Just listen to what 
 
 he had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year? 
 
JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: No, I wouldn't rule anything out or in that far away, but that's certainly not our plan. I mean our baseline 
 
 expectation is that we'll continue to move gradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and that the 
 
 labor market will remain strong. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Now, just to be clear, no one is talking about rate rises, Becky, next year. But the fact that he's saying, look, I can't rule it out 
 
 just indicates where we are now. The economy is solid, even to your point if people don't feel it and didn't feel it because of inflation in 
 
 particular. But all bets are off. The wild card now is the president- elect's policies next year. 
 
ANDERSON: And I was wrong to suggest actually that there are two meetings before inauguration. I've just looked it up and January 28th, 29th would be 
 
 -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Just after. 
 
ANDERSON: -- next but one. And that is, of course, after inauguration day. So it will be interesting to see what happens next. 
 
Let's just get this -- the politics done. He was asked whether he would stand down if Donald Trump asked him to, and he said no. Can you just give 
 
 us some context to why that question was posed yesterday, Julia. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Because their relationship. Yes. Their relationship was so contentious in the first Trump administration. I mean, the president-elect 
 
 was downright rude to him a lot of times. So coming into this, the suggestion was, look, is he even going to have a job? What we've heard from 
 
 sources, advisers near the president-elect is that he will continue to keep Jay Powell in the role. 
 
And that makes sense, of course, because for now they're singing from the same hymn sheet. The president-elect likes lower interest rates. The Fed is 
 
 trying to lower interest rates. 
 <br>[10:10:02]
 
The wild card, of course, is whether or not the president-elect's policies allow him to do that. But this was a mic drop moment, Becky. He was asked 
 
 whether he would step down. He said no, silence, but, you know, so you're saying for legal reasons, he won't step down. No. And that was the end of 
 
 that. 
 
Look, the law is unclear. It would be Congress that would remove him, not the president-elect. But my takeaway was that that was an exciting part of 
 
 the meeting in what can be often quite dull. And it's going to be a lively couple of years, I will say that. 
 
ANDERSON: Isn't it just? 
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. 
 
ANDERSON: It's always good to have you, Julia. 
 
Alayna, thank you. A lively dateline that you now have there down in Mar-a- Lago, too. Good luck. Thank you. 
 
To Capitol Hill where control of the U.S. House of Representatives is of course still up for grabs. Sources tell CNN that members on both sides of 
 
 the aisle believe that the Republican Party will maintain control of the House once all the votes are counted but it could be days or even weeks 
 
 before a number of key races are officially called. 
 
CNN's Lauren Fox following all of this from Washington. 
 
And before we go on and talk about what happens next, can you just explain why it is that it could be some time before we actually get a result? 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Becky, a lot of these close races were happening in places like California, and it just takes a 
 
 really long time to count all of the ballots in that state. And, you know, there are still outstanding races. I just looked this morning about six 
 
 races in California and despite the fact that Republicans are winning in many of them, you know, Democrats and Republicans want to be patient. 
 
They want to make sure all the votes are counted before either side celebrates. In fact, yesterday on a call with Democratic members Hakeem 
 
 Jeffries and the campaign arm was really trying to inspire their members to remember that nothing is final until it's final. But I will say, you know, 
 
 both sides privately are very bullish that probably Republicans are going to take the House of Representatives and they're already planning on what 
 
 their agenda is going to look like, given the fact that they want to hit the ground running in January after Trump is inaugurated. 
 
ANDERSON: It of course will be clean sweep and it will be a lot easier for Donald Trump and a Republican Congress to get things done. 
 
The internal blame game, of course, amongst members on the Democrat side, has started briefly. Can you tell us more? 
 
FOX: Yes, I mean, I think Democrats are disappointed. Some Democrats are really sad. Some Democrats are really upset. They feel like there are many 
 
 periods to go back and review. I think it really depends on the member you talk to as to what they think the problem was. Right? I think Democrats who 
 
 are coming from rural places, they're arguing these are messages we have been trying to get the Democratic Party to listen to for years. 
 
We always have been warning that the party has been moving too far to the left. We are too focused on some of the social issues. We should be more 
 
 focused on economic issues. You have other people who are frustrated with the president and the fact that he didn't get out of the race sooner. They 
 
 feared that because he decided to stay in this race, it didn't give Harris a lot of time. 
 
I think, though, the reality is Democrats are going to have to move forward. You can't change what's already happened in the past, and you do 
 
 hear some Democrats in leadership sort of making that case that we have to go forward. We have to think about how we want to work with Republicans. 
 
The bottom line is, in the House of Representatives, legislation is not going to move super easily because whatever majority Republicans have, if 
 
 indeed they do clinch the majority again, is going to be so narrow that passing government spending bills, ensuring that the country doesn't 
 
 default on its debt next year, all of that is going to require bipartisan communication, bipartisan support, and that's just going to be the reality. 
 
So, yes, Republicans could have the White House, the Senate and the House, but the reality is they don't have a filibuster proof majority in the 
 
 Senate. They still only are going to have less than 60 seats there. And whatever majority Mike Johnson has, if Republicans end up with it, it's 
 
 going to be really small. And we saw how that went the last two years. 
 
ANDERSON: Absolutely. Always good to have you. Thank you. 
 
Well, the outgoing president is trying to remain upbeat as he faces questions and criticisms over the poor showing by Democrats in Tuesday's 
 
 election. Joe Biden told an audience at the White House Rose Garden on Thursday that all Americans must accept the choices made by voters and 
 
 urged Democrats to stay strong in the face of defeat. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. 
 <br>[10:15:02]
 
The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Arlette Saenz joins me now from the White House. 
 
I'm sure those who are incandescent at this point will have heard Joe Biden's words, but that blame game, as I understand it, Arlette, is in full 
 
 swing. Explain. 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it is, Becky. And there's really this debate within the Democratic Party about what exactly 
 
 went wrong for them in this election that ended with the reelection of former president Donald Trump. Many in the party are placing a lot of that 
 
 blame squarely on President Joe Biden. There are those who are frustrated that he had decided to seek a second term at the age of 80, and at a time 
 
 when there were many polls showing that Americans and even Democrats within his own party did not want him to run for reelection. 
 
People have argued that he stayed in this race too long, which really hampered the ability of any Democratic candidate to run a successful 
 
 campaign against Donald Trump. But for President Biden's part, so far, he has not engaged in any discussions about what went wrong for Democrats. 
 
 That is not something you heard from him yesterday as he was in the Rose Garden really conceding this loss to Trump and also trying to stress that 
 
 he will engage in that peaceful transfer of power. 
 
Of course, one of the key lines in his remarks was you can't only love this country when you win. That is a quote that he would often deploy as an 
 
 attack line against Trump, who did not participate in any type of peaceful transition when Biden was coming into office, and instead he was 
 
 repurposing it in this speech. But there are so many questions about what Biden's legacy will look like going forward, especially after the outcomes 
 
 of this election. 
 
Biden had run back in 2020 to defeat Trump, to defeat his brand of politics. He won, but then lost after these last four years in office. So 
 
 that is something that will hang over the president moving forward. Now for his part, he has said that there's still more work to do, that people here 
 
 at the White House should be proud of their accomplishments. And in his remarks yesterday, Biden stressed that some of the things that they've 
 
 accomplished, if you think about the Infrastructure Bill or the CHIPS Act, that that will take many, many years to come to fruition. 
 
And that is something that has always been a struggle for the Biden administration in this campaign, is that they had some tangible outcomes, 
 
 some tangible legislation that they've passed that many Americans weren't seeing the immediate effects in their lives. So for President Biden in 
 
 these final weeks, they're going to try to do more work to try to shore up his legacy, trying to safeguard some of those initiatives that they've put 
 
 into place. 
 
But of course, Trump could come into office and undo many of the things that Biden had set forth in his four years in office. 
 
ANDERSON: Arlette Saenz is at the White House in Washington, D.C., where the time is 10:17 in the morning. Thank you. 
 
7:17 here in Abu Dhabi. Ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD, a shocking night of violence in Amsterdam. Why Dutch and Israeli officials are condemning the 
 
 attacks as antisemitic. 
 
More on that after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:20:34]
 
ANDERSON: Well, shame and disgust are being expressed by the Dutch government. It's condemning what it calls antisemitic attacks on Israeli 
 
 citizens in the Dutch capital on Thursday night. 
 
In this graphic video Israeli football fans can be seen being beaten and injured in violent clashes in Amsterdam. One Israeli official said at least 
 
 10 of its civilians have been hurt in the violence, which broke out after a match between Ajax Amsterdam and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Amsterdam's mayor spoke 
 
 a short time ago. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FEMKE HALSEMA, AMSTERDAM MAYOR: Well, you know, we're an old city with a tumultuous history. We are an international city, and as an international 
 
 city, we also have the international tensions in our city, and we are used to it. But we pride ourselves that we are a peaceful city and a tolerant 
 
 city. And last night we were very much ashamed because tolerance and peace were not there. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Maccabi fans were caught on video going to a metro station chanting, let the IDF win and bleep the Arabs. And social media videos 
 
 showed men ripping Palestinian flags off buildings. We have bleeped out the profanities in this video. 
 
The Israeli foreign minister is on his way to Amsterdam to meet with his Dutch counterpart. We are live in Amsterdam, where we're joined by CNN's 
 
 Melissa Bell and CNN's Matthew Chance is in Jerusalem for perspective from there. 
 
Melissa, just describe what the perspective is there and the atmosphere. 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A great deal of shock as you heard expressed there by the mayor of Amsterdam, given this 
 
 particular European city's fame for being tolerant and somewhere where communities live harmoniously side by side. 
 
As you mentioned there a moment ago, Becky, those tensions had been rising since Wednesday when those first Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had begun arriving 
 
 here in Amsterdam. We saw the scenes here on Dam Square Wednesday, the Dutch Police then put on extra police forces as that tension was rising 
 
 against the match. 
 
What we understand happened is that initially, after the match had finished, things were fairly calm. It was later on in the night that you 
 
 saw those extremely shocking and violent scenes showing what Dutch authorities have now described as hit and run. That is, Israeli citizens, 
 
 supporters, football supporters were hunted down and brutally assaulted, and initially we saw in the aftermath of that overnight, those five people 
 
 ending up in hospital. 
 
They've all now been released and all of the Israelis that initially had been feared to be missing have now been accounted for. Still, we know that 
 
 Israel's foreign minister has now arrived in the city. The first of the planes bringing the Israeli fans back to Tel Aviv has arrived back in 
 
 Israel. But here in Amsterdam, it's a city really reckoning with the violence of what happened. 
 
Have a listen to what the prime minister had to say a short while ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DICK SCHOOF, DUTCH PRIME MINISTER: I'm ashamed that this happened in the Netherlands, and it's a terrible antisemitic attack. And we will not 
 
 tolerate. And we will prosecute the perpetrators, and I'm deeply ashamed that it could happen in the Netherlands in 2024. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BELL: The antisemitic nature of the attacks clearly picked up by Dutch officials over the course of the last few hours, Becky. An investigation 
 
 has been opened and there are fears now about what happens going forward. There will be another match this time in Paris next week that will we 
 
 understand go ahead despite what has happened in Amsterdam this week -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: And Israeli forces or authorities. Thank you, Melissa. 
 
Let's bring in Matthew Chance. Authorities sending rescue planes for those fans. What more do we know at this point? 
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they sent a rescue plane already, Becky. 
 <br>[10:25:02]
 
There's another couple going to be returning to Israel later on this evening to Ben-Gurion Airport, where they'll be met with police to take 
 
 statements and forensic teams to collect evidence. They say they're going to be coordinating, cooperating with the Dutch authorities, the law 
 
 enforcement authorities, to bring prosecutions against those responsible for these antisemitic attacks. 
 
But there's a more general review taking place as well. My sources inside the Israeli Foreign Ministry telling me that they're reviewing security now 
 
 for Israeli sports teams competing in other countries in Europe. Melissa mentioned there a possible match taking place in Paris next week. That will 
 
 be under scrutiny as well. But also a general review taking place for -- security review for Israelis living abroad because what the Israeli 
 
 authorities say is that this isn't a problem obviously that is specific to the Netherlands. It's not specific to Amsterdam. 
 
It's a more general rise in antisemitism that they have seen or taken note of particularly since the October 7th attacks. And so what they're saying 
 
 is that that more needs to be done to protect Israeli fans, to protect Israelis in general in these countries when those kinds of pro-Palestinian, 
 
 you know, kind of protests are taking place. And so that's the review that is currently underway as they bring back Israeli citizens over the course 
 
 of the next few hours back to Israel for medical treatment and just to get them back home -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: And the statement by the prime minister -- Matthew, thank you. 
 
Benjamin Netanyahu writing, and I quote, "Tomorrow, 86 years ago was Kristallnacht, an attack on Jews, whatever jews they are, on European soil. 
 
 It's back now. Yesterday we celebrated it on the streets of Amsterdam. That's what happened. There is only one difference. In the meantime the 
 
 Jewish state has been established. We have to deal with it." 
 
Well, French officials say Israeli police forced their way into a French owned holy site in Jerusalem on Thursday and briefly detained two staff of 
 
 the French consulate. France is condemning the move, which is the latest in a series of events that have sent relations between the two countries 
 
 frankly plummeting. 
 
Meantime civil rights groups in Israel are criticizing a new law. That law allows the government to deport family members of people judged to have 
 
 carried out an act of terrorism. The law passed in the Knesset this week. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel says, and I quote, "All citizens 
 
 and residents are entitled to rights and protections not least of which is immunity from deportation from their country." 
 
We've been hearing about Pyongyang sending troops to Russia to support its war in Ukraine. Well, now it is -- there is evidence that they are engaged 
 
 in battle. So says Ukraine's president, at least. Speaking in Hungary on Thursday, Mr. Zelenskyy said that 11,000 North Korean soldiers were on the 
 
 ground in Russia near Ukraine's border and that fighting had resulted in fatalities, although he did not say which side suffered those casualties. 
 
 The clashes are the result of a close military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang. 
 
Well, elsewhere in Europe, Goldman Sachs predicting Donald Trump's proposed policies, including hefty tariffs, will hurt the continent's economic 
 
 standing. The investment bank is also pointing to what it sees as pressure on Europe to increase defense spending. 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson has more on how the incoming Trump administration could impact America's European allies. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Raging wars in Ukraine and the Mideast, an informal alliance of enemies, Russia, 
 
 China, Iran and North Korea, are the obvious changes in world order President-elect Donald Trump inherits. Less talked about since he left 
 
 office in 2021 the political weakening of some of his former putative allies particularly in Europe. 
 
Elections in France undermined President Emmanuel Macron's standing. Germany's chancellor Olaf Schulz has a tanking economy and a collapsing 
 
 governing coalition. Both of these E.U. powerhouses losing political ground to right-wing populists who are on the rise across Europe. In Italy, a 
 
 right-wing populist, Giorgia Meloni, won elections, is a fan of Trump. But Trump also lost supporters. 
 
BORIS JOHNSON, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Thank you all very much. 
 <br>[10:30:01]
 
ROBERTSON: U.K. PM Boris Johnson gone from power. The Conservative Party trounced in recent elections by trend-bucking Keir Starmer's left-leaning 
 
 Labour Party. Where all these changes get tested first, likely over Trump's campaign promise to end Russia's war in Ukraine in a day. 
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I'll have that done in 24 hours. 
 
ROBERTSON: And threats to pull America's Ukraine funding. As almost 50 European leaders gathered in Budapest just two days after the U.S. 
 
 elections, Trump's victory and Ukraine are top topic. Trump ally and meeting host Hungarian PM Viktor Orban in close conversation with Macron 
 
 and Starmer. Starmer then with Macron just the tip of the iceberg of debate on this frosty issue. And Starmer later with Ukraine's Zelenskyy. 
 
KEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: But as you know our support for Ukraine is unwavering. 
 
ROBERTSON: The unspoken question in Budapest -- can Europe go it alone? 
 
ALEXANDER DE CROO, BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER: We should be very clear on this. European security is not something that we outsource to someone else, for 
 
 example, to the United States. 
 
ROBERTSON: Macron said the same thing. But already clear the opening pitch to Trump -- we need you. 
 
DE CROO: We are open to discuss with the United States on how we can work better together. 
 
ROBERTSON: And at the sharp end of Europe's self, NATO's new chief, another change for Trump. 
 
MARK RUTTE, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: I look forward to sit down with Donald Trump to discuss how we can face these threats collectively. 
 
ROBERTSON: It's a bold gambit, but read through it, Europe isn't ready to stand up to Putin alone. 
 
Nic Robertson CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, you're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. Just after half past seven here in Abu Dhabi, broadcasting from our Middle 
 
 East programing hub, of course. 
 
When we come back, I'll speak to the U.N. coordinator Muhanned Hadi, who has just returned from Gaza City. The situation, in his words, is beyond 
 
 imagination. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson for you. 
 
A new report from the United Nations finds that women and children make up nearly 70 percent of those killed during the war between Israel and Hamas 
 
 in Gaza. Now these numbers come from the 8,000 fatalities that the organization has been able to independently confirm, far lower than the 
 
 43,000 counted by local health officials in Gaza. 
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
But the data do support the Palestinian claim that women and children make up a majority of those killed. Meantime, Israel ramped up bombings across 
 
 Gaza on Thursday and issued fresh evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza, which, as we've been reporting, has been under siege for weeks now. 
 
Now Muhanned Hadi is the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory, and he's just returned from Gaza. His trip 
 
 included a visit to a U.N. school, where people were sheltering. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MUHANNED HADI, U.N. HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORY: There were 500 people in this school in September, and now there 
 
 are more than 1500 people. There are no access to bathroom. There is shortages of food. The situation is unbearable 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Unbearable, Muhanned said, and he joins us now live from Amman in Jordan. 
 
Thank you for joining us. I know that you've just come out of Gaza where you visited Gaza City. 
 
Muhanned, this was your first trip since Israel launched renewed military operations in northern Gaza about a month ago now. Now describe what you 
 
 saw on the ground where you were and how much has changed since your last trip well. 
 
HADI: Thank you, Becky, for having me. The last time I was there was in September and then this week I managed to enter northern Gaza. I can tell 
 
 you there is a huge change in what I've seen in Gaza City. The school that I visited that you showed in your report, I haven't seen anything close to 
 
 this. And I have been in this business for 34 years now. I haven't seen anything like this. 
 
That school with a maximum capacity of 500 people, it has now more than 1500 people inside it. People are now staying in the bathrooms. So 
 
 basically what the people in the classrooms are doing, they made a corner of the classroom as a bathroom, and they dug a hole in the wall so all 
 
 those sewage water is coming out. There is a pool of sewage water next to the school with garbage and solid waste in it, where children actually are 
 
 playing. 
 
The school, the classrooms are just jammed with people on top of each other. And this is the first time I have to tell you where children 
 
 followed me to the car and adults asking for food, telling me that we are hungry. I have never seen anything, anything like that. It's really heart-
 
 breaking. My colleagues and I were really devastated with what we saw in that school. 
 
ANDERSON: Shocked even though you would have been, you know, informed by those colleagues who are on the ground regularly just what was going on. It 
 
 was still beyond imagination. That's what you're saying? 
 
HADI: That's exactly what I am saying. I haven't seen anything like that in my career. And I worked in difficult places, Becky. The women I've talked 
 
 to, they told me that they are now shaving their heads because they have no access to shampoo. They don't have soap. They are very concerned about 
 
 their safety, about their children. They need an end to this war. When I asked them, what is it that you want, they said we want a ceasefire, but a 
 
 permanent ceasefire. 
 
We want to end this feeling that we could die the next hour. We need to feel safe again. If we feel safe, then we can start rebuilding our lives. 
 
ANDERSON: How much aid and supplies are getting into the area where you were? 
 
HADI: First of all, in the entire Gaza Strip, October was the worst month. The World Food Programme only reached 20 percent of its intended 
 
 population. October wasn't any better. It was 30 percent. For northern Gaza, this is that the -- yesterday was the first time where we reached 
 
 Beit Hanoun. But unfortunately we couldn't enter into Beit Hanoun. We took a convoy of 11 trucks, one truck of water, 10 trucks of aid. 
 
The convoy was held at the checkpoint for more than two hours. What happened is people came to the convoy and they took most of the food. After 
 
 that, the convoy continued with only one and a half trucks, but again couldn't reach the destination. Food is becoming, is becoming an issue. All 
 
 aid, all humanitarian aid is really a shortage. 
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
Let me tell you a story after, when I moved from the north to the south, we stopped at a checkpoint where people were trying to cross Netzarim, 
 
 crossing to the south. We saw few families there, children, elderly, women. They made a sign to us that they wanted to drink water if we had any water. 
 
 So my team collected all the water and the food we had, and we gave them. We collected our lunch boxes, our snacks, and we gave them. The kids came 
 
 running to the car. They took whatever snacks we gave them. 
 
I couldn't forget -- I can't forget one girl saying to her sister, I can't remember the last time I have seen an apple. You should have seen the look 
 
 at their faces when they saw an apple in the lunchbox that we gave them. Let alone they were without shoes. It's been difficult. 
 
After that checkpoint, Becky, we proceeded to Gaza, 150 meters down the road. We just saw a body lying on the side of the road. My colleagues 
 
 stopped the convoy and told me, we will not keep this body for the dogs to eat. So they took a risk. Left their armored vehicle, put the body, put the 
 
 body in a body bag, tied it, tied it, tied the body bag on the hood of the U.N. vehicle and we drove for few kilometers until we found the Palestinian 
 
 Red Crescent and handed the body to them. This is something my colleagues in Gaza face every day. 
 
ANDERSON: Back in October, the U.S. sent a letter to the Israeli government giving them 30 days to improve humanitarian access or face repercussions. 
 
 The deadline for that is next week. 
 
Muhanned, here's what the U.S. State Department spokesman said about Israel's progress yesterday. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: We have seen Israel take a number of important steps over the past several weeks, including in just 
 
 the past few days. They reopened Erez Crossing, as you heard me report before, but they have also informed us that in the coming days, in the next 
 
 few days, they plan to open an additional new crossing at Kissufim. 
 
They have approved additional delivery routes inside Gaza, which is something that is critical because, as you know, the problem has not only 
 
 been getting humanitarian assistance to the crossings but then getting it out of the crossings and getting it delivered to the people who need them. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: I realized that some of the steps that he just mentioned may have just happened, but from what you saw on the ground, do you expect any sort 
 
 of moves at this point that that he was just discussing there to improve the humanitarian situation significantly? 
 
HADI: Becky, we as humanitarians are dealing with the results of failed politics. This is the consequences of the failed politics. For us as long 
 
 as one woman, one child, go to bed hungry, we have failed in our job as humanitarians. It's not about taking one or two steps. It's about ending 
 
 this war. It's about ending this madness. It's about providing aid to the people and protection. 
 
It breaks my heart when people talk about trucks when it comes to Gaza. It's not about trucks. It's about people like us. It's about women and 
 
 children. It's about the protection. It's about gender based violence that we cannot load on trucks, Becky. It's about the exploitation that people 
 
 are going through. It's about more than 17,000 minors running in the streets of Gaza without any protection. Girls and boys. This is what it 
 
 boils down to. This has to end. We have waited for so long. We have asked for this many, many times. We sound like a broken record. 
 
It's different when you go there, Becky. I wish you can have an opportunity to go there and witness that for yourself, and listen to the people, listen 
 
 to the women and the children. Listen how tension in -- I visited Khan Younis, one of the camps in Khan Younis. The stories that women told me, 
 
 how kids are terrified, when they hear a plane, when they hear a drone. The tension between the families just simply over having access to a bathroom. 
 
A woman journey to a bathroom is a nightmare. Women, if they have access to drinking water, to safe drinking water, they think twice or three times, 
 
 including pregnant women. Should I drink this water? Because she knows if she drinks water, then there is a need to go to the bathroom and bathrooms 
 
 are an issue for those people. 
 <br>[10:45:12]
 
ANDERSON: Muhanned, you are aware we've been reporting for some time that we can't Gaza and as international journalists the day that we can of 
 
 course we will be on the ground. And I'm ready to report from the ground. But it's opportunities like this that I get to speak to those of you who 
 
 have been and who can give us a real understanding of the situation on the ground. And for that, I thank you very much indeed. Thank you. 
 
We're going to take a very short break. Back after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, the FBI is investigating a spate of racist text messages being sent anonymously to people across the United States. Dozens of black 
 
 Americans, including children, were sent the offensive texts. One of them refers to slave catchers being sent after the recipient, and that they 
 
 would be made to pick cotton at the nearest plantation. Well, these messages came just a day after the highly polarized presidential election. 
 
CNN's Gabe Cohen joins me now live from Washington. 
 
What's the latest that you are learning, Gabe? 
 
GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, first off, this is becoming much more widespread than we initially realized. We now have reports of 
 
 people getting these messages in at least two dozen states across the U.S. These texts are personalized, and many of them specifically target black 
 
 and brown individuals. Some of them children. 
 
I want to put one of the texts back up on the screen to talk you through what we're seeing here. If we can get that text up. Several were sent to 
 
 us, this one included. You can see it's blurred out there, but the text has the person's name at the top of it, and then it references picking cotton 
 
 as you mentioned. It references slave catchers, plantations. And some of these messages specifically reference President-elect Donald Trump. 
 
Now, to be clear, the Trump campaign tells us they have absolutely nothing to do with these messages. They denounce them. But as you know, many people 
 
 are on edge right now in these days since the election. We have a statement in from the president of the NAACP who said these messages represent an 
 
 alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country who now feel emboldened to spread hate and stoke the flames of 
 
 fear that many of us are feeling after Tuesday's election results. 
 
So obviously, Becky, a lot of people are on edge right now. The big question here is, who's behind this and we don't have an answer at this 
 
 point. 
 
ANDERSON: The investigation continues. Gabe, good to have you. Thank you. 
 
Well, a wildfire in Southern California is destroying everything in its path. 
 <br>[10:50:03]
 
It is already so ferocious. It's burnt thousands of hectares, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. The conditions firefighters are 
 
 now facing just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Thousands of hectares burned and homes destroyed. More than 40,000 people are under evacuation orders in Southern California, as we 
 
 speak, as firefighters battle a massive wildfire there. These dry conditions and gusty winds fueled the Mountain Fire causing it to spread 
 
 very quickly and some residents say they barely made it out alive. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is like surreal. I mean, I know we live in a fire danger area, but this -- it came out of nowhere. It was so fast. 
 
RICHARD GALANTE, LOST HOME IN MOUNTAIN FIRE: But I'm on 14 medicines for my heart and my stomach and all my -- everything got destroyed. We didn't have 
 
 time to do anything. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, CNN's Camila Bernal is on the ground in Camarillo in California with an update if you will on the conditions there. 
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Becky. So we are seeing some progress thanks to the weather conditions, but just so much 
 
 devastation left behind. The sheriff saying this was just heartbreaking devastation. They had teams yesterday, 10 teams going around home by home. 
 
 They went to about 300 of them. And unfortunately at least 132, they found like the one you see here behind me everything is gone. You know, it's hard 
 
 to even point out what's left of this home. You can see the entrance here behind me and you can see the chimney still standing but the rest is all 
 
 gone. 
 
So they found 132 structures that are completely destroyed and 88 others that are damaged. And authorities say this work of assessing the damage is 
 
 not done yet. So that means those numbers could still go up. So the piece of good news is the weather conditions. We had red flag warnings in place 
 
 in the low and in the high areas. Right now, only the red flag warning is in place for the mountains, and that's going to be in place until about 
 
 11:00 a.m. local time. So there is that light at the end of the tunnel. 
 
An official saying they're going to try to do everything they can while the weather is cooperating before it changes again. But they also say that 
 
 there's a lot of unknowns and things that could change and could continue to make this firefighting even more difficult. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
THOMAS SHOOTS, FIRE CAPTAIN, PIO: The challenge is with this red flag going away, which is a great thing. We now have that onshore push. And so there's 
 
 areas of the fire that haven't been wind-tested in the same way because the wind has been pushing those embers into the fire. So for example, the 
 
 northeast portions of the fire are now going to see that wind pushing it into potentially unburned fuel. 
 
So a huge priority to get those buttoned up, make sure those are good but we are going to be able to make a lot of good progress out on the ground, 
 
 in the air cooling down those hotspots and trying to keep it from spreading. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: So containment right now is at 5 percent. And you heard there from CalFire, they're expecting more progress today. So we are expecting that 
 
 number to continue to go up. Again, they want to do everything they can now before next week because what happens next week is those red flag warnings, 
 
 those Santa Ana Winds, will come back. 
 <br>[10:55:01]
 
They're in the forecast. And so the idea is to get everything they can so that they could be in better shape come next week. They've been working 
 
 around the clock and they have been able to make progress in the air. They flew the helicopters and the airplanes overnight during those water and 
 
 retardant drops. And so again, they feel that things are improving but it's still very early. It's still 5 percent containment. People are not allowed 
 
 to come back into their homes just yet. 
 
So they are still telling people to continue to be careful, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: And we heard from people who are frightened and frankly exhausted admitting that they or conceding that they live in an area that is, you 
 
 know, is -- has a fire risk. But ultimately do residents feel that this area is now sustainable for living? Very briefly. 
 
BERNAL: You know, Becky, a lot of people come back and they see the destruction, but they say, I will rebuild. That's really the sentiment from 
 
 a lot of the people that live in this area. So you're likely going to see people stay here. 
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you. Thank you very much indeed. 
 
And it is good to have you wherever you have been watching. It's always good to have you on board. You've been watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, 
 
 Becky Anderson. From the team working with me here in Abu Dhabi and those working with us around the world, it is a very good evening. 
 
Stay with CNN, "NEWSROOM" with Rahel is up next.
