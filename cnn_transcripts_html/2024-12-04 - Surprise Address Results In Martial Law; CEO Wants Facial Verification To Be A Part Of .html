COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. I`m Coy Wire. Welcome to CNN 10. It`s Wednesday, December 4th, and that means one of you helped us write 
 
 today`s show. So listen up to see if we chose your unique word to help boost our vocab today. 
 
We`ve got an action-packed show, 10 minutes of news. Let`s get to it. We start in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in 
 
 a surprise TV address on Tuesday. In short, martial law is a temporary rule by military authorities in a time of emergency.
 
Yeol is accusing the country`s main opposition party of sympathizing with North Korea by taking actions he says are aimed at inciting a rebellion. 
 
 Following the announcement, protests were seen outside the parliament, and South Korea`s parliament had voted to block martial law. This is a 
 
 developing story, and we`ll have more on this in tomorrow`s show.
 
Next, today concerns are being raised over facial recognition, technology being powered by artificial intelligence used to identify a person from an 
 
 image or video. Now it`s technology that`s been around for quite some time, and it`s part of some of our daily lives. We might use it to unlock our 
 
 phones, access our virtual wallets, maybe even prove our identity to get in a shorter line at the airport.
 
The convenience and security it offers are driving factors in its growing use, but while facial recognition technology is becoming more difficult to 
 
 avoid in today`s world, it is not foolproof. The tech raises privacy concerns, especially if facial images are collected without consent. 
 
 Sometimes individuals can be misidentified due to factors like lighting or angles.
 
And did you know that there have been occasions where that has led to the wrong people being accused of crimes? Algorithms can also carry the biases 
 
 of the people who build them, leading to some demographics being targeted more than others. 
 
On top of all of this, there is little regulation over the technology, and no guardrails governing how this sensitive data is collected, stored, and 
 
 who has access to it. So some have concerns about the data falling into the hands of people with unscrupulous intentions. 
 
CNN`s Sara Sidner sat down with the CEO of CLEAR, the company that uses facial recognition and other biometric data like fingerprints to fast track 
 
 your experience at the airport. 
 
Here`s why she thinks facial recognition should be part of everyone`s everyday life.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Caryn Seidman-Becker is the CEO of CLEAR, you know, the company with the kiosks at the airport that 
 
 allows you to skip the other lines for a fee. 
 
(On camera): So, your company is really sort of a disruptor type of company. It`s there. It`s different. You go. You get your eye scanned. You 
 
 get your finger scanned. But once it got really popular, then we, as customers, started getting frustrated because the lines started getting 
 
 long. What are you doing about that?
 
CARYN SEIDMAN-BECKER, CLEAR CEO: I always say, we`re obsessed with the member experience. We look at data all day long. We can see tons of trends. 
 
 This has been a period of improved member experience over 2024. We expect to see that accelerate over the next 12 months as we roll out our Face 
 
 First technology, which is really awesome. It`s in about 12 airports today. It`s been two weeks, and it is, you know, five times as fast.
 
SIDNER (voice over): We asked to see that new tech.
 
(On camera): So, you`re in line somewhere.
 
SEIDMAN-BECKER: It was too fast. I`m done.
 
SIDNER (voice over): We clocked it. Less than two seconds.
 
SEIDMAN-BECKER: I think the coolest thing that we`re working on is really the concept of the secure identity network.
 
SIDNER: How could this end up making life easier, not just at the airport?
 
SEIDMAN-BECKER: Not only can it make life easier, it is making life easier. So, we want to go from using it multiple times a year in airports, to 
 
 multiple times a day. 
 
Today, let`s just say you live in L.A. You could use it getting into an Uber for rider verification within the rider app. And then let`s say you`re 
 
 going to the Intuit Dome to watch a Clippers game with just your face and CLEAR, right, because you are your age and your payment. 
 
You could check in at a doctor`s office with your face. You`re there for your appointment. What I see as the ultimate check in at the doctor`s 
 
 office is, your face is your appointment, it`s your insurance card that`s verified and validated, and then it is also your copay and your credit 
 
 card.

WIRE: Pop quiz, hot shot. 
 
What aquatic soft-bodied invertebrates have growth rings similar to tree trunks that can determine their age? Jellyfish, sea anemone, coral or 
 
 octopus?
 
Answer is coral. A colony of small animals which have similar ring-like growth patterns to trees visible within their skeletons. 
 
Throughout this week, Call to Earth is turning the spotlight on French Polynesia and an organization working to restore coral reef ecosystems 
 
 around the world.
 
Titouan Bernicot started Coral Gardeners in 2017, cogitating over healthier oceans when he was just 18 years old as part of the Rolex Perpetual Planet 
 
 Initiative. They are on a to plant one million corals worldwide by the end of 2025, a strategy they`ve dubbed Odyssey 2025.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): This is Tahiti, one of three permanent ocean-based coral nurseries in Mo`orea. As Coral Gardeners, 
 
 both by company name and by profession, these sites are at the core of what they do on a daily basis.
 
TITOUAN BERNICOT, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, CORAL GARDENERS: Coral gardening is the coolest thing on Earth. You are underwater. There is nobody talking. You 
 
 hear the sound of the parrotfish, like the noise of the waves. You have those thousands of little coral fragments, and you have the fish. They 
 
 become your co-workers. It`s something so tangible. It`s such a rewarding feeling to see your tiny coral fragment growing.
 
ASHER: First on the day`s to-do list is installing new underwater foundations, a task assigned to Gardeners Loic and Yohan (ph).
 
BERNICOT: I think that`s -- that`s the most physical part.
 
ASHER: Meanwhile, team members Hannah and Salome collect data from the nearly 6,000 pieces growing in this part of the nursery alone.
 
SALOME CHAUVELOT, IMPACT MANAGER AND CORAL GARDENER: We`re looking at the overall health of each fragment for any signs of predation or disease and 
 
 bleaching signs as well. And then the last part is out of all the corals that are growing, we have a subsample that we follow and monitor for 
 
 growth.
 
ASHER: Right now is also out planting season, meaning there are healthy and heat-resilient coral ready to be relocated back onto the damaged reef.
 
To preserve the health of the colony, they`ll take no more than 10%.
 
BERNICOT: Taino (ph) and I will create a coral rope. That`s the process of coral gardening. We have the tag, nursery number two, rope number one. 
 
 That`s how we do all the scientific monitoring behind.
 
ASHER: And they say on average it will take 12 to 18 months for those fragments to grow big and healthy enough to make it back onto the nearby 
 
 reef.
 
BERNICOT: And there you go. 
 
It was our dream one day to have a job where you get paid to be on the water and taking care of the place we love the most. And we just made it 
 
 happen. It wasn`t a job, but now it`s real. 
 
Conservation is not obliged to be a part-time job, only volunteering. You can wake up every morning with one single priority and focus, how to save 
 
 the most important place on earth.

WIRE: Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, is spaghetti so thin you could walk right pasta and not even see it. I know this may sound preposterous, 
 
 but scientists have created a nanopasta, invisible to the naked eye. While it may not make for a filling dinner, nanopastas uses are full of 
 
 pastabilities.
 
All right, I`m done. Here`s CNN`s Jeremy Roth.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY ROTH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Scientists at a UK university have created spaghetti so thin it`s literally invisible to the naked eye. According to a 
 
 published study, chemists at University College London successfully created nanopasta, spaghetti strands 200 times thinner than a human hair. But how?
 
Well, where traditionally spaghetti is made by pushing a flour-water mixture through a metal press, the study says nanopasta is made by pulling 
 
 threads of flour and liquid through the tip of a needle by an electric charge, producing strands so incredibly small they can`t be seen by the 
 
 human eye or even conventional cameras and microscopes. 
 
The scientists say they don`t see the process being useful for making palatable pasta, instead seeing potential for creating things like smart 
 
 bandages and aiding bone regeneration.

WIRE: All right, you all submitted so many good words for today`s show that we had to pick two of them. Congrats to Daniel in Monroe, Louisiana at 
 
 Neville High School in Coach Reynolds` class for unscrupulous, having or showing no moral principles. Well done, sir.
 
And Mrs. Gibson`s class at Bernice Ayer Middle School, you submitted cogitate, a verb meaning to think deeply about something. Thank you for 
 
 making us two words smarter today. 
 
Our school shout-out today is going to those Titans at Northwest Cabarrus Middle School in Concord, North Carolina. Rise up. Have an awesome day, 
 
 everyone. We`ll see you right back here tomorrow on CNN 10.
