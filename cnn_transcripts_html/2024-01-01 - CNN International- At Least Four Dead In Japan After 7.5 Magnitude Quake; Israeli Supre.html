ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello, I'm Julia Chatterley, and welcome to our ongoing coverage from Japan, where officials say at least four people have now confirmed dead after a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Tsunami advisories are also in effect. Waves have been lashing western Japan after the quake struck on New Year's Day. That initially prompted tsunami warnings before they were downgraded to advisory level.
 
Now, there are reports of people trapped in buildings and under rubble, and powerful aftershocks, too. The tremors, as you can see, rattled this office building. And Japan's weather agency warns aftershocks could continue for a week, potentially triggering building collapses and landslides.
 
Japan's world-famous train system has also been impacted. This video shows shaking inside a subway station. Bullet trains also came to a halt due to the quake, and state broadcaster NHK reports nearly 1,400 passengers were stranded inside the trains more than ten hours after the first tremors were felt.
 
Meanwhile, video shows a fire breaking out in this city. You can see it there, lighting up the night sky. We can also see some of the quake damage and what looks like a collapsed building. CNN's Hanako Montgomery has more from Tokyo on both the quake and the tsunami threat.

HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Frightening scenes as Japan woke up to the New Year. People forced under tables at this bowling alley, and Ishikawa Prefecture was rocked by 7.5 earthquake. Homes and businesses destroyed by the powerful impact. This woman, pleading for aid as she's showed the damage to the town of Matsunami.
 
(UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.)
 
MONTGOMERY (voice over): "Please come help us," she says.
 
(UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.)
 
MONTGOMERY (voice over): "My city is in a terrible situation." The epicenter, near Anamizu on Japan's western coast, causing water levels to surge.
 
(UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.)
 
MONTGOMERY (voice over): And raising fears of a devastating tsunami potentially to come. Authorities issuing immediate warnings and evacuation orders for the areas closest to the shore. In nearby mountains, tourists rushed outside as the quake struck.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Suddenly, it got pretty strong earthquake. You can see all the snow from the electric wires goes down. So everybody was panicked at that time.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice over): Monday's impact rekindling memories of the strongest quake ever recorded in Japan, the 2011 shock, which unleashed differently waves and caused a nuclear catastrophe as it impacted the Fukushima Nuclear Plant. More than 22,000 were killed. Authorities saying this quake, nothing like that one.
 
(YOSHIMASA HAYASHI speaking in foreign language.)
 
YOSHIMASA HAYASHI, JAPANESE CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY (through translator): Beginning with the Shika Nuclear Power Plant closest to the epicenter, there are currently no reported irregularities with nuclear power plants.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice over): The full scale of Monday's powerful quake still difficult to assess as thousands were left without water or power, and many remain trapped underneath the rubble. Tanika Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo.

CHATTERLEY: Okay. Let's bring in Greg Beroza. He is a geophysics professor at Stanford University. Professor Beroza, thank you so much for making time for us today, particularly given it's New Year's Day.
 
This was obviously a powerful earthquake. It struck a very shallow depth, which I know plays to you and your research team's expertise. What are your initial observations?
 
GREG BEROZA, GEOPHYSICS PROFESSOR, STANFORD UNIVERSITY: Yes. Well, the earthquake occurred off the coast of Ishikawa Prefecture in Honshu, Japan. Unlike the 2011 earthquake, this earthquake was not on the plate boundary, but in the crust above it. This kind of earthquake acts to relieve compression within the crust. And earthquakes of this type have occurred in the past also off the West Coast of Honshu, farther to the north.
 
They generate a lot of vertical deformation. And when that occurs under the ocean, it has the potential to generate a tsunami. CHATTERLEY: And that's certainly what the initial warnings were warning against. Can we talk about the aftershocks, too, because I believe we've seen at least 26 aftershocks now, above two and a half magnitude? What are your expectations? Can certainly whether it's the advisories over tsunamis or the possibility of further aftershocks in the coming days and perhaps up to a week? There are still significant concerns.
 <br>[15:05:13]
 
BEROZA: Right. So aftershocks, after any large earthquake like this, will occur. And they will decay with time. They decay slowly with time. And some of them may be large enough to themselves cause damage. So if buildings are weakened by the main shock, then the aftershocks can cause more damage than they might otherwise cause to happen.
 
So there's a concern about aftershocks. We know that they will decay with time. And there have been, probably, by now, thousands of small aftershocks, which people like me detect and use to sort of trace out the deep the geometry of faults such as this.
 
CHATTERLEY: Are we better at mapping that today, sir, than we were -- and you mentioned it back in 2011, where we saw that magnitude 9 earthquake hit? And obviously, the subsequent damage there and the concerns about the Fukushima Nuclear Plant were vast and had ongoing impact and concern. Are we better at mapping today and predicting what the aftershocks might look like and, of course, perhaps, another earthquake in the same area more than we were, what, more than 10 years ago?
 
BEROZA: Yes, so sort of yes and no. So, we're much better using the methods of AI and machine learning at finding small earthquakes and mapping out where they occur and how aftershocks sequences such as this unfold. That increased -- that improved view of the earthquake process has not yet led to improved forecasting, but there are a lot of people working hard to try to make that happen.
 
CHATTERLEY: So what would you be watching for now in the coming days? Is it simply that? And on a sliding scale, as you pointed out, the risk of aftershocks and what that means, perhaps, for damaged buildings and potential landslides?
 
BEROZA: Right. So, what the earthquake research agencies in Japan will be doing is monitoring aftershock activity to make sure that it doesn't, say, start picking up. And they will have instruments in the field to gather the really valuable data of how strong the shaking is in aftershocks because that helps us better design buildings to be earthquake-resistant.
 
CHATTERLEY: And what about the regulations post-2011 in Japan? I spoke to one expert in this field, seismology earlier today, and they said actually this is perhaps the most regulated nation in the world in terms of preparedness for earthquakes.
 
BEROZA: Yes, I think that's probably true. So, all of Japan is earthquake threatened, unlike most countries that they are all -- you know, everybody in Japan is an area where there could potentially be a large earthquake. Earthquakes happen frequently. And so, they have a lot of motivation and a lot of practice in dealing with the earthquake threat.
 
So they -- you know, same goes for tsunamis. They are, you know, among, if not the most tsunami-aware country on the planet.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, doesn't make it not frightening in the moment, though. And, Professor Beroza, thank you so much for your expertise. And once again, Happy New Year.
 
Okay, we're going to take a quick break, but coming up, the Israeli Supreme Court putting the brakes on the government's controversial judicial overhaul, how it could bring a political crisis as the war continues in Gaza.
 
And, unlike the fireworks, joyous celebrations throughout most of the world, 2024 began with a day of mourning in Ukraine following yet another wave of Russian attacks. The details, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:10:57]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back, and a reminder of our top story today, Japanese officials say at least four people have lost their lives after a massive earthquake struck the country's west coast.
 
Tsunami advisories are now in effect, too, following the powerful 7.5 magnitude quake. The damage rose in buildings, hampering efforts by doctors to reach injured patients. Thousands remain without power.
 
You can see the quake's terrifying impact in this video as a home violently shakes. The threat, as we've discussed, of aftershocks, too, remains high.
 
Now, to Israel, and the Supreme Court has struck down a controversial law that formed part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul. The courts of the law, which was designed to limit judicial powers would seriously damage the country's democratic character. The ruling could now trigger a political crisis amid the war with Hamas.
 
Let's get to Elliott Gotkine in Tel Aviv for more on this. It would only trigger a political crisis if their prime minister or the government decided that they wouldn't stand by the Supreme Court's decision on that. Elliott, how likely is that in light of what is perhaps the bigger issue and has been since October the 7th? And that's the war with Hamas.
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, CNN JOURNALIST: Julia, I mean, as you say, this is an incredibly controversial decision. And before those terrorist attacks of Hamas in October the 7th and the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, this was the only thing that we were talking about every single week -- tens of thousands of people out on the streets protesting this government's judicial overhaul. And it had a number of elements to it. But the first and only element that got passed was this so-called amendment to a basic law. But the closest thing is you have the constitution, which was called the reasonableness law. Effectively, they stripped the Supreme Court of its ability to strike down decisions made by the government on the grounds of reasonableness.
 
And I'll give you one example. The government tried to get a minister called -- a man called Aryeh Deri made him minister, but he's been convicted three times most recently of tax fraud. The Supreme Court said, no, you can't make him a minister. To do so is unreasonable based on his previous convictions.
 
But when we interviewed Prime Minister Netanyahu and he spoke with Wolf Blitzer, and Wolf asked him very specifically, would you abide by a ruling by the Supreme Court that would strike down this reasonableness bill, this part of your judicial overhaul? Well, Netanyahu didn't give anything away.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Looking at the September, when Israel Supreme Court will hear appeals to this new law, if the court does strike this down, will you abide by that ruling?
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER: Well, look, we'll go into unchartered territory. And I really would like to believe that they won't do that. And the reason is that, first of all, we're all subject to the rule of law.
 
The prime minister is subject to the rule of law. The Knesset, our parliament is subject to the rule of law. The judges are subject to the law. Everybody is subject to the law.
 
Now, the closest that we have to a Constitution are basic laws. That's what we're dealing with. And what you're talking about is a situation, a potential situation where, in American terms, the United States Supreme Court would take a constitutional amendment and say that it's unconstitutional.
 
That's the kind of spiral that you're talking about, and I hope we don't get to that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOTKINE: Now. To be fair, and I won't get into all the details, Netanyahu was kind of comparing apples and oranges in terms of the set up here with the divisions between the judiciary and the government. You know, there's no upper house of parliament here. And, you know, it's not quite the same thing.
 
And now we are in this position where, interestingly enough, we've had comments from Netanyahu's justice minister, Yariv Levin. He was the architect of this judicial overhaul. We've heard -- who's assailed the court for the timing of this decision, even though the timing of the decision was beyond the courts powers to decide when it had to issue this ruling. [15:15:04]
 
We've heard from Far-right Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir saying that this ruling is illegal and undemocratic. And we've heard from Benny Gantz, who's now in the war cabinet, was one of the opposition leaders, saying that this verdict must be respected, and let's not forget all of the divisions that this judicial overhaul was sewing before October the 7th, and reiterating that we are all brothers and we have a shared destiny.
 
But there's one person missing from this conversation, Julia. The one person we've yet to hear from in response to the Supreme Court ruling earlier this evening is the prime minister himself.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. We'll have to wait and hear what we say from him. But I think the most important part -- context of that conversation snippet that you showed here was the date, July 27th. Obviously, it's a very different environment now with what's going on with the war in Hamas than it was back in July 27th of last year. We'll see when we hear from the prime minister.
 
For now, Elliott, thank you. Elliott Gotkine there.
 
Now, Israel is beginning to withdraw some of its troops from Gaza. The Israeli military says the move should help, quote, "alleviate economic burdens and enable troops to gather strength for upcoming activities in the next year. The IDF has warned the war is expected to continue throughout 2024.
 
Nada Bashir joins us now from Lebanon and has been covering the story. Nada, this is reservists being allowed to go back home. We know they were ripped from their jobs, from the economy when they were called up after the events of October 7th. What does this mean, though, in terms of both broader war and the IDF's efforts in Gaza?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, Julia, those economic pressures are certainly part of the reason why Israeli officials are now withdrawing some of those troops. But the other crucial element, of course, is that they are and nowhere preparing for a long military operation ahead. The war certainly isn't drawing down, even if we are seeing troops from the ground being.
 
Well, in fact, we have seen the Israeli military expanding its operation in terms of going into new places in the Gaza Strip, expanding their airstrikes as well, moving farther southwards. And, of course, that is a huge point of concern.
 
Now, of course, we know that the US government has been in frequent talks with counterparts on the Israeli government has been, putting pressure on the Israeli military to move towards what's being described as a lower-intensity phase of the war. And we have today heard with senior US officials saying that this is perhaps an indication that Israel may well be moving towards that lower-intensity phase that they have been calling for, and that this could reflect also signs that they have achieved many of their military targets in northern Gaza. Of course, the Israeli has said it is targeting Hamas. It is looking to eradicate and diminish Hamas's military capability inside the Gaza Strip, as well as returning all those hostages held in Gaza.
 
But, of course, as we know, the civilian toll has been immense, and we continue to see that the civilian toll rising. Just today, the Hamas- run Ministry of Health in Gaza, saying at least 150 people were killed in the last 24 hours alone. And that death toll is rising day by day, already topping 21,000 according to officials on the ground. Of course, CNN can't independently verify those figures. They're at restricted access to the Gaza Strip.
 
But as we know, the Israeli military says it is still calling on civilians, particularly northern and central Gaza to evacuate southwards. This, while the Israeli military doubles down on its operation both on the ground and in the air, focusing on that southern region, where so many have been displaced, where so many are seeking shelter. But, of course, that UN warning has been reiterated time and time again. There simply isn't anywhere safe for civilians' return.
 
And, of course, there is mounting concern over the humanitarian situation because, of course, as this military operation expands southward, that really is going against what the UN has been calling for, which is for an environment to be created that will allow for the safety guarantees to allow aid agencies to operate on the ground, to allow for crucial aid to cross via the Rafah Border Crossing that separate Gaza and Egypt to reach those most in need.
 
And at the moment, what we're seeing is just a drop in the bucket in comparison to the actual amount of aid that is so desperately needed in the Gaza Strip. And if we do see those airstrikes intensify in southern Gaza, we have seen airstrikes over the last couple days centered around Rafah, which is that key gateway that separates Egypt from the Gaza Strip. And there is mounting concern that we won't see that aid getting in, as is so desperately needed by many.
 
CHATTERLEY: Nada Bashir, from Beirut there for now, thank you.
 
And Danish shipping giant Maersk says it's pausing traffic in the Red Sea after one of its vessels came under attack. The US military says its helicopters intervened over the weekend and sank three boats belonging to Houthi militants from Yemen. All those aboard were killed.
 <br>[15:20:01]
 
A fourth boat got away. Maersk says the boats were trying to board one of its vessels before being fought off. Attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis have spiked since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
 
Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon for us. Oren, it was a violent message sent by the United States to these fighters. The question is, I think, what does it take to send the message of total deterrent (inaudible) to stop these attacks taking place?
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, the US has tried to send that message repeatedly to Iran and its proxies not to attack US forces, not to attack commercial interests or block major waterways. The problem is that message has not gotten through, as we've seen. The US has had Carrier Strike Groups, as well as other forces in the region to try to send that message of deterrence. And yet, over the course of the past month and a half or so, we have seen the Houthis launch more than 100 missiles, drones, and cruise missiles at commercial vessels in the Red Sea. And that, of course, is in addition to all of the Iranian proxies who have attacked US forces in Iraq and Syria.
 
The Houthis and Iranian proxies that have operated out of Yemen have repeatedly attacked commercial vessels, and that has forced many major shipping companies to avoid the Red Sea. In response, the US set up an international coalition to try to secure shipping routes there called Operation Prosperity Guardian.
 
And Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, was pretty much the first company to say, okay, with this setup, we will start going through the Red Sea again. But here over the weekend, we saw the results of that. US Central Command says the Maersk Hangzhou came under attack first from an unidentified object of some sort, so perhaps a drone or a missile. And then four Houthi fast boats that attacked the ship and tried to board it.
 
US Central Command says it came within 20 meters of the ship, so about 60 feet. At that point, US helicopters from navy vessels in the area responded. They say they were fired upon and returned fire, sinking three of the Houthi ships and killing the crews. The fourth ship sped away.
 
The Biden administration says they are not seeking a wider conflict in the region, but that's not there to determine unilaterally. Now, we'll see how to Houthis respond. Now, we'll see how Iran responds at this point because it has been the entire region, frankly, a powder keg. The US may have tried to avoid a conflict with Iranian proxies largely, but here it is, and now the question, where does it go and when will shipping companies feel comfortable coming back to the Red Sea after we saw Maersk, as you pointed out, just announced that they will once again pause shipping through one of the world's most critical waterways?
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. And this is -- let's be clear, Maersk in the top three by container shipping sized cargo companies in the world. So where they go, others tend to follow. And if they're saying, look, we have a problem here, then everybody has a problem. And that has profound economic consequences, Oren, around the world.
 
We -- you and I were talking earlier today about Guardian -- Prosperity Guardian, the operation that brought nations together to try and provide better security in this region. And obviously, that was only announced at the back end of last year. And that's simply going to take time to get troops however they're going to handle this into the region to provide that support. Where are they in terms of stages of actually bringing that together?
 
LIEBERMANN: So there is already a combined maritime force operating in the Middle East. For the US, that's Fifth Fleet. So they had the framework in which to put this together. And that's why they were able to make Operation Prosperity Guardian come together so quickly.
 
That specific effort focuses on the Red Sea and even more specifically on that, the southern Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which is the southern gateway into that critical waterway. Its entire purpose is to secure shipping commercial vessels, make it safe for them to go and pass around Yemen and through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. So that's why it was able to come together so quickly.
 
And when Maersk announced after this was set up that they would once again operate in the Red Sea, that it was a huge vote of confidence in this US-led multinational effort. The fact that Maersk is pausing once again, that indicates the dangers they see there and that perhaps Operation Prosperity Guardian isn't able to deliver the security to commercial vessels that they were hoping it would, especially not with the questions about where does this go from here.
 
Do we see more of these attacks? Do we see more conflict that will only add to the danger that commercial companies see in trying to get their vessels through the Red Sea and try to get them past the Houthis in a secure fashion?
 
Julia, that's why we're seeing so many companies opt to go the long way around Africa. That affect supply chains, that affects shipping rates. That has very much real-world consequences.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, profound consequences. Great security presence in the Red Sea, it seems, still required.
 
Oren, great to have you. Thank you. Oren Liebermann there.
 
Okay. To Ukraine, now. Just hours into the New Year, Ukrainian officials say Russia has launched a series of fresh attacks. Ukraine's air force command says it destroyed most of the 90 drone attacks launched by Russia on New Year's Eve.
 <br>[15:25:07]
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared New Year's Day a national day of mourning. And that follows Friday's air assault that killed at least 53 people. Search and rescue operations are still ongoing.
 
Now, in their New Year's features, the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia had very different messages for their nations. Clare Sebastian has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.)
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): One gave a detailed account of the war.
 
(VLADIMIR PUTIN speaking in foreign language.) SEBASTIAN (voice over): The other, never directly mentioned it. In very different ways, this was two leaders calling on their conflict - worried populations to stay the course.
 
(VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): And just like that, December 31st, today, we say, we do not know for certain what the new year will bring us. But this year, we can add, whatever it brings, we will be stronger.
 
(VLADIMIR PUTIN speaking in foreign language.)
 
PUTIN (through translator): We have proven more than once that we can solve the most difficult problems and we'll never back down.
 
SEBASTIAN (voice over): Vladimir Putin's speech was pared back, less than half the length of the previous year. And this time, not assembled company of military serviceman. Still, it was an opportunity to project strength and confidence as he positions himself for a fifth term as Russian president.
 
(VLADIMIR PUTIN speaking in foreign language.)
 
PUTIN (through translator): We are proud of our common achievements, rejoiced at our successes, and we're firm in defending national interests, our freedom and security, our values, which have been and remained an unshakable support for us.
 
SEBASTIAN (voice over): And yet, Russia's security has been shaken. Increasingly, brazen attacks on Russian territory have brought the war closer to home.
 
The year closing with one of the deadliest attacks for Russian civilians yet in the border region of Belgorod. And Putin faced one of the most direct threats to his rule yet (inaudible) Yevgeny Prigozhin aborted march on Moscow in June. A plane crashed two months later, closing that chapter for good.
 
(VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): We defeated the darkness.
 
SEBASTIAN (voice over): Amidst the stepped up Russian aerial campaign and waning western weapons supplies, President Zelenskyy stuck to his well-warned tactic of accentuating the positive, including Ukraine taking one small step closer to EU membership.
 
(VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): This process will definitely have a logical conclusion -- full-fledged membership in strong Europe, A powerful one, from Lisbon to Luhansk.
 
SEBASTIAN (voice over): And yet, this past week has shown Ukraine enters 2024 increasingly vulnerable. That message even spelled out by Putin in his first appearance of the new year, promising a group of wounded Russian soldiers the strikes would intensify.
 
Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Now, at the beginning of 2023, the US and other western allies promised Ukraine their unwavering support. But by year's end, it was a pretty different story. Military aid is drying up with few secure promises for more. And Ukraine's counteroffensive is faltering, too.
 
Melissa Bell takes a look at how the year that began with promise ended in disappointment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It was an 11th hour invitation that led President Zelenskyy to Washington in December. This time, with a question of further funding to Ukraine stalled on Capitol Hill.
 
JOE BIDEN, US PRESIDENT: I don't want you giving up hope.
 
BELL (voice over): A far cry from the hero's welcome the Ukrainian president had received in 2022, with progress on the ground in Ukraine apparently stalled as well.
 
(VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): The counteroffensive is difficult. It's happening probably slower than how some people may want or can see it.
 
BELL (voice over): A foothold on the east bank of the Dnipro river, one of the rare Ukrainian gains despite months of fighting, with questions of how much more money allies can invest.
 
MIKE JOHNSON, US HOUSE SPEAKER: What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win.
 
BELL (voice over): Allegations of corruption haven't helped, despite President Zelenskyy's determination to act, with the firing of top officials and the arrest of a leading oligarch who is also a backer of his presidential bid.
 
(VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): Any internal issue that hinders the state is being cleaned up and will be cleaned up further. We need a strong state, and Ukraine will be just that.
 
BELL (voice over): But it is on the battlefield that the Ukrainian president's ability to lead is be engaged most closely. As is, his relationship to the troops and to the man who leads them, Valerii Zaluzhnyi with hints of a strained relationship alluded to at Zelenskyy's end of year press conference.
 <br>[15:30:07]
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): He has to answer for results on the battlefield, as commander in chief, together with the general staff. There are many questions.
 
BELL (voice over): Questions, also, for European and American allies looking to Zelenskyy to deliver victory against Russia, in return for a defense systems, tanks, missile systems, and now fighter jets. All too little, too late, say Ukrainians as support for even that aid drives up, Zelenskyy is now an uncharted territory.
 
With tens of billions in dollars and euros for Ukraine held up by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union, now wrestling with Hungary's opposition, as Republicans slow U.S. aid.
 
ZELENSKYY: I am confident that the United States of America will not betray us.
 
BELL: But there has been some relief for Ukraine this Christmas with news breaking of the first long promised F-16 fighters headed for the country.
 
ZELENSKYY: Like our victory, in the Black Sea, we aim to win the air battle, crashing Russian air dominance.
 
BELL: A note of optimism from a leader desperate to believe that his war can still be won.
 
Melissa Bell, CNN.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
CHATTERLEY: And some positive news for Ukraine. This just into CNN. For the first time, Norway's government will allow the country's defense industry to sell weapons and military products directly to Ukraine.
 
The foreign minister said Monday that direct sales could begin immediately. Prior to this, Norway's defense industry has been under strict government export rules that banned arm sales to countries threatened by war.
 
The government has been donating weapons and ammunition to Kyiv since the invasion.
 
OK, coming up, for a live report from Japan, where a 7.5 earthquake struck on New Year's Day. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. And a reminder, once again, of the breaking news from Japan, where a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the country's western coast on Monday afternoon.
 
The quick hit tip 4:10 local time. It had a depth of 10 kilometers or six miles, which just for context is actually very shallow.
 <br>[15:35:05]
 
Officials say, at least, four people were killed.
 
Japan's public broadcaster now says around 1,400 passengers remain stuck on full bullet trains that stopped during the quake. And a tsunami warning was immediately issued and waves are reported around 10 minutes later.
 
That warning though, has now been downgraded to an advisory level, but of course, risks remain. And we're just getting this video to a fire broke out in Wajima City as a result of the earthquake damage.
 
Marc Stewart has been following the story for us.
 
Marc. We're just getting a sense now. And, of course, it is still very early hours in Japan of the loss of life, at least, four people, and perhaps injuries too. What more can you tell us?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that the deaths actually occurred in the Ishikawa prefecture, which is the hardest hit area. I think that the question we are trying to ask and hopefully we'll have some success in the in the hours ahead, is exactly, how many people have been injured? How many people are missing? And what is the urgent medical need?
 
This has been a challenge, because, as you mentioned, it's now middle of the night, this hit at four in the afternoon, local time. So, it hasn't even necessarily been 12 hours since this all happened.
 
We know resources are certainly going to be available to help. We know that 1000 Japanese soldiers have already been called up to help, another 8,500 are on standby.
 
I just saw a tweet by the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, and he offered the assistance of American troops, as we know, the U.S. has a very strong presence on with military installations across Japan. So, perhaps that will be -- that will be a resource that will be utilized as well.
 
But there is this big question of infrastructure. Right now, we know that five highways have major damage. We know that roadways are damaged, we saw some of the cracks in the roads in some of the video.
 
We know that one airport has a cracked runway, another airport has had flight cancellations. So, it's -- there's going to be this mobilization of forces, which is going to be a big challenge. Then, the other question is dealing with homeless population or people who have been displaced.
 
We know that 21 schools have been turned into emergency centers. But we're not clear about the long-term strategy in all of this. And then, Julia, we just have to accept the unfortunate realities of nature. The Japanese Weather Service has made it very clear and has warned Japanese citizens that aftershocks, additional tremors are very likely.
 
Perhaps, three days into the future. But as long as a week. That's kind of the window that they are offering. So, it is challenge upon challenge, Julia, that stacking upon each other.
 
You know, I think -- I think that hopefully we will get a roadmap as to how the government is going to start to handle all of this when the sun rises at around 7:00 local time in Japan.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. And we will be covering that for our viewers too. Marc Stewart for now. Thank you so much for that report.
 
Let's go straight to the CNN Weather Center in Atlanta, where we find meteorologist Allison Chinchar.
 
And Allison, I'm sure you were listening to that, too. As Marc was pointing out, the risk now is the damage of aftershocks and what impact they have. What can you tell us about what we may see and expect over the coming hours?
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, and I think it's very important that it's a multi fold there. So, it's not just the aftershock itself and maybe any subsequent damage. But remember, aftershocks can also trigger their own tsunamis, they can trigger landslides. So, it's also a lot of the other impacts that come with them.
 
And that's very likely why we have this tsunami advisory that's still in place and may still be in place for hours. Because of those aftershocks. We just simply don't know when they will occur at what magnitude they will occur. So, you have this tsunami advisories still in place basically up and down the west coast.
 
That X marks where the actual epicenter of the quake took place, roughly several hours ago.
 
Here is a look at Suzu City, the location of where it is just in Japan, general. But then, also when we zoom in, notice this little inland that it kind of sits on here with some water.
 
When you have that tsunami that takes place. Think of it like dropping a stone into your bathtub or a hot tub, it displaces the water, the water starts to flow out creating that ripple, but then, it hits the edges of the bathtub and then, comes right back in. And so, you get these waves.
 
Well, that's what's happening. It's going to hit land and you're going to start to see that water ebb and flow multiple times. Now, for a lot of these coastal communities we've already seen some observed waves as high as around 1.2 meters to nearly four feet. Several other locations picking up just under one meter.
 <br>[15:40:04]
 
These were the higher observed ones. And then, again, you're going to have several that are slightly smaller than that as the water goes back and forth.
 
The tsunami itself, when the earthquake first takes place, that plate, this thrusts upward, and it pushes all of that water displaces it. And then, it begins to race across the water, eventually, just kind of coming into contact with land, and it becomes a series of waves that pushes all of that water inland.
 
But the topography of the coastline itself can also have an impact on where that water piles up along these particular areas. Now, the main quake itself was a 7.5, very shallow and geological standards, just about 10 kilometers deep.
 
We've already had at least 20 to 25 aftershocks of magnitude 2.5 or higher. The thing you have to understand is, even though they're not to the same magnitude of the main quake, which is 7.5, when you have such a large earthquake like that buildings and homes now become structurally compromised. So, it doesn't take another 7.5 to cause further damage. You can have a 5.5 or a 6.5 that can still trigger further damage on those buildings and homes. So, it's certainly something you have to pay attention to.
 
Not to mention, they could trigger landslides, they could trigger further tsunamis. So, all of these things have to factor right now with the magnitude of this particular strength, a 7.5.
 
Julia, typically, on average, we will get one. That's a magnitude 6.5 or higher, and roughly about 10 or so that are 5.5 or higher. We've already seen several of those, but it's very likely those will continue in the days to come.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. much to watch for, and certainly, we will update there. We will wait for the update from authorities on all of these risks and the damage assessment too. Allison, great job. Thank you. Allison Chinchar, for now. Thank you.
 
OK, just ahead, Europe's longest serving current monarch, stepping down from the throne. Find out why the Danish queen will no longer reign and who takes the crown, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:45:05]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM.
 
The queen of Denmark say she will step down on January 14th, after 52 years on the throne.
 
Queen Margarethe II is the second -- forgive me, is Europe's second longest serving monarch. She succeeded her father King Frederik IX in 1972.
 
She decided now is the right time to pass the responsibility onto the next generation. Queen Margarethe's son, the Crown Prince Frederik will be proclaimed king and his wife Crown Princess Mary will become queen. Max Foster takes a closer look at the new line of succession.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A new year, a new era for Denmark, and for one of the world's oldest monarchies. Queen Margarethe II will end her reign at more than half a century, a shock decision delivered in a live address to the Danish people on New Year's Eve.
 
QUEEN MARGARETHE II, QUEEN OF DENMARK (through translator): I have decided that now is the right time. On the 14th of January 2024, 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father, I will step down as queen of Denmark.
 
FOSTER: Denmark's ruler became Europe's longest reigning monarch after the death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2022.
 
Queen Margarethe put the decision down to her fragile health. Recent surgeries on her back have limited her royal duties.
 
MARGARETHE II: The time takes its toll and the number of ailments increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past.
 
FOSTER: That sense of duty won the hearts of the Danish people. And drew comparisons to Queen Elizabeth, to whom Margarethe, look to for some inspiration.
 
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was quick to praise the only monarch that many Danes will ever have known.
 
"On behalf of the entire population, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Her Majesty the Queen for her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom," Fredricksen wrote in a statement.
 
Like other constitutional monarchies, the Danish sovereign stays above politics, but feathers can be ruffled. In 2022, the queen removed the titles of prince and princess from the children of her second son, Prince Joachim.
 
It was an effort to reduce the royal establishment and allow her grandkids more privacy.
 
But Prince Joachim went public with his four children's hurt feelings, and Queen Margarethe later apologize but did not change her decision.
 
MARGARETHE II: That is more pressure on the young people of today than they were when I was -- when I was a child.
 
FOSTER: Margarethe's decision to abdicate places the weight of the crown upon her eldest son's head, Prince Frederik, a man equally faithful to the crown, but with a slightly more reserved public persona.
 
Frederik will rule alongside his Australian born wife, Princess Mary. The royal couple met at a bar in Sydney during the 2000 Olympics. Mary Donaldson, a marketing executive from Tasmania swept into a fairy tale.
 
MARGARETHE II: I really like her very much indeed. And she -- I hope, knows that and feels that.
 
FOSTER (voice over): The new queen won't have far to look for a role model.

CHATTERLEY: And last, but definitely not least, it looks like 2024 will also offer some exciting events from the world of sports too. Don Riddell has a preview of what's to come.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: There is no point in gazing into a crystal ball with sports. We love it because it's so unpredictable. But we do at least know what's on the calendar in 2024, and that is going to be another action-packed year.
 
Taking center stage, will be the Summer Olympics in Paris. The modern games back in the French capital for the first time in a century. As Paris becomes only the second city after London to host the Games three times.
 
Amidst heightened tensions in the Middle East security will inevitably be a concern. But the Olympics should feel like a return to normal after the sterility of Tokyo's delayed COVID games in 2021.
 
In nearby Germany, UEFA's European Football Championship will serve as a curtain raiser to the games with Italy the defending champions.
 <br>[15:55:04]
 
And England and France considered the favorites to win the tournament.
 
And all eyes will again be on Lionel Messi as the world champions, Argentina seek to defend their copper America crown, and win their third consecutive major title.
 
As the United States continues to prepare for the FIFA World Cup in 2026, next year, it will introduce American fans to a new sport for them co-hosting cricket's T20 World Cup with the West Indies.
 
Talk of a revitalized Tiger Woods will be a major headline in golf. But the sports' biggest story may once again be outside the ropes, as the PGA Tour and the Saudi-backed LIV Golf continue to wrestle for the future of the game.
 
The return of new mom, Naomi Osaka will bolster the highly competitive tennis scene at a time when women's sport more broadly is really taking off. According to the accounting firm, Deloitte, women's sports revenue will cross the $1 billion threshold for the first time. That's a threefold increase from just three years ago.
 
What happens on the court, to course, the pool, the field or the track, there is no shortage of sports I look forward to in 2024.
