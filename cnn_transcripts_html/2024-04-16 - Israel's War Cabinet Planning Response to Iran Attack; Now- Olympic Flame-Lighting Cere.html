Right now on CNN THIS MORNING:
 
Retribution or restraint. The world is waiting to see how Israel response to Iran's aerial assault over the weekend.
 
Day two of Donald Trump's New York hush money trial. Not a single juror has been selected so far.
 
And House Speaker Mike Johnson moving on aid for Israel and Ukraine. A vote on two separate bills now expected by Friday.
 
(MUSIC)
 
ACOSTA:  All right. It's 5:00 a.m. here in Washington. 
 
Here's a live look at Olympia, Greece, about to light the Olympic flame. 
 
Good morning, everyone. I'm Jim Acosta, in for Kasie Hunt. It's great to be with you. 
 
The next move belongs to Israel, a response to Iran's unprecedented airstrikes over the weekend expected to come at any time. Hundreds of missiles and drones fired at Israel really territory last weekend, nearly all of them intercepted. Israel's war cabinet meeting Sunday, but still divided over next steps as it faces mounting international pressure to show restraint.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF STAFF, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  Iran will face the consequences for its actions. We will choose our response accordingly.
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have been coordinating a diplomatic response to seek, to prevent escalation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us live from Abu Dhabi. Paula, good morning 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Jim. Well, we are expecting the war cabinet to meet once again today. This Tuesday and just the sheer number of these meetings and how long these meetings are going shows how difficult this decision is to make for Israel. 
 
Now, we've heard from an Israeli official that they understand the need to act quickly, but there is some disagreement as to what exactly they should do. There is agreement that there should be a response from Israel but there's not agreement when it comes to the timing, when it comes to the scope of exactly what they will carry out. 
 
There is an understanding, though, that Israel does need to react in some way to show deterrence against what we saw over the weekend with those Iranian drone and missile launches. Now, we do know that one Israeli official says that potentially looking at a military option that would avoid casualties, that is one of the scenarios that they could look at to try and avoid escalating the situation countries around the world, including the United States, are asking Israel to show restraint. So the U.S., of course, saying it will not be involved in any retaliatory strike against Iran. 
 
But any strike a direct strike against Iran will set a precedent. And at this point, there are concerns that it will inevitably escalate the situation in the region. 
 
Now, we also know that its affecting what's happening in Gaza to Israeli officials saying that an operation they were expecting a ground offensive in Rafah, which many around the world did not want to see happen, has now been delayed because they are still trying to figure out at what to do with Iran. 
 
They were planning, the Israeli military, to drop leaflets on parts of Rafah this week to tell people to move out. So they could carry out this offensive. No indication of where these up to 1.5 million Palestinians though would be moving to -- Jim.
 
All right. Paula Hancocks with that report. Thank you very much.
 
Happening now, the flame lighting ceremony for this summer's Paris Olympics is taking place in Greece at the ruins of the 2,600 year-old Temple of Hera, the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games. During an 11-day relay, some 600 torch bearers will carry the flame 3,100 miles before handing it off to the organizers of Paris 2024. It will then begin its trip to France.
 
And Elinda Labropoulou is live in Olympia, Greece, for us with more.
 
Very exciting, Lynda. What can you see? What can you tell us? 
 
ELINDA LABROPOULOU, JOURNALIST:  its an incredibly exciting moments because we only minutes away from the Olympic light plane being lit. And with that, the commencement in many ways of the Paris Olympics. So we have a first torch bearer waiting for the flame. He's going to
 
 be the first person to carry it around Greece. As you said, hundreds of torch bearer is just in Greece alone before the flame is handed over to the French delegation at the first modern Olympic stadium in Athens, the Panathenaic Stadium. 
 <br>[05:05:13]
 
And from there off to France, to Marseilles, on a beautiful sail ship. I have the crew of the boat right next to me. They're very excited to be here and to be the ones that will carry the flame to France. 
 
And in total, we expect about 10,000 people will carry the flame until it reaches Paris, and the opening of the games. But first, we have to see, first of all, if the flame is going to be lit because the process is quite complicated, what happens is a woman dressed as a high priestess will hold the torch next to a conclave mirror, and were light it with the rays of the sun. 
 
This is the traditional way that this has been done for a very long time. So it's an excitement moment. The priestess is about to go into the temple. Now, were not allowed in, but very soon well know if the flame has been lit, Jim. 
 
ACOSTA:  And, Elinda, when I talked to my friends from France there, they're very excited about the Paris Olympics I have to assume that across Europe, excitement is building.
 
LABROPOULOU:  Oh, absolutely. I mean, there are people from all over Europe who are going to attend these Olympics. The French have promise really lavish games. They're the first ones that are actually holding an outdoor opening ceremony. 
 
They said that they will be a holding that ceremony all across the sand, so for kilometers into Paris, and there'll be using boats to transport the athletes in and out, which sounds absolutely spectacular. 
 
Jim, but just a couple of days ago, the French president has sort of a watered down this potentially because he said, well, there are many security concerns, so there may have to be a plan B to how this actually takes place, but really I'm just trying to convey to you the amazing feeling of what its like to be in ancient Olympia with the first games were held nearly three millennia and ago, I mean, in this very space where we are now. This is the friend first Olympic stadium history and the light is about to be lit -- James. Sorry, Jim. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yeah, Elinda. 
 
I mean, this is just uniform to watch right here. Can you tell us a little bit of what we're seeing here and this amazing ancient setting?
 
LABROPOULOU:  Yeah, it's a choreographed event. So there's a group of females dancers just you used to have these forces in antiquity as well. This is all inspired by ancient rituals. They will accompany the high priestess into the temple where she will -- she will speak to the Olympian gods, to the god of light, Apollo. 
 
And he will be the one who will come but will say, yes, let's have the flame lit, and then she will bring it out to the crowds here. We're all waiting, you know, cameras in hand to take in this moment. And the first torch bearer is going to begin his journey. 
 
He's an Olympic Greek rower. We spoke to him earlier. He said this is a great honor. He is extremely excited to be taking part. 
 
He said as a young boy, he never imagined that a moment like that would come for him.
 
So, this is what we're expecting to witness in just minutes from now, you will also see the priestesses, the Kouros, wearing these classically inspired costumes and dresses. They are designed by Mary Katrantzou, a very well known designer and actually the flame itself has won many design awards and it's very long history. So it's always been an item of great interest to designers we are waiting to see for the won, the French one in just minutes from now, and to follow, its amazing journey all the way to Paris, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  And it will be an amazing journey. Elina Labropoulou, thank you very much for that report. And we'll show everybody the lighting of the flame here and in just a few minutes when that happens, we'll bring that back to you.
 
Elinda, in the meantime, thank you very much. A lot of fun getting us all excited for the Olympic Games later on this summer.
 
In the meantime, coming up next, Donald Trump back in court. We'll preview day two of jury selection in his hush money trial. 
 
Plus, Biden's pitch to middle-class voters. The president heads to Pennsylvania to talk taxes.
 
And a story developing out of Denmark this morning. A massive fire burning through one of Copenhagen's oldest buildings. The latest details ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:14:19]
 
ACOSTA:  It's day two of jury selection in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial. On day one, more than half of the first group of prospective jurors were dismissed because they said they did not think they could be fair and impartial. 
 
The D.A.'s office also asked Judge Juan Merchan to sanction Trump for violating the gag order imposed on him. Prosecutors want Trump to be held in contempt and sanction $1,000 for each of three social media posts they say violated the order. The former president was predictably defiant when talking to the media after his first day in court.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It looks like the judges even allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt. 
 <br>[05:15:01]
 
It continues. It continues to forever. And we're not going to be given a fair trial.
 
He's a very conflicted judge. We've got a real problem with this judge, got a real problem with a lot of things having to do with this trial. 
 
I'm not in Georgia or Florida, or North Carolina, campaigning like I should be. This is about election interference. That's all it's about. Thank you very much.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  And while Trump goes back to the court for day two of jury selection, President Biden heads to his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, today to deliver his economic message. 
 
A Biden campaign official telling CNN the address will drive home a simple what question, do you think the tax code should work for rich people or for the middle-class? The president has made it clear what he thinks the answer is. And so has Donald Trump.
 
And joining me now to discuss is "Axios" senior politics reporter, Eugene Scott.
 
We'll talk about the president in his campaign in a moment. But what were your main takeaways from Trumps first day in court, reportedly having trouble staying awake at one point, and then he was -- you know, he said that predictable things about a scam, witch out, all that sort of thing when he walked out, what do you think? 
 
EUGENE SCOTT, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, AXIOS:  Yeah, I think we got a clear idea which isn't a big surprise to many of us that its going to be really difficult finding an impartial jury as much as we know that people have not been tuned into the news like they were in 2020 or even 2016, most people were tuned in enough to know that they know where they side when it comes to Donald Trump. 
 
And so I'll be paying close attention to see if it gets easier as we move forward to figure out a who they want, you know, to be on this jury. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yeah, it's going to take some time in New York. More than half of the prospective jurors apparently were removed on day one. 
 
SCOTT:  Yeah. 
 
ACOSTA:  I mean, at some point, they'll get a jury selected, but it's difficult with Trump because he pushes peoples buttons and so many different ways. And in Manhattan, there's just not a whole lot of affection for him up there. 
 
SCOTT:  No. You know, the thing you've got to remember about a trial in New York opposed to Georgia is a lot of these people may have had opinions on Trump before he even hit the national state.
 
ACOSTA:  That's true.
 
SCOTT:  Right? Like people have had opinions about Donald Trump for a while. And we'll see whether or not they're going to be able to deliver any type of a judgment that it's actually in his favor or in the favor of arguably the American people.
 
ACOSTA:  Right. And the judge also made several rulings that may frame how the case is presented. His sided with prosecutors in allowing Karen McDougal to testify. And I guess in a victory for Trump, he ruled that the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape cannot be played. 
 
And so I mean, I think the judge, despite what Trump is saying, is going to bend over backwards to just come across as very down the middle, I would think in all of these proceedings because he understands there's all this attention, there's a huge spotlight on this case. 
 
SCOTT:  That seems to be the case, but obviously that is not the talking point the president's -- former president is going to lean into and we saw when he came out, he tried to make the case that the judge was far, you know, more partial than he actually has been. And so, whether or not that's going to convince the swing voters and independent voters that Trump needs to win needs to be seen, but we know where the basis falling. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yeah. I guess wants to see whether or not the judge at some point says I've had enough, and he starts to punish Trump. I mean, that that is another thing that may come down the pike.
 
And, you know, the Biden campaign will be getting the split-screen today that they'll undoubtedly try to seize on Trumps and court Biden's on the campaign trail. I wonder if we're going to be seeing a lot of that this year. 
 
SCOTT:  Well, you know, it'll be interesting because Biden has really been careful about not drawing attention to Trump's legal trouble. But, you know, his surrogates haven't been. And you know, we've got about six more months. He's got --  
 
ACOSTA:  Plenty of time. 
 
SCOTT:  Yeah, the strategy could shift, especially his poll shift and there's more concerned but the message that Biden is putting forward may not be getting to the people he wants. He may have to remind them why you're not seeing trouble the campaign trail. 
 
ACOSTA:  Well, and I think, you know, the Biden's message of the day on tax policy, that is -- that is a policy they think resonates with voters.
 
SCOTT:  Especially right now.
 
ACOSTA:  Especially right now. Yeah. 
 
SCOTT:  Yeah. 
 
ACOSTA:  I mean, you know, it is one of those issues that for a lot of people, depending on, that doesn't matter which side of the spectrum that you come from. People want to see certain folks pay their fair share in taxes. I expect the president to hit on that. 
 
SCOTT:  It's been really interesting because so many of these folks are asking people, are you better off than you were four years ago? And the number of people saying there better is higher than Biden wishes. They would be. 
 
ACOSTA:  Right. 
 
SCOTT:  But I imagine the campaign is going to show them more information sets, whether you feel like it or not, you're not better off based on these numbers and you're not doing as well as these corporations and billionaires and you won't be if Trump goes back to the White House. 
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Eugene Scott, great to talk to you this morning. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
 
Coming up next, a former marine sentenced for firebombing a Planned Parenthood clinic. 
 
Plus, the speaker of the House calling for separate votes on aid for Israel and Ukraine. That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:24:22]
 
ACOSTA:  It's 23 minutes past the hour. Here's your morning roundup.
 
A former marine sentenced to nine years behind bars for firebombing a Planned Parenthood clinic in California. Chance Brannon is one of three men who planned and executed the attack in 2022.
 
The Supreme Court allowing Idaho to enforce its ban on gender affirming care for trans youth. The state law sentences doctors to up to ten years in prison if they provide care for anyone under the age of 18.
 
This morning in Denmark, a massive fire burning through Copenhagen's historic stock exchange. The causes currently unknown and authority for his have reported no injuries at this time.
 
More than 45 million people in the Midwest are under a severe storm threats for today, where damaging wind, large hail, possible tornadoes all on the radar screen for weather forecasters today. 
 <br>[05:25:11] Fire, danger and red flag warnings are also in place from Texas to Colorado.
 
Meteorologist Derek Van Dam tracking all of it for us.
 
Derek, it's kind of a busy day out there. 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah, yeah. Check this out, Jim, I found this astounding this morning, did a bit of research. There are currently 300 lightning strikes per minute across the Plains States right now. You can see them just illuminating our screen here from North Dakota southward, all the way to Oklahoma and Texas.
 
But there just isn't a lot of severe weather at the moment. It didn't produce much yesterday. We had anticipated late last week, I guess that's good news, right? But there were reports of some wind and hail damage in one tornado report. But today, the severe weather threat is kind of going to ramp up in a different location of the country, and I'll show you were. 
 
Currently, we have a tornado watch. This includes Omaha and that's valid until about 8:00 a.m. Central Daylight, so 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard. It's really because of this line right here that you can see entering the western suburbs of Omaha here within the next hour or so. 
 
So heads up. If you're located in that region, that could be a bit rocky heading to work this morning, but look at the evolution. You can see that very pronounced spin as it moves through Minneapolis, into the northern portions of the Midwest and into the upper great lakes. 
 
As we track that storm that's where well find our greatest probability of severe weather, large hail, tornadoes, damaging winds, can't be ruled out. Des Moines to the east. This is our greatest probability of two inch in diameter hail or larger. 
 
So that's baseball-sized hail across that hatched area but the storm prediction center also has highlighted this particular region in the shading of orange, where we could have the potential for stronger tornadoes later today.
 
Jim, lots going on.
 
SCIUTTO:  Yeah, a lot going on. Be careful out there, everybody. 
 
All right. Derek Van Dam, thank you very much.
 
Coming up next, jury selection, day two. How hard will it be to find 12 and partial New Yorkers of Donald Trump's hush money trial?
 
Plus, aid for Israel and Ukraine split into separate bills by the House speaker. Well talk about that.
