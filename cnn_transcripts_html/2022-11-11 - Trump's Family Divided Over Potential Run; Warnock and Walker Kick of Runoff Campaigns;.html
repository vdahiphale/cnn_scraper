KATE BENNETT, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: He was the person that everything went through. Everything from the Middle East to Covid response. And Ivanka Trump has always been sort of the favorite daughter, if you will, and his closest adviser. But right now they're both living in Miami. They have no intention of going back. They're doing their own thing. And, apparently, Trump is OK with that. 
 
Donald Trump Jr., however, is eager to join the campaign. His political footprint has exploded since Trump left the White House, of course.
 
And this is all happening under the backdrop of Tiffany Trump's wedding. This is happening this weekend. There's a lot going on. Obviously, the president has - the former president has not been in a great mood, as you just mentioned, going off against Ron DeSantis, et cetera. 
 
So, the family will be coming together to discuss the future. I mean this announcement could come next week. But it's going to look different for them. And I think it's just a sign of how perhaps Ivanka and Jared have moved on and Trump Jr. and Donald Trump himself really have not. 
 
SCIUTTO: They're the ones sticking around. Is anyone telling him not to run or just it's going to be up to him? 
 
BENNETT: I don't think so. Everyone I talk to said this is, you know, Donald Trump. You can't tell him what to do, even if you are a part of the family.
 
SCIUTTO: yes.
 
BENNETT: They certainly voice their opinions about things when they want to. Donald Trump Jr. was very vocal about not announcing before midterms, and he didn't. So, we'll have to see. But I think Trump's going to do what Trump's going to do. 
 
SCIUTTO: There is some history there.
 
BENNETT: Yes.
 
SCIUTTO: Kate Bennett, thanks so much. 
 
BENNETT: Thank you.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Depending on what happens in Nevada and Arizona, Georgia could, once again, decide the balance of power in the Senate. Both candidates, incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker already back on the campaign trail ahead of their runoff scheduled for December 6th. And so that means it could be a month depending on what happens in those other two states before we know who will control the Senate. 
 
CNN national politics reporter Eva McKend joining us now live from Atlanta. 
 
You have a busy few weeks ahead, my friend. 
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: I sure do, Erica. You know, the arguments that Herschel Walker, Senator Warnock, are really coming into focus, the arguments that they are going to make over the next four weeks. Senator Warnock telling supporters that the next four weeks is an argument over character and competence, sort of chiding Herschel Walker for suggesting in that one and only debate that they had that diabetics can just get better by eating right, suggesting that someone that makes a claim like that one is not fit or prepared to serve in the United States Senate. 
 
Meanwhile, Herschel Walker joined last night by Senator Ted Cruz really making this national pitch, arguing that Senator Warnock is too closely aligned to President Biden, namely on economic policy. 
 
Now, they both held events last night. Take a listen to what they had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HERSCHEL WALKER (R), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: He was dying to go into overtime because if you watch what he was saying, we've got to go in a runoff. And I was saying, no, I want to beat you outright. And if he want to go in a runoff with me, you know what I'm saying, you bring it, homes. You bring it, because I was built for this. 
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): You have to admit that I did warn y'all that we might be spending Thanksgiving together. And here we are. So I'm going to need you to stick with me for four more weeks. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND: So, this has really been a costly affair. $271 million spent. Even more millions are being pumped into this. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pledging to spend about $7 million to boost Warnock. Walker getting a lot of money as well. A costly next couple of weeks, Erica. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes, it certainly is. 
 
Eva, appreciate it. Thank you. Still to come here, the D.C. attorney general now suing the NFL and
 
 the Washington Commanders football team, as well as its owner, over allegations of a toxic workplace. Just ahead, I'll get reaction from a woman who says she saw that harassment firsthand. She'll join us, along with her attorney, who represents dozens more former employees. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:38:43]
 
HILL: More legal trouble this morning for the Washington Commanders and team owner Dan Snyder. This time from Washington, D.C.'s attorney general, who is now suing Snyder, the team and the NFL, saying they all worked together to deceive D.C. residents about a toxic workplace culture and allegations of sexual assault. The AG is going after them under a D.C. law that allows him some wide leeway in holding individuals or companies accountable for misleading customers. So, in this case, the customers are fans of the Washington Commanders football team. 
 
CNN has reached out to the NFL, Commissioner Roger Goodell, the Commanders and Dan Snyder. The NFL telling CNN they had already conducted a thorough, independent investigation into workplace misconduct, released a public summary and imposed a, quote, record- setting fine against the Commanders and it's ownership. Lawyers for the Commanders say Dan and Tanya Snyder have acknowledged an unacceptable workplace culture existed for years and have, quote, apologized many times for allowing it to happen. 
 
Melanie Coburn is a former director of marketing for the Washington Commanders, also a former cheerleader for the team. She testified in front of the House Oversight Committee about what was, in her view, a toxic workplace at the organization. Lisa Banks is an attorney representing more than 40 former Commanders employees. 
 
It's good to have you both with us this morning. 
 
Melanie, you testified. You have written about your experience, what you witnessed as well. 
 <br>[09:40:04]
 
You were interviewed as part of this investigation from the D.C. attorney general. I read that when you heard about this suit, you cried. What do you think this will achieve? 
 
MELANIE COBURN, FORMER WASHINGTON COMMANDERS CHEERLEADER AND MARKETING DIRECTOR: Well, I think it's a huge step in the direction to full transparency. There are still many ongoing investigations, as you know. So we are just hopeful that more jurisdictions will come in, look at the evidence and really all we've asked for from the beginning is transparency and accountability. And that's what we're hoping for. 
 
HILL: The Commanders, Lisa, released a statement calling this an offbeat legal theory. The AG is claiming that the team misled fans, the consumers, the customers in this case, by covering up this toxic workplace environment. The reality is, we know that NFL fans have seen and heard about a lot over the years and they still show up, they still watch it on TV, they still buy tickets. Do you think this is the best way to hold the team accountable? 
 
LISA BANKS, ATTORNEY FOR 40 PLUS FORMER COMMANDERS EMPLOYEES: It's certainly ne way to hold the team accountable. And what the AG in D.C. did was use the law that they have available, and that has clearly been violated in this instance, to hold the team accountable for a long period now of lies and cover ups about what happened over the past 20 years at the Washington Commanders. 
 
HILL: When we look at where we are today, the NFL also said, you know, they released this public summary of their investigation, but they didn't release the full report because Roger Goodell says there were concerns that they were trying to protect the identity of employees who had cooperated with that investigation. 
 
Lisa, as I understand it, you represent dozens of them. Would they want this report made public? Do they want more transparency? 
 
BANKS: Oh, absolutely. Every person that I represent who participated in that investigation two years ago expected and wanted a report to be released. They wanted transparency. They were sharing their experiences and they wanted those experiences known so there could be true accountability. And the NFL did something unprecedented, and it buried all the results of that report. 
 
HILL: Melanie, do you think, with everything that we're seeing, and what we've heard from you over the years, I know you've called out specifically not just the NFL but Commissioner Roger Goodell, saying that he really protected the owners, he protected the team here. Do you think he needs to go? 
 
COBURN: Oh, absolutely. I think he's complicit in all of this. They knew the findings. They - I'm -- everyone from the Commanders to the NFL praises Beth Wilkinson and what a thorough investigation she did. And they hold her in such high regard, then why not release her findings and redact names? It's been done before. How does deflate- gate, deflated balls investigation get 243 pages and we get zero. It's unacceptable. 
 
HILL: Has speaking out, both you and others, those who you represent, Lisa, as well, has there been a change at this point that you are aware of? 
 
BANKS: There's been a change in that the expectations are different. People are saying it's not OK for you to engage in harassment and abuse over the course of 20 years and then try to bury that. There's been a change in that people are ready to stand up and have their voices heard and if they're tried - if somebody tries to silence them, then people like Melanie and others that I represent are going to continue fighting until there's transparency and accountability. And we've made a lot of progress in that regard. And yesterday was one step in that direction. 
 
HILL: Melanie, in terms of that speaking out, what have you seen personally, not only when it comes to reaction, but what have you heard from other people who have seen what you said? 
 
COBURN: You know, I was not one that wanted to come out publicly in the beginning. I was terrified, as are so many other former colleagues of mine. But I speak on behalf of them. I speak on behalf of those who have signed NDAs, who have been silenced, but who lived through the horror that we all lived through there. And I get so many messages of support, encouragement and just affirming everything that we're doing and I know we're doing the right thing. I know karma is on our side and truth will come to light. 
 
HILL: Melanie Coburn, Lisa Banks, I appreciate you both joining us this morning. Thank you. 
 
BANKS: Thank you.
 
COBURN: Thank you. 
 
HILL: In a statement released to CNN, attorneys for the Commanders said, quote, although the lawsuit repeats a lot of innuendo, half- truths and lies, we welcome this opportunity to defend the organization for the first time in a court of law and to establish, once and for all, what is fact and what is fiction. 
 
And a bit more from the NFL's response. I shared part of it with you. It went on to say, we, quote, reject the legally unsound and factually baseless allegations made by the D.C. attorney general against the NFL and Commissioner Goodell and will vigorously defend against those claims. 
 <br>[09:45:08]
 
SCIUTTO: Such an important story.
 
Coming up next, we are going to take you back to Ukraine as Ukrainian troops liberate the city of Kherson, flags waving, people celebrating in the streets. A member of Ukraine's parliament will join me live next on just how significant a moment this is. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO: Right now, Ukrainian intelligence is telling any Russian soldiers still in Kherson to surrender. This after Ukrainian forces have now entered that city. 
 <br>[09:50:03]
 
Ukrainians in the streets now celebrating their freedom after months of brutal occupation, chanting, waving flags, giving some troops there, you see, a hero's welcome. 
 
Joining us now to discuss is a member of the Ukrainian parliament, Kira Rudik, who's a friend of the show.
 
Kira, it's nice to have you back.
 
KIRA RUDIK, MEMBER OF UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT: Thank you so much for having me. It's impossible to watch those videos without crying for us.
 
SCIUTTO: Oh, goodness, I remember being in Ukraine when Kherson was taken. And brave stands by residents there to those Russian soldiers.
 
Tell us what it means to you, to Ukrainians today, to see the city taken back. 
 
RUDIK: Well, today is an historic day. We will remember it because we are liberating the regional center, Kherson, that was captured at the beginning the invasion. And that is -- not too many people believe it would be taken back. 
 
Russians had their posters saying Kherson is (INAUDIBLE) forever that are now being ripped by Russian soldiers - by Ukrainian soldiers and by Ukrainian people who believe that Kherson will return to us. People are so happy they are chanting. And I can tell you, there is so much crying of happiness because when nobody believed that we would be able to do that, Kherson is Ukraine, and it's being liberated today. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes, in a war with so many sad moments, a happy moment is certainly one to celebrate. 
 
This is the latest in a string, really, of Russian withdrawals. We saw them pull back significantly in the north around Kharkiv. We're seeing it here. We're seeing them lose ground in the central part of the east as well. 
 
In your view, in the view of Ukrainian officials, is that a temporary Russian pullback or is this part of a larger Russian retreat? 
 
RUDIK: Well, first of all, I wouldn't call it withdrawal. There is no withdrawal. There is a retreat that is the result of intense fighting and strategic actions by Ukrainian army and the support of our allies. You know, there is -- like nothing is given in this war. It's always a matter of pain, death and incredible resolve and push of Ukrainian soldiers. 
 
So, we understand that in lieu of winter, Russians are getting ready to only keep the territories that they will be able to provide to. It's very hard to maintain the territories that they have captured. And this (INAUDIBLE) why, right now, we are able to get them back. 
 
However, it is important to remember that everywhere where we are liberating territories, we find same things. We find torture rooms, we find mass graves and we find raped women. And this is why we will be fighting for every single inch of Ukrainian land. 
 
SCIUTTO: CNN reporters have interviewed people who have experienced exactly what you're describing there.
 
"The New York Times" is reporting today that General Mark Milley, who's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs here, believes that there is a need to see a diplomatic outcome to the war in Ukraine, and that sparked some debate inside the Biden administration as far as how hard to push for it. 
 
I wonder, is the U.S., is the west, to your knowledge, pressuring Ukraine to return to the negotiating table? 
 
RUDIK: Well, we did not hear about such pressure. However, the question that we are ask remains the same, who or what are the security guarantees to the point that Russia would not attack us again? When we are talking about any diplomatic negotiations, about any peace deal, the question remains the same, how can we trust that Putin would not attack us tomorrow, or in a year, or in five years? 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
RUDIK: Because the main thing that we owe to our children, to the next generation, that they wouldn't have to fight this war again and again and again. And would you believe that Russia will get rid of their imperialistic intentions, especially after the shame that they experience right now? No. I believe that they will be out for us. And this is why we should not let this happen. 
 
SCIUTTO: Is Ukraine's goal to gain back all of Ukrainian territory, even territory that was taken by Russia in 2014, or just, do you believe, should it be to gain back what Russia has gained since February of this year? 
 
RUDIK: We are out for restoring our sovereignty to the borders of 1991. So, everything that was sovereign Ukraine, that is sovereign Ukraine, needs to become back sovereign Ukraine. 
 
SCIUTTO: It's a firm position. We've heard that from the Ukrainian president as well. 
 
Kira Rudik, thanks so much for joining us this morning. It's good to have you on. 
 
RUDIK: Thank you. And glory to Ukraine. 
 
HILL: On this Veterans Day, we want to take a moment to pause. 
 <br>[09:55:01]
 
Live picture here from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. This, of course, a day to honor the millions of men and women who have served in the armed forces. 
 
SCIUTTO: And the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, will join the first lady in an observance ceremony there. The vice president will participate in laying a wreath, also share some words. Be do - do be sure today to thank a veteran for all they've given in their service to this country. That's what today is about, thanking everyone who served and from here at CNN, we thank all of you. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO: A very good Friday morning to you. I'm Jim Sciutto. 
 
HILL: And I'm Erica Hill. 
 
Any moment now, President Biden set to speak at the U.N.'s climate conference in Egypt.
