THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[09:30:00]
 
JIM SCHULTZ, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LAWYER: -- prosecute once he leaves office, what will then be a former president of the United States. They need to justify that and that report goes to Congress.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: The main justification was the complete cooperation they got from President Biden after those documents were, in fact, it was revealed that he had them.
 
Elliot Williams, Jim Schultz, thank you both so much for being with us today.
 
ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Thanks, John.
 
BERMAN: Armed and dangerous. A manhunt underway for the suspect in the fatal shooting of a sheriff's deputy during a traffic stop.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BERMAN: This morning, Tucker Carlson might know what it feels like to get an unsolicited rambling selective history lesson. Now it's hard to know if he got played by Russian leader Vladimir Putin because who knows what Carlson actually wanted.
 <br>[09:35:11]
 
Putin suggested Ukraine needs to give up its resistance, and he signaled he may be open to a prisoner swap for Wall Street Journal Reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in Russia for nearly a year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA (through translation): We are willing to solve it. But there are certain terms being discussed via special services channels. I believe an agreement can be reached.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: With us now, former CNN Moscow Bureau Chief and Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University, Jill Dougherty. Jill, great to have you here. You, of course, know Russia so well, know Vladimir Putin so well. What did Putin get out of this?
 
JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I'm judging by what his press secretary said this morning, which is, what do you know? The entire world now wants an interview with Vladimir Putin, and essentially they're knocking on the door.
 
I think, you know, this interview to me was not the interview per se, because almost everything that we heard from Vladimir Putin, is the same thing that we've heard literally for years, but it was about the interview, you know, the preparation.
 
So I think Putin had domestic U.S. audiences and domestic Russian audiences in mind. Number one, Tucker Carlson gets an interview. There's a lot of press. Tucker gets a lot of attention. And Putin does too, because he's willing to give this interview at home in Russia, which is really crucial.
 
He gets to show that Russia is no longer isolated, that the world respects Vladimir Putin, and now everybody wants to talk to him. So I think ultimately, you know, Putin got more out of it than Tucker Carlson. Although I don't know financially, we'd have to look at that.
 
BERMAN: So, do you -- first of all, obviously, you're right. I mean, Putin gives this history lesson any chance he gets, and he gives it at length, which is what Tucker Carlson experience with his very first question. But what about what some people are perceiving as an opening to negotiate over Evan Gershkovich, anything really there?
 
DOUGHERTY: I don't think it's anything new. I mean, the name of that -- of the Russian which was not used by President Putin, but a lot of people know that they are pushing to get a Russian hitman who's currently being held in Germany released for Evan Gershkovich.
 
And so that even was not particularly new, Putin did say, you know, I'd like to see him return to his homeland, too. But that's not really news. So, I don't think it broke any new ground. Putin, though, was trying to get in, I think, some talking points where he said, you know, doesn't the United States have anything better to do than to arm Ukraine?
 
I mean, you've got problems on the border. You've got problems with your, you know, your budget, et cetera. Why not just do a deal with Russia? Of course, ignoring the fact that there's another country, which is Ukraine, which is the one that will make those decisions, hopefully.
 
BERMAN: Jill Dougherty, great to see you. And great for us to see this interview through your trained eyes. Thank you so much.
 
So the Super Bowl is upon us. Who is to thank for an expected surge in viewership? And does it rhyme with Smaylorlift (ph)?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:43:11]
 
BERMAN: More than 110 million people are expected to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday, and the NFL can thank Taylor Swift for some of those newfound football enthusiasts. CNN Sports Anchor, and all of a sudden, Chief Taylor Swift Correspondent, Coy Wire, is in Las Vegas reporting on it all.
 
Coy, I mean, you're there, in the middle of it. It's just a little bit different than you're used to.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Oh, it's incredible. Yes, I think I was today years old, John, when I realized there's a Super Bowl being played alongside this Taylor event -- Taylor Swift's event happening on Sunday. I've never seen so much focus about something going on outside the lines.
 
The most watched TV program in America has gotten even more hype and more intensity as these sports and entertainment worlds collide.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shout out to the newest members of the Chiefs Kingdom, Taylor Swift, who has officially reached the Super Bowl in her rookie year. That's kind of good (ph).
 
TRAVIS KELCE, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS TIGHT END: Shout out to Taylor. Thanks for joining the team.
 
WIRE (voice-over): The NFL and loads of fans are embracing this romance. One thing you can bet on is that Taylor Swift is good for business. NFL viewership hitting all-time highs this postseason.
 
KELCE: She's rewriting the history books herself. I told her I'll have to hold up my end of the bargain and come home some hardware, too.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're screaming at Taylor Swift saying she ruined it, you're just a loser.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why is everybody so mad about it?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh God.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why is everybody so mad about it?
 
COLIN COWHERD, HOST: This anger it says nothing about Taylor Swift. It says everything about the men bothered by it.
 
WIRE (voice-over): It's pretty clear that this has all been quite divisive. Some supporting Tay Tay, but others?
 
LISA MCCAFFREY, CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY'S MOM: We are boycotting.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Boycott.
 
MCCAFFREY: Any T Swift songs. And it's hard for me because I have her on my running playlist and everything, so. But if she pops up on -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's dead to you this week.
 
MCCAFFREY: -- the radio station, and my oldest son Max and I are big Swifties, nope, she's dead to us this week.
 <br>[09:45:03]
 
WIRE (voice-over): Now, listen to this. Taylor's favorite number is 13.
 
TAYLOR SWIFT, SINGER: This is my 13th Grammy, which is my lucky number. I don't know if I've ever told you that.
 
WIRE: This is Super Bowl 58, 5 plus 8 is 13. The game's being played on 2:11, 2 plus 11, 13. The Chiefs opponent, the 49ers. Four plus nine is you get it. But seriously, though, this will be Taylor's 13th game this season, leaving some conspiracy theorists to think the NFL is scripted.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think I'm that good a scripter or anybody on our staff.
 
WIRE (voice-over): Has this first ever Vegas Super Bowl matchup been Taylor made?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE: Oh, look what they made me do, John. Yes, some online are saying that getting the Chiefs in the Super Bowl so Swifties can boost ratings even further was the NFL's plan all along. But I am going to give you a bit of reporter envy right now, John.
 
I'm going to interview Tom Brady, your beloved Tom Brady in just a bit. And yes, I will ask him about this Swift mania, and I will also ask him about the heck of the quarterback matchup we're about to see on Super Bowl Sunday football.
 
BERMAN: You get a huge get an interview with Tom Brady to ask about Taylor Swift. Super Bowl 58 is upon us.
 
Coy Wire, thank you so much. Great job. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN HOST: John could not be happier. He wishes he were there.
 
All right, joining us now is former NFL wide receiver Donte Stallworth. Thank you, sir, for coming on. Love the hair and the beard. You're killing it. Can I just quickly ask you about this conspiracy thing? Now, I know you are very familiar with the 49ers. Is there anything to this numbers crunched whatever? What do you think?
 
DONTE STALLWORTH, FORMER NFL WIDE RECEIVER: I think it's always fun for especially around the Super Bowl for people to come up with all of these conspiracies and especially with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift dating now. There's obviously more storyline towards that. It's fun. But at the end of the day, I don't. It's not scripted, but it'll be interesting to see how it all plays out.
 
Obviously, the viewership has skyrocketed since Taylor has been dating Travis Kelce and then going to the games. You've seen a big surplus in young viewership of among young women, young girls. And the NFL is obviously going to welcome that viewership from anyone. And Taylor Swift obviously has a lot of star power, and she's bringing a lot of new viewers to the game.
 
SIDNER: Yes, I mean, she has a whole economy behind her. This has been the year of the woman -- 
 
STALLWORTH: Yes.
 
SIDNER: -- in 2023. It is again in 2024, I would like to add, and from now forward. But she brings with her a huge amount of people who may not have been interested in the Super Bowl and suddenly are. So you're welcome, NFL.
 
Let's just talk about who -- or the other stars of this, of the Super Bowl. We've got Mahomes six years as a starter. He's been selected to the Pro Bowl as he should be in every year. He is a two-time MVP, and on Sunday he could become the fifth quarterback, just the fifth to win three Super Bowls.
 
If Mahomes and Chiefs come out on top, where does that put him among the league's all-time great quarterbacks?
 
STALLWORTH: I think you've got to put him up there. He's -- he will actually be the youngest quarterback to start four games in the NFL's history. And he's only, I believe, 28 years old. So he's got a long way to -- hopefully, you got a long career left ahead of him. And he mentioned it last year that he wants to -- he's chasing Tom Brady. So it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out.
 
But I think even without the Super Bowl, I think he's already mentioned among the all-time greats now. But if he gets this win, you've got to start talking about him. You know, maybe not as good as Brady, but definitely knocking on the door.
 
SIDNER: Well, the 49ers I am well familiar used to live in the Bay Area, but they have whooped my rams behind a few times. So that makes me a little nauseous. But they have a chance to join the Patriots and the Steelers with the most Super Bowl wins of all time at six. There is a lot riding on this game for the head coach.
 
He has fallen just short of hitting the mountain top in recent years. What do you think about their chances here, and that the pressure that is put on Shanahan?
 
STALLWORTH: I'm born and raised in Sacramento, California, so I also grew up a 49ers fan. So -- and I played for Kyle Shanahan, and actually both played for Andy Reid too. So I, you know, I love Andy Reid. I love the Chiefs. I love Mahomes and everything that they've been able to build over there that this new dynasty that they have.
 
But, you know, I'd like to see Kyle Shanahan get one. I think the chances are really good. I mean, they're a really good team. They've had some injuries throughout the year, but they kind of persevered through all of that. And so have the Chiefs. They persevered through an up and down season.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
But, you know, now the culmination of the Super Bowl, you have the two best teams. And if I had to take a guess, if I'm the -- if I'm a betting man -- 
 
SIDNER: I'm listening in.
 
STALLWORTH: -- I'm going to go 49ers. I'm going to go with the home team by three points.
 
SIDNER: OK. Donte said it here live at 6:49 a.m. Pacific Time. Obviously you're in Las Vegas.
 
STALLWORTH: There you agree.
 
SIDNER: I think we can both agree. We both have seen the Niners play for a long time. Ain't no way they're letting someone win. So the fix is not in, OK? Let's just be clear.
 
Donte Stallworth -- 
 
STALLWORTH: Right. Exactly.
 
SIDNER: -- thank you so much for waking up early for us this morning. Appreciate you.
 
STALLWORTH: Thank you, Sara. Appreciate it.
 
SIDNER: John?
 
BERMAN: All right. We do have new reporting this morning on a manhunt after a deputy was shot and killed during a traffic stop.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BERMAN: All right, happening now, a manhunt is underway for a man suspected of shooting an East Tennessee sheriff's deputy. 42-year-old Kenneth DeHart allegedly shot and killed Deputy Greg McCowan during a traffic stop. The suspect is believed to be armed and dangerous with a 10,000 reward for details now leading to his capture.
 <br>[09:55:01]
 
CNN's Rafael Romo following all of this. What's the latest, Rafael?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, John. We know that the suspect is believed to be traveling on foot. And as you mentioned, and this is very important for people to know, he should be considered armed and dangerous. This is according to the Blount County Sheriff's Office in Tennessee, which has launched a manhunt to arrest the suspect. He's identified as 42-year-old Kenneth DeHart and is accused of shooting and killing a sheriff's deputy and injuring another during a traffic stop on Thursday. The officer killed was Deputy Greg McCowan, according to Blount County Sheriff James Lee Berrong. A second officer, John, Deputy Shelby Eggers was injured after returning fire. She was treated at a hospital and released.
 
The Blount County mayor's office is now offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to DeHart's capture. Sheriff Berrong has vowed to catch the suspect. Let's take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHERIFF JAMES LEE BERRONG, BLOUNT COUNTY, TENNESSEE: My friends behind me, they've had officers and they've stood up here before you before I have it. It's the hardest thing I've ever done.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And John, in the last couple of hours, Sheriff Berrong specifically asked people who live in the Wildwood area who may have outdoor security or doorbell camera video systems to please take a look at those systems in case the suspect might have been caught on camera.
 
Some of our viewers may know that Blount County, home of the city of Maryville, is about 30 miles west of Gatlinburg, a mountain town in eastern Tennessee. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is assisting in the search and has issued a statewide blue alert for DeHart.
 
Officials are advising people to not approach the suspect and asking them instead to contact law enforcement immediately if they see him. John, back to you.
 
BERMAN: Yes, be on the watch, but be careful. Rafael Romo, thank you very much for that.
 
Sara?
 
SIDNER: Thank you, John.
 
All right. Ahead, President Biden unleashes his fury. We are getting new behind the scenes details about the expletive lace rant over the special counsel's report. It cleared him, but it talked about him being a forgetful elderly man. We will have all the details ahead.
