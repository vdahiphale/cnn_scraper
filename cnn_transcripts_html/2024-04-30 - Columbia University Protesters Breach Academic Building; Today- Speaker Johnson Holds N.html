KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR:  It's Tuesday, April 30th.
 
Right now on CNN THIS MORNING:
 
Breaking news, protesters at Columbia break into an academic building and barricaded themselves inside. We are live on campus.
 
Growing concern in Israel and in Congress. The international Criminal Court is preparing an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 
And Donald Trump back in court, where the prosecution's third witness is laying out how the hush money for Stormy Daniels was actually paid.
 
(MUSIC)
 
HUNT:  Five a.m. here in Washington. A live look at the nation's capitol on this morning. 
 
Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. 
 
We begin this morning with breaking. Overnight at Columbia University. Dozens of protesters breached an academic building next to the protest encampment and they barricaded themselves inside. Others outside the building, formed a human chain to block out access to the entrance. 
 
In these images from Inside Columbia's Hamilton hall, you see one protester using a hammer to break a window and others moving furniture to block doorways. It's worth noting this building, Hamilton Hall, named for Alexander Hamilton, is home to the office of the dean of Columbia college and has been the site of many protests over the years, notably in 1968.
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval is on Columbia's campus early this morning, covering all of this for us. 
 
Polo, what's the latest?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Kasie, this would be a significant development. You see for nearly two weeks that we've been following this both on and off campus, protesters -- these pro-Palestinian demonstrators have really kept to that encampment itself, encampment in question, that is really the start of this massive movement we've seen across the country. 
 
However, overnight as you're able to see in some of these pictures, not only from the ground, but also in the air, you can see what appears to be many, many, many demonstrators, individuals that have actually gone up to that Hamilton hall, as you pointed out, is a significant important building here, housing the dean of Columbia College and appears to use a benches, tables as well to barricade the entrance of that -- of that building and other footage that we've also seen. There does appear to be indication that these demonstrators are these individuals, many of them with their faces covered forced their way into that building. 
 
As you can see in some of the pictures, or at least you may be able to make out some of the visuals, even looking out through the window from the inside. Obviously, this building would be closed at during the overnight hours. And in one instance, you've been hanging a Palestinian flag on the exterior of the building. 
 
As you point out, this facility, this specifically this building that is not far from the encampment that we've been discussing for the last two weeks, that has been the stage of previous student demonstrations and 1968 to increase awareness about the Vietnam War. Decades later in 1985, was also used to push for divestment from companies with South African ties during the apartheid. And so, this is really just now the latest chapter. 
 
However, this certainly would mark a potential significant escalation as Columbia University officials since yesterday after they impose that 2:00 p.m. deadline, to clear out of the encampment, which coincidentally is just about 50 yards from Hamilton Hall, have remained relatively restrained compared to what we experienced, what we saw just under two weeks ago when they reach out to the NYPD for assistance and clear up, clearing out another encampment. 
 
So in the hours ahead, it will certainly be significant, at least important to watch what will be the university's next move? Will they once again reach out to -- reach out to the NYPD? 
 
I can tell you, Kasie, just from our vantage point, again, the campus is restricted, so were not able to make our way onto the campus, it is very quiet. You wouldn't know it if you didn't have those pictures that have come in from -- from the campus itself, only security personnel and an occasional police officer. But this certainly might mean that we could expect that check to change very soon -- Kasie. 
 
HUNT:  Polo, we heard some from students were just kind of getting at reaction is this is coming into us overnight. I want to show you a little bit of what some of those students said and we'll talk about it on the other side. Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JESSIDE SCHWALB, COLUMBIA STUDENT:  The people who are already inside Hamilton hall decided to smash the windows and then put bike locks like around each door handle.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[05:05:00]
 
HUNT:  So there was also another student who described students who were trying to get in front of the mob as well. 
 
How do you understand kind of the tensions inside this group of people? 
 
SANDOVAL:  Yeah. What's going to be interesting to find out is who or what organization these individuals may be associated with. 
 
In fact, it's even to certain to positively say that they are all students. What we have seen though for the last two weeks are mainly students keeping two confines of that encampment and we've been on campus basically every day during that window. That's available. That's offered depressed to make their way onto campus. 
 
And I can tell you that a majority, a majority, not all, but of these demonstrations have kept to that lawn. So that's why this would be something fairly significant here, now with the potential for this demonstration to spill out of that area, and now, affecting this building, potentially even leading to some damage that we've seen on video. And again, at least 200 students were reporting at this hour are currently barricaded inside at Hamilton Hall. 
 
HUNT:  Polo Sandoval for us -- Polo, I'll come back to you as this unfolds this morning. Thanks very much for being there for us.
 
And this is the latest seen as the protests grow each and every day at college campuses across the country. Police in riot gear responding the demonstrations at Virginia Commonwealth university's campus in Richmond last night. This video from CNN affiliate WWBT shows people being taken into custody. It's clear this hour just how many arrests were made. 
 
Similar seen in Austin, Texas, as thousands of protesters were arrested yesterday on the UT campus. Demonstrators have now been arrested on more than 20 campuses across at least 16 states. And, of course, this has become a major political flashpoint. People on Capitol Hill responding to it. 
 
After his visit to Columbia last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson plans to hold a press conference today to announce what his House office is calling a House wide crackdown on the virus of antisemitism spreading throughout college campuses. Johnson previewed it when he spoke to reporters last night. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  This is not an expression of free speech. This is the -- this is the threats and open intimidation of the lives of innocent Jewish, many of them are fearful of the class. We need moral clarity on the issue. We need everybody from the president on down to speak out about this and say that it is clearly wrong and -- Jewish students are not second-class citizens and they can attend classes just like everyone else.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  Joining me now to discuss is Eugene Scott. He's the senior politics reporter at "Axios". 
 
Eugene, good morning. This, of course, these scenes playing out on college campuses. It's coming straight into our political debate. 
 
You heard Mike Johnson there, this is, of course, something that's very difficult for President Biden a to grapple with Karine Jean Pierre at the podium yesterday, essentially saying its up to each and every university to deal with this kind of trying to stay above the fray. 
 
How long do you think they can do that? 
 
EUGENE SCOTT, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, AXIOS:  Not long, especially because Mike Johnson is quite frankly, I believe using this opportunity as a chance to unify his party, which really needs some unity right now, given where he stands with a few members in his party, this also has played into the GOP's consistent talking point that caused just are out of control, and when you see buildings being breached. There are safety issues that people who are even sympathetic to the Palestinian protesters are concerned about it. 
 
And so, not seeing the White House take a more starch stance on this really does give Johnson and other people in his party a bit of an advantage. 
 
HUNT:  Yeah, this building is really interesting to me because it clearly there is so much history. There was 1968, it was during the height of the Vietnam War, again in 1972, was occupied id also over the war and then it was 1985 to protest apartheid. 
 
But the reality is it's been a really long time since we've seen this, right? We have been many decades now removed from that era. So to kind of come back to this is -- it's really, as you point out, quite something to see, especially when you see the hammer breaking the windows. 
 
Let's -- let's also look at some of our colleagues on Capitol Hill yesterday. One of the issues that has become a flashpoint here is how to use federal money. Obviously, there are many investigations into antisemitism on campus is going on right now. Let's listen to what some of those lawmakers had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (R-NY):  My bill would actually strip federal funding from institutions that allow antisemitic activities to take place. If our tax dollars shouldn't be going to universities that allow antisemitism to persist. REP. DON BACON (R-NE):  Antisemitism is disgraceful and a lot of these
 
 universities have done too little, and it's not fair to our Jewish students.
 
REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  I do think that these institutions of higher learning if they fail to act, then federal funding should be stripped from them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  How much traction do you think this is going to get at this point? I mean, and again, I think we should underscore, there are certainly peaceful protests, people who are out there, supporting, you know, Palestinians who are suffering, who need humanitarian aid. 
 <br>[05:10:07]
 
However, we have seen at points very ugly antisemitism rear its head. 
 
SCOTT:  We have. Just like we've seen, an increase in antisemitism over the last few years. And this a right now is showing how different places that it's showing up. I think what's really interesting is we know that I believe more than 20 campuses are finding themselves having students protested. They range. 
 
Some are public, some are private, some are big, some are small, some are in major cities, some are in smaller towns. Different schools will be affected differently by removal of federal funding, all to some degree received some federal funding. But this could have a significant impact on the educational experience at some schools and wastes that it wanted others. 
 
HUNT:  Very interesting point. Eugene Scott. Thank you very much for being with us this morning. I really appreciate it. 
 
All right. Coming up next here, what would the U.S. do if the International Criminal Court issues a warrant, an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu? Plus, four officers killed while trying to serve a warrant. We'll bring you that and we'll have much more on today's breaking news. Student protester is breaking into and now occupying an academic building at Columbia, this happening overnight.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:15:24]
 
HUNT:  Welcome back this morning. 
 
There is growing concern that the International Criminal Court could soon issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, is urging President Biden two intervene and demand that the ICC stand down. That's according to "Axios".
 
The White House has been tight-lipped about any possible warrants.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We don't believe it's in the ICC jurisdiction in this situation. 
 
We do not support the investigation, and I think that kind of answers that question when we say we do not support this so we do not believe its in their in their jurisdictions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  Another House Republican told "Axios" that retaliatory legislations already in the works if the warrants do come down. 
 
CNN's Max Foster joins me now, live from London. 
 
Max, good morning to you. 
 
The ICC, they're an independent organization. They have also issued warrants its against Vladimir Putin. Can you help us understand how and why this is coming together? And also the impact of this if it does come down for the prime minister of Israel/
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  What was Israel in the as you say, don't recognize it, so wouldn't have any impact there, but it would have see impact. Netanyahu, if he wanted to travel to countries like the UK, Canada, all the countries that do recognize the ICC. So we've seen that with Putin. He hasn't been traveling to countries which do recognize the ICC, presumably for fear of being arrested, he could be arrested if he goes there. 
 
Also is the optics of this, as always is, it suggests that those countries support the ICC decision, which we might not necessarily do. Also, the Israeli government has been warning Israeli embassies around the world that this might come down and might increase antisemitism as well. So, all very unhelpful. As far as the U.S. and Israel is concerned, it doesn't relate to the war, by the way, it goes back some years, and is largely in relation to the building of settlements.
 
HUNT:  Right. So, Max, as far as Netanyahu is concerned, I mean, we've talked so much about how his domestic political situation is something that's front of mind for him and is affecting potentially the conduct of the war. We know big picture. They have put an offer on the table that Tony Blinken and Saudi Arabia yesterday called extraordinarily narrowly generous to Hamas and I'm interested to know what you think that says about how Netanyahu feels. 
 
He's clearly under intense pressure from hostage families in Israel to try to bring people home on the one hand. On the other, does this arrest warrant affect him from a domestic perspective? 
 
FOSTER:  I think it's this it'd be the sense, wouldn't it, that there is this view and other parts of the world that he should be arrested. And then it becomes a debate within Israelis and divisive figure. And then all of his opponents would suggest this is what you've done. And maybe you should be arrested. I mean, it would inevitably play into the debate. So its incredibly
 
 unhelpful in terms of the deal the debate now is not whether or not there will be some sort of ceasefire, whatever you want to call it, is how long its going to last. Will it turn transition into a lasting peace? 
 
So this is why people are so positive about Blinken's positivity if you like, because if there's a potential now, this is what that entire region has been looking for. Countries like Saudi Arabia or lasting peace, which can transition into a place where Gazans can return to normal life. 
 
HUNT:  All right. Max Foster for us in London -- Max, thank you very much. Always appreciate having you. See you tomorrow.
 
All right. Coming up next here, four officers shot and killed while serving a warrant in North Carolina. We'll bring you that. 
 
And breaking news, protesters now occupying a building on in Columbia's campus. Well keep you posted as this unfolds. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:23:21]
 
HUNT:  All right. Twenty-two minutes past the hour. 
 
Here's your morning roundup. Four officers were killed while trying to serve a warrant in Charlotte, North Carolina. Four other officers were wounded. A local police chief called it the most tragic shooting he's been involved with in his 32-year career. The feds policy setting committee, starting at closely watched two day meeting. Investors are wondering whether the board will raise interest rates above their current 23-year high or if they'll hold them steady following a series of disappointing inflation reports.
 
The FEMA director Deanne Criswell heads to Oklahoma today to meet with local officials after tornadoes devastated parts of the state over the weekend, four people were killed, including an infant.
 
Time now for whether. The central U.S. facing another severe storm threat today on the heels of that deadly tornado outbreak over the weekend. 
 
Let's get straight to our meteorologist, Derek Van Dam. 
 
Derek, good morning to you. What are you seeing? 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah, I'm concerned about storm fatigue with this setup because we're coming off of a very active weekend of over 500 storm reports, 137 tornado reports from Thursday through Sunday. And now we have another round of severe weather highlighted across this area, greatest risk from southwestern Iowa, three portions of Missouri stretching into Kansas and Nebraska. 
 
But you can see this is just the previous storm imports from the last round of severe weather that rolled through that caused the damage you saw on your screens just a moment ago. And what we've been talking about.
 
Radar right now are generally quiet, but later today, things will get active once again, once we take advantage of the daytime heating from the sun, we have our greatest risk of severe -- our tornadoes, I should say from Wichita through Kansas City, northward into Sioux City, Omaha, and Des Moines. 
 <br>[05:25:04]
 
This particular area as a 5 percent probability of tornadoes and then the real threat will consider, will also be within the large hail, a highlighted within this area, that kind of that hatched area is our greatest probability of two-inch or larger sized hail. And then also a wind threat associated with this line of storms that is expected to develop. 
 
In fact, watch as we time it out later this evening, right around 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. just after dinner. That's when we expect the storms to fire up. It'll be more of a bowing segments. So, the wind threat will be greatest, and then severe weather threat advances eastward for the day tomorrow. 
 
So, 20 million Americans, nearly 20 million under threat today, and then nearly twice 25 million Americans, including portions of Oklahoma and Texas for the day tomorrow. So it never ends. This is severe weather season, height of tornado season -- Kasie. 
 
HUNT:  Be very tough. We'll keep an eye out. 
 
Our Derek Van Dam for us -- Derek, thank you very much. 
 
All right. If you're just waking up, were following breaking news this morning. Protesters now barricaded inside the main academic building for undergrads at Columbia University.
 
Plus, Donald Trumps hush money trial back in court just hours from now.
 
And growing support within the GOP to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson? We'll see.
