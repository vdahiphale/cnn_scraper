BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: With what would be the first ever U.S. default looming, President Biden and Speaker McCarthy are nowhere near seeing eye to eye on a solution. 
 
McCarthy has offered up a plan, his plan, but now we know that Biden will veto that bill should it ever reach his desk. 
 
The GOP proposal would raise the debt limit for a year, but it's paired with serious spending cuts to Biden's priorities. 
 
In a veto threat today, the White House called the plan "reckless," saying the president will not accept such attempts at hostage taking. 
 
Let's go to CNN's Lauren Fox. She's at the capitol for us. 
 
Lauren, does McCarthy have the votes for tomorrow? 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean, that's the big question. And we should note, just a few moments ago, he talked to our team and gave us a better sense of what leadership is thinking right now on vote timing.
 
Saying they would vote this week rather than emphasizing this vote would come tomorrow, a potential sign that this vote could be slipping because leadership is still trying to get the majority of their conference, the magical number 218 to back this proposal. 
 
And right now, they're running into two specific headwinds. One coming from conservatives who have concerns about voting for a debt ceiling increase at all. Other conservatives arguing that they want to see more stringent work requirements for programs like food stamps and Medicaid. 
 
There is also concern coming from four Republicans from the state of Iowa about the repeal of some of the ethanol subsidies in this Republican proposal. 
 
That meeting we expect to happen today with Kevin McCarthy and those Republicans from the state of Iowa to try to work through this. 
 
But yesterday, when I talked to the Republican whip, Brianna, he said this bill, it wasn't open for negotiation anymore. Here's what Tom Emmer told me. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): We're trying to thread the needle with all of our members. And, no, I do not expect the language is going to change. The bill is closed. The speaker has told us that. And I expect when we get to the floor, when that comes, we're going to pass the bill. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[14:35:12]
 
FOX: And expect to see a flurry of meetings this afternoon as, again, leadership is trying to lock up the vote they need for this proposal. We'll keep an eye on this vote timing and see whether it looks passed tomorrow -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: The challenges of a very slim majority out there on the Hill. 
 
Lauren Fox, live for us, thank you so much. 
 
Boris? 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: It's day two of closing arguments in the seditious conspiracy trial against five leaders of the far-right group the Proud Boy. 
 
A federal jury in Washington hearing months of testimony all boiling down the events of January 6th and the alleged plot to violently stop the certification of the 2020 election results and keep President Trump in power. 
 
CNN's Sara Sidner has been following this case from the very beginning. 
 
Sara, you've sat down with some of these defendants one-on-one. Bring us up to speed on what's happening in the case. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL ANCHOR: As you mentioned, they're in closing arguments. The Justice Department, in their closing arguments, basically said, look, the Proud Boys were, as they put it, Donald Trump's army. 
 
They have gone through months of just witnesses on the stand. You also had, of course, five attorneys who had to do the case for each of the defendants, which is why this trial lasted such a long time, even longer than the previous seditious conspiracy trial against the Oath Keepers. This one lasting about two months so far. 
 
But we did, of course, hear from defense attorneys in their closing. 
 
And I want you to hear what we just got in from Enrique Tarrio's defense attorney. Most of the defense attorneys didn't directly after Donald Trump. That is not the case with Enrique Tarrio's attorney. 
 
He said to the jury, "It was Donald Trump's words, it was his motivation, it was his anger that caused January 6th in your amazing and beautiful city," referencing D.C. to the crowd there who was from D.C. 
 
Now, he said they want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald Trump and those in power. 
 
That is perhaps the strongest closing argument against Donald Trump trying to say they're using Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat there. 
 
Of course, the prosecution would argue very differently in this case and have brought forth mountains of evidence in this case against several of the defendants. 
 
I do want to let you hear from Enrique Tarrio himself. To couch this, it was in February 2021. This is right after some of the Proud Boy members had been charged in this case. And Enrique Tarrio himself had not yet been charged. 
 
Here's what he had to say about his Proud Boys and what happened on January 6th. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: Did the Proud Boys have a plan to go --
 
ENRIQUE TARRIO, PROUD BOYS LEADER: Into the capitol?
 
SIDNER: -- into the capitol?
 
TARRIO: Absolutely not. There's nobody that told them that stopped them from going in. You feel like it's something that's wrong, you shouldn't do. 
 
SIDNER: But are you blaming police for telling people not to break the law? 
 
TARRIO: No, I'm not blaming the cops at all. 
 
SIDNER: What are you saying? 
 
TARRIO: Now, now I can blame -- I can blame the police officer and the feds for their inability to respond to this. So was it a mistake to even go into the capital? 
 
SIDNER: Was it? 
 
TARRIO: Yes. 
 
SIDNER: Do you condemn those people and you say that right now? 
 
TARRIO: OK, I can't say that because --
 
SIDNER: Why not? TARRIO: -- I think "condemn" is a very strong word and I think it's a little bit too strong. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: Not long after that, Enrique Tarrio himself was charged along with the other four defendants.
 
And the closing arguments continue. This case has gone on, like I said, for a couple of months now, a very long, tedious case this jury is going to have to go through once they get all those closing arguments finished -- Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: I want to point out, Sara, in the days before January 6th, Enrique Tarrio was in D.C. burning stuff his attorney says was happening in a beautiful, lovely city. Quite an interesting turn there. 
 
My friend, Sara Sidner, the pride of Miami Lakes. I always like to say that. 
 
Thanks so much for being with us, Sara.
 
Jim?
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: A scary trend of people being shot for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Well, it's happened again, this time in south Florida. Two Instacart delivery drivers shot at when they mistakenly ended up at the wrong address. We'll have new details on this.
 <br>[14:39:34]
 
Plus, Breonna Taylor's mother tells CNN that it's, quote, "a slap in the face" that a sheriff's office has now hired one of the police officers who was involved in the fatal shooting of her daughter. More of her interview just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO: Yet another wrong-place, wrong-time shooting in this country. Police say a homeowner near Miami shot at two Instacart delivery drivers who they were trying to deliver groceries to the wrong address. 
 
According to investigators, the homeowner says he feared for his safety after seeing the car, he says, driving erratically. The Instacart workers say they understandably feared for their own lives. 
 
Police incredibly will not by filing charges against the homeowner. The incident highlights the dangers delivery drivers may face. 
 
CNN's Omar Jimenez sat down with three people who knock on doors for a living and they share stories of precautions they have to take. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's going to be interesting. 
 <br>[14:45:01]
 
SCIUTTO: A door knock gone terribly wrong. 
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Tonight, new details in a case of shooting a 16-year-old who mistakenly rang his doorbell. 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Let's get right into this. 
 
Chad, right off the bat, tell me how big of a part of your job actually is knocking on people's doors? 
 
CHAD CRAIG, REALTOR: If I was to put it percentage wise, I would say about between 20 and 30 percent. A lot of realtors choose not to do it because of the situations. As soon as I knock on the door, I always step off the porch or try to give at least six feet between the doorstep and myself. 
 
JIMENEZ: It's interesting to hear you do that. We do the exact same thing. And really the key for me is I want to be able to look to my left and look to my right and see I have space to potentially jump out of the way if somebody comes out with a gun. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I try to be as loud as I can like, hey, delivery, good morning, you know, good afternoon, good evening, deliver, you know, from the bottom of the stairs. I try to like attract attention to myself in a way that's disarming in my mind. 
 
JIMENEZ: Yes, you're just trying to let them know if you see someone walking up in the next few seconds, I come in peace. 
 
ANTONIO CHAVEZ, BIKE COURIER: I'm a bike messenger in San Francisco. I was accosted by somebody in a nice neighborhood. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want identification. Who are you? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) are you? Why do you think that I have to answer your (EXPLETIVE DELETED) question? Don't think I don't know why you came over here and stopped me. Because you think I belong in another neighborhood, right? 
 
CHAVEZ: At first, he was going to call the cops because he thought I was stealing packages, and after I pressed him back a little bit, he said that I was being threatening and that I was scary. 
 
D'MONTERRIO GIBSON, FEDEX DRIVER: A lot of these people say they do feel unsafe and they do feel like they perceive somebody as a threat. But if you perceive somebody as a threat, why not just call police? That's what we pay them for, right? 
 
CRAIG: I if I don't know too much about the neighborhood I probably won't go there and introduce myself. I have the luxury of picking and choosing. Unfortunately, these gentlemen do not. JIMENEZ: D'Monterrio, this makes me think a little bit of your
 
 situation. I know you can't talk too much about it, but you've been actually shot at on the job. 
 
GIBSON: Yes, sir. 
 
JIMENEZ: I always feel like my press I.D., I feel like it helps me, it helps people calm down when they say who are you, what are you doing, I always say I'm with CNN. 
 
Do you feel your uniform protects you in some cases? 
 
GIBSON: No, sir. Because I had my uniform on that night. Uniform, big jacket, big words, everything.
 
CHAVEZ: I looked up "porch shooting" because I forgot the kid's name for a second. It wasn't the first time. How do you teach your kid don't make a mistake, don't knock on the door, don't deliver a package, don't look the way you look? What are you supposed to tell them, you know? 
 
CRAIG: We've gotten to a place where it's shoot first and ask questions later, and that's just a terrible place we're headed in. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCIUTTO: A lot of data to back that up. 
 
Our thanks to Omar Jimenez for that report. 
 
Brianna?
 
KEILAR: Now to some of the other headlines that we're watching this hour. 
 
Breonna Taylor's mother says it is a, quote," slap in the face" that a sheriff's department hired the officer involved in her daughter's shooting. 
 
Miles Cosgrove was recently hired by the Carroll County Sheriff's Office according to his attorney. 
 
Take a listen to what Tamika Palmer had to say on CNN this morning. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAMIKA PALMER, MOTHER OF BREONNA TAYLOR: I want to say I was surprised. I still can't believe it. I'd say but not surprised at all. 
 
No, neither. I haven't reached out and they definitely haven't reached out. 
 
I'm just disappointed in them. I just -- I can't understand why you would want this type of person to work in your department? You know, I'm scared for the people of Carroll County. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: Also, the governor of North Dakota has signed one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country. It would ban abortions at six weeks in the state, with no exceptions for rape or incest. 
 
There is an exception if the mother's health or life are in danger. The law also makes it a felony for performing or aiding an abortion.
 
Boris? 
 <br>[14:49:21]
 
SANCHEZ: Even more reason to keep your day job. What a new study says about bad work schedules and mental health. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: The CDC is sounding the alarm about what our jobs can do to our mental health. Factors that cause distress include inflexible work schedules and not getting paid sick leave. 
 
CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard, is with us now live. 
 
Jacqueline, what other job conditions are associated with psychological distress? 
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: It's interesting, Boris. This study also shows that people who work evening or night shifts tend to have higher psychological distress. 
 
We're also seeing a connection with people who have infrequent month to month earnings. And we also see a connection with those who end up having to go to work while physically ill. 
 
So all of that plays a role in our stress levels. 
 
And overall, Boris, this study found that in 2021 -- that's the year where the most recent data were available -- about one in 37 working adults between the ages of 18 and 64 experienced serious psychological distress. So that shows this is a widespread issue.
 
And the takeaway here, Boris, is that your health is not only impacted by whether you have a job but also the conditions at that job -- Boris? 
 <br>[14:55:06]
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, definitely. 
 
And, Jacqueline, what if folks can't adjust their work schedules, they can't get paid sick leave? What advice is there for them? 
 
HOWARD: Yes, you know, Boris, with a lot of these job conditions, it really comes down to the lack of control that a person might feel like they have over their work schedules, over their job. 
 
So number one, definitely talk to your supervisor about having a more consistent schedule or having some control. 
 
And then we also know for all of us healthy ways to cope with stress. This is according to the CDC. Of course, take care of your body, so work out, eat healthy.
 
And then make time to unwind. Have a support system around you, friends, family, loved ones. 
 
All of these steps you see on the screen here are ways to really help cope with stress in our day to day lives -- Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, great advice, Jacqueline. Work out, meditate, watch CNN NEWS CENTRAL weekdays Monday through Friday, 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. 
 
Thank you so much, Jacqueline.
 
Brianna?
 
KEILAR: Have a show at 1:00 p.m., work with Boris and Jim. That's how I do it. 
 
Coming up, the World Health Organization now warning about a huge biological risk in Sudan after one of the warring factions occupied a public health lab. A high-ranking source calling it a potential germ bomb. We're going to bring you the latest.
