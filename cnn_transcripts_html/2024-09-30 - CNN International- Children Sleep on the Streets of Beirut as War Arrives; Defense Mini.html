MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Max Foster. This is CNN "Newsroom". Just ahead a CNN on the streets of Beirut as Israeli airstrikes continue in the Lebanese capital. We bring you the stories of civilians trying to survive.
 
Plus, washed away by Helene, whole communities in North Carolina are without power as rescuers struggle to reach those in desperate need. And Donald Trump back on the campaign trail today, why both Republicans and Democrats are denouncing his recent comments about Kamala Harris.
 
Hezbollah is vowing to fight on and choose a new leader, while Israel is striking more Hezbollah targets in Southern Lebanon, just days after taking out its leader. Also, for the first time since war broke out on October the seventh, air strikes hit deep into the heart of Beirut.
 
The Lebanese capital is on edge after the first Israeli strikes within city limits. You can see the chaos near the city's Cola bridge, the major intersection. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment. Here's a look at some of the damage in the daylight hours, the barrage of strikes prompting Syrian refugees who once came to Lebanon to flee violence to return home.
 
The U.N. says at least 100,000 Lebanese and Syrians have crossed into Syria. 1 million people have been displaced, according to Lebanon's Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Israel confirms that it also carried out airstrikes more than 2000 kilometers away in Yemen on Sunday.
 
Israel's Defense Minister says the strikes in Yemen show that for Israel, quote, no place is too far. A Palestinian group says three of its members were killed in the Beirut airstrike. CNN's Ben Wedeman filed this report from the Lebanese capital just a short time ago.
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're at the site of an Israeli air strike that took place at 01:00 a.m. on Monday. This apartment on the fifth floor was hit. According to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, three of their members were killed in that strike, in addition to one other person, as reported by the Ministry of Health.
 
Now, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is a Palestinian faction that has a presence here in Lebanon, but has not been active for several years. It's not clear if Israel is now taking the opportunity to target, not just Hezbollah and others who have been firing into Israel, but all of the factions that are opposed to Israel.
 
Now, many of the people who left the southern suburbs moved to areas like this because they thought it might be safer. Clearly, that's not the case.
 
FOSTER: And CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has been speaking to terrified civilians on the streets of Beirut, and she filed this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): War has arrived to Beirut, and this is what it's done to so many of its children, exhausted and homeless. They now sleep on the streets and parks like this one, most here fled the densely populated southern suburbs where Israel's rained down bombs on Hezbollah targets.
 
But like every war, it is the innocent who paid the heaviest price. Abeer's home was hit in one of the strikes. She grabbed her little girl and ran and they've been out here since.
 
ABEER, DISPLACED IN LEBANON: I've never fled my home before, not even in the 2006 war.
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): The single mother says, but now I have a child. The children are terrified. Far from the air strikes, eight- year-old Batul (ph) tells us she's very scared. The roof was falling on us, she says. Every time my mom would tell me they're not going to strike, they would. I wish the war would stop.
 
Batul (ph) plays with new friends she's made, children trying to escape a new reality. They're too young to understand. But beneath their playful giggles, trauma and fear so deep, 10-year-old fats may can't hold back her tears. The whole country is being destroyed, she says, born in Syria, she fled war a baby Beirut's the only home she's ever known. My dad was killed in Syria, she says, I only have my mom.
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
I'm scared my mother and siblings will also get killed. Syrians, Lebanese and migrant workers all found themselves with nowhere to turn, but this park. Schools now house the displaced, but there are too many in search of shelter, and this all happened so fast, a million people, the government estimates, have been displaced in a matter of days.
 
We found many Lebanese families like this one camped out on the side of the road for five days, they say there was no room for them at government shelters, their disabled young girl sleeps in the car. The rest have mattresses outside, no toilets or showers here, they've heard their home is still standing, the women tell us, but their neighborhood is devastated.
 
Our area has been emptied out -- says there is no one left. In the heart of the capital in Marchers Square the remnants of crises passed with a poster that reads, Beirut never dies, and here many more with no roofs over their heads. For how long? No one really knows, but they fear this may only just be the start of a long war on -- fled barefoot.
 
It was real horror, she says, air strikes were all around us. People were collapsing and fainting. She only grabbed her medication and these tissue packs her livelihood. She sells them for about 50 cents on those he escaped Syria, her home, there is gone. Wherever we go, she says, death follows us. It's all just too much.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Jomana joins us now from Beirut. I mean, it's horrifying hearing those stories. What advice are people getting about what they should do, where they should go in the midst of all of this?
 
KARADSHEH (on camera): Well, you know, Max, the government is saying it's trying its best to set up shelters. There are about 170 or so that have been set up those schools that have been turned into these displacement centers. But when we were at one of those yesterday, people were coming in, and there was just no space for them.
 
You've got multiple families sharing one classroom, and so some people say it's better for them to just stay out on the streets than get crammed into these centers where there's not enough for everyone. And it's not just that, Max. The fear is that we are now looking, according to the government here, at up to a million people who have been displaced in a matter of days.
 
No one expected these numbers. I mean, one minister was telling me a few days ago that back in 2006 during that Israel Hezbollah war, they had about 6 to 800,000 people who have been displaced. But right now, you have Lebanon facing its biggest ever internal displacement crisis, and the government just doesn't have the resources to deal with it.
 
So, they are trying their best, but they are coping with these numbers. They're continuing to grow, and the fear is you are going to have so many more. I mean, that strike that Ben was reporting on that really sent shockwaves across the capital. A lot of people very worried seeing that you now have a strike taking place outside of the southern suburbs for the first time during this war.
 
And a couple of days ago, we heard from the Israeli military's Arabic language spokesman putting out a warning in a post on X addressed to all the people of Lebanon, while specifically addressing the people of the southern suburbs, Southern Lebanon and the east where these operations and these airstrikes have been concentrated.
 
It was also a message to the entire population, telling people that they have to stay away from Hezbollah facilities. People don't really know where Hezbollah facilities are. So that's absolutely terrifying for the population. And it also sends a message, along with these strikes, where you see it expanding beyond the southern suburbs, that there might be more coming.
 
That other parts of the capital and other parts of the country might also come under Israeli bombardment, as we are seeing this war really widening right now. It is absolutely terrifying for the civilians in the city and across this country, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK Jomana, thank you so much us. President Joe Biden saying he'll speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon. Biden says a wider war must be avoided, and the U.S. is taking precautions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: It has to be. We really have to avoid it. We've already taken precautions relative to our embassies and personnel who wanted to leave, but we're not there yet. But we're working like hell with the French and many others.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
FOSTER: Meanwhile, the Pentagon says it plans to reinforce its air support capabilities in the Middle East as the conflict grows. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. I mean, this deployment, is it to protect U.S. interests, or is it to protect Israel? What's your understanding?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well Max, a U.S. official tells CNN that what the U.S. is trying to do right now is take steps to really beef up joint defense efforts, working with Israel, as well as making these changes to U.S. military posture in the hopes that they could ward off a potential attack by Iran.
 
A U.S. official tells CNN that, that is a major area of concern for the U.S. right now, that Iran might be planning an attack in retaliation for Israel's killing of Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah just last week. Now, the U.S. official did not detail exactly what Iran's attack might look like or the specific measures that the U.S. military is taking in preparation.
 
But the Pentagon yesterday did say in a statement that if Iran or any of its partners or proxies tries to use this moment to target American personnel or American interests in the region, that the U.S. would respond in defense of their personnel. They noted that the U.S. military has significant capabilities in the region, including a carrier strike group.
 
You have also heard from the Pentagon that they plan to increase their force posture, their readiness, readiness to be able to deploy in the region if necessary. On Saturday, President Biden convened a call with his national security team and Vice President Kamala Harris to evaluate the situation in the Middle East and also talk about the U.S. military readiness in the region.
 
So right now, they are trying to take these potential steps in preparation, to prepare for all scenarios. If they don't exactly know what that might look like from Iran, or whether there might be something else coming from Hezbollah, but it all does come at a very precarious moment for the region, as President Biden you heard just there say that he wants to prevent all-out war in this region.
 
Something that his administration has really feared and been working against since the start of the conflict nearly one year ago. Now, Biden also said that he plans to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon, though, officials have not detailed exactly when that will happen.
 
But one area where the administration is still holding out some hope is that there can be some type of diplomatic solution. In this situation, you saw the U.S. and France, along with other countries, roll out what they thought was a plan to lead towards a 21 day cease fire between Israel and Hezbollah that quickly went away, even though U.S. officials thought Israel had signed on to it.
 
Then Israel poured a little bit of cold water on that, and then moved forward with their targeting and killing of Nasrallah in Beirut just last Friday, the administration still insists that they believe that there is a diplomatic solution that they can achieve to try to get Lebanese and Israeli citizens back to their home safely.
 
But it's unclear right now what the progress towards that diplomatic solution might be. But in the meantime, the U.S. is starting to make preparations in the event that they could be a potential attack by Iran, though they haven't detailed what that might look like, but also making clear the Pentagon over the weekend that they are ready to defend American interests and personnel in the region if there is any such attack.
 
FOSTER: OK Arlette at the White House. Thank you so much. Let's go back to the region. CNN's Nic Roberson, who joins us now from Tel Aviv in Israel, from the you know, all eyes on Israel at the moment, and whether or not, it sends what gather are troops gathering at the border, going in to Lebanon.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yeah, Max. The messaging has sort of been steadily ramping up on that through last week, the IDF released video of troops in training at the border. They announced that they were calling up two brigades of reservists, a couple of 1000 troops.
 
We saw video over the weekend that the IDF released the tanks at the border. Today, the defense minister has been at the border, perhaps giving the strongest indication yet that those troops could be deployed. He said he was talking to the troops, and among those troops were the Golani Brigade.
 
Now this is perhaps one of Israel's more elite fighting forces, certainly battle experience, battle hardened. And he said to them, look killing Hassan Nasrallah was a very important first step, but this is part of our message for our enemies, and I hope that they sort of hear this and understand it, he said, but we will use all our capabilities.
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
And he said to the troops, there you are those capabilities. He's saying, I will use you. So, the indication that his giving is a very clear signal to the soldiers to Hezbollah, to the world, I suppose, to Israelis, that they are prepared to deploy those troops across the border, the signaling is all there.
 
Has the decision been taken. And most importantly, what will their mission be if they do go across the border? But that's where we seem to be, Max, it does seem to be heading in that direction right now.
 
FOSTER: And how would we define that? If that happens. We talk about conflict between Hezbollah and Israel at the moment would ground troops going in, mean it's now technically a war.
 
ROBERTSON: You know, I think a lot of people would say it became a war when Israel defined its war aims a little over two weeks ago, two weeks ago tonight, that the Northern Front was part of their war aims, their broader war aims. 
 
So, I think that, that definition would be in many people's mind when more than 1000 people have been killed across the border in Lebanon in the strikes the pagers that were blown up on Hezbollah, all the way to the killing of Hassan Nasrallah and many of his leadership.
 
But I think it would probably be couched here in terms of an incursion across the border. And what would that incursion be intended to do? Well, every time we ask the IDF, are they going to push troops across the border? They say, we'll do whatever it takes to make it safe for our border communities, 60,000 people living on the northern border to move back.
 
What does that actually look like? Some people have described that to me as perhaps creating a buffer zone along the border. So, the houses that Hezbollah uses to launch those quick and easy to use shoulder launch rockets that can't be intercepted by iron dome or anything like that, to hit houses just over the border.
 
It would be to stop and prevent -- doing that? But, you know, history tells us, and I've heard this very senior officials as well. There's no such thing going into Lebanon as a limited incursion. It quickly becomes something else. But I think here it would be framed as something relatively small, not trying to send troops all the way to Beirut, because of the many failures through history Israel has had in trying to do that.
 
FOSTER: OK Nic Robertson, thank you so much for joining us from Tel Aviv. Communities across the U.S. Southeast are facing indescribable destruction after Hurricane Helene tore an 800-kilometer path of devastation from Florida to Virginia, at least 102 people across six states have died.
 
Millions are still without water, power and mobile phone service. In Western North Carolina, hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, but officials hope those numbers will go down as communications knocked out by the storm, slowly get back online. The historic mountain community of Asheville is now isolated as hundreds of roads remain closed, slowing the delivery of badly needed supplies and making it difficult to get people out.
 
As CNN's Rafael Romo is live in Asheville for us. Rafael the State's Governor, Roy Cooper speaking to CNN a few minutes ago, he says that the physical and emotional toll from the storm is literally indescribable.
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right, Max. And he also said earlier that the first responders and the crews trying to help people in need are also overwhelm. It's just very hard, and when you look around me that we're surrounded by mud in this area of Asheville. You get an idea.
 
You begin to get an idea of how tough it's going to be for these crews like. Take a look at this restaurant behind me that is surrounded by mud. There's another one that is surrounded by debris. This is billboard avenue right behind me, just a few blocks, just to get an idea of where we are.
 
Just a few blocks that way is the Swannanoa River, which crested at 27 feet on Friday, flooding all of this area not too far in that direction as well is the historic 19th century Biltmore Estate. And it is a very difficult situation for people here because they have no power, no water, no means of communication, no mobile service, much less internet.
 
And they're telling us that they're desperate, not only because they're lacking the basic necessities, but because they're unable to talk to their relatives. Now I wanted to show you something here as well, this gas pump. I was noticing that it has sand inside the screen, which means that at one point the water level was this high. And we earlier heard from the governor.
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
He's telling us that the state is trying to make every effort possible to bring relief to the people who need it. Let's take a listen to what he said earlier for CNN.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): The problem is that in the mountains of North Carolina are beautiful. There is a lot of rugged terrain on a sunny, beautiful day, and when landslides have occurred and flooding has occurred. It's almost impossible to traverse, so we're depending a lot on air power helicopters with hoist capacity to get supplies in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And Max, the governor also said that there are 19, at least 19 out of state search and rescue teams right now trying to help people who are caught off or trapped. There are an additional three federal teams that are doing the same thing. And the North Carolina National Guard has rescued about 100 people. The teams combined have rescued hundreds of people, but there are hundreds of thousands of people of customers without power right now. And we heard earlier from the City of Asheville saying that they're going to have two cell phone carriers bring satellite trucks.
 
So at least there are spots in the city where people can use their cell phones to communicate with loved ones to let them know that they're OK. But a very, very difficult situation here in North Carolina, Max. Back to you.
 
FOSTER: We've been talking about how this is historic. We have talked to other witnesses on the ground, saying it's, you know, the storm was one thing. It's obviously the after effects and the flooding that follow, which has been the big challenge, and it's so far inland, isn't it? And that really surprised people.
 
ROMO: That is right, Max. And I was talking to a gentleman who told me that, yes, they have flooded before. There are two main rivers in this town. They remember the floods of 2004 for example. But he was making the observation that they had never seen water come up this way so far.
 
Like I said before, the Swannanoa River, one of the tributaries to the broad French River, crested at 27 feet on Friday. So that gives you an idea of the kind of historic flooding that this community has seen nothing like they have seen before. Somebody who had lived has lived here for 40 years told me that this is completely unprecedented for this town.
 
FOSTER: Yeah. Rafael Romo, thank you so much for bringing us those horrifying images. Well floods and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains have killed at least 192 people in Nepal. As rescue workers reach more remote areas, officials warn the death toll will likely rise.
 
96 people have been injured since Friday, and dozens more are missing. Images show floodwaters sweeping over parts of the capital Kathmandu. Other videos show entire buildings collapsing as the land below gives way. Meanwhile, rescue workers are searching for survivors and are digging them out by hand now, including this two-year-old boy who was saved after two hours of grueling work.
 
Donald Trump expected to be in a storm ravaged Georgia to assess the damage Helene left behind there. The visit comes the day after the former president sparked controversy with comments made during a rally aimed at his opponent. Details just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
FOSTER: Happening later today, Donald Trump will head to Georgia in the wake of Hurricane Helene, the former president will get a firsthand look at the devastation the storm has left behind and hand out much needed supplies as well. His visit comes a day after the Republican presidential candidate ramped up personal attacks on Kamala Harris during a rally in Pennsylvania, questioning her mental stability.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired said, but lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There's something wrong with Kamala.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from Washington with more. So, Alayna, what's the reaction to those comments?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, this is definitely not the strategy that many of Donald Trump's Republican allies that his own team wants him to be taking with. Now just a couple weeks away from the November 5th election. And what's interesting about these remarks is we have heard Donald Trump question President Joe Biden's mental capabilities in the past, but now he's trying to do that with Harris as well.
 
And all of this comes actually after Harris visited the border on Friday. And from my conversations with people close to Trump, that seemed to have struck a nerve. Donald Trump believes that she was fighting on his own turf. And really, all of the rallies and the speeches we heard from Trump this weekend really painted a dark picture of America.
 
Again, Donald Trump often uses dark rhetoric, but he amped up these attacks in a way that we haven't seen in some time now. And so, I think it's very notable. But as for your question about how are people responding? We heard Republicans, allies of Donald Trump, publicly criticize those comments.
 
We heard Lindsey Graham yesterday say that this isn't the right path, that Donald Trump should be prosecuting the case against Harris' policies and on the issues. We heard Tom Emmer, who has been helping vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, behind the scenes prepare for tomorrow's debate.
 
He said this is not the right path. Donald Trump needs to be talking about the issues. But as we've seen with Donald Trump, he has been told this repeatedly from people within his own camp, and he doesn't take that advice. I asked him about this a couple weeks ago, and he told me that he believes that he's entitled to personal attacks.
 
So, I don't think you're going to hear a change in rhetoric anytime soon from Donald Trump, even as people are saying, this is not helping your campaign, it's hurting it.
 
FOSTER: Trump also calling for an hour of violence yesterday when discussing shoplifting. Can you explain that one too?
 
TREENE: It was pretty jarring solution that he tried to offer. We know that Donald Trump, in the past, has really criticized what he argues is a massive problem in the United States with shoplifting. He argued and claimed that progressive policies are putting constraints on police officers. I want you to take a listen to exactly what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: You know, if you had one day like one real rough, nasty day with the drug stores as an example. One rough hour, and I mean a real rough, the word will get out and it will end immediately.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE: Now, again, a pretty jarring solution that he tried to offer, and it seemed like he was almost calling for police brutality in response to some of this. But look, I do want to be clear that CNN, we have reported that shoplifting while, of course, there's a problem, it has not risen meaningfully nationwide in many years.
 
And so, I think it's important to keep that in mind. But again, this is Donald Trump really leaning in to some of that dark rhetoric, talking about an hour of violence, and trying to argue that he will be, when it comes to crime, to the border, he will be someone who will really crack down on all of that across the country, while trying to paint Harris as someone who will let it happen.
 
You hear him often really trying to demean her record when she was the attorney general of California. This all plays into that, and I keep in mind that crime and the border are two of the issues that Donald Trump sees as a priority, and also his team sees as him winning on those issues.
 
So again, you'll hear much of this rhetoric I believe, in coming speeches, whether it be today or later this week and throughout the rest of our time on the trial before the November 5th election, Max.
 <br>[08:30:00]
 
FOSTER: OK, Alayna, thank you so much. Still to come, Israel is ramping up attacks on three Iranian backed militant groups sharply escalating tensions in the Middle East. What does this mean for the region? Details coming up. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Hezbollah's highest-ranking official is promising to choose a new leader as soon as possible, and vows to keep fighting Israel. It comes just days after Israel assassinated the militant group's Former Chief, Hassan Nasrallah. Earlier, Israel's Defense Minister gave the clearer sign yet of a potential ground invasion into Lebanon when he said the elimination of Nasrallah is a very important step, but it's not the final one. 
 
It comes as the Israeli military ramps up attacks on Iranian based targets in the Middle East. The IDF continued to strike Lebanon overnight. Hamas, meanwhile, says its leader in Lebanon and his family were killed in attacks in the southern part of the country. And for the first time since the war broke out nearly a year ago, Israeli airstrikes hit within Beirut's city limits. Israel also expanded its attacks on Iranian backed groups striking
 
 Houthi targets in Yemen, in what the IDF chief called, quote, an action that carries a message. Back in Lebanon, the crisis on the ground is growing. The country's Prime Minister says a million people are displaced as Israeli strikes continue, as Israel escalates the attacks on Iranian backed militant groups in the Middle East. What is this ultimate goal? 
 
Joining me now to discuss all of this is Ambassador Alon Pinkas, the Former Israeli Consul General in New York. Thank you so much for joining us as ever Mr. Pinkas. But I mean, this is moving very, very rapidly, isn't it? How would you describe the Israeli military strategy?
 
ALON PINKAS, FORMER ISRAELI COUNSUL GENERAL, NEW YORK: Well, right now, Max the strategy is to hit Hezbollah. If you've noticed, and I'm sure you have, as our viewers have, the war in Gaza is really good. As for the attack in southwest Yemen on the Hodeidah Port that was a retaliation for a Houthi missile that was fired toward Israel and intercepted. 
 
What we don't know yet, and I doubt we will, because there probably isn't one. Is a strategy, an end game, and a clear, coherent definition of what the goals are. OK, we did what we did in Gaza. We degraded Gaza. We degraded Hamas, fine. We're doing the same. Israel is doing the same to Hezbollah. That's fine, too. That's a result, a direct result of Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah's total, awful miscalculation in joining the war. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
But the question is, what next? Is Israel ready to take these two fronts and convert them into some kind of a regional framework, a counter axis? I don't see sign of that. So, what we're going to see right now is just a continuation of these mutual bombardment.
 
FOSTER: Are ground troops going to go in do you think? Some people suggesting it's just posturing, but the -- you know the tanks are there at the border, as Nic was describing earlier, and the military leaders are very clear that that is the next step. 
 
PINKAS: Well, you know, the military needs to be prepared. So, artillery and armor and infantry and engineering corps, they all need to be ready. They all need to be close by. They all need to exercise or go through whatever plans they have. The plan that everyone is talking about is a limited incursion into Lebanon and establishing a security buffer zone in the south.
 
That I think is nonsensical. A, it does not answer the long-range missiles that Hezbollah still have a formidable capability of launching. B, it takes us back 20 years into that security zone that produced nothing, no advantages, no benefits from anyone involved. So, I hope Israel averts that, that the army is preparing, yeah, they have to.
 
That the military is saying it is ready it has to otherwise, you need to maintain levels of readiness. And if you don't say that, those levels diminish, but I don't see that happening in the next few days for sure.
 
FOSTER: I know you say there isn't -- you know a wide strategy here, necessarily. But I just want to present one idea that's out there. It's very sensitive, but people are talking about it, so I just want to put it to put it to you, and you can tell us what you think of it. But perhaps the strategy is to provoke Iran to fire at Israel so it can fire back harder.
 
PINKAS: Yeah, that's been Mr. Netanyahu's case. I know it's sensitive, but hey, it's true. And Mr. Netanyahu has been flirting with that kind of escalation for the better part of the last year. In fact, Max, I think his dream scenario would be to lure Iran into responding, and then somehow dragging the U.S. into hitting Iran back. 
 
The only problem with this ingenious strategy is that neither the U.S. nor Iran are interested in such an escalation or such a deterioration. So, I very much doubt we will see that transpire. But as a premise, as a policy, let's drag them and hit them. You know, it sounds great on paper on military simulation games, it could be devastating for everyone, and it's not going to produce anything. 
 
FOSTER: And we should remember, shouldn't we, that? You know, Iran isn't one cohesive political group. There's a lot of debate within Iran about whether or not you know how hard to hit back and -- you know how far to hit back? There's a big night there. 
 
PINKAS: Yeah.
 
FOSTER: And as you say, people aren't considering that fundamental idea that -- you know, the U.S. and Iran, don't want to go to war with each other. So, there's going to be some sort of middle ground, presumably, but there has to be a response from Iran?
 
PINKAS: That's absolutely right. If I may add one more -- one more sentence Max. There's also you have to now question the premise that we've been subscribing to, including myself, for a long time, that Iran really has over its proxy. It does not.
 
It did not -- it does not have total control over Hezbollah. It does not have total control over the Houthis in Southwest Yemen, and it does not necessarily have total control over the Shiite militias in Iraq. So, the idea that Iran is this puppet master that operates a web of proxies, or a network, rather of proxies, needs to be revisited.
 
FOSTER: OK. Alon, appreciate your time as ever. Thank you so much for bringing us your insights on --
 
PINKAS: Thank you, Max.
 
FOSTER: -- this escalating situation across the Middle East now. Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed at least 12 people on Monday, according to Palestinian officials. In recent days, Israeli shells hit residential buildings across the territory and a school compound in Northern Gaza. Now, Palestinians in the Enclave feel their plight will be ignored as Israel and the world turn their attention to Lebanon.

PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another week of help in Gaza, a mother and her four children were killed when their home in -- was hit by an Israeli air strike. Their uncle said it happened at 03:00 a.m. they were killed while they slept.
 <br>[08:40:00]
 
Another strike at a school sheltering displaced in Nuseirat Camp killed a couple and their five-year-old child. Israel said it was a precise strike targeting Hamas operatives. A man staying nearby says these are the remains of the missile. They were innocent and displaced, sleeping in this little room. 
 
The next day, a drone strike in -- killed two children and 20-year-old twin men. Their father says they were sitting by the front door looking at their phones. They were born together and killed together he says.
 
Children playing in the street were rushed into hospital. We have asked the IDF what the target of this strike was. One little boy is treated on the hospital floor next to the body of a deceased man. No dignity allowed in life or death for the residents of Gaza. Dozens lost their lives last week, while, thousands of miles away at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
 
World leader after world leader called for the war in Gaza to end. A U.S. led proposal for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel Lebanon border is also intended to jolt a Gaza ceasefire if it happens, but it's a big if. Families of hostages still held in Gaza worry the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah is overshadowing their cause. 
 
Residents of Gaza fear they're being forgotten by a world that has failed to end their suffering. This man says, when the war on Beirut happened, we lost all hope. There's no focus on Gaza. It's barely mentioned. This woman adds, Lebanon is full of our brothers and sisters. We stand in solidarity with them, but at the same time, we do not want the world to forget us. 
 
This man says, I don't think Gaza is forgotten because of the war in Lebanon, because the two are connected hopefully they will be resolved together. Since Hezbollah pagers started exploding in Lebanon two weeks ago, more than 360 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health.
 
No breakdown of militants versus civilians, but hospitals filled with women and children tell its own story. Israel's shift in focus to its northern border feels no different on the ground in Gaza, Paula Hancocks CNN Abu Dhabi.

FOSTER: China's government is facing a major challenge. What to do about disappointing economic trends in key sectors like manufacturing and services. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout has more on whether Beijing can achieve a turnaround in time for years end?
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Shares in China surged again over Beijing's stimulus blitz, even after more weak data from the world's second largest economy. On Friday, there was an explosive stock market rally after China unveiled a major stimulus package, and on Monday, markets soared yet again. 
 
The benchmark SHANGHAI Composite rose about 8 percent the Hong Kong HANG SENG added over 2 percent and SHENZHEN shares surged nearly 11 percent. Mainland markets will be closed tomorrow through October 7th for the Golden Week Holiday, and markets here in Hong Kong will reopen on Wednesday. 
 
Now, data released on Monday shows China's manufacturing activity contracted for the fifth consecutive month in September. But on Sunday, big moves are made to revive the property market. China's Central Bank said it would start cutting existing mortgage rates before the end of October, and three Chinese megacities, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, eased curbs for home buyers. 
 
China has been facing a number of economic challenges, including weak consumer spending, a property slump and rising local government debt. And for months, economists had been asking the government to do more to boost the economy, and Beijing appears to be heeding that call.
 
Last week, China's Politburo, this is its top decision-making body, vowed more stimulus to reach China's annual growth target of around 5 percent and investors and economists cheered the news. In fact, Bruce Pang, he's a Chief Economist China at Jones Lang LaSalle said this quote, a pickup in government spending will probably be sufficient to drive a turnaround in business confidence, market sentiment and economic activities helping China to catch up with potential trend growth. 
 
The Politburo's pledge came days after China's Central Bank unveiled its most aggressive stimulus package since the COVID-19 pandemic. But this won't be a quick fix. It's going to take time for the stimulus measures to filter through, so investors may have to brace for more painful data ahead. Kristie Lu Stout CNN Hong Kong.

STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Kris Kristofferson was a Golden Gloves Boxer, a Rhodes Scholar and an army helicopter pilot, before giving up his military career to pursue his dream of being a country music songwriter.
 
KRISTOFFERSON: It was shocking to most people, because I was a Captain in the Army, and I was on my way to teach English at West Point. When I went to Nashville, I was a janitor for a couple of years and bartender and did a lot of menial jobs.
 
ELAM (voice-over): But Kristofferson persevered, and eventually artists like Johnny Cash and Janice Joplin were taking his songs to the top of the charts. 
 
KRISTOFFERSON: I wouldn't have been doing any of the other things of the performing. If I weren't a writer, they wouldn't have hired me for my voice.
 
ELAM (voice-over): Despite whatever misgivings he had about his singing voice, Kristofferson parlayed his songwriting into a recording career. He became a successful artist in his own right, scoring a string of popular country albums and songs. He captured Hollywood's eye as well.
 
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Convoy and Blade were highlights in a decades' long-acting career, but perhaps his biggest film was the 1976 remake of "A star is born". Kristofferson played a hard drinking, self-destructive rock star opposite Barbra Streisand. He saw a lot of himself in the role.
 
KRISTOFFERSON: I was certainly going through all the motions that that character was doing. 
 
ELAM (voice-over): In the mid-80s, Kristofferson teamed up with Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson to form the country super group, "The Highwaymen". They released a trio of albums and performed together for over a decade. In later years, he received some of music's top honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Looking back, he had no regrets about embarking on his artistic journey all those years ago.
 
KRISTOFFERSON: I think I loved the whole creative process.

ELAM (voice-over): Kristofferson once said he wanted the opening lines of Leonard Cohen's Bird on the Wire to be engraved on his tombstone like a bird on the wire like a drunk in a midnight choir, I have tried, in my way, to be free.
