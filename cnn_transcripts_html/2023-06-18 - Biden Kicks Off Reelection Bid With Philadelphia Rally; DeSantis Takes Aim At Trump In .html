VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. Welcome to CNN THIS MORNING. It is Sunday, June 18th. To all the pops, the dads, the daddies out there, happy Father's Day. I'm Victor Blackwell.
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: The dads, the daddies, the daddy-Os --
 
BLACKWELL: The papis.
 
WALKER: -- the papis. That's what my kids call my husband. They call my husband papi.
 
BLACKWELL: Papi.
 
WAKLER: Happy Father's Day to everyone. Thank you so much for spending a part of your special day with us. A lot to get to this morning and here is what we are watching.
 
President Biden makes his pitch for four more years in the White House in his first campaign rally of the 2024 presidential race. The message he is sending to voters on why he feels he deserves a second term.
 
BLACKWELL: Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing at this hour in what's being called a high-stakes, low expectations visit. The purpose of the trip and the issues that Blinken plans to raise.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): I've seen more tornados than I can count. I've never seen the level of decimation to a town as I have seen today.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALKER: Texas Governor Greg Abbott signs a disaster declaration for communities in Texas devastated by those tornados. The extent of the damage we're seeing this morning and why residents say they didn't hear any tornado signs.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Is it important for Black Americans to get support from other Americans?
 
AMY IWASAKI MASS, INCARCERATED IN AN INTERNMENT CAMP AS A CHILD: Absolutely. Because when we were having trouble, Black people were being good to us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLACKWELL: As California considers reparations for its Black residents, more than 200 multiracial groups are signing on to show support. Why those who benefitted from reparations say it's an important step.
 
President Biden is officially back on the campaign trail. About 2,000 union members were on hand in Philadelphia for his first rally since announcing his reelection bid.
 
WALKER: Now, Biden flipped Pennsylvania in 2020 and he told the crowd that labor's support will be critical for him to win reelection.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If this room didn't show up for work tomorrow or Monday, the whole country would come to a grinding halt.
 
So, tell me, tell me, who matters more in America? Folks, I'm looking forward to this campaign. I want you to know why, because you got a story to tell. We've got a story to tell. We've got a record to run on. And most importantly, we're not only changing this country, we're transforming it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALKER: CNN White House reporter Jasmine Wright joining us now. Jasmine, good morning. Of course, it makes sense that President Biden kicking off his 2024 campaign in Philadelphia as he is reminding voters of his deep ties to this crucial swing state.
 
JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes, Amara. Look, we got a glimpse of what President Biden will look like for this 2024 campaign. Yesterday in a place that is so important to him, we have seen him turn to Philadelphia time and time again over his political career in front of a group that's very important to him, union members. It is a cornerstone of his backing and a group that the White House hopes will propel President Biden to a second term in office.
 
And of course, you see all that enthusiasm right there in the video. At times you could hear them saying four more years, really shouting for the president in a setting that is meant to celebrate him and his early union support. We know that the AFL-CIO said that they back him. And it's the earliest time that they have backed a presidential candidate in their history. So, it's important for President Biden to showcase this coalition building. Now, the thrust of his message though was focused on the economy, arguing that his vision for the economy is one that is currently working. Really trying to battle test that message as a campaign official put it to me and he also tried to show contrast with Republicans, both on the economy and on his legislative wins. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Let me tell you something. If Republicans come after what I've done, when they come back to try to get rid of all these clean energy investments and they try to stop the plan on infrastructure, when they try to do these things, guess what? They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your jobs.
 
They're coming for your future. They're coming for the future we're building for your kids and your grandkids.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WRIGHT: Now, what was clear from this message, what we just heard from President Biden is this speech not only was a celebration but it was also part of a strategy from the White House trying to get more Americans to associate the economic wins that this country has seen from the strong labor market, job growth to President Biden, something that we know from polling is not exactly happening.
 <br>[06:05:12]
 
So, that is going to be the tall task for the White House over the next few months before President Biden starts really campaigning in earnest. Amara, Victor.
 
BLACKWELL: Jasmine Wright for us in Washington, thank you very much. Joining me now Shelby Talcott, a reporter with Semafor. Thanks for being with us.
 
Let's start with the president's decision to go again to Pennsylvania and not just to Pennsylvania, Philadelphia specifically, but to this audience to launch his first rally of the election cycle. What's the message?
 
SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, SEMAFOR: Yes, it's aimed at working class voters. Obviously, union workers were hugely important in his last campaign. And I think it's notable because it hasn't necessarily been smooth sailing with union workers since then. He has gotten into some tips with a few of the groups. He did have one of the major groups AFL-CIO backed him. But other union groups have held off.
 
And so, by going to Pennsylvania and having this union worker focus he is kind of sending the message that, hey, I'm going to do this again, this is what worked last time, trust me, look at these economic wins, as Jasmine said, we're going to do it for four more years.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. There were some union workers who were disappointed with the president's decision as related to averting a rail strike, we all remember. But the president said he had to do that to keep the economy on the rails.
 
Let's turn to the fundraising element of this. Reported short break of direct fundraising events for the president because of the negotiations over the debt ceiling. He is returning now. What is the degree of concern if there is a legitimate, a substantial amount of the president's infrastructure as it relates to fundraising, finance chairs and the rest?
 
TALCOTT: There is concern for sure. A bunch of his allies have been very concerned that he had to kind of take this pause because of the debt limit freeze. And now we are seeing he has 20 fundraisers planned for the end of the month which is, obviously, coming up soon, it's June 18th at this point.
 
And so, his campaign is still growing. It's still a bare bones operation, especially compared to some of these Republican candidates. And so, the concern is there that he is not raising enough money and it's instead going to these kinds of outside groups like the DNC.
 
BLACKWELL: The DNC and the campaign have an agreement as it relates to fundraising as well. But does anyone believe that you are speaking with that this will create a significant challenge for his ability to match the eventual Republican nominee? I mean, he is the sitting president. He doesn't have a serious primary challenger.
 
TALCOTT: Yes, I think -- and I think that's the big point is, A, it's a little bit too early. And, B, the Republican race is so vastly different than the Democratic one. Obviously, the president is the only one in the race compared to -- I mean, we have Marianne Williamson. We have -- we have a few others. But the only serious contender there is not going to be debates.
 
And so, I think the concern there is a little bit less just because of that factor. But remember when we get to a general he is still going to be up against potentially somebody who has raised a lot of money.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. Let's turn to the Republican side and the primary there. Governor Ron DeSantis in Nevada for a Basque Fry which essentially if you don't know anything about this event it's focused on stewed and fried lamb testicles. So, there you go. Sunday morning breakfast. Insert all puns here.
 
So, at the event, DeSantis focused on the president, on the Biden administration record. However, around the event his people, the super PAC, they focused on the primary fight. What do you make of what we are seeing of the approach here, especially in a state that during the primaries Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020?
 
TALCOTT: Yes, I think this has been kind of a theme with the DeSantis campaign so far, is you'll notice when DeSantis goes out and speaks to voters during his stump speeches it's very much focused on hitting Joe Biden, hitting the Democrats. We have even seen that from other campaigns.
 
But then when he talks to the press or when his outside groups, the PAC, his supporters are speaking, it's more directly going after Donald Trump. And the reason for that is pretty simple. It's -- is he has to walk this fine line between winning over Republican voters who still like Donald Trump and even if they are not necessarily completely on the fence for Trump, they don't want to vote for someone who is directly attacking him.
 <br>[06:10:01]
 
BLACKWELL: All right. Shelby Talcott from Semafor, thanks so much. Now, be sure to tune in to "STATE OF THE UNION" later this morning. Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie will be among the guests joining Jake Tapper. That's at 9:00 a.m. eastern right here on CNN.
 
WALKER: President Biden made a stop on the way to his rally in Pennsylvania to get a firsthand look at the damage to Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. Part of that interstate collapsed last week when a tanker truck carrying gasoline crashed and exploded into flames underneath it. During his aerial tour, Biden viewed the damage and the construction crews already working to rebuild the collapsed section. Now, after the tour he met with the state's governor who gave an update on just how quickly it will be before they open that highway again to drivers. CNN's Polo Sandoval has more.
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Amara and Victor, I remember some six years ago I was in Atlanta covering the repairs of a portion of Interstate 85. That project taking about 43, 44 days to complete. So, it seems now that this I-95 project seems to be moving right along, that's according to Pennsylvania's governor who spoke alongside President Biden at a campaign event just yesterday.
 
Governor Josh Shapiro saying that that section of I-95 is expected to reopen in the next two weeks. The governor also praising efforts from union workers, some of them present at that Biden campaign event yesterday. Listen in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): There is something special happening in our community. People coming together. Now, don't get me wrong. I know that motorists are hurting and business owners are hurting, but right now this community is coming together and lifting up those workers and making sure that they know we are supporting them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANDOVAL: Yes, hard to believe it was just last weekend that a tanker truck was involved in a deadly accident that led to this incredible level of damage. The demolition portion of that project that was completed on Thursday. The state disaster declaration is what has really allowed officials to dip into not only some federal funds but to also try to go around some of that typical red tape when it comes to these kinds of big projects. So, that has allowed for them to be able to expedite the repairs.
 
They are certainly working with a very high level of urgency given the usage of this stretch of interstate. On average, it is one of the busiest highways in the area
 
 carrying some -- 160,000 vehicles a day to Philadelphia. Amara, Victor.
 
WALKER: All right. Polo, thank you very much. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in China this morning for meetings meant to tamp down tensions between the U.S. and China. We are live in Beijing with a look at what both sides hope to achieve.
 
BLACKWELL: Texas Governor Greg Abbott says he has never seen devastation like what we're seeing in the town of Perryton. Recovery efforts happening now and why officials say the tornado sirens meant to warn people there failed.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:17:05]
 
WALKER: The stakes are high, but expectations are low as Secretary of State Antony Blinken kicks off talks in Beijing. Now, Blinken is the first secretary of state to travel to China in five years and his visit comes after months of tensions between Washington and Beijing. The State Department says the main goal is to reopen lines of communication.
 
BLACKWELL: CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood is traveling with Secretary Blinken and she is joining us live from Beijing. So, officials, Kylie, are downplaying expectations for the visit. With the expectation so low, what do they hope to accomplish?
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, listen, what U.S. officials are saying is that we shouldn't expect deliverables out of these incredibly high-stakes two days of meeting that the secretary of state has here in Beijing, but they are calling this a very critical meeting for the secretary and here's why.
 
Their primary goal here in Beijing is to reestablish communication between the United States and China. Regular channels of communication, which, frankly, just have not been up and running particularly when it comes to military-to-military conversations. And the backdrop for that is just look at what's happened in recent days. There have been two close calls, military incidents in the South China Sea both in the sea and in the air between the U.S. and China which has caused some great tension between the two countries. And then when the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, was recently at the same place in Singapore with his Chinese counterpart, China denied him a meeting.
 
So, first and foremost. the Biden administration looking to reestablish regular channels of communication. They are also looking to express U.S. concerns on a number of fronts when it comes to global issues, the war in Ukraine, regional issues, of course, Taiwan, and bilateral issues.
 
One of the issues that a senior administration official said would be critical in these conversations was addressing the fentanyl issue. The precursor chemicals coming to the United States forming fentanyl, that opioid crisis that is a tremendous killer of Americans are coming from China. The secretary is going to address that with his Chinese counterpart.
 
He will also address the three Americans who are wrongfully detained in China. And then what he will try and do is touch on areas where the U.S. and China can work together. Climate, global economic stability, those are two that he has laid out ahead of this visit.
 
And when it comes to the economic portion of this, China is facing a global -- excuse me, a local economic slowdown after that post-COVID recovery where we saw some economic growth in the country that has slowed down. And just last month there was the highest rate of urban youth unemployment that China has ever seen, just above 20 percent. So, they are clearly wanting to engage with the U.S. when it comes to economic issues.
 <br>[06:20:00]
 
The two countries are simply intermingled with one another, interchanged with one another very closely when it comes to the economy. But when it comes to China's reception of the secretary, just ahead of the secretary's visit here, Chinese officials were warning Blinken not to interfere in the internal domestic situation here in Beijing, to show respect while he is here in Beijing. So, we will have to see what that reception looks like over the course of the next two days.
 
WALKER: Perhaps it will get a bit tricky for Secretary Blinken. Kylie Atwood, appreciate you. Thanks so much.
 
Let's get some insight now from CNN global affairs analyst Kimberly Dozier. She is a senior managing editor of the "Military Times." Kimberly, great to see you this morning. Good morning to you.
 
So, we keep hearing the main objective is, you know, to reopen these lines of communications. Yes, its high-stakes but low expectations. Does it boil down to just trying to find a way so that these tensions don't spiral into conflict?
 
KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, Blinken's trip has basically two tracks. You have got the immediate practical and then the long-term and strategic. When it comes to the immediate and practical, as Kylie was saying, those recent near-misses between a U.S. and Chinese warship when the Chinese warship made a close encounter, just drove straight in front of the U.S. warship, kind of playing chicken and forcing the U.S. warship to slow down. And a similar thing happened between a Chinese jet and U.S. spy plane in recent weeks.
 
There is at this point in time no hotline between the U.S. military and the Chinese military. The Chinese stopped taking our calls back when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. So, in the immediate moments the Pentagon wants that line back open.
 
The concern is that one of these minor incidents could lead to the kind of -- could spark the kind of conflict that could lead to some all-out armed confrontation. Now, I know that sounds extreme, but things can snowball from a direct confrontation.
 
When it comes to the wider strategic side of the relationship, basically, Blinken wants to start getting -- bring down the temperature, bring China away from this forming relationship with Russia, Iran, this kind of block of countries that it feels like China is forming within the U.N., vying for African and Latin American countries to side with them as opposed to United States and the West. We see that with things like Ukraine. So, that's an even harder task for Blinken but, you know, you have got to get there and have a conversation in person and the first secretary of state visit in five years of the U.S. to Beijing is an opportunity for that.
 
WALKER: You know, when you just look at the rhetoric or listen to the rhetoric and see the actions between the U.S. and Beijing, you would think they were foes and you would be surprised that they are even trying to talk at this point.
 
And when you look back just the last few months, not just these near- misses recently, you know, in the seas and over the skies but, you know, also these troop movements by the U.S. to the Philippines and to south Japan, and then of course you have these military -- these major military drills that China has been carrying out with an eye on Taiwan, can you just give us some context here, Kimberly, on just how bad things really are between the U.S. and China? I mean, it's the worst it's been since when?
 
DOZIER: Well, the reason it feels like it's getting worse and worse, maybe the last time we saw something like this was back in the late '90s when the U.S. brought an aircraft carrier to the region and China had to back off. But you have China announcing that, you know, by 2035 it wants to rival the U.S. military. By 2049 it wants to be a global superpower.
 
And it is starting to sort of expand its territory in a way it hasn't done before. It started trying to implement its territorial sort of ownership of the area it calls the nine-dash line. This is an area off the coast of China that the U.S. says and according to international law is international waters. But China, by doing ever aggressive patrols and harassing Philippine ships, Japanese ships, merchant ships in that area, they are sending the message that, yes, international law may say one thing about this area, but through our actions we are increasing our ownership and daring you to push back.
 <br>[06:25:07]
 
So, you have that -- against that backdrop, the U.S. is increasing its own what the U.S. military calls presence patrols. And you have this increasing friction that tracks along the lines of the Chinese military's future goals and the U.S. can see this and say, no, we are not going to let this happen. So, the idea of having the diplomats talk is to bring that temperature back down and to stop what feels like an inevitable confrontation.
 
WALKER: Let's see if Xi Jinping makes time to meet with Secretary Blinken as well. Kim Dozier, appreciate your time. Thank you. BLACKWELL: Still ahead, a massive effort to keep illegal drugs off the market in the U.S. The coast guard offloads more than seven tons of seized cocaine. Details about where it came from next.
 <br>[06:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BLACKWELL: Coming up on 30 minutes past the hour, let's look at some other headlines this morning. At least 17 people have been injured in Baltimore after a city bus collided with two vehicles and then a building early Saturday. Fire department officials say the driver and all 16 passengers were taken to the hospital. Nobody's facing life- threatening injuries though.
 
Police say the MTA bus first hit a Lexus, then a Nissan, finally coming to a stop after crashing into the side of a building. The cause of the crash is still being investigated. 
 
WALKER: A major haul for the U.S. Coast Guard. Officials say they seized more than 14,000 pounds of cocaine from nine separate cases in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The street value of the drugs roughly $186 million. They also arrested 12 suspected smugglers. Crews offloaded the drugs in Miami Friday. 
 
According to a U.N. report, 2000 tons of cocaine had been seized in the past two years. 
 
BLACKWELL: Some scary moments for people on this ferry in the Philippines early this morning. Look at this. All 120 people on the boat, though they were rescued after it caught fire while traveling between two islands there. The Philippine Coast Guard says the fire has been put out but rescue ships will stay on scene as a precaution. Officials say no one was injured and they are all still investigating what started that fire. 
 
A small town in Texas is banding together after destructive and deadly EF3 tornado ripped through their town. And this morning help is coming from across the state and from neighboring states. 
 
WALKER: The cleanup process will be extensive. Some 200 homes were damaged by the twister. It's something the state's governor says he has never seen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): I've seen more tornadoes than I can count. I've never seen the level of decimation to a town as I've seen today. 
 
NIM KIDD, CHIEF, TEXAS DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: I was humbled by the citizens of this town. The families that had just lost everything, they were not setting on the curb waiting for somebody to help them. They were right in the middle of cleanup within hours after the storm passed. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) WALKER: But this morning, the question on many residents' minds is why didn't they hear the city's tornado sirens warning them to take cover? CNN's Isabel Rosales explains. 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Amber, Victor, good morning to you. This is something I heard from folks all around town that they never heard a siren. Now we know from the city manager that's because the system failed. There was no electricity and therefore that audible siren never went out. Those who did know they were in danger is because they had application on their phone, weather apps to let them know a tornado was possibly coming their way. 
 
Let me show you what's happening here on the ground. Really it is clean-up mode everywhere you look in downtown Perryton. You see heavy machinery like this, bulldozers knocking over homes, businesses, 200 of them, the fire chief says, 200 homes have been damaged. They're need to clean this out before they can even begin to rebuild this community. 
 
Of course, this tornado is on the ground going 11 minutes going across a length of over six miles. I spoke with 11-year-old Alexa Lugo who took cover inside of a mobile home as the tornado was going overhead. She prayed for the safety of her family. She was fine. Her family was fine. Their home was totaled. But at a nearby mobile home, 11-year-old Matthew Ramirez was not.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEXA LUGO, TORNADO SURVIVOR: He's very funny. He was very funny. We would always joke around and he would always be playing with his friends, playing soccer. He loves soccer. Yes. And I just remember him -- like we'd be in class -- like, sometimes he would come in class and he would just be laughing for no reason. And he would make his friends laugh. I mean, it was funny. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: And Ramirez here is the youngest victim of this tornado. The death toll standing at three. We know from the Ochiltree General Hospital that they treated 160 people for tornado-related injuries. And a hospital that only had 25 beds, so really a remarkable effort here by medical staff. Victor, Amara? 
 
WALKER: Isabel Rosales, thank you.
 
Just ahead, the return of Pope Francis. This morning, the pontiff led the Angelus Prayer at the Vatican just days after being discharged from the hospital. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:35:00]
 
WALKER: Happening right now, Pope Francis is leading the weekly Angelus Prayer at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It is the first time he's held a public prayer since he was discharged from the hospital Friday. 
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, the Pope had abdominal surgery early this month. He's 86 years old. The Vatican says he's well enough to keep his appointments ahead of a busy summer calendar. CNN's Barbie Nadeau is with us now. So, how are his spirits this morning?
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, he was in good form this morning. He looked well. He had color in his face. He had a strong voice. He gave the -- his Angelus Prayer. And he thanked everyone who had gathered in the Square below his window for sustaining him in prayer and for the well wishes when he was hospitalized. 
 
He also offered his pain and prayers for the victims of a terrible migrant shipwreck that happened here off the coast of Greece a couple of days ago, and for those people who have lost his life in the attack in Uganda. So, he's keeping up on world news as we always expected, this pope. And he sounded strong.
 
You know, he did cancel his upcoming Wednesday audience. He won't be in the square for that. That's the only thing he's canceled so far. He's leading -- meeting the leaders of Cuba and Brazil during private audiences this week. So, he's keeping his calendar. 
 
He's got a busy, busy, busy summer ahead, August. He's got two big trips, one to Portugal and one to Mongolia. And so, his doctors want to just keep him, you know, resting, getting stronger. And you know, they -- his doctor gave an interview in which he said he's much stronger now than before the surgery, three hour procedure he had on June 7th. Amara, Victor? 
 <br>[06:40:33]
 
WALKER: So, Barbie, speaking of that upcoming busy summer schedule and of course those travels, has the Vatican said anything about whether they think or believe that the pope will be able to keep his engagements? 
 
NADEAU: Well, they haven't taken anything off the calendar yet. But it's worth noting that he never gives the Wednesday audiences in July. That's always a month of rest. He's usually very busy in August. This is not the first time we've seen him take apostolic journeys and do things in the month of August. 
 
And it works out pretty well for him to take this month off. It is brutally hot in Rome. And so, he's going to stay in the air conditioned comfort, I'm sure, of his digs in the Vatican City. But his doctors are keeping a close eye on him. They've got very, very good facilities there to watch him make sure he's, you know, getting stronger and stronger. 
 
BLACKWELL: All right, looking better and apparently feeling better. Barbie Nadeau, thank you very much. 
 
Still to come, there's a growing wave of multiracial support for Black American reparations. CNN spoke with the Japanese-American woman who received reparations after being forced into an internment camp as a child during World War II. We'll look at her story next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BLACKWELL: Support for reparations for Black Americans seems to be increasing specifically from other multiracial groups, including Jewish and Japanese organizations. CNN takes a closer look at this, speaking with Japanese-Americans who faced exclusion and internment on the basis of race eight decades ago. 
 
CNN Stephanie Elam with more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you so much. Thanks for your comments. 
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Their pain is real. 
 
JONATHAN BURGESS, TESTIFIED BEFORE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE: Those are the harms that happened to my ancestors that we don't talk about. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): Their vision clear. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's ensure recraft legislation that historically preserves our land, our history. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): Black Californians being heard in front of the state's reparations task force. Their passion understood by Amy Iwasaki-Mass. 
 
AMY IWASAKI MASS, INCARCERATED IN AN INTERNMENT CAMP AS A CHILD: The government we trusted, the country that we loved -- 
 
The nation to which we had pledged loyalty had betrayed us, had turned against us. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): She too bared her soul to a government body considering reparations. 
 
MASS: It was a pretty scary time. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): Mass was a Los Angeles first-greater when she and her family and more than a hundred thousand other Japanese-Americans were rounded up by the federal government and sent to internment camps. The United States' response during World War II after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
 
MASS: They didn't have their guns out protecting us from the outside. They had the guns pointing at us. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): By the time her family left the Wyoming camp three years later -- 
 
MASS: I knew that the United States didn't love us. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): Her family returned to Los Angeles but the experience took its toll. MASS: Our scars are deep and permanent. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): More than four decades later, Japanese-Americans were granted $20,000 and a formal apology. 
 
MASS: If we didn't get reparations, if we felt we're still being put down by the government, I think that for me it would be hard to fight.
 
ELAM (voiceover): Mass is part of a growing wave of multiracial support for Black-American reparations. Many Jewish and Japanese organizations among them. 
 
DON TAMAKI, MEMBER, CALIFORNIA REPARATIONS TASK FORCE: I think there's a growing realization that in 1865 slavery ended, but that the bias simply morphed into other forms that not only put a target on the backs of African-Americans, but also other people of color. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): Don Tamaki is one of nine members on California's reparations task force, the first of its kind in any state. His parents, natives of the San Francisco Bay area, were also in an internment camp. He even has a copy of the check his mother received from the federal government. 
 
TAMAKI: There is no equivalence, really between four years in a concentration camp and 400 years of systematic exclusion and discrimination. But I think Japanese-Americans as a group do understand what it's like to be excluded on the basis of race. And I think there is a sense that African-Americans opened the door and everybody else walked through it. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): The task force is suggesting more than 100 proposals for California to address issues have historically set the Black community back, including health harms, mass incarceration and over- policing, and housing discrimination. 
 
TIMOTHY ALAN SIMON, CHAIR, AFRICAN AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: So, to me, it's tragic that we're seeing this declining population. 
 
ELAM (voiceover): Native San Franciscan Timothy Alan Simon says he's seen his Black neighbors move out of his bay view community. In fact, citywide in 1970, 13 percent of the population identified as Black. Now, that number stands at less than six percent. 
 
SIMON: San Francisco has lost the brilliance to a large extent, the cultural value, the economic contribution and innovation, all that's come out of the African-American community.
 
ELAM (voiceover): Simon says educating the public about that loss is key and allies like Amy Iwasaki Mass are helping to shine light on the pain by exposing their own. 
 
ELAM: Is it important for Black-Americans to get support from other Americans?
 <br>[06:50:00] MASS: Absolutely, because when we were having trouble, Black people were being good to us. It's not the race, it's just as a human being --

Still ahead, the world's top golfers are looking for a Hollywood ending at the U.S. Open. We're going to take a look at who's in the hunt to take home the third major of the season. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALKER: All right, so the final round of the U.S. Open tees off this afternoon in Los Angeles. And after a wild finish yesterday, it's still wide open. 
 
BLACKWELL: Coy Wire is here now. So, there are plenty of major winners in contention. None of them are first place though. 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: None of them first place, but there will be at some point. Later today, there's a lot of great storylines heading into this. Los Angeles country club finally starting to play like a U.S. Open after some records start to the tournament. 
 
Shot of the day, you have to check this out. From last year's runner up in world number one, Scottie Scheffler. He has a finance degree from the University of Texas. He's six back of the lead on the 17th, but then from 197 yards out, money. Scheffler getting the eagle. And he followed that up with a birdie on 18. And all of a sudden, the 2021 Masters Champ is just three back headed into today's final round.
 
There is a tie for the lead currently. Southern California kid, Ricky Fowler, seeking his first-ever major title. He set the two-day scoring record. And then on the 13th yesterday, he sank a 69 foot putt for birdie, putting him at 11 under. But he did bogey the 18th, finishing at 10 under, and even far on the day. 
 
And that left the door open for 29-year-old Wyndham Clark, seeking his first major as well. The club spin right here on 18. You know it's a good shot when you do that. His motto is play big. His words from his late mom, Lisa, who passed from breast cancer 10 years ago. She said play for something bigger than yourself to inspire someone who's watching. We've putt there for birdie on the 18, taking some momentum in today's final round. Six career major appearances for Wyndham. He's never finished better than 75th. That's about to change. 
 
Keep an eye on him and on Rory McIlroy, just one shot back as he tries to snag his first major in almost a decade.

RORY MCILROY, FOUR-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: It's been such a long time since I've done it. I'm going out there to try to execute a game plan. And I feel like over the last three days, I've executed that game plan really, really well. I just need to do that for one more day. 
 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, 2021 MASTERS CHAMPION: You're nervous whether or not you're leading or chasing. I want to win the golf tournament. It doesn't matter what tournament it is, I'm showing up and I want to play good. And I want to -- I want to win.
 
RICKIE FOWLER, SEEKING FOR FIRST CAREER MAJOR WIN: I would say this week, this is the best I've felt all year, and definitely in a long time. I'm not scared to fail. I've dealt with that. So, we're just going to go have fun, continue to try and execute, leave it all out there, and see where we stand on 18.

WIRE: We'll see how it plays out today. Now, a special moment after the Phoenix Mercury's game in Washington, D.C. this weekend, WNBA star Brittany Griner meeting with national security officials who helped secure her release from a Russian prison last December. U.S. State Department and National Security Council members also meeting with other families of wrongfully detained Americans. 
 
Look out, the iconic Las Vegas strip shutting down for the Stanley Cup champs. Vegas Golden Knights and about 200,000 of their closest friends. Vegas winning in just their sixth season. That's faster than any NHL expansion team ever. Look at William Karlsson took a fall there. Championship play in Vegas, well, that played out exactly how you think it might.

WILLIAM KARLSSON, CENTER, VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS: And I know you have been here day (BLEEP) one. 
 
MARK STONE, CAPTAIN, VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS: This is an incredible day for me, my teammates. I don't know, I'm trying not to tear up here, sorry.

WIRE: Captain Mark Stone finding some strength there from the crowd and the chants and maybe some of the beer that was flowing. I heard that they were drinking Radlers. 
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. 
 
WIRE: They were inspired by yesterday's show. 
 
BLACKWELL: It won't be a surprise. It goes down smooth. 
 
WALKER: Good one, Coy. Good one. 
 
BLACKWELL: It was only two tall boys in one hand in that side.
 
WIRE: I'm going to try that.
 
WALKER: We'll have to bring you on, Coy. 
 
WIRE: I would enjoy that. 
 
WALKER: Thanks, Coy. 
 
BLACKWELL: Research on psychedelics is making a comeback, especially about psilocybin, which you may know comes from the so-called magic mushroom. While it's illegal on the federal level, this year, Oregon became the first state to legalize psychedelic mushrooms for therapeutic use. 
 
WALKER: In other countries where psychedelic mushrooms are legal, some people are turning to them for wellness retreats. CNN Correspondent David Culver takes us on a mind-altering journey in the next episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER."
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So many mental health issues are based on a kind of rigidity, of stuckness. The psilocybin experience helps kind of break that up. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That doesn't mean it could treat everything in psychiatry. But I think it is realistic to think that this could be a breakthrough in mental health care. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It sounds promising, but by no means a cure-all. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Psychedelics may not be entirely safe for people who have a personal or family history of psychosis. Patients with bipolar disorder may be at great risk in taking psychedelics drugs and having another manic episode. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The risks come in more psychologically because without support in some cases it could be destabilizing.

WALKER: Be sure to tune in to an all-new episode of the "WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER," one whole story, one whole hour airs tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific only on CNN.
