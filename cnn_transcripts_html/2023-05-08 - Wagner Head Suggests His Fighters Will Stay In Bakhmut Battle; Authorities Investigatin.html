PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Hello. And a warm welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world, I'm Paula Newton. A head right here on CNN Newsroom, backtracking on Bakhmut, the leader of Russia's notorious Wagner mercenary group reverses course, signaling that his troops will now stay in the embattled city despite his earlier threats. Anguish in Allen, Texas, as the community reels from Saturday's deadly mass shooting, we're learning new details about the gunmen behind that attack. And mending ties, Japan's prime minister making a historic visit to South Korea as the two nations look to overcome historic differences and unite in the face of growing threats from neighbors.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Paula Newton.
 
NEWTON: And we're following developments in Ukraine this hour, where the mayor of Kyiv says explosions have hit two districts in the capital, causing several injuries. And to the south, we're now learning that Russia has fired air launched long range missiles near the port city of Odesa. A food company warehouse and recreational area were affected, but there are no reports of casualties. Now, all of this comes as Ukraine accuses Russian forces of trying to exhaust the country's air defense system. Ukraine's military says Russia has been using a variety of missiles and air launched weapons against several regions in the past day.
 
It says the regions of Mykolaiv and Kherson in the south and Kharkiv in the north all came under fire. Meantime, Russian appointed authorities in Crimea say their air defense forces helped fend off at least three Ukrainian drone attacks in the port city of Sevastopol. And a source now says the U.S. has high confidence in Ukraine's claim that it used an American made Patriot air defense system to intercept a Russian hypersonic missile last week. Now, meantime, to the front lines in the east, top commanders say Russian forces are increasing their attacks on Bakhmut as the Ukrainian military remains determined to keep Russia from capturing the city by Tuesday, when Moscow holds its World War II Victory Day parade. Now, Ukraine says Russia is doing everything possible to take Bakhmut, including sending in more forces. And those forces include Wagner fighters.
 
Just days ago, the head of the Russian mercenary group had threatened to pull his men out of the fight because of a lack of ammunition. He now claims his fighters are advancing in Bakhmut as they wait for more supplies. CNN's Sam Kiley has our update now from Kyiv.
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Fighting continues to be bloody and merciless in the east of the country, in particular around the city of Bakhmut, where the Ukrainians have suggested that it's possible that the Wagner group or elements supporting the Wagner group have even been using incendiary devices in that battle. This coming as the leader of the mercenary organization has backtracked on his threat to leave the city and hand over to Chechen fighters. This is very much part of an ongoing soap opera, effectively led by Mr. Prigozhin, who has been tweeting and making public statements since effectively the beginning of this war, highly critical of the Kremlin and particularly the Russian Ministry of Defense.
 
He now says that he is getting the ammunition that he needs, so he won't be pulling his troops out for the foreseeable future. But all eyes really are on where and when or even if the Ukrainians are going to be launching a summer offensive. There have been mass troop movements. There is a lot of talk from the Ukrainians about an offensive, but no real signs yet on the ground that anything is especially imminent.
 
Sam Kiley, CNN in Kyiv.
 
NEWTON: Joining me now from Washington, retired U.S. air force colonel and CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton. Good to have you weigh in on these issues. We've had quite a few days, though, Wagner group leader, he made those dramatic threats to pull out of Bakhmut. Turned out it was quite a performance, right? It looks like his troops are staying put. Now, does this incident give you any insight into what's going on with either the Wagner group or the Russian military?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Paula, I think it's kind of the battle of the tantrums, if you will. And in this particular case, Prigozhin's tantrum seems to have won the day for him. In other words, he gets to get weapons and ammunition, gets a resupply line to, you know, his troops in Bakhmut that didn't appear to have that good of a resupply line, and he gets to stay in that horrible meat grinder. So in some ways, you know, it might, you know, be considered a victory for Prigozhin, but in other ways it's a pure victory because, you know, staying in that meat grinder doesn't do anybody any favors, and at least of all him.
 <br>[01:05:19] NEWTON: Yes, but there seemed -- when I say that it's a performance, I'm, you know, not trying to be trite. It seemed that it was a message to someone and yet if you think all he wanted from that was ammunition, well, that would be pretty naive to think that. It was clearly some kind of propaganda purpose.
 
LEIGHTON: Absolutely. Well, there is propaganda and there's a power struggle going on, Paula. And what this basically means to me is that Prigozhin let it be known that he has a military element that could be withdrawn and could potentially put at risk Russia's front line. And if that front line had collapsed, that would have been a calamity for the Russian forces. So what Prigozhin is doing is he's flexing his muscles in a way. He is in a position where he can, in essence, complain and make sure that he gets what he wants in this particular case, but he is basically vying for as much power as he can possibly get.
 
NEWTON: Right. And that gives us -- turns our attention now to Ukraine's counter offensive. It could start as early as this week. Do you think expectations are too high at this point, especially if what Ukraine is looking for is a decisive blow to the Russian military in this war?
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, if you're going to mount a decisive blow in an operation like this or in a conflict like this, there's got to be an element of surprise here. And, you know, right now it seems to me at least, that we have telegraphed way too much, the Ukrainians have telegraphed way too much, the west has telegraphed way too much that this offensive is going to happen. And the only thing that's missing are the specific details as to time and place. But we believe it's going to happen this week. We believe it's going to happen probably in the south. And we believe it's going to affect the approaches to Crimea.
 
So that is, you know, a major area that shouldn't be a big surprise to the Russians. But if the Ukrainians have learned mobility warfare, if they've learned combined arms operations, putting all the elements of the military force together in a coordinated fashion, then they could still achieve some successes, but they won't be as dramatic as they would have been had there been the element of surprise.
 
NEWTON: Yes, it's such a good point, right? We've been talking about this for months, it seems now. And I have to ask you strategically, the U.S., the allies, have they given Ukraine enough capability at this point and has it arrived in time?
 
LEIGHTON: Well, it's mixed. You know, the verdict on that is definitely mixed. I think that some of the capabilities such as the Patriot missile system, which reportedly has shot down a Kinzhal hypersonic missile. That's a major plus for the Ukrainians. However, there are only going to be two batteries, two Patriot batteries in Ukraine. They will need far more than that in order to mount an effective air defense and missile defense for their country.
 
The other thing that, of course, is missing is required quantity of tanks and, of course, aircraft. The Ukrainians want the F-16. They're not getting the F-16 until after all of this is done, if at all. And that, of course, will provide them, you know, with a significant lack of capability at this particular point. And that could have a significant impact on their ability to perform.
 
NEWTON: Yes, and it'll be interesting to see what the blowback is from Ukraine if and when that happens. Again, some pivotal months ahead for sure, as the weather warms up in Ukraine. Retired U.S. Air Force colonel Cedric Leighton, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
 
LEIGHTON: Thank you Paula.
 
NEWTON: Now, the pro Kremlin military blogger who was injured when his car exploded Saturday says he wasn't in his usual seat. Zakhar Prilepin says he was driving the car and his driver was in the passenger seat when the explosion occurred underneath that seat, the driver was killed. Prilepin fractured both his legs. Now, he also says he was told there were two bombs in the car, but the bomber ran off after the first explosion and never detonated the second bomb. Russia has blamed Ukraine and Western nations, but has not presented any proof.
 
Now, we will have more coverage of the war on Ukraine later this hour, including a look at why Vladimir Putin might be sending tanks old enough to be in a museum to his troops on the front line.
 
Now, we are following developments on two deadly tragedies in the U.S. state of Texas. One is in the border town of Brownsville, where a car has barreled into a crowd near a shelter housing migrants. At least eight people now, including several of the migrants, were killed. Meantime, in the city of Allen, authorities are investigating the motive of a shooter who killed eight people at a mall. Source says the gunman may have posted online content related to white supremacy.
 <br>[01:10:11]
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Allen, Texas with more on the shooting investigation.
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The parking lot of the outlet mall here in Allen, Texas, where a gunman killed eight people Saturday afternoon, is still cordoned off. Hundreds of cars still in the parking lot as investigators continue to work through the scene. We have learned from various witnesses who were there at the time of the shooting that the gunman, from the moment he started firing into the moment where he was shot and killed by an Allen police officer, that the gunman had moved several hundred yards around a building inside that parking lot area.
 
Several witnesses described the gunman moving deliberately and shooting at victims as he was continuing to move through the parking lot. We have now identified, according to a senior law enforcement source, the suspect as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia. He lives in Dallas. We were in the neighborhood where his parents lived and were told that up until several months ago he was living there. We tried to speak with Garcia's family, but they refused to answer the door when we knocked on it. But we did speak with about a half dozen neighbors who described Garcia as someone who kept to himself.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I never really saw anything that seemed a little suspicious or out of, you know, out of whack with a gunman. He would get in, he would park his car and then just walk in like anybody else, so nothing, you know, nothing in a red flag. I think he was a real loner. A lot of times he would walk up and down the block, you know, and always with those Converse, you know. He be liked those I guess those were his favorite brand with those Converse. So I think he would just -- he's like to walk up and down the block with his little hoodie on and, you know, just didn't really say anything.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAVANDERA: A senior law enforcement official also says that they have discovered that Mauricio Garcia has connections to right wing extremism. On his body they found an insignia with the letters that say RWDS, which stands for Right Wing Death Squad. That senior law enforcement official also says that there has been a long list of social media posts with white supremacist and right wing extremism themes as well. Exactly how all of that plays into the motivation for carrying out this attack here at this outlet mall in Allen, that part is not exactly clear, but that is some of the initial details that we are hearing from investigators.
 
This as we have now gone more than 24 hours since this shooting happened that officials and law enforcement officers have not briefed reporters on the latest on this investigation.
 
Ed Lavendera, CNN, Allen, Texas. 
 
NEWTON: Now, U.S. president Joe Biden has ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff through Thursday for the, quote, senseless acts of violence in Texas. State Governor Greg Abbott says he will visit the scene of the shooting to support the community as they try to heal speaking to Fox News, the governor called for renewed talks about violence in the country.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): There are questions that are lingering that the families want answers to, and that is, why did this happen? Why did the gunman do this? How did this happen? And I know that those families need answer as quickly as possible. It truly seems today that America is more divided than we've been in decades. And we got to find a way in this country where we can once again reunite Americans as Americans and come together as one big family. And in that regard, find ways to reduce violence in our country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, meantime, a man who witnessed the horror of those critical moments after the gunman opened fire spoke to CNN about it. And we have to warn you, some of the details are disturbing. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEVEN SPAINHOUER, WITNESSED OUTLET MALL SHOOTING: I parked about 50 feet from the front door of H&amp;M, and it was guy on the phone, and he was begging for help. And he didn't speak a lot of English. I took the phone from him. I told the operator. I started counting the bodies on the ground. I said, I've got one, two, three, five, six, seven bodies. The first girl I went to and this is pretty graphic, but she was in the bushes in a fetal position like she was praying. And I didn't feel a pulse. I pulled her head back to see if she's OK. And there was nothing left of her face or her head. And it was gone.
 
I then saw a little boy, about four or five. I'm assuming it was a boy. It might have been a girl. I couldn't tell the sex, fall out from under one of the victims. I went around the planner and grabbed him and took him away from all the bodies. I asked him, do you speak English? Because he looked Asiatic. He said he did. He just kept saying, my mother's hurt, over and over and over. I told him everything was fine, that help was on the way. I checked in for no wounds, but he was caked with blood from head toe. I just held on to him until the first Allen police officer showed up. And that officer said, is he OK? I said, take him to the hospital. I don't know.

 <br>[01:15:16]
 
NEWTON: Now further south in Brownsville, Texas, police are still trying to find out whether the incident killing eight people there was intentional or not. CNN's Rosa Flores has the details.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, this happened in Brownsville, Texas, which is across the border from Matamoros, Mexico. According to the director of the shelter where all of this unfolded. He says that this happened across the street from his shelter on Sunday morning at about 8:30 in the morning. He says that between 20 and 25 migrants from Venezuela were sitting on the curb waiting for a bus, and then the rest was captured on surveillance video, according to this director.
 
He says that he watched this video. And what he saw unfold was the following. He says that there was a 2007 Range Rover vehicle that was driving at a very high speed. The driver ran a red light, then hit the curb about 30 feet from where the migrants were, and then that vehicle went out of control. Now, according to this director, he says that he talked to some of the witnesses and that according to some of the witnesses, that this act was intentional.
 
But I asked the director if based on his witnessing of this video, watching this video, if to him it actually looked like an intentional act. And he said no. He reiterated that what this video showed was that there was a vehicle that was driving at a very high rate of speed, that ran a red light, hit a curb, and then drove out of control. About the driver of this vehicle, according to Brownsville police, they have not identified this individual. This individual is not cooperating with authorities. This individual is under arrest, and they're being held on charges of reckless driving. Now, I'm here in El Paso, Texas, because we're covering the migrant surge that's happening leading up to the lifting of Title 42. If you can see, there are barricades here in front of me on this street because what you see behind me is a church shelter. And so there's a lot of concern by city officials here in the city of El Paso and in other border cities for their own public safety and the public safety of their residents. That's why the city of El Paso issued a statement on Sunday saying that the incident in Brownsville reinforces their decision to close out the street here at the shelter in El Paso.
 
Rosa Flores, CNN, El Paso.
 
NEWTON: And coming up a little later this hour, we'll take a closer look at the situation along the U.S.-Mexico border just days before Title 42 expires. But first, there's no let up in the fighting in Sudan as the two warring sides gather in Saudi Arabia for peace talks. I'll speak to an expert about the significance of these discussions. Plus, thousands of people are fleeing their homes in the Indian state of Manipur amid ethnic violence. We'll have a live report from the region.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:20:43]
 
NEWTON: Fighting rages on in Sudan as envoys from the two warring sides gather for peace talks. Now, plumes of smoke and sounds of explosions could be heard in the south of the capital, Khartoum on Sunday. The violence comes as representatives of the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are in Jeddah for talks led by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Now, in the meantime, the League of Arab States says a committee will be formed to communicate with Sudan's warring parties on trying to reach a ceasefire agreement.
 
Now, the three week old conflict has killed hundreds and triggered a mass exodus and created a humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia has also announced that $100 million in aid will be delivered for Sudan. The much needed assistance comes as the country grapples with a lack of basic facilities amid the ongoing violence. And in fact, numerous medical facilities have been shelled since the fighting broke out in April. The U.N. says the violence has left only 16 percent of hospitals in Khartoum fully functional. Here's how one mother described her experience at a maternity ward.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): When the bomb started falling at the hospital on April 20th, we were told we had to evacuate because no one knows what will happen next. So we scrambled to rescue the two babies. There were no ambulances available and one of them died before reaching Al Nada hospital because of the lack of oxygen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Our stocks of medicines are starting to dwindle. If it goes on like this, everything will collapse. A lot of people ask me for medicine, but I can't give it to them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: For more, we're joined by Cameron Hudson. He's a senior associate with the Africa Program at the center for Strategic and International Studies. And I want to thank you for joining us as things remain dire still in Sudan. So we have the two sides apparently meeting. Do you expect any progress from the U.S.-Saudi initiative? I mean, I've already heard conflicting news as to whether or not this was supposed to be about a ceasefire at all, that some people who attended these talks said, no, no, this is about humanitarian aid only.
 
CAMERON HUDSON, SR. ASSOC., AFRICA PROG., CTR. FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTL. STUDIES: Well, it's unclear exactly what the scope of these conversations are going to be, largely because I think this was very ad hoc and last minute. Clearly, there's a need to get a genuine ceasefire on the ground so that we can enable better humanitarian access to people both fleeing the country and also remaining inside the country. So there's a whole host of priorities, not least of which I think we can't lose sight of the fact that, depending on how these talks go, that could set the country up for future political talks.
 
And I think that most people on the ground in Sudan, as much as they want to see a ceasefire. What they're most interested in is a pathway towards civilian democratic rule. And that's really, I think, what people are most anxious about, that these talks could some way prevent or prolong military rule in the country and further delay the achievement of their civilian dreams.
 
NEWTON: I want to get to that issue in a second. But before that, I want to ask you, because you brought it up, that you think perhaps this could even -- these kinds of ceasefire arrangements could even recreate, in your words, the failed security situation that got us here in the first place. Why do you say that?
 
HUDSON: Well, I think if you just look at who's doing the talking right now, it's the Rapid Support Forces and the army brought together by the Saudis and the U.S. So it's all the same people who were around the table talking when the fighting broke out and in the lead up to that fighting. And so here they are talking again, essentially at no higher level than what they had before.
 
The issues haven't changed. If anything, the issues are more complicated because there's actual fighting going on right now. And so how we expect to produce a different result, a different outcome, the parties haven't shown any kind of contrition about what they've done in the last three weeks and basically destroying the country. So it's really hard to imagine that without, you know, sort of new facts on the ground, we're going to be able to, you know, get over the fact that there is active fighting going on and get to a point where somehow we're going to get a different and a better outcome than we did before.
 
The only thing that is different right now is that the U.S. has created a sanctions regime on Sudan. And we understand that U.S. mediators right now are threatening sanctions on the actors at the talks if they don't, you know, if they don't sign on to some kind of agreement that ceases the hostilities. And that may be all well and good, but I think that achieving a peace deal through sanctions like this doesn't bode well for long term stability of whatever emerges from these Saudi talks.
 <br>[01:25:28]
 
NEWTON: Right. You're saying it has to have some durability because we've already seen what happens if it doesn't. I note that the U.N. representative there is also saying that they're looking for some kind of monitoring mechanism. I guess you have to get to a ceasefire before you get there. I want to ask you though, given the fact that this could get worse before it gets better, what's at stake? 
 
HUDSON: Well, clearly, I think the parties are using this as an opportunity to continue the fighting. We haven't seen any kind of abatement in the fighting. We haven't seen appreciably more humanitarian assistance, getting into communities that need. And so, you know, you're talking about an already very fragile country with a population that's on the move. And I think we can just see all of those forces exacerbated in the next few weeks with people moving, the humanitarian crisis getting worse, and more and more of the infrastructure of the country being destroyed in this fighting.
 
We're seeing factories, hospitals, schools, roads, basic infrastructure being destroyed right now. So you have to think long term about what is the future of Sudan, what will people come back to if we ever expect them to come back, if the things that sustain life in the country and sustain employment are all destroyed. So we really have to think about what we are trying to create here.
 
NEWTON: Yes. And the spillover effects in the region if it does get worse. Cameron Hudson for us, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
 
HUDSON: Thanks.
 
NEWTON: Now, in an extraordinary session, the Arab League has decided to readmit Syria 11 years after it was suspended. The move marks another milestone in Bashar al-Assad's efforts to regain diplomatic recognition after Syria's brutal civil war. But the League secretary general is making clear this restored status doesn't mean the crisis in Syria is over.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AHMED ABOUL GHEIT, ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL (through translator): The return of Syria is the beginning of a movement, not an end. The direction of the resolution to the crisis in Syria will take time for procedures to be implemented, and it will be gradual. The task of this committee is to follow up on those procedures. Also, it is not a decision to resume relationships between Arab states and Syria. This is a sovereign decision left for every country to take on its own. In this decision, we are talking about holding the membership and the formation of a committee to communicate with the Syrian government and regime. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, the Arab League suspended Syria in November 2011 after President Assad violently cracked down on anti-government protests, sparking the civil war. An estimated 350,000 people have been killed. And almost 14 million Syrians displaced. Some who are still living in refugee camps, say the Arab League's action means nothing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASHAD AL-DEEK, DISPLACED SYRIAN (through translator): We didn't benefit from the fact that the regime was not in the Arab League. So what will happen if it's part of it? This means nothing to us because we are displaced and forced to leave our towns. They are just like him. This is why they took him back. They are all useless.
 
ABDUL SALAM YOUSEF, DISPLACED SYRIAN (through translator): It came as a big unfortunate shock for us Syrians living in camps in the north. Instead of Arab leaders helping us and getting us out of those camps where we suffer and live in pain, they whitewash the criminal and killer's hands from our blood.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, the move does mean Mr. Assad could attend the League's next meeting in Saudi Arabia later this month. And that's if the Saudis invite him and then if he decides to go.
 <br>[01:29:01]
 
Now as Russia scrambles to replace destroyed tanks in Ukraine, their museum pieces no more. Coming up, we'll show you how Moscow is turning to Cold War relics as its tanks get battered on the battlefield. Plus, the Pandemic era deportation rule known as Title 42 ends this week. But is the Biden administration prepared to handle an expected surge of migrants at the southern border? We'll take a closer look at that.

PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: And welcome back. You are watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Newton.
 
Preparations are underway in Moscow ahead of Russia's annual Victory Day Parade that marked the defeat of Nazi Germany. Now, Tuesday's event is typically used by President Vladimir Putin to show off Russia's military might, but this year events have reportedly been scaled back, and security heightened just days after Russia alleged a drone attack on the Kremlin. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDREY YAKOVLEV, MOSCOW RESIDENT: Security measures should be tightened as people understand that the terrorist acts are possible. It is an important day for us, and they will try to strike at the most vulnerable point for us, but we should not be afraid of it. 
 
ALYONA GORYUNOVA, MOSCOW RESIDENT: I get this feeling of patriotism every time. Not always do we get to see the parade live. It's on TV mostly but I deeply appreciate moments like this. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Even as Russia prepares to parade its military might through the streets of Moscow, its army is turning to the relics of its past to re-equip its beleaguered forces in Ukraine. 
 
Tanks not used since the Cold War are being pressed back into service, a sign of just how desperate Russia is becoming at this hour on its fight on the battlefield. 
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian has that story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN DELANEY, SENIOR CURATOR, IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM: What a missile will do is it will fly over the tank, then down in a 90-degree, straight into the top of the turret which is less well defended. 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This scenario had played out hundreds of times over the past 14 months. Ukraine using western weapons to devastating effect. 
 
Russia, according to one recent estimate, has lost up to half its operational tanks used in this war. Now western officials say Russia is dusting off much older models to replace them. 
 
DELANEY: This gun was used on the SU 100 tanks destroyer in 1944. So it's a Second World War gun. 
 
SEBASTIAN: Including this T-55, first built in the 1940s. This one now housed at the Imperial War Museum outside of Cambridge. 
 
Satellite imagery from a storage facility in Russia's Far East showing dozens of tanks have been removed in the last year. This image showing the T-55 at that same facility. 
 
Video that first surfaced in March also showing a train load on the move, reportedly somewhere in Russia. The Russian minister of defense hasn't confirmed their deployment. 
 
But in recent weeks well connected Russian bloggers have begun showing T-55s in Russian occupied territory in Ukraine. 
 
DELANEY: There are so many of these were manufactured, over 100,000 altogether. And the parts, the basic mechanical parts are all interchangeable, so there will be vast stockpiles of these. 
 
SEBASTIAN: The T-55 was a central piece of the Soviet Union's cold war arsenal, helping crush democratic uprisings in eastern Europe. Hungary in 1966, the Prague spring 12 years later. But by the time Iraq used them in the Gulf War in the early 90s -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We took out -- all told 14 T-55 tanks. 
 
SEBASTIAN: They were already outclassed by U.S. M1-Abrams and British Challengers. Earlier versions of the tanks NATO countries are now supplying to Ukraine. 
 <br>[01:34:59]
 
TREVOR TAYLOR, PROFESSIONAL FELLOW IN DEFENSE, RUSI: I think faced with western weapons the Russians must expect very heavy casualties if they expect to move forward using that type of system. 
 
SEBASTIAN: Experts say behind the official propaganda, Russia Cannot build new weapons quick enough. The western sanctions primarily targeting Russia's access to higher tech parts for weapons have made it much harder for them to manufacture more modern equipment.
 
Older, simpler tanks like this, thousands of them just sitting in storage provide an alternative. But this against say, a Leopard 2 or a Challenger what happens? 
 
If it's a one-on-one tank engagement of a reasonable distance, this will lose every time. But in wooded, we're closer built environments, this is adequate. 
 
DELANEY: If it's a one on one tank engagement over a reasonable distance, this will lead every time. But in (INAUDIBLE) or closely built environment, this is adequate.
 
SEBASTIAN: It is also simpler to maintain and train on the newer systems, an advantage for Russia's mobilized troops. 
 
DELANEY: Dig a pit. You could fit the tank in the (INAUDIBLE) you can only see the turret, and then that can be used to defend the front line against a counterattack. 
 
SEBASTIAN: Russia is now digging in with everything it has, as Ukraine gets ready for what may be its biggest counteroffensive yet.

NEWTON: At least 55 people have been killed and more than 200 hospitalized amid ethnic violence in the Indian state of Manipur. Now, authorities say as many as 23,000 people have fled their homes since violence broke out in the past few days. 
 
The Indian army has been deployed and a five-day mobile Internet blackout is in force to try and contain the violence. 
 
CNN's Vedika Sud is following the developments for us from New Delhi. And it's good to have you on the story, and I will note thousands of troops are now on their way to the region. And when you look at the details of what went on, it is incredibly disturbing. What more do you know? VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Incredibly disturbing indeed, Paula.
 
 It's open, this violence is open. New fault lines in a state where there's already been a history of ethnic violence that has been reported for years and this is yet another one. 
 
There is uneasy calm in Manipur as I speak with you. This is a state that borders Myanmar as well. It's the northeastern state of India. And there were clashes last week -- intense, disturbing clashes between two communities. 
 
One is a predominantly Hindu community known as the Meitei community. It accounts for more than 50 percent of the population in Manipur which stands at over 3 million. And the other is a local tribe which is in the foothills of the region. 
 
Now what we do know is that there was a protest march that this tribe had taken out against the Meitei community's demand for tribal status. What that does, once you get tribal status, it gives you benefits, it gives you government jobs, the reservations in government jobs, in schools and colleges, in institutions for that community. 
 
Now the local community said that this is not fair because they are the majority population, the Meitei community is the majority population in Manipur and hence they should not be benefiting from reservations. 
 
While the protest was on there were clashes, it sparked those clashes between those two communities, which led to widespread destruction, arson, looting, deaths in that patch. 
 
Now we have reached out, CNN has reached out to the state government. We have asked them on direct questions on the death toll. We haven't got an answer from them yet. The army has come out and sent out a statement Sunday. They are worrying for (INAUDIBLE) by the Modi government. 
 
Now, what's also to be noted here is Manipur the state is also ruled by the BJP, Bharatiya Janata Party. That is the party that is ruled by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
 
What we do know from the army is that the situation is now under control, Paula. That is what we know from them. The chief minister has also tweeted to say the same. The chief minister is the head of state of Manipur. 
 
What we also do know is that there are these (INAUDIBLE) happening, flag marches happening, to ensure that there is peace in the region. 
 
But we had to independently go to those hospitals across Imphal, which the capital of Manipur to understand what the death toll stands at because the state government has not put out today yet. There has not even been a press conference from the chief minister of the state yet to his people. 
 
So we've got that figure -- 55 plus, that is the death toll, that's where it stands up for now. More than 23,000 people have been displaced, and they are placed in refugee camps across Manipur for now, Paula.
 
NEWTON: It's clear getting information from that region's going to become more difficult, obviously with that Internet blackout. 
 
SUD: Yes.
 
NEWTON: Vedika Sud, we appreciate you being on top of the story for us. 
 
Now, at least 22 people, including women and children have died after a boat capsized in southern India on Sunday. The vessel was ferrying tourists when it overturned near a beach in Kerala state. 
 <br>[01:39:58]
 
NEWTON: Officials don't know exactly how many people were on board but estimates the number to be around 35. Eight people were also taken to hospital. 
 
U.S. House Republicans are set to vote on a wide ranging border security package Thursday which is also the expiry date for Title 42. 
 
Now, that's the U.S. government rule that allowed border officers to immediately expel migrants during the COVID pandemic. Pushing back against criticism, the Biden administration insists it is prepared for an expected surge of migrants on the U.S.-Mexican border. 
 
CNN's Gustavo Valdez has more now on that story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GUSTAVO VALDEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We are about 15 miles from downtown Ciudad Juarez and this is the point where many migrants are now waiting for the end of Title 42. The end of Title 42 is May 11th. 
 
Nonetheless, these people think that it is safer for them to be here, already in U.S. territory, behind that barbwire, than being on the streets of Ciudad Juarez where they believe they could be victims of crime. 
 
We have seen this afternoon about 200 people that are waiting here, many of them are children. And we hear the cry -- the cry for help from many of them who are requesting water or food from us. 
 
They say they've been here about five days, and they have limited resources. We have seen some people come with food, water, soda. But it seems like they are selling, so only those who still have some money can benefit from this. 
 
We have also seen medical emergencies like the one on that side where we are told there are three women who collapsed, and they are waiting for some kind of assistance. 
 
There is nobody on the U.S. side, nobody from the border patrol, the national guard, there are two porta-potties but there are no officials here to see what's happening. They were telling us they were trying to get this woman back into Mexico to see if they can get any medical help on this side, we haven't seen that happening yet. 
 
Gustavo Valdez, CNN -- Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua.

NEWTON: Still to come for us, leaders from Japan and South Korea tried to move beyond the difficult past and focused on the threat from North Korea. We'll have a live report on how the historic meeting went. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: Japan and South Korea are deepening ties at a historic summit over the weekend. And it is the first time a Japanese leader has visited Seoul in more than a decade. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and discussed a number of topics, including working together to monitor the threat of nuclear missiles from North Korea.
 <br>[01:44:58]
 
NEWTON: CNN's Paula Hancocks has been following the visit for us and joins us now from Seoul. 
 
Paula, good to see you as I know how closely you follow these issues, this was a very significant visit. And obviously they talked about North Korea, but significantly the Japanese prime minister also expressed a measure of atonement. 
 
Why was that important? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well Paula, this is something that was always going to be one of the main issues as they meet. As you say, North Korea and security issues are important, but also there are a number of historical issues that have kept the relationship between Japan and South Korea at arms length really for recent memory. 
 
And certainly during the previous presidents of South Korea's tenure, relations were worse than they had been in decades. So what we are seeing here is President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea trying to move closer to Japan. 
 
Now when it comes to things like wartime labor, for example, he has come under domestic criticism for trying to offer concessions to Japan without receiving anything in return. 
 
Some were hoping for another apology from Japan for the treatment of Koreans during the colonial period. Japan colonized South Korea and North Korea from 1910 to 1945. There wasn't a fresh apology which disappointed some. But he did show personal sympathy for what those victims would have gone through. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER: My heart aches as many people went through a very difficult and sad experience in the harsh environment at that time. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: President Yoon had said that he's trying to dispel the perception that South Korea and Japan cannot take a single step forward until all of this historical issues have been completely sorted out and settled. 
 
So they were trying to move beyond this issue, which has been making things very difficult between the two countries. 
 
Now Washington has certainly welcomed the fact that Japan and South Korea are getting closer, at least at the government level. And we have seen also that both sides understand there is a need for more information sharing, for more security alliances when it comes to dealing with the threat from North Korea. Here is what President Yoon had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREA PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Prime Minister Kishida and I shared the recognition that North Korea's nuclear and missile development poses a grave threat to peace and stability, not only on the Korean peninsula and Japan, but also throughout the world. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: Now, the leaders of Japan, South Korea and the United States are expected to have a trilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G-7 summit in Japan later this month, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes, no doubt on those issues with North Korea will come up again. 
 
Paula Hancocks for us in Seoul, thanks so much.
 
Now at least 394 people have died after floods and landslides hit villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo last week. Heavy rainfall caused rivers to overflow and created mudslides that devastated communities. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Mud and misery everywhere in this village in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Houses with corrugated roofs no match for the flash floods and landslides that swept through this area last week. 
 
The rush of water and debris in the South Kivu Province claiming hundreds of lives as well as property. An official in one territory affected by the flood says nearly 400 people have been killed as searchers dig through the soggy ground to try and find others. The grief is unbearable for some. GENTILLE NDAGIJIMANA, SURVIVOR (through translator): Now I don't have
 
 any more family, and I don't have any more fields. Now, I must look for a place to sleep. 
 
I know that my husband is alive, but all the children are dead. 
 
NEWTON: Aid workers say it is grim work recovering the bodies with many burials already taking place. But one local official says there are growing concerns for the survivors both homeless and sleeping outside. 
 
Schools have been destroyed, hospitals washed away, the facilities that weren't damaged now stretched to their limits and running low on medicines and supplies for the wounded like gloves, syringes, and compresses. 
 
BAUMA NGOLA, HOSPITAL MEDICINE DOCTOR (through translator): The influx of cases shows clearly that we are overwhelmed, because we have already exceeded our capacity. As for the beds, you can see some people sleeping on the floor. 
 
NEWTON: The government says Monday will be a national day of mourning, something the people of these hard-hit villages already know all too well.

NEWTON: Now at the Formula One Grand Prix in Miami there was no stopping Verstappen. The two-time world champion roared from a weak starting position to take the race away from the driver who led most of the way. 
 
Here is "WORLDSPORT's" Don Riddell. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLDSPORT ANCHOR: There is no doubt that Red Bull are the team to beat in Formula One this season. 
 
And the two-time defending champion Max Verstappen is proving very, very difficult to beat. At the Miami Grand Prix this weekend he was forced to begin from ninth place on the grid because of a qualifying set back in Saturday, but it did not seem to matter at all.
 
Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez started from pole position and would have been hoping to hold Verstappen off, but once Verstappen got a bit of momentum going, just nobody could stop him. 
 
By the 48th lap, Verstappen caught Perez and passed him and he was seen celebrating his third win of the season. This is only the second running of the Miami Grand Prix, and Verstappen now has won them both. 
 
MAX VERSTAPPEN, FORMULA ONE CHAMPION: I mean yesterday was of course, a bit of a setback, but today we just kept it calm, kept it clean, and yes, for sure winning a race from the nine is very satisfying. 
 
SERGIO PEREZ, FORMULA ONE RACER: I gave it all, you know. I think the first thing was really poor with the raining (ph) that we had on that initial phase -- and that compromised quite a lot of our race because we did not have too much of a difference on tires, and Max was particularly good today -- it was a (INAUDIBLE) win for him. 
 
FERNANDO ALONSO, FORMULA ONE RACER: At the beginning of the year, I thought it was amazing. Now, after four (INAUDIBLE) we want obviously more, and least second place. But the two Red Bulls, they are always unbreakable, and they are always, you know, super fast. 
 
But as I said, maybe Monaco, maybe Barcelona, we have a possibility. 
 
RIDDELL: Fernando Alonso is having a brilliant season, that by the way is the fourth 1-2 finish for the Red Bull team this season, and of course, Verstappen 14 points clear at the top of the driver standings. 
 
Now for the American race fans, this is just the beginning. There are three Grand Prix in the U.S. this season -- Austin and Las Vegas are still to come.
