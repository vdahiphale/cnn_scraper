ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: I'm Richard Quest, and I bring to you some breaking news from Israel, where the authorities there are 
 
 reporting a deadly shooting in east Jerusalem. Authorities say a gunman has killed five people and wounded several before them, in their words is being 
 
 neutralized.
 
The attack comes a day after one of the deadliest Israeli raids in the West Bank for many years. CNN's Hadas Gold is with me from Jerusalem. We'll get 
 
 to yesterday's events first of all after you've updated me with what you know about today's shooting and deaths.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Richard, so just want to correct you. This attack happened actually in north Jerusalem, in a 
 
 neighborhood called Neve Yaakov. And what we're hearing from authorities is that five people have been killed, there are several more injured, some of 
 
 them in serious condition.
 
This was a shooting attack, and police are saying that they have, what they call neutralized, which means that they likely killed at least one 
 
 assailant. And there's a very heavy police presence right now in north Jerusalem where just this just happened in the last 20, 30 minutes or so.
 
We're seeing images from Israeli news channels of just an absolute massive amount of police and emergency services. We are getting reports from 
 
 Israeli media that this happened actually right outside or at a synagogue in Neve Yaakov. It is the Sabbath here, the Shabbat, so many people would 
 
 be at the synagogue, praying for the Sabbath services.
 
This is one of the worst attacks, targeting Israelis in several months, especially when we're looking at the numbers of the victims. But as you 
 
 mentioned earlier, this is coming at a time of incredibly heightened tensions and violence, while we did think that today was a little bit 
 
 calmer than yesterday, this attack is proving to us that this situation is quickly spiraling out of control right now between Israelis and 
 
 Palestinians. Richard?
 
QUEST: So, the just -- I listen to what you say, I'm putting it into the bigger picture of what we saw yesterday. Do we have, or can you give an 
 
 educated guess, the responsibility here?
 
GOLD: Well, the police are already saying that they do believe this was terror-motivated, this neighborhood is in northern Jerusalem, it's over the 
 
 green line, the traditional line, 1967 lines. And as we've noted, it's coming after a very intense and violent 24 hours.
 
Now I guess longer than 24 hours, 36 hours, yesterday morning, there was that deadly Israeli military raid in Jenin. Israeli military saying they 
 
 were targeting Islamic Jihad militants there, at least, 9 Palestinians killed, we know at least, one of them was a civilian --
 
QUEST: Right --
 
GOLD: Bystander, a woman in her 60s. And then actually, just a couple of hours later, another Palestinian was killed during clashes with Israeli 
 
 forces, actually not very far from this neighborhood where this shooting tonight took place. They're really close to each other. So, I don't know if 
 
 there's a connection between those two, but that is something to -- definitely of known.
 
Keep in mind, this isn't bringing back -- I mean, it wasn't very long ago, just a few months ago that there was a wave of attacks targeting Israelis 
 
 that killed something like 20 Israelis in the span of a few months. And so clearly, I mean, we've already seen the security establishment here, the 
 
 Israeli Defense Forces on high alert.
 
Last night, rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel as well, and responded with airstrikes in Gaza. And I can only imagine that with what's happening 
 
 tonight, and as we learn more about the situation and the victims and the assailant and the potential motives, this will only further inflame the 
 
 situation here.
 
And keep in mind, within a few days, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to be here, so he will have a lot on his plate when he comes to 
 
 visit.
 
QUEST: Well, one final question, different bit of guidance or understanding. Bearing in mind, a government in Israel who's -- and the 
 
 sort of the controversial actions that they have taken, or some ministers within, and former cabinet members have taken. Who is ratcheting up the 
 
 pressure here at the moment?
 
GOLD: Well, I mean, yes, there is a new right-wing government in Israel, and it's the most right-wing in Israeli history. Some of the ministers are 
 
 people who are considered -- once were considered fringe right-wing politicians that no one would have imagined that they would have been part 
 
 of the cabinet.
 
Now, one of them, for example, Itamar Ben-Gvir is in charge of the Israeli police, he's National Security Minister.
 <br>[14:05:00]
 
He went up to one of Jerusalem's holiest sites known to Jews, the Temple Mount, to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif or the Noble Sanctuary. And while he 
 
 went there during what's supposed to be normal visiting hours, it did inflame, exacerbate tensions. But listen, Richard, this situation has been 
 
 going on during the previous government.
 
As I noted, I mean, during the previous government under Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett, it was the deadliest year for both Palestinians, 
 
 especially Palestinians, but both Palestinians and Israelis in recent memory. So, this isn't necessarily something new. This new government, 
 
 obviously, and what their -- you know, their words, their actions can exacerbate and further inflame the tensions.
 
QUEST: Right --
 
GOLD: But Richard, the ground here has been dry and just waiting for that match to strike --
 
QUEST: Yes --
 
GOLD: It'll flame for months now.
 
QUEST: And well, whiles you and I are talking, I'm seeing the first video of tonight, and obviously it's the ambulances, it's the police, it is the 
 
 panel PF of security forces around it. And to what you just said a moment ago, if we do have five Israelis dead and many injured, then -- and I don't 
 
 want to forecast violence in any shape or form, but following from what you said, there would likely be a response.
 
GOLD: I would imagine a response also right now, obviously, the first thought in mind for the Israeli police and potentially, the Israeli 
 
 military, is to make sure or to see if there are any more assailants that they're going after, reports of anybody running away from the scene and 
 
 they will be going after them.
 
And I imagine that they will immediately -- I mean, they say that one of the -- at least, one of the assailants, if there's just one, was 
 
 neutralized, and Israeli police speak, they usually means that, that person was killed, not clear yet by who, whether it was a security person who 
 
 happened to get to the scene or if it was a civilian who happened to be armed.
 
But they will obviously be researching their history, where did they come from? And we might see, you know, potentially raids and where that person 
 
 comes from, to talk --
 
QUEST: Right --
 
GOLD: To any of people that they know. This is obviously, a very quickly developing situation, and unfortunately, for this region, it has not become 
 
 an uncommon one.
 
QUEST: And Hadas, I realize it's late where you are, but unfortunately, there will be many more hours of duty ahead, and the moment you have more 
 
 facts, please come back to me and we will take you straight to air immediately. Hadas Gold joining us from Jerusalem, where of course, it's 
 
 now well into Friday evening or well just about.
 
In a few hours, we will get to see the video of the arrest of Tyre Nichols. Now, it has shattered the U.S. city of Memphis. The 29-year-old man died 
 
 days after police pulled him over, after the car he was driving, claiming he's been driving recklessly, that was earlier this month. They then 
 
 allegedly beat him so severely, that a few days later, he succumbed to his injuries.
 
The police chief who has already viewed the video has told us, it shows, in their words, acts that defy humanity. Five police officers have been fired, 
 
 and they now face varying degrees of murder, assault and very serious charges in connection with the death. They have all been released on bail 
 
 and bond.
 
Nichols' parents and their attorney spoke a short while ago, and they're calling for police reforms including obligating officers to intervene if 
 
 other officers are committing crimes. They also want the special Scorpion Unit as it's known, that the office belonged to, permanently disbanded.
 
All across the city in Memphis, people are in mourning and shocked, now, there were plenty who gathered last night for a prayer and remembrance 
 
 visual at the Skate Park where friends and family members say Nichols found some of his greatest moments of joy. And that is part of the tragedy. 
 
 Nichols was a lover of sports and the outdoors, an amateur photographer and a father.
 
Sara Sidner now takes us through who he was through the words and images of his parents and friends.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Memphis, candles burned for a life snuffed out.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tyre wasn't trying to go home --
 
SIDNER: The life of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols being remembered where friends say he felt the most free, a skate park. Twelve years ago, Nichols seen 
 
 here doing what he loved. Twelve years later, he ended up dead, officials say, beaten by five men sworn to protect and serve.
 
STEVE MULROY, SHELBY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: The grand jury returns indictments against all five with the same charges. The actions of all of 
 
 them resulted in the death of Tyre Nichols, and they are all responsible.
 
SIDNER: Justin Smith, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills and Emmitt Martin III were all fired from the Memphis Police Department, and 
 
 now stand charged with seven crimes, second degree murder, two counts of aggravated assault.
 <br>[14:10:00]
 
Two counts of aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. And there is police body-cam and sky camera video showing it 
 
 all. Something police will soon release to the public.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I'm grieved. Frankly, I'm shocked. I'm sickened by what I saw. What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. 
 
 This was wrong. This was criminal.
 
SIDNER: Attorneys for two of the former officers responded to the TBI's damning statement.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you heard that, what did you think? And have your clients heard all of the charges against them?
 
WILLIAM MASSEY, ATTORNEY FOR EMMITT MARTIN III: I thought, I wish I had seen that video so I could evaluate what he said.
 
BLAKE BALLIN, ATTORNEY FOR DESMOND MILLS: To say things like that is when you have a tinderbox that we're all concerned about. I have questions about 
 
 whether those are the right words to use, whether this was the right timing, and whether the government should be saying those things about 
 
 people who are innocent until proven guilty, when you know that's going to be broadcast to potential jurors.
 
SIDNER: But Nichols' family wants people to know more about Tyre Nichols than how he died.
 
ROWVAUGHN WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS' MOTHER: Nobody is perfect, OK, nobody. But he was damn near. My son was a beautiful soul and he touched everyone.
 
SIDNER: Nichols had his mama's name tattooed on his arm. He wasn't just her beautiful boy, he was also a father, who loved having fun. His friend, who 
 
 knew him in Sacramento, told a local newspaper, he had such a free spirit and skating gave him his wings. He worked at FedEx, but had other dreams -- 
 
 photography.
 
In his own words, he posted people have a story to tell. Why not capture it? Instead of doing the norm and writing it down, and speaking it. It 
 
 turns out, what led to his death was captured on camera.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST: Obviously, we will have full coverage of the events in the next few hours, especially, of course, when the video is revealed and is released. 
 
 We will hear it all and you will see it all, unfortunately. Tyre Nichols parents have been speaking to CNN earlier, and they talked about their son 
 
 and the officers who are now accused of murdering him.
 
His mother told Don Lemon, I don't have my baby, I will never have my baby again. We want you to listen to part of that interview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN CRUMP, ATTORNEY FOR TYRE NICHOLS' FAMILY: The last words on that video that America is going to hear, Miss Wells, he calls out for you three 
 
 times. Gut-wrenching, screams for his mom --
 
WELLS: Screams --
 
CRUMP: Go ahead, mom.
 
WELLS: That was my baby, he was a mama's boy, that boy loved me to death. He has my name tattooed on his arm. People don't know what those five 
 
 police officers did to our family, and they really don't know what they did to their own families. They have put their own families in harm's way.
 
They have brought shame to their own families. They brought shame to the black community. I just feel sorry for -- I feel sorry for them. I really 
 
 do. I really feel sorry for them.
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Why do you say that?
 
WELLS: Because they didn't have to do this. And like I said, they brought a lot of shame to their own family. Once you see this video, and I know, I 
 
 didn't see it, but from what I hear, it's horrific and the humanity of it all. Where was the humanity? They beat my son like a pinata. My son. He was 
 
 -- he had crohn's disease. He had surgery in 2013.
 
My son weighed a buck fifty, he was 6'3 and he weighed a buck fifty. And those men, if you combine their weight, they all -- it was over a 1,000 
 
 pounds, beating and beating 150 pound person to death. Because that's what they did, they beat my son to death.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[14:15:00]
 
QUEST: Authorities and community leaders are now urging people who may be outraged by what they see on the arrest video in a few hours time, to 
 
 express themselves peacefully. Don Lemon has spoken to the Memphis police chief about her reaction to the footage.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CERELYN DAVIS, POLICE CHIEF, MEMPHIS: I was outraged, I was -- it was incomprehensible to me. It was unconscionable, and I felt that I needed to 
 
 do something and do something quickly. I don't think I've witnessed anything of that nature in my entire career. You're going to see acts that 
 
 defy humanity.
 
You're going to see a disregard for life, duty of care that we're all sworn to, and a level of physical interaction that is above and beyond what is 
 
 required in law enforcement.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST: Now, let me pull together the strands, so you will know what to expect. We're going to talk more about the story, of course, as we go 
 
 through this hour. And then throughout the rest of the day, well, the release of the video, it's supposed to be either 6:00 or 7:00 Eastern Time, 
 
 and that's in about four or five hours from now.
 
We don't exactly have a precise time on it, but obviously, when it is released, the reaction to it, and the developments that follow -- well, as 
 
 you would expect, he'll get a full comprehensive, detailed coverage here on CNN. As you and I continue this Friday evening, Ukraine says Russia is 
 
 firing hypersonic missiles in wanting attacks on civilians and energy infrastructure.
 
Only western defense system can take them down. We'll talk about that in a moment. Also, Haiti, the unrest has reached boiling point, if it could get 
 
 any worse. Protesters are now storming the prime minister's residence. The explanation of what's behind the demonstrations and why they got so bad.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
QUEST: An update on our breaking news that we're following very closely tonight. Eight people are now known to have died in the deadly shooting in 
 
 Jerusalem.
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
You're seeing the latest pictures just coming in to us at the moment. Israeli authorities say that several people have also been wounded. And the 
 
 gunman in there, somewhat for say -- has been neutralized, we assume that means has been killed. The attack follows one of the deadliest Israeli 
 
 raids in the West Bank in years.
 
As this story moves and develops, I will bring you, of course, the latest and numbers. Poland is pledging to send 60 more tanks to Ukraine on top of 
 
 the 14 Leopard 2s it has already promised. Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of the tanks. They're coming in from Germany, U.S., the U.K. and 
 
 various European allies.
 
It's also waiting for the deliveries of western air defense missile systems like Patriots, those might have helped intercept two hypersonic missiles, 
 
 Ukraine's air force says Russia fired in its attack on Thursday. Ukrainian military official say they were able to strike down most of the 70 Russian 
 
 missiles in that attack, one calls substantial damage. Sam Kiley is with us from Kyiv, with a lot of ground to cover. First, Sam, these hypersonic 
 
 missiles, it's a new phrase, what makes hypersonic that different?
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They go incredibly fast is the short answer to that, Richard, 10, 12 times the speed of sound. The 
 
 fastest missile system on earth, and the Russians seem to have pioneered at least the public use of them. The United States and other allies, they're 
 
 trying to -- or have already developed them, but they're still under wraps with the first use of them in anger in a war setting has been early on in 
 
 this campaign by Russia against Ukraine.
 
We haven't heard of the use of them for many months, actually, and then just a day, President Zelenskyy said that two of these missiles, they're 
 
 PrSM missiles which are capable of carrying some 500 kilograms of conventional explosives or ultimately, but not in this case. A nuclear 
 
 warhead were used against targets here in Ukraine.
 
They are super fast, they are also maneuverable, and there doesn't seem -- there's certainly nothing in the Ukrainian air defense armory that can stop 
 
 them. The Ukrainians have done remarkably well in taking down the vast majority of the missiles that have been fired at them in this campaign, to 
 
 go after, particularly, the energy infrastructure here in Ukraine over the last few months.
 
But these hypersonic missiles of which the Russians don't have a large number are capable of evading everything they've got. So they're asking 
 
 once again for a Patriot and other similar missile systems to be --
 
QUEST: OK --
 
KILEY: Allowed to them, so that they could take on what effectively as a strategic weapon. Richard.
 
QUEST: So, we now have the agreement to send Patriots and other missile defense systems, and of course, the tanks. With your experience, how long 
 
 do you think it's going to take before this new more powerful armory starts arriving, gets to the front, and we feel the effect?
 
KILEY: It would really depend on what -- if you're talking about the tanks, the United Kingdom government is saying that they are 12 or 14, rather, 
 
 challenger tanks which are very sophisticated weapons system, could be delivered to Ukraine within weeks. Then it will just take a relatively 
 
 short amount of time for experienced tank operators to learn how to use the weapon systems on board, the targeting systems, the thermal imaging.
 
The very sophisticated NATO state-of-the-art equipment on board before they can be deployed. Similarly, with some of the Leopard tanks, they could -- 
 
 they are likely to be here according to German officials inside, up to three months.
 
The American Abrams tanks, though, could be many months away, and now this latest offer of 60 tanks from the Polish inventory, very interesting 
 
 because they will be easier and quicker for the Ukrainians to use because they're based on the 272, they're very much upgraded versions with upgraded 
 
 armor, upgraded targeting systems.
 
But essentially, the same tanks when it comes to driving and using them, as the ones that the Ukrainians use in almost a majority of cases. So they -- 
 
 if they're in the inventory and they're ready to go, could be brought in from Poland pretty quickly. But of course, this is all piecemeal. Richard.
 
QUEST: Sam Kiley, grateful to have you with us tonight, thank you, sir. Russia's propaganda machine is in high gear as the war in Ukraine nears the 
 
 one year mark. President Putin supporters and state media are making a mockery of the weapons from the West. Not everyone is buying it, though as 
 
 Nic Robertson reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): "Toothless cats, battered Abrams", he says. The Russian state media anchor points to a 
 
 huge graphic, alleging flaws in the NATO thanks.
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
His purposeful propaganda playing down risk the Russian troops in Ukraine does seem to be working. "Sending tanks is going to be bad for the 
 
 Americans and Germans", she says. "We're going to win regardless", Sergei(ph) tells us. It's just enlarging the conflict. If we pull out, the 
 
 West will put more pressure on us."
 
But not everyone buys the state TV's hype, Putin has killed off independent media, but not independence of mind. This young film student tells our team 
 
 a friend was drafted and deployed, but has now disappeared. "I'm for peace", she says, "it's very sad". People are dying, I'm on the verge of 
 
 tears here.
 
"I don't know if it's true or not or what's going on in this war." This lady tells us. "But I do know people who have been killed. Some of them, 
 
 are friends." All emotions the Kremlin likes to prey on. Around the capital, air defense systems have been lofted at top government buildings, 
 
 the less than subtle message, Russia is under threat.
 
It's leverage Putin needs to drum up more recruits for the increasingly unpopular meat-grinder, that is Ukraine's frontline trenches. In more prime 
 
 time, Putin's propaganda Yevgeny Popov pops a pun for the audience, tells them the German Leopard 2 tanks will burn very nicely.
 
Another Putin accolade, the insanely popular Vladimir Solovyov, asked the audience, after all this, isn't Berlin a lawful target? Such is the stitch-
 
 up in Russian media. Putin is able to spend almost any message he wants. His TV puppets, serve fuss and fear in equal measure. But even that's not 
 
 going down so well with some.
 
"Everyone is listening to Solovyov's opinion", this lady says, "but it would be good if the experts started expressing their real opinions instead 
 
 of obeying orders from Putin. What's real is anyone's guess." And, for some, that means tuning out. This lady tells us, she doesn't know about the 
 
 tanks when we asked her opinion.
 
"I think that this is a political war and not a war for the people", this lady tells the team. "What are we supposed to do", she says? "Our opinions 
 
 mean diddly-squat." Increasingly isolated from outside views and under threat of harsh retribution if they dissent, Russians are stuck in a rut, 
 
 in a war they don't want with a leader they can't remove, and the threat of potential recruitment around the corner.
 
They're doing what Russians have historically done in the face of adversity -- focusing on their own survival. Nic Robertson, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST: As this Friday continues, I will bring you the latest from Jerusalem, eight people are now believed or known to have died. We'll 
 
 obviously update you with that. And in the U.S., we have the video of last year's attack on the former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. In a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:00:00]
 
QUEST: Allow me to update you on the breaking news. The Israeli police now say that the deadly shooting is at a synagogue in Jerusalem where at least 
 
 seven people were killed and ten have been wounded. We thought it was eight but now it might appear to be seven so far that we know of, which is merely 
 
 an indication of the confusion there currently is because as you will appreciate, this incident has only just happened. And we are still finding 
 
 out the details and what you often learn one moment has to be clarified the next. The authorities do say that the gunman has been neutralized, which 
 
 probably means dead. And it does follow one of the deadliest Israeli raids in the West Bank for some years.
 
Hadas is with me. Hadas is in Jerusalem. I'm just realizing, and what I've just been reading, Hadas, this synagogue line, what -- this is a new 
 
 development, what do we know?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Richard. So in terms of the confusion over the numbers, that may be because the assailant 
 
 has also been shot dead. And so from what we understand, seven victims in this attack, the assailant was shot dead. We are getting information from 
 
 police that this happened in two different locations. The first one was at the synagogue, right? As services were ending Friday evening, Shabbat 
 
 services were ending. That's where the first location took place. There was several dead there.
 
The assailant then, according to police, got into his car, started driving, at one point got out of -- at a junction of some kind, not clear why, 
 
 that's when he was engaged by police and police say that a police officer did shoot him there and that he has been killed. But they do say that they 
 
 are currently scanning the area and trying to find out whether there were more assailants, suspects that they need to be aware of. As you know, 
 
 quickly developing situation. Seven so far killed. There have been several injured including some in serious condition. This all just happened within 
 
 the last hour, fifteen minutes. It's 9:30 right now, local time. This happened right around 8:15. So, not even an hour and fifteen minutes ago, 
 
 like I said, happening during, as you noted a very tense and violent 36 hours or so here.
 
So, while this is a shocking event, shocking attack for people in Jerusalem, for Israelis, it's coming at a time when the tensions have been 
 
 sky-high. And even before this happened, many were concerned, worried that the situation would further spiral out of control. And this seems to be 
 
 sort of that next cascade of events of that spiral.
 
QUEST: It's difficult to know where and how this moves to the next stage other than it's going to be ugly.
 
GOLD: Yes. I mean, listen, this is the first major, major task for this new right-wing government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, who has a lot of 
 
 experience. He's been Prime Minister before for many, many years, but he now has a very right wing coalition government and they are, you know, the 
 
 people who are in charge of the police, these are people who were once considered sort of the fringe politicians. And so it's going to be a major 
 
 test of his government and how they respond. They will respond. The question is, how will they choose to respond to the situation? What will 
 
 that look like? And will it be significantly different than previous Israeli responses to such attacks?
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
I should note, this is one of the biggest attacks that Israelis have seen in recent years, in recent memories, I'd have to go through the data 
 
 points, but, you know, people are immediate to mind is an attack in 2008 that killed eight people. But it's hard to think back in terms of the last 
 
 couple of years of an attack that killed as many people in one single night. And I think for Israelis, especially the fact that this is happening 
 
 on Friday night, on Shabbat, at a synagogue, that is adding an element this whole situation.
 
QUEST: Hadas, it's coming up to just half past 9:00 in Jerusalem. We'll talk more as the hours move on. Thank you.
 
In California, the authorities have released videos showing the attack on Paul Pelosi. Remember, he is the husband of the former speaker, Nancy 
 
 Pelosi. And at the same time, they released audio from police interviews with the alleged attacker called David DePape, as well as the 911, the 
 
 emergency calls. The disturbing body cam footage is -- you're about to see is somewhat troubling. It had been a court exhibit in the criminal case 
 
 against DePape.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POLICE OFFICER: Hey, guys.
 
POLICE OFFICER: Hi. How you doing?
 
POLICE OFFICER: What's going on, man?
 
DAVID DEPAPE, PAUL PELOSI ASSAILANT: Everything's good.
 
POLICE OFFICER: Hi. Drop the hammer.
 
DEPAPE: No.
 
PAUL PELOSI, HUSBAND OF FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
 
POLICE OFFICER: What is going on right now?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not getting any answer on the call.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST: I mean -- well, the video -- I mean, you can see for yourself, because we now know what happened, Pelosi -- Mr. Pelosi, I was attacked 
 
 with a hammer and the assailant had already previously broken in to his home. The -- Paul Pelosi was then in hospital for many days. He suffered 
 
 numerous head injuries, made thankfully a full recovery. The assailant told police he was looking for Pelosi's wife, Nancy Pelosi, who was, of course, 
 
 the speaker of the house at the time.
 
Veronica Miracle is in San Francisco. Gosh, I mean, the suddenness of that attack, when the police told him to drop the hammer, it's quite -- it quite 
 
 takes a bit of watching.
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It's very difficult to watch, Richard. And in the aftermath of that, after the attack, after the 
 
 arrest of David DePape, he had an interview with investigators. It's about a 15-minute-long interview and that has also been released today, which I 
 
 just listened to. And when asked why did you hit him with the hammer after the length of your encounter, because it was quite a long time before David 
 
 DePape eventually hit him and then he did it right in front of police, he said that he was not going to surrender, that he didn't go to this house to 
 
 surrender. He wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage. He admits to all of this. He said that he told David DePape -- or he told rather Paul Pelosi 
 
 that he would go through him if he had to. And so in that moment, he felt that he needed to do that. He also admitted to using full force to hitting 
 
 Paul Pelosi, Richard.
 
QUEST: Is there going to be an allegation or a suggestion of mental incapacity here? And that either he was not in his right mind or otherwise? 
 
 Or is this going to be straightforward, downright criminal?
 
MIRACLE: I think that's a really interesting question, Richard. And certainly, we'll have to see how that plays out in court. But I was very 
 
 taken by the fact that at the beginning of his interview with investigators, they give him his Miranda Rights, they say you have the 
 
 right to remain silent. But he goes on to talk about every single thing that he did, and even talks about his intent. But at the very beginning of 
 
 the conversation, they asked him, what is your phone number, and he couldn't remember his own phone number. So there's some moments where it's 
 
 a little bit confusing, is this man in his right mind? But then the rest of the 15-minute plus long interview, he lays through every single step of 
 
 what he wanted to do, and all of the reasons why he felt that he wanted to go after the Pelosis and other targets, which he admits to go -- wanting to 
 
 go after. So, that's a very good question, Richard, and we'll see how that plays out.
 
QUEST: Thank you. I'm grateful for your time. Thank you.
 
As we continue, Haiti's Prime Minister is said to be in a safe place after protesters attacked his residence.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:42:11]
 
QUEST: An update for you, Israeli police now investigating the shooting at a synagogue in Jerusalem, apparent terrorist attack. Authorities say at 
 
 least seven people have been killed, ten have been wounded. The government has been killed or neutralized, as they say. And the moment I have more 
 
 details, I will, of course, bring them to you.
 
A gunman burst into a foreign embassy in Tehran on Friday and the video of the attack is particularly disturbing. The Iranian man open fire on 
 
 security guards inside the Azerbaijani Embassy. Head of Security was killed and two others were wounded. Iran and Azerbaijan have been at odds for 
 
 years over a number of issues. Azerbaijan says harsh rhetoric from Iran is what led to this attack. Iran says the gunman was upset of the his wife 
 
 disappeared that he believes had visited the embassy before going missing.
 
Haiti's Prime Minister is safe and in an unknown location after protesters stormed his residence. According to Special Advisor now says Ariel Henry 
 
 had to be extracted by Special Forces. The demonstrators were even joined by some police officers, follows gangland killings, and the release of 10 
 
 officers over the last week. Patrick Oppmann is with me to discuss, to put this into context. I mean, essentially there is no law and order in Haiti. 
 
 And the limits of that is clear today by the fact that, again, they can't even keep the Prime Minister safe.
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): No. And, of course, some of the protesters who are accused of trying to assassinate the Prime Minister 
 
 by his own advisers. The fact that some of them were police is really quite troubling even for Haiti, which is in so much turmoil recently, Richard. 
 
 But, you know, to back up, I mean, we have the scene now that took place on Thursday when the Haitian Prime Minister was returning from a conference in 
 
 Argentina and these protesters first attacked his home outside his house, his official residency. And then when they realized he was not there and 
 
 was landing shortly, they went to the airport and surrounded the airport, where he wasn't, if it hadn't been for those special forces taking him out 
 
 of the airport under their protection and evacuating to a place where -- that's not been disclosed to keep him safe, we don't know what would have 
 
 happened.
 
His aides say that they felt that the protesters were going to, essentially, lynch the Prime Minister of the country. Some of them were 
 
 police officers who were understandably very upset that at least 10 officers have died in the past week with clashes with the gangs that are, 
 
 frankly, better organized, and have more resources, and have more firepower than the Haitian police do currently. And these officers are very upset 
 
 that they've been unable to even recover some of the bodies of their slain colleagues.
 <br>[14:45:03]
 
So, the fact that there has been this breakdown to the police, some of the police at least, have turned on their own government, that is very, very 
 
 troubling because already, Richard, a so much of the country is under control of the gangs. It's the government that is losing territory on a 
 
 daily basis.
 
QUEST: Patrick --
 
OPPMANN: And now you have the really unprecedented development now that the Haitian Prime Minister can't even say where he is staying currently.
 
QUEST: OK. How much worse, how much lower, how much more disintegrated, if you will, can this country, this place get?
 
OPPMANN: You know, I talked to aid workers who are on the ground or have left recently because it's not safe to be there anymore and people have 
 
 been playing this really sad game for years of saying it can't get any worse and yet it does. And you just wonder, you know, there've been 
 
 presidents who have been assassinated in recent years. There have been, over the years, Haitian presidents and prime ministers that had to leave in 
 
 the dead of the night because they've been forced out by violence, by gangs, by the political turmoil of this country. And it has really gotten 
 
 to a point that no one ever expected that it would get this bad that it's approaching a failed state, if it's not already.
 
QUEST: Patrick Oppmann in Havana. Thank you, sir. Authorities in Peru say they'll dismantle roadblocks set up nationwide by protesters, and warning 
 
 that blocking highways is a crime punishable by years in jail. The government says at least 10 Peruvians have died because ambulances could 
 
 not get through. And that includes two babies. The anti-government protesters are calling for President Dina Boluarte to resign. And they want 
 
 early elections and a new constitution. Of course, we've covered this greatly on this program.
 
As we continue, a memorial decades in the making. Germany is remembering the LGBT victims of the Nazi regime. It is Holocaust Remembrance Day.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
QUEST: The latest out of Jerusalem, at least seven people are dead after an attack on a synagogue. U.S. State department has described it as horrific, 
 
 the attack. Israeli authorities are saying that the attacker has been neutralized at the scene. Now this attack comes as the world is marking 
 
 Holocaust Remembrance Day, ceremonies worldwide, remembering the horrors of the Holocaust and paying tribute and that, of course, includes the German 
 
 parliament.
 <br>[14:50:04]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BAERBEL BAS, GERMAN PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT (through translator): No one must turn a blind eye. Exactly one year ago, I said here anti-Semitism is in our 
 
 middle. I stand by my statement, anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia are certainly not just present at the very edge.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST: For the first time, the parliament officially commemorated the LGBTQ victims, who were persecuted during the Nazi regime. To get this move has 
 
 been decades in the making. Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of men and women were deported to concentration camps because of 
 
 their sexuality, usually under another pretext. Germany's Lesbian and Gay Association welcomed Friday's ceremony, calling it an important symbol of 
 
 recognition for the victims.
 
Now I've made no secret of it, of course, I'm gay myself. And so talking about this and moments of recognition in the LGBT community is important, 
 
 which is worth remembering. Sixty-seven countries still criminalize same sex activity. You can see them on the map there, mainly in Africa and over 
 
 towards the Eastern down into some parts of Southeast Asia. The death penalty is still on the books in some and is even being invoked in certain 
 
 countries, Iran for instance. It's also worth reminding ourselves, there has been much change in recent years, countries such as Barbados and Angola 
 
 have decriminalized same sex relations.
 
Others like Cuba, Slovenia, and Slovakia -- Slovenia and Switzerland, I beg your pardon, have expanded laws now legalize same sex marriage, either by 
 
 government or the courts have done it for them. The Vice President of the GLAAD Media Institute is Ross Murray. He is with me now. And Ross, progress 
 
 has been made. And I guess the core of this is the decriminalization action that is, in a way, the first step that many countries take.
 
ROSS MURRAY, VICE PRESIDENT, GLAAD MEDIA INSTITUTE: It really is. And thank you for inviting me here because this is a really important topic, both to 
 
 recognize how important it is to discuss the LGBTQ history and the things that we've been able to overcome, and then recognize where we are today for 
 
 progress. But you're absolutely right, the decriminalization piece is one of the most basic fundamental human rights to not put people in jail, or in 
 
 some cases execute them for their lives, for their relationships.
 
And I think it's been really helpful to see if there's been a week of momentum in that. This action from the German parliament, Pope Francis's 
 
 statements condemning laws that criminalize LGBTQ people, and even several conversations and actions happening at the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
 
 including lighting up the promenade in rainbow colors between Accenture and GLAAD and a lot of partners in the partnership for global LGBTI equality.
 
QUEST: Ross --
 
MURRAY: And so we can see where we've come from and where we're going.
 
QUEST: OK. But I guess there's a vast line between sort of adoption, same sex marriage, marriage equality, and all the things that might be 
 
 aspirational, to the very basic and core, which is at least don't criminalize what you're doing behind your own front door.
 
MURRAY: Yes, I think always remembering that, you know, in that kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, there is a need for basic security and safety 
 
 so that people can be able to live. And we don't stop there, right? We keep working so that people can continue to live full lives that will be forming 
 
 families, children learning, teaching, and I think it's a lesson that we continually have to revisit.
 
QUEST: I refuse to end a Friday night program on a down note. So I turn to you and say there is progress and it is going in the right direction, 
 
 albeit not at fast enough speed.
 
MURRAY: I mean, yes. So this is something -- the action here that's come from the German parliament, from Pope Francis, from others, these are 
 
 things that we can learn from and it's always about building that momentum, right? And so it is something that we can learn in the United States, here, 
 
 and many states. It's places that governments and leaders in other countries can look at and examine, and to see that if such diverse 
 
 countries, as Singapore and Barbados and Angola, can take steps to secure the freedom for LGBTQ people, that it can be done anywhere. And I think we 
 
 can always take heart in that action and say we see someone else doing something, and we can match that as well. That's always my hope.
 
QUEST: Good to see you. Ross Murray. Thank you, sir. Have a good weekend. I'm very grateful to you.
 
MURRAY: Thank you.
 
QUEST: Now before I leave you tonight, turning to the quote of the day.
 <br>[14:55:02]
 
In the United States, there's been much a hooha about drag. Those who dress up and perform drag, there are now numerous rules and regulations and new 
 
 laws preventing drag in schools, and preventing this, that, and the other. Those who are against it are seemingly on the march. So, when it comes to 
 
 doing drag, and I'll freely confess, I've not done it, although I did once, in one program, wear high-heeled shoes, which nearly killed my ankles and 
 
 ripped my shins for days to come, in that message, tonight's quote of the day, steps to create expression, bring back the famous RuPaul quote, "When 
 
 at all -- we're all born naked, and after that, the rest is drag."
 
I'm very grateful that you joined us tonight. Thank you for watching. Stay with CNN. I will have "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS," which will have very little 
 
 to do with drag. Well, at least not at the moment in just a moment.
