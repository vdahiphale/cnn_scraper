JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Hello, we're breaking away from our partners at CNN U.S. I'm Julia Chatterley in New York. We're going 
 
 to have much more on the breaking news from Israel that hostage negotiation update. For now though, we're going to take a short break. You're watching 
 
 CNN, stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: You're watching "Connect the World". Let's return to the breaking news now from the Middle East. There's word of a deal to free 50 
 
 of the hostages taken by Hamas during the October 7th attack on Israel. That deal could be announced in the coming hours.
 
Sources tell us there are still some things to be worked out, but an agreement is getting closer. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just 
 
 a short time ago saying they are making progress. And he hopes for "Good News" soon. His office source say the government is meeting over the next 
 
 few hours to discuss the deal.
 
Now for the families, this has been an emotional roller coaster. If the deal comes to fruition one of the hostages who could be released is a 
 
 three-year-old American Abigail Idan. CNN talked with her great aunt just a short while ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIZ HERSH, GREAT AUNT OF THREE-YEAR-OLD HOSTAGE: We can't get our hopes up in a way that just believes that it's going to happen right in the next 
 
 couple of hours. But you know, when I think about that on Friday is Abigail's fourth birthday, and that she should be home with her family and 
 
 with her sister and brother. And she isn't right now. It's just it's that if you get your emotions, you have to keep them in check.
 
Because if not, and you think about nine-month-old children, little girls, little boys, mothers and you just hope that there's somebody holding these 
 
 little children.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: And we'll get to our Becky Anderson who's on the ground in Doha, Qatar a key player of course, in these negotiations in the next few 
 
 moments. Plus, in the next hour on "Connect the World" we'll talk to Udi Goran whose cousin is one of the Hamas hostages. We'll ask him what he 
 
 thinks about the potential deal announcement too.
 
Now for now, let's take a look at some of the other headlines around the Israel Hamas war. More than two dozen newborn babies evacuated from the war 
 
 torn Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza and now being cared for in Egypt. At last check, many were listed in critical condition and fighting for their lives. 
 
 Eleni Giokos recounts the dangerous journey to Egypt.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We yell to safety as they make their way from chaos to come, finally in Egypt, a race against time to 
 
 get them out, but a delicate process to move them, the journey to bring them here long and arduous.
 
Cries for help from the world's tiniest victims, their first stop is the Al Hilal Al- Emirates Hospital in Rafah. 28 babies made the grueling journey 
 
 from Gaza. Their condition doctors say delicate and difficult.
 
DR. MOHAMMAD SALAMAH, AL-HILAL AL-EMIRATI MATERNITY HOSPITAL: We are conducting tests on all of those babies and they were given fluids and 
 
 needed medication according to their condition. For now they are in a difficult stable condition where this condition might deteriorate.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Now the W.H.O says many of them are in critical condition and all are fighting infections. They've injured life threatening 
 
 ordeals trapped inside Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City as the war raged around the hospital complex last week. Al-Shifa ran out of oxygen, clean 
 
 water and fuel.
 
Moved by hand and laid on these beds, no incubators, and place next to hot water bottles to stay warm. Doctors say five of the babies didn't make it, 
 
 conditions too harsh for such vulnerable patients.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
But ultimately, it was the war in and around Al-Shifa that made their evacuation complex and dangerous. The Egyptians waiting for over a week at 
 
 the border, disappointed day after day, knowing that every minute countered, but the decision out of their hands to get these babies to 
 
 safety. For this father after weeks of living in fear after being separated with his son finally reunited.
 
ALI SBEITI, SON BORN 3 DAYS BEFORE THE WAR: Thank God, we now feel that our son is safe after not seeing him for more than two weeks. We didn't know 
 
 whether he was dead or alive.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Only four mothers and six nurses accompanied the 28 babies. Lubna El-Seik describes her nightmare.
 
LUBNA EL-SEIK, MOTHER OF TRANSPORTED BABY: During the siege, there was no milk, her condition worsened. She went back to zero, and she relied solely 
 
 on artificial oxygen.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): As for the others, it is unknown where their parents and family are or if they still alive. Now in the hands of Egyptians, they 
 
 live so fragile, the future forever defined by this wall. Eleni Giokos, CNN, Cairo.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: And a global Association of Writers is "Deeply concerned over the reported arrest of a Palestinian poet by Israeli forces". Mosab Abu 
 
 Toha had been contributing to the New Yorker with reflections on his life inside Gaza. PEN International wrote on X formerly known as Twitter that it 
 
 is demanding to know his whereabouts and the reasons for his detention.
 
Mosab's brother Hamza said the army took him at a checkpoint as he was traveling from the north of Gaza to the south. CNN has reached out to the 
 
 IDF for response. The IDF says it's checking on the report. Joining us now to talk about the arrest is Nada Bashir.
 
Nada, as I mentioned there, The New Yorker if a regular readers of that will recognize his name. And one of the essays that was very poignant to me 
 
 the agony of waiting for a ceasefire that never comes. He and his family were in the Jabalya refugee camp for a long while. What more do we know 
 
 about his potential whereabouts?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: There are so many questions around his potential whereabouts, the circumstances he is facing under the tension by the 
 
 Israeli military. And of course, this is a rioter who was deeply revered particularly amongst the Palestinian community for his reflections and 
 
 poetry on life inside the Gaza Strip, both under blockade but also during wartime.
 
And he had written about his experiences not of his family living under this ongoing war. As you mentioned that his family had taken shelter at the 
 
 Jabalya refugee camp in Northern Gaza, which before fleeing southwards, but they had originally come from the neighborhood of --
 
And in fact, this -- wrote about returning to his home to see the destruction wars by this ongoing war around his town. Things that his 
 
 children were used to the shops, the local neighborhood, the destruction, local areas filled with rubble. And so of course, this is somebody who has 
 
 very eloquently carefully and sneeringly (ph) told the stories of those inside the Gaza strip facing this ongoing war.
 
Now there is mounting concern, as you mentioned, from the Writers Association, and of course from his family, over the situation he faces as 
 
 we understand it, according to Mosab Abu Toha's brother. He was detained in southern Gaza while passing a checkpoint.
 
He, his wife and children were attempting to cross southwards, his wife and children -- have made it into southern Gaza. But he was, of course 
 
 detained. And his brother has been writing on the situation saying that the family had been attempting to reach the Rafah border crossing that they 
 
 had, in fact, were notified by the U.S. Embassy that they would be able to cross into Egypt via this border crossing.
 
CNN has reached out to the U.S. State Department but no comment or no further details shared by the State Department on that. And of course, we 
 
 have reached out to the Israeli military as well for comment, but no response just yet. But there is a huge amount of concern.
 
And I can read you just a bit of his last post on Facebook, which was shared about five days ago where he spoke about the situation that he and 
 
 his family like many Palestinians in Gaza were facing. He said that he was alive and begged for an end to the bloodshed, saying thank you for your 
 
 prayers. We don't have any access to food or clean water.
 
Winter is coming and we don't have enough clothes, kids are suffering, we are suffering. Now, of course, moving southwards is something that hundreds 
 
 of thousands of Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip have been told to do by the Israeli military. We have seen at mass exodus of Palestinians 
 
 desperately searching for safety.
 
But as you heard there, in his last message on Facebook, the situation facing those who have now moved southwards who have been internally 
 
 displaced. It's also extremely difficult particularly as temperatures begin to drop. We've been hearing the warnings from U.N. agencies that the 
 
 situation is deteriorating that many living in these temporary ten cities are facing unlivable circumstances, Julia?
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Nada Bashir, thank you for that report for now. And we also have some news just in from the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has launched 
 
 what it claims is the military reconnaissance satellite southwards. That's according to the South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 
This will be Pyongyang's third attempt to place a spy satellite in orbit this year. Japan issued an emergency warning in response to the launch 
 
 telling residents in Southern Japan to take cover. We'll have much more on this story and the breaking news of course out of the Middle East as well 
 
 after this short break, stay with CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back. I'm Julia Chatterley in New York filling in for my colleague, Becky Anderson. And we've got a lot happening this hour, two 
 
 breaking news stories. We're hearing words that a deal to free 50 of the hostages being held by Hamas could be announced as early as today.
 
And for now, we also want to get back to the breaking news from North Korea Pyongyang launchings of an alleged spy satellite. Let's bring in Paula 
 
 Hancocks from Seoul, South Korea for us. Paula, this would be third time lucky if they succeed. There were two failed attempts, I believe in May in 
 
 August of this year. What more do we know about this launch?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Julia, what we've heard at this point is from the Joint Chiefs of Staff here in Seoul, saying that North 
 
 Korea claims that it has launched a military reconnaissance satellite. We've also heard from the Japanese side as well. They say they had 
 
 originally launched a ballistic missile then said that they believed it was a man-made satellite.
 
There were emergency alerts that went out as well in the southern Japanese island of Okinawa and telling people to either evacuate to a building or 
 
 underground. So at this point, we don't know whether it has been a successful launch. We don't have any more details than this.
 
But as you say, it is the third attempt that North Korea has made. Back in May, they say that their attempt failed on the second stage. Through state 
 
 run media they were quite transparent about the faults they believed they had in these efforts to launch this satellite into space.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
And then in August, they tried once again and said in the third stage of the rocket, it failed. Now, of course, the concern at this point from Seoul 
 
 and also from Washington is that they may have had help from Russia. We did see back in September, Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader meet with 
 
 Vladimir Putin, at the Cosmodrone Space Center in Russia itself.
 
And we did hear from Vladimir Putin that he was willing to help Kim Jong-Un with his space ambitions. We've also heard from North Korea, that they 
 
 believe that this is a legitimate aim for them to have; they believe that it is their sovereign right to be able to work to put a satellite into 
 
 space.
 
Of course, what we have heard from the U.S. side as well is that the technology used to put the satellite into space is very similar to an 
 
 intercontinental ballistic missile technology, which is banned by numerous United Nations resolutions. Then North Korea had given a window to Japan's 
 
 Coast Guard for when they would carry out this third attempt.
 
It was from November 22 to December 1st. They actually launched it if that's what this was a couple of hours earlier than that. But we're now 
 
 just waiting for any kind of indication as to whether or not this was successful. And of course, whether or not there could be any indication 
 
 that there was Russian help with it.
 
We heard from South Korea's Defense Minister saying that they believed North Korea had almost resolved its engine issues, "With Russia's help", 
 
 Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, fascinating point there. With regards to potential Russian support to achieve this, we'll see what the outcome is. For now, Paula 
 
 Hancocks from Seoul there, thank you. Now the Israeli government will be holding a series of meetings over the coming hours. This as we hear word 
 
 that a deal to free 50 of the hostage is being held by Hamas could be announced as early as today.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a short time ago said they are making progress. And he's hoping for "Good news". Yesterday Hamas's Leader 
 
 Ismail Haniyeh said a truce agreement was close. The U.S. is also sounding cautiously upbeat.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: We are laser focused on the American citizens that we know 
 
 we're being held hostage and we want them out all of them. Everybody should be out now. But here we are in a negotiation. And we're getting closer to 
 
 the end. We believe of that negotiation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: And these talks are being mediated by Qatar, of course. And Becky Anderson is in Doha tonight for us, Becky, great to have you with us. 
 
 I think you and I would agree that until the moment those hostages are released, and are safe and sound and back with their families.
 
We're going to be very cautious, cautiously optimistic, we hope. But just the fact that the Israelis now were talking about scheduling a war cabinet, 
 
 a security cabinet, at least suggest that we can at this moment say we're closer than we've ever been in this process.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST: That's right. And Majed Al Ansari, who is the Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here in Doha and it's been 
 
 Doha, who has been mediating these talks between Israel and Hamas held a press conference slightly earlier today. And I'll quote him in what he 
 
 said.
 
He said, a truce agreement in the Gaza Strip, "Has reached a final stage". He said this is the closest point going beyond the core issues. And that 
 
 "What remains are limited issues". That was held some hours ago that press conference here in Qatar. Diplomatic sources, telling me, diplomatic 
 
 sources who are very close to the talks telling me now that Qatar does hope to announce a truce agreement in the coming hours.
 
The expectations are that that truce agreement as it is being described in the Gaza strip will allow for and includes the release, over a four day 
 
 pause period, a pause in the fighting, a pause in the ground offensive by the Israelis and periods of time, where they will not be flying drones in 
 
 the air.
 
Over four days that will allow for the release of some 50 hostages included in that number and this is the first phase as we understand it, of a number 
 
 of releases. But this first phase includes 50 women, children, and possibly some foreigners.
 
So we're talking about women, children, and some foreigners being held by Hamas in Gaza. The numbers of those and how that is split up is not clear 
 
 at present. There has always been a priority in these talks to get the women, children and the elderly; I have to say out of Gaza.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
These are civilian hostages. These are not soldiers. These are not Israeli soldiers, as we understand the terms of the deal to be. And these are not 
 
 individuals who will be of reservist age, whether they were actually serving in the IDF or not.
 
So there is a split here between civilian hostages who are now it seems part of a deal those being held by Hamas, to be released in a series of 
 
 phases and in a series of groups within those phases. And that could start as early as tomorrow morning if this deal is struck today and if that 
 
 announcement is made later tonight, Doha time.
 
I think the wording is really important here Hamas and the mediators in Doha describing this as a truce, not a ceasefire. Israel has always said 
 
 that it will not call a ceasefire; it will not stop its actions in Israel until all hostages are released. Hamas said until they get a ceasefire, 
 
 they will not release or hostages.
 
So we're talking about a truce, a pause in hostilities over a four day period to allow for the release of some of these hostages. Let's remind 
 
 ourselves, 240 hostages, there are thereabouts being held in Gaza at present, not all of them are being held by Hamas.
 
And this has been, as we understand it part of the negotiations that Hamas actually doesn't hold nor know where some of those or many of those 
 
 hostages are on the pause in hostilities should allow them to actually get out and be able to identify for the Israelis, where these other hostages 
 
 are and who they are.
 
There is also a key part of this, which is quite a contentious part of this deal according to multiple sources. For every hostage held in Gaza who is 
 
 released, there will be three Palestinian women or teenagers held in Israeli prisons. Now as we understand it from the Palestinian prisoners 
 
 group, there are some 380 or so teenagers, children under the age of 18 being held in Palestinian prisons, and some 80 women.
 
So this deal as we understand it includes the release of three Palestinians for every one hostage being held in Gaza. Of course, let's just be clear 
 
 about that not all of those hostages being held in Gaza are Israelis. There are many foreigners; there are Israelis with dual citizenship. Some are 
 
 American Israelis, for example.
 
And we also of course know that there are women, children and the elderly being held. But look, I think what's really clear at this point is that 
 
 these week, this has been weeks of negotiations, I've been in touch with diplomatic sources very close to these talks now, for weeks back on October 
 
 the 27th.
 
The parameters of this deal, as I understood it, according to diplomatic sources were very close to what we are seeing now. But mediators told me, 
 
 you know, somewhat, three, four weeks ago that they needed the pause in hostilities, a calm period to try and get these negotiations back on track.
 
And that didn't happen because the Israelis had sort of ramped up their efforts. They had said very clearly that they believed the Israelis 
 
 believed it would be the pressure from this, you know, assault on Gaza, the assault on Hamas that would eventually get the release of these hostages. 
 
 That was the Israeli side mediators.
 
They were told me at the time when this assault had upticks, as it were, that it was really important that they got a period of calm. That is what 
 
 it looks like they are getting. That is what appears to have been now agreed in what is a truce, which I mean, would be quite clear, but it has 
 
 not been announced yet.
 
The deal is not a done deal until it's a done deal, as you rightly pointed out, Julia at the beginning of this. But there are some real hopes and real 
 
 confidence at this point that an announcement is now imminent in the coming hours, 50 hostages to be released over a period of days forthcoming, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, vitally important context, Becky. And I think the word that you use most there was if. So many elements here have to come together 
 
 in order to get this deal through and agreed and get those hostages released. So we'll, we'll curb our enthusiasm and the growing optimism.
 
But as you I think, and I agree, closer than we've ever been, fingers crossed for now. Becky Anderson in Doha, we'll let you get back to 
 
 continuing your vital news gathering efforts. Thank you.
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
OK, the dangerous work of covering the war between Israel and Hamas has been deadly for many reporters. At least 50 journalists and media workers 
 
 have been killed since the conflict started. According to a report from the Committee to protect Journalists, the organization calls that figure a grim 
 
 milestone and says it far exceeds the 15 journalists who have been killed covering Russia's war on Ukraine.
 
And since that report was released, CNN has learned that at least two more journalists have been killed in southern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese 
 
 media. For more on this, let's bring in Ben Wedeman who's in Beirut for us. I was looking at the report Ben, 45 Palestinian journalists, four Israelis 
 
 and one Lebanese in that report. And now it seems the Lebanese can add a couple more tragically.
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, these were two journalists working for Al-Mayadeen, which is a Beirut-based Arabic 
 
 Satellite Channel. They were Farah Omar, and Rabih Al-Me'mari. Farah was a Correspondent, a Reporter, Rabih was a Cameraman. They were killed in an 
 
 Israeli strike outside the town of Teir Harfa, which is very close to the border with Israel.
 
Now, Al-Mayadeen came out with a statement saying that this was direct deliberate targeting by Israel. CNN has gotten in touch with these rarely 
 
 military to see if they have any comment, clarifications why these journalists were targeted and killed. But as is often the case, the Israeli 
 
 military doesn't get back to us very quickly.
 
Now regarding the CPJ report, in addition to the death toll they're talking about, they say 11 journalists have been injured since the beginning of 
 
 this war on the 7th of October, three are missing, and 18 have been arrested. This is as they point out, by far the bloodiest conflict for 
 
 journalists in recent history.
 
I mean, let's see, this is only since the 7th of October, basically, at least one journalist is being killed a day and the vast majority of them 
 
 are in Gaza. And it's not just the journalists themselves who are being killed in Gaza. It's many of the family members of these journalists as 
 
 well.
 
So yes, this is a grim report and it certainly does set a horrendous record when it comes to our profession, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, thoughts and prayers with all those lost involved and their families too and beyond. Ben Wedeman, thank you for that. We'll be 
 
 back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
CHATTERELY: And welcome back to "Connect the World". Global investors continue to follow the latest developments and the ongoing drama at 
 
 Artificial Intelligence firm OpenAI. Report say talks continue to get CEO Sam Altman rehired at the firm after his sudden ouster on Friday.
 
A majority of OpenAI employees sent a letter to the company's board on Monday threatening to resign unless Altman comes back. And Board Members 
 
 themselves that fired him resign. Report say top OpenAI Investors are also pushing to get Altman back.
 
Microsoft, which owns a sizable portion of OpenAI, has announced that they will hire Altman to head up a new AI development unit. But it hints it's 
 
 open to Altman keeping his old job with conditions. Microsoft stock hit a record high on the news on Monday. Anna Stewart joins me now.
 
And of course the CEO, Satya Nadella as well is sort of caught up in the mix of this and was talking to journalists as well, during Monday's 
 
 session. And was sort of open to options, either we'd get them in house for free, or everyone just goes back to where they were a week ago I mean, what 
 
 a joke.
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: He seems fairly relaxed about it, doesn't he? Satya Nadella did a series of interviews. And a few points became really 
 
 clear in all of them. One, that Microsoft which is you know, the biggest partner biggest investor of OpenAI was not informed by the Board that they 
 
 were planning to fire its CEO Sam Altman.
 
That going forward is Microsoft definitely wants some sort of governance going forwards with their partnership, whether that is a seat at the Board, 
 
 or some observation position with the Board, that they have indicated that they will continue to work with. And I quote from Nadella, whoever is left 
 
 at OpenAI; they are committed to that partnership.
 
But they will also work with Sam Altman, whether that's from within Microsoft or from outside, Julia. And also Nadella is very keen to point 
 
 out to people that he's worried that people are getting the wrong end of the stick here. He says OpenAI is a value partnership. It means a lot to 
 
 them. But he says it is not consequential for the future of Microsoft.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, whoever's left to OpenAI, OpenAI whether they end up legging it over to Microsoft with Sam Altman, or Sam Altman goes back and 
 
 then they end up back there? Wow, Anna, no words, words counting, but I agree with you.
 
I think the point is Microsoft ends up on the Board in some manner because some grown up is required in the room. We have to leave it there. 
 
 Unfortunately, you and I could carry on for another 10 minutes on this. Anna Stewart, thank you for that.
 
All right, next more news from the world of tech, Elon Musk on the defensive as major advertisers pull a spending on X. Musk's latest legal 
 
 salvo, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: And welcome back to "Connect the World". Elon Musk, the owner of social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter is suing the 
 
 progressive watchdog group "Media Matters" for its role in getting major corporations to pause their advertising spending on X.
 
Media Matters says in a report that X had been placing ads next to pro- Nazi anti-Semitic content on the platform, a claim that X itself strongly 
 
 denies. It says Media Matters manipulated images to show ads next to the harmful context content.
 
The ex-CEO Linda Yaccarino saying in a post on the platform "Here's the truth, not a single authentic user on X saw IBM's Comcast or articles ads, 
 
 next to the content in the Media Matters article. Only two users saw Apple's ads next to the content, at least one of which was Media Matters".
 
Now Media Matters says it stands by its reporting. Now this controversy doesn't even end there. Musk is now being criticized for commenting on an 
 
 X-post on Monday that links the Head of Media Matters with the roundly debunked pizza gate conspiracy of a few years ago. Do you remember it?
 
While it was a conspiracy that alleged back in 2016, the Democratic Party officials were behind a child sex ring. Elon, you've got more important 
 
 things to do. That's my comment on this. Thanks for watching this hour. Don't go anywhere, we're going to continue to monitor events in Israel and 
 
 Gaza, stay with CNN.
