ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN London, this is CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Welcome to the second hour of the show today from London. I'm Becky Anderson. Global leaders warn of further 
 
 escalation in the Middle East after a deadly attack in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
 
Investigations around former President Trump's assassination attempt continue as more details emerge over security failures.
 
And new polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris is growing favorability just a week after her campaign launch.
 
Begin this hour with more details on the breaking news that we first told you about last hour. The ambulance service in northwest England says eight 
 
 patients are now being treated for stab injuries. Some have been transferred to a children's hospital. This is happening in the town of 
 
 Southport. Anna Stewart back with us with some new information. Anna?
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Well, the latest from the Children's Hospital is that they've had to declare a major emergency which does suggest that 
 
 more patients have arrived and they're urging patients not to bring their children there unless they absolutely have to at this stage. We know of 
 
 course that there were eight patients taken by ambulance that included a couple of air ambulances, I believe.
 
And this was a major stabbing in a seaside town in the northwest of England called Southport outside of Liverpool. It happened at 10 -- sorry, 11:50 
 
 a.m. this morning. That's when reports were first made to police of a stabbing incident. We know that one man has been arrested at this stage. A 
 
 knife was seized and there is no wider risk to the public at this stage. We do have more information on who was arrested, we're likely going to get 
 
 that more information if and when they are charged.
 
We have had their response at this stage from the Prime Minister Keir Starmer peel on X has posted to say horrendous and deeply shocking news 
 
 emerging from Southport. My thoughts are with those affected. I would like to thank the police and emergency services for their swift response. I am 
 
 being kept updated as the situation develops. So, a really major incident here in the U.K.
 
ANDERSON: Just some three hours ago when it was first reported, as we said last hour and for the benefit of our viewers who may not live in the U.K. 
 
 This of course is the pretty much the first day of the school holidays for many students, youngsters here in the U.K. And Keir Starmer clearly being 
 
 kept abreast of this and he will be well aware of course of the -- of the knife incidents in the U.K. and the Labor Party will have a policy on that 
 
 going forward of course.
 
STEWART: It is something that the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has spoken on -- actually a number of times in campaigning as a shadow opposition 
 
 member in Parliament. Stabbing is a really big problem in the U.K. There were 21,736 incidents of knife assault in England and Wales last year. It 
 
 accounts or at least it did last year for about 46 percent of all homicide. So, it's a really key issue.
 
It's a particular problem for the youth, particularly for teenagers. And in this case, it appears to be children as well.
 
ANDERSON: Anna, it's good to have you. I know you are working your sources. So more on that, of course as we get it. Thank you.
 
Well, let's get you to a region now seemingly bubbling towards boiling point. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Israeli-
 
 occupied Golan Heights on Monday, vowing that his country's response to Saturday's deadly rocket attack there will "be severe." Israel blames 
 
 Hezbollah for the attack which the Lebanese militant group is denying. Now it comes as Lebanese state media reports that two people were killed in a 
 
 double drone strike in southern Lebanon on Sunday.
 
And three were wounded including a child. CNN's Jeremy Diamond was at the scene of that strike just after it happened right now. He joins us from 
 
 Haifa, in Israel, Jeremy.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Becky, the Israeli Prime Minister vowing that there will be a severe response as he visited this 
 
 shaken community of Majdal Shams where the Israeli prime minister expressed his sympathy and shock at what happened. We should know that he was 
 
 actually heckled by many of the community members as he made his visit. So, clearly not welcomed by some there.
 
But what we did find in Majdal Shams as we spent a couple of days there was a community that is still very much shocked in disbelief trying to process 
 
 the horrors of what happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
DIAMOND (voiceover): Sirens pierced the serenity of this town in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. And in an instance, this explosion will 
 
 shatter the very soul of the Druze community that lives here. As residents and first responders rushed to the scene, the horror of this strike becomes 
 
 clear. Soccer field, children's bikes, pools of blood between them. 12 Children, the youngest just 10 years old, torn from this life.
 
It is the deadliest attack on civilians in Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since October 7th, according to Israeli officials. Israel says 
 
 Hezbollah which has frequently targeted the Golan Heights before is behind the attack. Hezbollah denies responsibility.
 
DIAMOND (on camera): It was 6:00 p.m. on a hot summer evening, dozens of children are playing on this soccer field right behind me when suddenly 
 
 sirens rang out. Seconds later, a rocket made impact just right here we're in its place now stands this black flag of mourning. But one of the most 
 
 devastating parts of all of this, as you see this scene, frozen in time, is the fact that right behind us was safety, a bomb shelter, but there simply 
 
 was not enough time for these children to get inside.
 
DIAMOND (voiceover): Taymor Willie was looking out his window when the rocket struck and rushed to the scene. We found him that night hours later, 
 
 still trying to make sense of it all. 
 
TAYMOR WILL, WITNESSED ROCKET STRIKE: Well, at first, I saw the injured, injured children running around I saw blood. They didn't respond to us. 
 
 They were panicking. I saw a lot of guys gathering here. Most of them didn't go down. I went down here. And I saw a lot of things that are way 
 
 too gruesome to mention out of respect for the families. And we tried to help but it was beyond our help. There is nothing we can do.
 
DIAMOND (voiceover): In Majdal Shams morning is all that remains. Thousands gathered here to pay their final respects. The sight of each casket brings 
 
 with it another wave of cries in Wales. As nightmares turn into crushing reality are. Photos of smiling children like 11-year-old Alma can only mean 
 
 one thing.
 
AYMAN FAKHR EL-DIN, DAUGHTER KILLED IN ATTACK (through translator): I reached the stadium and in the corner, I saw dead bodies and body parts. 
 
 When I got closer to one of them. I saw a bracelet. I knew it was Alma.
 
DIAMOND (voiceover): Ayman Fakhr El-Din is only just beginning to process the love of his only daughter.
 
DIAMOND (on camera): She liked soccer, huh? Yes?
 
EL-DIN: Yes. Like sport, all sport and basketball.
 
DIAMOND (on camera): And she played and she was good?
 
El-DIN: Yes, good. Yes, yes.
 
DIAMOND (on camera): Yes?
 
EL-DIN (through translator): Alma is a child filled with energy. She loved life. She was special in school and in athletics. Rayyan come sit next to 
 
 me.
 
DIAMOND (voiceover): He now calls on his son Rayyan for comfort.
 
DIAMOND (on camera): Her big brother. But Rayyan's grief is all too fresh.
 
Rayyan, what do you remember about your sister and what do you want people to know about your sister?
 
EL-DIN (through translator): She like to play just like any other kid. In the end, we have a room without Alma.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DIAMOND: And Ayman told us that he holds Hezbollah directly responsible for the death of his daughter. He said that Hezbollah for sure carried out this 
 
 attack. He said my enemy is Hezbollah. They killed my daughter. Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Jeremy, good to have you. Thank you.
 
Well, Elliott Gotkine joins me here in the studio. Elliott, you've been monitoring what's being said by both sides at this point. Hezbollah is 
 
 still denying they were responsible for this attack. The Israelis have said they absolutely are. Let's hear from the defense minister.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOAV GALLANT, ISRAEL DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): I moved to the army's Northern Command to see the response plans. This is Hezbollah we are 
 
 talking about. Iran's proxy in the region. Hezbollah will not be cleared of this event, despite its ridiculous denials. It committed the shooting and 
 
 it will bear a heavy price for its actions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That's the defense minister. We've also heard from the Prime Minister who returned from Washington in the wake of this attack on Sunday. 
 
 What's he said and what can we expect next?
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Netanyahu returning early from his trip to Washington. He was actually in Majdal Shams earlier today.
 <br>[10:10:02]
 
It wasn't universally welcomed, as Jeremy was noting. He was heckled by some of the people there. And what he said and this, I think, is the key 
 
 thing that he said. He said, these children are our children. They are the children of us all, the State of Israel will not and cannot ignore this. 
 
 Our response will come and it will be severe. And yet at the same time, as we've been hearing from Ben, Ben Wedeman in Beirut, we heard from the 
 
 Lebanese foreign minister saying that he had received assurances from international actors wouldn't say who they were.
 
That the response was going to -- it was going to be a limited response and that it wouldn't lead to all-out war. But I think as President Biden's 
 
 special envoy has said in the past, he said this on a webinar in May, which I was watching over the weekend, he said wars have started historically, 
 
 around the world, even when leaders didn't want them because they had no choice. And just as Israel is saying this was a mistake by Hezbollah.
 
In other words, Hezbollah was aiming they think, for military, watchtowers and the like on Mount Hermon nearby and that it fell short. And that's why 
 
 it slammed into this football pitch killing those 12 children. It's always possible that Israel's response however, while it tries to calibrate it may 
 
 have unintended consequences.
 
ANDERSON: It does seem clear that whatever its response, and we're talking about a slightly wider response, perhaps at this stage, because we've seen 
 
 some activity across the border, although I think you and others have suggested that that's maybe just part of the incrementals that we see. 
 
 Whether or not we've seen, you know, the response as of yet, it does seem as if Israel is -- Washington has got Israel's back. Have a listen to what 
 
 Antony Blinken had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: There is no justification for terrorism period. And every indication is that, indeed, the rockets 
 
 were from or the rocket was from Hezbollah. We stand by Israel's right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: As Antony Blinken, again, the suggestion there that Israel has -- that Washington has Israel's back. This, of course, is not unrelated to 
 
 Gaza. If we got a deal this week, and this was the week where many had hoped, at least that these talks would be up and running once again, in 
 
 Rome, this time. If we got a deal the suggestion is that this conflict in its entirety, might calm down. What chance at this point?
 
GOTKINE: Look, I mean, if you have your glass half full, then you could look at what's going on right now. And think, look, there's still a war 
 
 going on in Gaza. Israel and Hamas are still at war more than nine months later, almost 10 months later. So, Israel from a practical perspective, 
 
 probably wouldn't really choose to stretch itself even more. And so, as a result of that, as I say, if your glass is half full, this could 
 
 concentrate minds more, perhaps encourage Israel to do a deal with Hamas that sees the -- as we've been talking over the last few weeks or six weeks 
 
 ceasefire, release of a number of hostages, release of a certain number of Palestinian prisoners and various other -- various other elements.
 
And then at the same time, that would therefore allow for calm there, that would probably cause calm on the border with Hezbollah, at least Hezbollah 
 
 would stop firing because Hezbollah started firing on Israel, a day after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks, which is why that has been simmering for 
 
 all this time, as well. But that would really just be a short-term fix because you're talking about more than 60,000 Israelis who have been 
 
 displaced from their communities in the north, many villages kibbutzim and towns or ghost towns.
 
Similar picture I should say on the southern border of Lebanon. And they do not want to go back to their homes, even if there is quiet in the knowledge 
 
 that Hezbollah is just over the other side of the border. Now you'll recall that back in 2006, I think U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 called 
 
 Freedom Demilitarization, south of the Litani River. Now, depending where you take, it's about 12 to 15 kilometers a swathe of southern Lebanon.
 
And Hezbollah is clearly in breach of that. So, Israel has said in the past, and we've heard it from Yoav Gallant in the past. This was back in 
 
 December. Yoav Gallant, the defense minister saying if the world doesn't get Hezbollah away from the border, Israel will do it. Now in the short 
 
 term that might not be possible and in the short term quiet on the border may be the best that anyone can hope for.
 
But longer term, Israel and Israelis especially those who live in North will be demanding that something be done and that Hezbollah be moved back 
 
 to the Litani River in accordance with a U.N. resolution 1701 because otherwise, how are they going to live insecurity without fear of a harmless 
 
 style attack from Hezbollah?
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. It was a pleasure. Elliott Gotkine. Let's focus back on Gaza, the war that has brought about the regional instability that 
 
 we are seeing now as we've just been discussing. Let's consider two numbers first. 26. This man says he has been displaced 26 times inside Gaza.
 <br>[10:15:02]
 
But that is one man, one family amongst many of course. Today's big number is 29,000. The number of people in one area of Gaza that Israel ordered 
 
 evacuated on Sunday, another internally displaced person makes the sense of desperation clear.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABU MAHMOUD, DISPLACED PALESTNINIAN (through translator): Honestly, we're now living in survival of the fittest. We are living like animals. People 
 
 are eating each other.
 
I have to stay strong in the eyes of everybody despite being sick and wounded. But in front of my family, I must stay strong and brave no other 
 
 solution. I don't know where I'm going. I swear to God, I don't know. You're asking where am I going? I don't know. I'm going like all those 
 
 people are doing.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, stories like the one we just heard are only likely to increase as the war continues in Gaza. And with the deadly attack we've 
 
 been reporting on in the Golan Heights, bringing Israel and Lebanon it seems one step closer to conflict concerns over the toll on the civilian 
 
 population continue to grow. A new warfront should likely mean more displaced people. A major concern for Lebanon, which is already home to 
 
 well over 1-1/2 million refugees.
 
I just spoke to Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and he had a dire message from the humanitarian aid community. 
 
 Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FILIPPO GRANDI, UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES: We've been concerned not only about what's happening in Gaza, terrible for the past 
 
 few months. But also, as you said, by the possibility of an expansion of the conflict in particular to Lebanon, which is a very complex country in 
 
 so many ways. So, I think the attack that just happened increases the chances that this can occur.
 
And I do hope and pray the current efforts that are being made by many countries to try to deescalate the tensions succeed. You know, I -- we have 
 
 had a terrible year. A terrible couple of years. And the humanitarian community is stretched to an unbelievable point, further conflict further 
 
 refugee crisis. I'm not sure we can cope with that any longer. So let's really all
 
 pray that an end is put to these conflicts.
 
Because if there is no end to the conflict in Gaza, for example, it's very clear that these incidents will continue to occur and the chances of a 
 
 major regional conflict and beyond are very high. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Filippo Grandi speaking to me earlier and more of that conversation tomorrow on this show.
 
Well, still to come. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is set for a third term in office following a highly contentious election. But there is still 
 
 doubt about the results.
 
Plus, new details from law enforcement about the communication failures surrounding the attempt on Donald Trump's life. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:20:28]
 
ANDERSON: We have the first images coming in from the scene of a mass stabbing attack in England. These pictures from Southport in the northwest 
 
 of the country where official say eight people have been taken to hospital with stab wounds. Some now in a children's hospital in the area. Police 
 
 have detained a man and a cease knife but have not released more information as of now.
 
The British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called the attack horrendous and deeply shocking. More than that, of course, as we get it.
 
We are monitoring developments in Venezuela where President Nicolas Maduro has been declared the winner of Sunday's election, That is, according to 
 
 the government-controlled National Electoral Council. Maduro suggested there will be a bloodbath if he lost but struck a different tone on 
 
 election day. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator): We are the guarantee of peace in this country, tranquility and stability in this 
 
 historical moment, July 28th, 2024. We are the guarantors of peace. What's more, the only guarantors of peace and tranquility that this country has to 
 
 enable it to continue building in the near and late future to be able to see the emergence of a more democratic Venezuela.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, the opposition is claiming its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia was the winner. Won the presidential race. Meantime, the U.S. and 
 
 multiple nations in the region of voicing skepticism over President Maduro his reelection. Stefano Pozzebon is in Caracas. What have we heard from the 
 
 opposition, Stefano?
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Becky. The opposition is staying firm about their pledged, their claim that they won the election with 
 
 almost 70 percent of the preferences. However, first of all, Becky, I want to bring you some breaking news that we've just received here in Caracas at 
 
 this hour because Brazil, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has just released a statement less than 10 minutes ago calling on the Venezuelan electoral 
 
 authorities to release all the data, all the numbers behind their vote counting operations.
 
Just in the last hour, you remember I was talking to you we were chatting about the importance of two key countries that are in the region, Brazil 
 
 and Colombia who had yet to release a statement or a reaction on those results from yesterday's election. Well, Brazil, which is the largest 
 
 country in South America and punch, a mighty weight in terms of geopolitical balances around here is now calling on the Venezuelan 
 
 electoral authorities to release all the numbers and the papers at the ballot to confirm the numbers that the National Electoral Council here in 
 
 Venezuela gave us in the early hours on Monday.
 
Going back to your question, the opposition is saying that they feel like their candidate has won. And just a few hours ago in the early hours of 
 
 Monday or late hours of Sunday, this is what their candidate Edmundo Gonzalez said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EDMUNDO GONZALEZ URRUTIA, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): What happened during today's polling day was a 
 
 violation of all the rules to the point that the majority of electoral registers have still not been handed over. Our message of reconciliation 
 
 and peaceful change still stands. We are convinced most Venezuelans also want this. Our struggle continues and we won't rest until the will of the 
 
 people of Venezuela is respected.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POZZEBON: So, Becky, in the chess play or that he's developing around these controversial results, the opposition standing firm saying that they 
 
 believe they want this election. Maduro doing exactly the same. In a few hours we understand Maduro will participate in a public act to confirm 
 
 those results that were given in the early hours of Monday and be officially proclaimed by the electoral authorities as the winner of 
 
 Sunday's election.
 
Many countries in the region put in a lot of pressure on those authorities to release those ballots numbers and that will be crucial in the next few 
 
 days. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Got it. Stefano, thank you. Well, for the first time since the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the local SWAT team assigned to 
 
 protect the former president is now speaking out about what they describe as communication failures among the multiple law enforcement agencies 
 
 involved.
 <br>[10:25:11]
 
CNN's national security reporter Zachary Cohen joins me. That local SWAT team says that a meeting with Secret Service before that Trump rally never 
 
 happened. But just fill us in and what we understand to have happened here.
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Becky. It appears there was a massive communication failure. And it wasn't just this briefing -- 
 
 this face-to-face briefing that was supposed to happen and it never did, according to this local SWAT team, but they're telling ABC News that they 
 
 actually had no direct contact with U.S. Secret Service. The agency that was supposed to be leading the security for Trump's rally on July 13th, 
 
 they had no direct contact with them until after the shooting took place.
 
And instead, information was passed from the local SWAT team to a central command post that would then sort of dictate what happened to that 
 
 information if it was acted on. Take a listen to how they described the communication between their team and the U.S. Secret Service in that 
 
 interview with ABC News.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE PRIOLO, BEAVER COUNTY SWAT TEAM SERGEANT: So, that when he put that information out to command, that command took that information and did 
 
 something with it. We don't know if they did.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN: So what they're referring to is information about the first time they noticed the would be assassin. This was over 90 minutes before the 
 
 rally even started. The local SWAT team was talking about this individual in a group chat amongst themselves. They were told to pass that information 
 
 along to the command center but they don't have any idea what happened to that information.
 
After it was passed along, they assumed that somebody would act on it, somebody would maybe monitor this individual as a threat. Apparently, this 
 
 information never made its way to the U.S. Secret Service. And obviously the consequences were severe.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. Thank you. Well, still to come. Some Olympic triathletes in Paris have to miss out on swim practice because the river same is 
 
 apparently too dirty. A live report is ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:30:01]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. Time here in London today, half past 3:00 in the afternoon. Half 
 
 past 4:00 in Paris and we are following a developing story there where telecoms operators in parts of the country say they have been hit in a 
 
 fresh act of sabotage. Fiber optic lines were damaged earlier today and what is described as a major incident.
 
Now this comes just days of course after the railway infrastructure attack in France. Officials say backup routes are allowing traffic to be rerouted.
 
Well, meantime, triathlon training session in the river scene has been cancelled for a second day in a row over poor water quality. Triathlon 
 
 events are supposed to begin on Tuesday. Now some are questioning if that will happen at all and if so, where? CNN's Amanda Davies joining us from 
 
 Paris. What do we know at this point?
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Well, don't be fooled, Becky. The sun might be shining today. It's glorious, but it's the rain. We have to say 
 
 the torrential rain that impacted Thursday, Friday and Saturday here in Paris that is being blamed for the situation. Organizers are now facing 
 
 with the pollution levels in the reverse side. It's been one of the big talking points in the last couple of years.
 
In the build up to these games, it's been illegal to swim in the River Seine for the past century. But one of the legacy points that the 
 
 organizers and World Triathlon were desperate to put into place is cleaning up the Seine can it -- so it can be enjoyed for years to come. You might 
 
 remember it was just a couple of weeks ago that the Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo went for a swim to try and allay fears at the river is where both 
 
 the men's and women's triathlon and the marathon swimming are set to take place. 
 
Yesterday Sunday, the first of the what is called familiarization sessions bit with me and you are talking about it as training sessions. The athletes 
 
 call them familiarization sessions to get to know the river and the flow and the current ahead of the racing. It was canceled yesterday. It was 
 
 canceled again today. And that of course, causes real concern ahead of the men's race, which takes place tomorrow Tuesday.
 
I was joined in the studio a little bit earlier on by the President of World Triathlon and she admitted there is still a doubt about whether or 
 
 not the race goes ahead. But said there is a contingency plan which would see the three-sport triathlon be cut to a two-sport triathlon. So rather 
 
 than cycling, swimming, running, it would be just running and cycling.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Between one and 10, how confident do think? One, it won't happen. 10 It will happen.
 
MARISOL CASADO, PRESIDENT, WORLD TRIATHLON: Eight.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, there's still a doubt.
 
CASADO: There's still a doubt because as I say, we depend on the weather conditions. The weather conditions now are very good, fantastic, because we 
 
 have the sun. The sun is something that also clean in this case. And then of course, we are going to have it tomorrow.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Could we get to the end of the games without this event taking place? 
 
CASADO: No, not at all because we have a contented plan. And in the worst case scenario at the very end if is needed, this is in our rules and 
 
 regulations. We will convert it into a throne that is run, cycling and run again. I hope we are not going to go direct to this point.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVIES: So, the men's triathlon due to take place on Tuesday, the women's on Wednesday. We understand that a water quality test is set to take place 
 
 at 3:30 a.m. So just less than 12 hours from now, which would be 4-1/2 ahead of the start of the race tomorrow. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Yes. Hardly a contingency plan. More just a complete change in the event. Anyway, very briefly to clash of two tennis Titans Monday. Tell 
 
 us more.
 
DAVIES: Yes. And sadly, it could be the last time we ever see Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic square off in a singles match on a tennis court but what 
 
 a venue for it to have taken place here in Paris in France at Roland Garros. Of course, the scene of so many of Rafael Nadal greatest moments, 
 
 the 14th time winner here in Paris. But the end of his Olympic singles journey is over. He was being relatively easily and straight sets by Novak 
 
 Djokovic. 61-64. Nadal still very much in the hands with his compatriot Carlos Alcaraz, of course, the next gen.
 
But for Novak Djokovic, this is the medal he's never won. For all his 24 Grand Slam titles he is determined he's set his sights on finally getting 
 
 his hands on an Olympic gold. So promises to have a lot more tennis ahead.
 
ANDERSON: You would not Djokovic off when he's got something -- he's got a beeline for something would you at all. It's good to have you. Paris looks 
 
 fabulous. You look great. The coverage is brilliant. Thank you. 
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
More Olympics fun is just ahead. We go behind the scenes to learn more about the Moulin Rouge dances featured at the Paris Olympics opening 
 
 ceremony Fridays. With us for that.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, another stride towards being able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. A new study finds that a blood test can catch 90 percent of early 
 
 dementia cases significantly more accurate than current methods. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more on what is this promising new development.
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: We're talking about a two-part blood test here to give you an idea of how much amyloid you'd 
 
 likely have in your brain. It's an amyloid probability score. Now, I want to be clear, this is not an Alzheimer's test, per se, you can't take the 
 
 blood test and say you either have Alzheimer's or you don't. But it can provide a lot of information for people, especially those who are worried 
 
 could the memory loss they're experiencing actually be due to Alzheimer's?
 
So specifically, we're again, we're talking about two specific blood tests here. One is called P-Tau 217. That's measuring for tau protein and 
 
 something known as Beta Amyloid 42. That's another biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. The real question, I think, and part of the reason there's so much 
 
 enthusiasm is how predictive is it really? And how predictive is it against what is typically out there?
 
And what you find is that the accuracy and determining of memory loss is likely due to Alzheimer's disease with this blood test around 90 percent. 
 
 Compare that to neurologists, memory specialists around 73 percent, primary care doctors around 61 percent.

ANDERSON: Some very good news there. All right I want to take you back to Paris, the Olympics. The Moulin Rouge cabaret which has been a part of 
 
 Parisian culture for 200 years. Have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
Well, that is how it normally looks. What better way to celebrate the Olympics set in Paris, and appearance from the dancers during the opening 
 
 ceremony when spectators were delighted to watch them perform the iconic French can-can (INAUDIBLE) or frankly, a bit of glamour to the Olympics. 
 
 Moulin Rouge dancers Romane Bollengier and David Tandy. I hope I'm pronouncing your names correctly. David, your sounds quite English joining 
 
 me now from Paris.
 
Listen, this is not the easiest dance in town. And this I think I'm right in zone was one of the first times has ever been actually conducted outside 
 
 away from the theater. How was it for you guys?
 <br>[10:40:05]
 
DAVID TANDY, MOULIN ROUGE DANCER: It was amazing. It was a really incredible experience just to be part of the Olympics but not the Olympic 
 
 but like the Olympics in Paris.
 
ROMANE BOLLENGIER, MOULINE ROUGE DANCER: Exactly.
 
TANDY: And then we've -- to represent the Moulin Rouge to represent France, it was an incredible experience. We're just -- we were just a bit on lucky 
 
 with the weather so we didn't give it the usual pizzazz that it usually gets. 
 
ANDERSON: Because remain you performed in less than ideal conditions. Like it was raining on the Seine. How did you work through what must have been a 
 
 myriad of challenges?
 
BOLLENGIER: We tried to do the best actually. We know like for the raining maybe 10 second before the music stuff. So, we tried to clean a bit the 
 
 stage and to dry a bit. Like we did last minute but like the value of Olympic Games never give up. So yes, we just tried to do the best and yes. 
 
 I think we enjoy like just the experience and it was such a unique show. So --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: It was. And I think -- and I think without the Moulin Rouge can- can dances it just wouldn't have been a Paris opening ceremony. Tell us about life behind the scenes of a can-can dance on a regular basis. This is 
 
 -- this is a tough act.
 
TANDY: Well, a regular night we're doing two shows every night and even during the lead up to the Olympics Games. We were rehearsing all afternoon 
 
 and then still doing our two shows every night. So yes, it's quite a hectic -- a hectic lifestyle. But I think we managed quite well.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: How did you -- how did both of you get into this? Romane, you first.
 
BOLLENGIER: Actually, it was a -- it was a quite intense, like, the rehearsal was really like every day. And we tried to keep the motivation 
 
 and the energy for the night for the two show. But yes, we have like -- we get lots of like real show and we try (INAUDIBLE) with the costume and after onstage and after on stage with the 
 
 weather and everything. But yes, I think it was -- it was a challenge for sure. But we just -- we just try to do the best.
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
ANDERSON: I love -- I love the way that you talk about those. Yes. It was a challenge. It was -- it looked like a nightmare to me. But you pulled it 
 
 off both of you. Let's pull that camera out. Can you give me one kick between the two of you before I let you go? Can you give us a kick?
 
TANDY: Do we have space?
 
BOLLENGIER: Maybe I just take --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Create some. Oh, stop it. Oh, stop it. David, can you do that? Wow.
 
TANDY: Not as classy as my (INAUDIBLE) not bad. 
 
ANDERSON: Brilliant. Love having you both. Good luck. Thank you. It was great seeing you. And the Olympics, of course are up and running and into 
 
 the first full week.
 
Coming up. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris rolling out new attack lines at their rallies to see what sticks. We're going to dissect some of the 
 
 polling numbers for you. That is up next.

A law in the U.S. state of Iowa banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy has now gone into effect. That law was passed last year despite 
 
 widespread protests and a judge's attempt to block it. Now Iowa is the latest of more than a dozen states where abortion access has been sharply 
 
 curbed in the last two years. CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell joins me now. I mean, basically there is pretty much no bigger issue in the 
 
 States than that of abortion at this point.
 
Meg, what exactly is the new policy? And what does it mean for those living in Iowa?
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So this morning really just an hour and 45 minutes ago, this went into effect in Iowa and what it does is 
 
 shorten the amount of time when somebody can get an abortion in the state. Down to about six weeks the law states that after cardiac activity has been 
 
 detected via ultrasound, you can no longer get an abortion. And for most people, that's about six weeks into pregnancy.
 
There are some narrow exceptions here including for cases of rape and incest if they've been reported to authorities. Also for cases where there 
 
 are fetal -- fatal fetal abnormalities when the fetus is not expected to survive. Miscarriage care and preserving the life of the person who's 
 
 pregnant, although abortion advocates note that those are fairly rare exceptions. We know that last year there were about 4200 clinician provided 
 
 abortions in the state of Iowa. 
 
That's according to the Guttmacher Institute, which is a research group that advocates for abortion access. Most of those were for people living in 
 
 Iowa, but some of them were from people traveling from out of state, including from nearby Nebraska, where there's a 12-week law. Now it's 
 
 thought folks might be going in the other direction because Iowa's law has become much stricter.
 
This is the fourth state in the U.S. to put into place about a six-week ban in addition to Florida, which was the most recent South Carolina and 
 
 Georgia. And there are about 14 states that ban abortion almost completely. So, this landscape keeps changing pretty quickly, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Very specifically, what do we know about what the effect is likely to be for the people of Iowa?
 
TIRRELL: Well, a lot of people don't realize that they're pregnant by six weeks. And so that really shortens the amount of time for decision making. 
 
 Advocates say they are increasing resources to try to help people to travel out of state. And we know though that looking at other states like South 
 
 Carolina, for example, which implemented a six-week law in August of 2023 dramatically impacts how many abortions happen within that state.
 
In South Carolina abortions dropped by 71 percent just month to month after their law went into effect. So, we are expecting to see a lot more people 
 
 travel across state lines from Iowa to access abortion. Illinois already has had a tremendous influx of patients between 2020 and 2023. Tripled the 
 
 number of patients traveling to that state to seek abortion. So, folks are a bit worried about constraints on the system for states like Illinois, 
 
 also, Minnesota.
 
We know Planned Parenthood has increased its resources both in Nebraska and Minnesota. So a lot of people will be traveling. But there's also concern 
 
 that people -- some people won't be able to travel and will have to carry pregnancies to term that they didn't plan.
 
ANDERSON: Meg, it's good to have you thank you very much indeed. Well, let's turn to the U.S. election which is now just 99 days away. And in the 
 
 past week, Kamala Harris has effectively erased Donald Trump's lead in the polls. Harris is all but assured of becoming the new Democratic nominee and 
 
 former President Donald Trump rolling out new attack lines at his rallies trying to figure out what sticks. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If a crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American Dream is dead. She made Bernie Sanders look 
 
 like a moderate. We have a man that can't put two sentences together. And now we're replacing him with worse than he is. A dangerous person who's not 
 
 smart. You know, she couldn't pass a law exam, right? Kamala wants to be the president for criminals and illegal aliens. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That's Donald Trump. CNN's Harry Enten has been looking at some of the polling numbers since this race changed. I don't want to use the 
 
 word dramatically, Harry, but that That's a sort of understatement or certain exam completely turned on its head. Harry joining me now. Let's have a look at those numbers. What are 
 
 they telling us at this point?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Yes. I just can't wait to see what shoe falls next, Becky. All right. Let's take a look nationally. All right? 
 
 Let's take a look at the national polls. This is Trump versus Harris. There hasn't actually been that much of a change in the horse race when it comes 
 
 to Trump versus Harris. Before Biden dropped that you see Trump was up by two. Look at this Trump now up by one, of course, the clear thing here is 
 
 no clear leader.
 
But the dramatic change, of course, was going from Biden as the presumptive Democrat nominee to now Harris being the presumptive Democratic nominee.
 <br>[10:50:06]
 
Why is that so important? Because Biden was trailing Trump by six points in the same polls, in which Harris was only trailing by two. So, Democrats 
 
 clearly in a better position on this metric now with Harris instead of Biden. It's not the only way that they're in a better position. All right, 
 
 this is enthusiastic about voting, right? There was a lot of belief that Democrats were lagging in enthusiasm.
 
And in fact, we see that, right? Democrats enthusiastic voting for Joe Biden, back in February, it was just 62 percent. Look at where we are now. 
 
 88 percent of Democrats say they are enthusiastic about voting for Kamala Harris versus -- look at Republicans for Trump. It was 80 percent in 
 
 February, that was a massive advantage over Joe Biden when it was just 62 percent. And now, Trump said about the same level, 82 percent. That's not 
 
 half bad.
 
But in fact, now Harris leads on the enthusiasm metric. But of course, elections in the United States are all about the swing states, we don't 
 
 have a popular vote. So how are things looking in the all-important battleground states? All right. So, let's take a look here. This is Harris 
 
 versus Trump margin. These are all polls taken after Harris became the likelier presumptive Democratic nominee.
 
Look, no clear leader once again, Wisconsin Trump by a point well, within the margin of error. How about Michigan? We get a tie. Pennsylvania, we get 
 
 a time. Just look at how close these matchups are. And why is this so important? Because ultimately, this is a race to 270 electoral votes. So 
 
 how are we looking in the electoral college? Well, Kamala Harris, this is the Great Lakes path, right?
 
We were talking about Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania course which is just south of where I am in New York City. If Kamala Harris is able to win 
 
 those three states, she could still lose in states like Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, which were states that Joe Biden carried last time around, but he 
 
 wasn't polling too well. And we don't have new polling from there yet. But even if Harris lost there, but one up here in the Great Lake battleground 
 
 states, get this Becky, she would get to exactly 270 electoral votes.
 
The exact number needed. So, with 99 days to go, there is still so much to be determined. As a political junkie. I'm quite excited by this. But I hope 
 
 the viewers are willing to take the roller coaster ride with me, because I can assure you that we will be on one.
 
ANDERSON: There is a path. And I sense your enthusiasm, sir.
 
ENTEN: I have. I love -- I love this stuff.
 
ANDERSON: That's why we put you on. You're brilliant at it.
 
ENTEN: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you, Harry.
 
ENTEN: See you later.
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
ANDERSON: -- in the swing state of Georgia, talking to voters there. Have a listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If the election were held today, Margarita Eberline doesn't know who she vote for. The elevation of 
 
 Vice President Kamala Harris in the race hasn't made things any clearer for her.
 
MARGARITA EBERLINE, GEORGIA SWING VOTER: No, it's not exciting to me. It's not like oh, wow, the easy answer. It's not an easy choice for me. It still 
 
 isn't. People are assuming that because I'm a Latina woman that oh, I'm going to be excited about her. And it's not that easy for me because I 
 
 worry about character. We had somebody that was the right hand of somebody that was not healthy, who was silent about it and that concerns me.
 
VALENCIA (voice-over): Eberline lives in Gwinnett County, a key suburban county in a swing state, where she believes her vote is more consequential 
 
 than ever. In a recent memo, Vice President Harris's campaign said it sees securing swing voters like Eberline as part of a pathway to victory. 
 
Do you think a lot of people are burned out with politics at this point?
 
EBERLINE: Absolutely.
 
VALENCIA (voice-over): In 2020, Joe Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the 
 
 state since 1992. But in 2024, we're finding that Democrats have their work cut out for them. If they're hoping for a repeat. 
 
How has it changed your opinion seeing her as a potential nominee for the Democrats?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fifty-fifty.
 
VALENCIA: Fifty-fifty?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
VALENCIA: You still have to learn more and research more.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
VALENCIA: If the election was today, you wouldn't know which way you would vote?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am so doubt -- in doubt.
 
VALENCIA: In doubt?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now. By getting that place about three months. You know, it'd be ready.
 
SHELLA HOLLEY, GEORGIA SWING VOTER: It's not like, you know, I want to vote for her because she's black. That's not the reason. This year is just -- 
 
 because we -- just to make sure Trump is not elected.
 
VALENCIA (on camera): What makes you want to vote for Trump?
 
VALENCIA (voice-over): Aber Martinez doesn't need any more time to make up his mind. He saw our camera and shouted Trump 2024.
 
ABER MARTINEZ, GEORGIA TRUMP VOTER: I rather vote for Trump, no matter what. They're going to keep being bringing the liberal agenda and I'm not 
 
 for it. I'm just sorry.
 
VALENCIA (voice-over): For Margarita Eberline. Some progressive policies are troubling. But it's Trump's rhetoric, specifically on immigration, that 
 
 makes it hard for her to support him.
 
EBERLINE: I'm a conservative person. And I just cannot make peace with anybody that uses hatred in the rhetoric. And that uses division as a 
 
 strategy.
 
VALENCIA (voice-over): Eberline also questions whether either outcome will even make a difference for her and her family.
 <br>[10:55:04]
 
EBERLINE: I'm not from a privileged background, I was the first in my family to go to college and I went to a really good university and all of 
 
 that, and I feel like I've checked all the boxes, but relatively speaking, like my life's not easy, and no matter who wins, the financial implications 
 
 are not necessarily going to be easy for me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VALENCIA: Our biggest takeaway and talking to voters throughout the day is just the overall lack of enthusiasm about the upcoming election. The voters 
 
 that we spoke to say they're just not animated in the same way they were in 2020. And for as instrumental as Georgia was in handing Biden a victory 
 
 four years ago. What's clear to us is that the Democrats in 2024 are fighting against a lot in Georgia.
 
And the name of Vice President Harris just hasn't injected the excitement or enthusiasm into those swing voters we spoke to.
