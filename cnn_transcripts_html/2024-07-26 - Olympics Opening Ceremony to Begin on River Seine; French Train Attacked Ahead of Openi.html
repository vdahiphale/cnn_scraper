AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT:  The eyes of the world focused this evening on a landmark that needs no introduction. The Eiffel Tower, standing iconic, getting set to shine bright across the city of light as we get set for the world's best to light up the pool, the track and the field here in Paris over the next two weeks. The final countdown to the official start of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games is upon us.
 
Hello. Welcome along to this special edition of "Aiming for Gold." Live from Paris with me, Amanda Davis, as myself and the team bring you all the buildup to what is billed as the greatest show on earth with a very different Olympic Opening Ceremony set to get underway within the next 30 minutes or so.
 
Instead of the usual focus on the Olympic stadium, this is the evening where Paris gets the chance to set the tone for the next couple of weeks. The long-awaited parade of 100 boats along a six-kilometer stretch of the River Seine with the teams and the athletes making the journey past some of the city's most iconic landmarks, Notre Dame, the Louvre right to the Trocadero, where the Olympic Cauldron will be lit.
 
And I am delighted to say joining me this evening, we have CNN's Coy Wire just down there, behind us in the shadows of the incredible Arc de Triomphe and senior international correspondent based here in Paris, Melissa Bell.
 
It is an Olympic Opening Ceremony that Paris 2024 organizers have said is going ahead as planned, absolutely unchanged despite what was described as an attack on France overnight, a coordinated sabotage of a number of train lines across the country with fires and stolen cables set to impact an estimated 800,000 people over the course of the weekend.
 
So, instead of the fan zone where Melissa was meant to be this evening, she has spent the day the Paris Montparnasse station. Melissa, I mean, there'd been a lot of talk, hadn't there, about safety and security concerns here in Paris, particularly ahead of this opening ceremony with a difference, but this is certainly not what had been expected. MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  No, you know that they had planned for almost every eventuality. We spoke to the Paris mayor yesterday who told us just how well they were prepared, the 45,000 policemen, the 18,000 soldiers. Security was at the forefront of their minds throughout the organization of these games these last few weeks. And yet, it was in the early hours of this morning that disaster struck in a way that no one could possibly have imagined.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL (voice-over):  The organizers of Paris 2024 believed they were ready for anything. But it was at 4:00 a.m., hours from the opening ceremony, that coordinated sabotage and arson caused chaos.
 
PATRICE VERGRIETE, MINISTER DELEGATE FOR TRANSPORT OF FRANCE (through translator):  Today, all the information we have clearly shows that it was deliberate, the simultaneous nature, everything happened at the same time. Everything now points to the fact that these were arson attacks, particularly the timing, which is more than suspicious.
 
BELL (voice-over):  Security in Paris is tight, with authorities keen to make sure that things go smoothly. But this was one attack carried out simultaneously across the country that was impossible to imagine. No particular group has yet claimed responsibility.
 
BELL:  These are exactly the kinds of images that the organizers of Paris 2024 had hoped to avoid with French authorities warning that it is 250,000 travelers likely to be impacted this Friday, 800,000 over the course of the weekend.
 
BELL (voice-over):  The latest drama likely to dampen the spirits of the French, many of them heading off on family holidays even as Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo believed that enthusiasm for the Games had finally gripped the country.
 
ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS MAYOR (through translator):  I felt that the enthusiasm arrived a little before, during the passage of the flame in Paris on July 14th and 15th. The Olympic flame was paraded in Paris and there were people everywhere, children, elderly people, all social classes. Everyone was really happy. And I said to myself that it's the magic of the games working.
 
BELL (voice-over):  The opening ceremony will still go ahead as planned tonight along the River Seine, despite the train attack and the threat of rain. Whether it will further dampen spirits could depend more on the weather than the turnout.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[13:05:00]
 
BELL (on camera):  And yet, Amanda, it will have impacted some athletes as well. What we understand from France's rail operators is that there were four trains carrying athletes that were due to arrive in Paris today. Only two actually made it. DAVIES:  Yes, Melissa, thanks very much. Indeed. It's been one of the kind of key points in the build up to this games, hasn't it? Sustainability really encouraging people to use the public transport systems. But as you rightly say, the organizers say the opening ceremony is going ahead as planned. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, has said he has got full confidence in the French authorities and the games will go on.
 
The stars have started to arrive ahead of the opening ceremony due to get underway in about 20 minutes or so. I still haven't seen Celine Dion. I have seen Ariana Grande. And Coy Wire is on the ground for us. And,
 
Coy, there's, you know, despite the heavy police security presence that both of us have experienced here over the last couple of days, you get a real sense of excitement, not only on the streets of Paris, but from these athletes, because you've got to remember this is the first Olympic Games since those COVID impacted games in Tokyo.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yes, and especially you get more excited when Snoop Dogg, the legendary artist, musician, is carrying around the Olympic torch, right, too. I mean, it's just plenty of excitement.
 
And these games, they're the pinnacle of the careers for most of these athletes. Most won't ever make it back. They've sacrificed their jobs, their family life for this one shot to make it all worth it. You also have superstar pros chasing Olympic gold like Novak Djokovic. The tennis star has never won an Olympic gold.
 
These are the first Olympics for Olympics -- for arguably the greatest shooter the NBA has ever seen, the Warriors' Steph Curry. I asked him and Spurs' star Kevin Durant what they will be thinking about as they're floating down that Seine River during the opening ceremony.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPH CURRY, MAKING OLYMPIC DEBUT:  You imagine the excitement of representing your country, being a part of the opening ceremony, you know, festivities. I know it's very unique here. You know, being on the river and being a part of, you know, just the scene in Paris. So, I'm excited about it all.
 
KEVIN DURANT, THREE TIMES OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST:  You get to see all the great athletes around the world represent their country, and the pride that you have for your country just goes to another level. We haven't done the river. The boat on the river yet, you know. We usually walk around the stadium, so it'll be a new experience for me. I'm looking forward to it.
 
ANASTASIIA RYBACHOK, TOKYO 2020 SILVER MEDALIST (through translator): It's my second Olympics. I have already held the medal in my hands. So, I know what it feels like. So, this time, the pressure is even bigger. The competition and the fact that my baby son is away from me. I miss him very much, but he and my husband are what drives me.
 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC, SEEKING FIRST CAREER OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL (through translator):  This is different because you're representing your Olympic team, your countries, and that is an additional responsibility. And of course, additional pressure. But it is something that I'm used to. So, I will try my best to make it fifth time lucky.
 
JENNA STRAUCH, MAKING SECOND OLYMPICS APPEARANCE:  I think it's the excitement and you know, the pride of representing a country. I think once we all put our yellow Olympic tops on, it sort of sits in -- sets in, sorry, and we sort of look around and like we are part of a small minority group in Australia that we'll get to rep in our country and the ball. So, I think we're all feeling very proud to be here.
 
CHAD LE CLOS, SOUTH AFRICA'S MOST-DECORATED OLYMPIAN:  I've achieved probably more than I ever thought I would as a kid. But the funny thing about winning and success is you want more every time, you know, you just keep chasing those highs and just keep chasing that podium during the national anthem because there's nothing greater than that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Now, before I go any further, Amanda, I do have to correct myself. My producer tells me I said Spurs' star Kevin Durant. He's the Sun star. Maybe I'm channeling Victor Wembanyama, who's the host nation will be representing their flag here.
 
But look, it all comes down to this, Amanda, years of dedication, sacrifice, what you eat, who you spend time with, the moment they've been dreaming of. And beyond just the athletes, you could feel the power of sport for fans as well. People from all races, places, putting differences aside, saying hello, celebrating the games in the sports they love together. And that unity and uniqueness will be on full display in the opening ceremony. Each nation representing their people.
 
Team Kenya sent 81 athletes to Paris. 46 of them will be in athletics. The team said their outfits embrace Kenyan culture reflecting their deep belief in togetherness. There's those signature art details accessorized there with that Kenyan bracelet. And how about team Mongolia? 32 athletes at these games, and they may have already won the gold medal for best outfits that we will see. They broke the internet.
 <br>[13:10:00]
 
Two sisters put these Mongolian masterpieces based on traditional Mongolian wear known as deals. Each piece took about 20 hours to make. We have to also show some of the host nation, France, one of the fashion capitals of the world, rocking that Berluti of fashion houses dating back to 1895. The blue suit jackets. We'll see those on those boats tonight. They're sleeveless for the women. How about that for a strong, Amanda?
 
And of course, if you haven't noticed, I'm rocking this Ralph Lauren, the official outfitter for Team USA for about a decade now. Got the traditional Navy blazer, some Americana details, the Oxford white shirt. And you mentioned sustainability earlier, Amanda, they had that in mind too. Parts of it made from recycled polyester, but it feels like pure gold to me, Amanda. So, I can't wait to see the fashion show, the fun, the unity on full display tonight here at this opening ceremony.
 
DAVIES:  Yes, they are not outfits to be recycled, Coy. They are -- if you are lucky enough to get your hands on one that you very much put that in the wardrobe and keep it for posterity. We don't often mention Ulaanbaatar on world sport, but the designers from Mongolia and Ulaanbaatar definitely deserve a shout out that is without doubt my favorite.
 
And you know, it's not only wearing the uniform and the jacket, but those carrying the flag get to wear a special uniform, don't they? And athletes are chosen for different reasons, often by their team members they're voted for, some for reaching great heights, some because they're coming to the end of their career. And for Coco Gauff, it's an honor very much at the other end of her Olympic journey.
 
WIRE:  Yes. I mean, it feels like we've been talking about her forever, right? I mean, she turned pro when she was 14. So, it's wild to think that she just turned 20 a few months ago. And as we remember, she caught COVID before the last Summer Olympics. She missed them. Her heart was broken. She's now the world number two, having won her first career Grand Slam last year.
 
She was chosen by her peers to be the flag bearer representing the U.S. alongside one of her idols, LeBron James. I asked Coco Gauff about the moment she found out. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm sure she's very excited to be here at her first Olympics. It's a pretty special moment.
 
WIRE:  I want you to walk me through this moment here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think because you are so special, you have the honor of wearing this jacket during the opening ceremony and being a flag bearer with LeBron James.
 
WIRE:  What's going through your mind at this point?
 
COCO GAUFF, U.S. OPEN 2023 CHAMPION:  At this point, I just thought -- you know, Chris is like a brother to me and he always, you know, talks about how proud he is of me. And so, I thought he was just doing a little bit too rich talking. And then, yes, once I got told that I was going to be flag bearer -- obviously, you could see by my reaction, I was just shocked and I didn't really know what to say. I think a lot of people were laughing at me saying, oh, because I really didn't know what to say.
 
WIRE:  Have you started a process yet that you will be repping your country alongside LeBron James?
 
GAUFF:  No. I -- like, I don't know when I'm going to meet him, but I'm like already like stressed about it really. WIRE:  So, you've never met him before?
 
GAUFF:  No, no. I've never met him before. I'm excited to meet him. And I'm excited to be flag bearer alongside him. There's no other athlete I think I would have chosen to do this with.
 
WIRE:  You talk about the racket has the potential to change the world. As divisive as times are right now with everything going on, what do you make of it all? And also, what are your hopes for -- in the game's potential ability to bring people together, that's what sports can do?
 
GAUFF:  Yes, I just hope that me being a person representing Team USA and I think all of the -- I don't want to speak on behalf of all Olympians on Team USA, but I feel like majority of them will agree that we all just want to promote positivity through our game and through our sport and through our competing. And I think that we all just want to show. How passionate we are and share that passion with the supporters that we have and hopefully have a lot of success too.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  All right. So humble. Such a great representative for Team USA. Amanda, one more quick, fun anecdote from our conversation. She says she's going to be completely fangirling when she finally gets to meet LeBron. She's going to be nervous. So, to think about one of the highest paid female athletes in the world getting nervous. Starstruck is pretty cool.
 
LeBron's fourth Olympics. His first was 2004. That's the year Coco Gauff was born. So, one of the many great storylines that we're getting ready to kick off here from Paris, I know we'll be sharing them all night long right here on CNN. I look forward to doing it with you, Amanda.
 
DAVIES:  Yes. Thank you very much indeed for now, Coy. And Coco has plenty of time to get to know Lebron James, with a four-hour opening ceremony and that boat journey down the River Seine. So, they'll be very well acquainted by the time they get to the end of it.
 
We'll be back with you shortly. The skies may be grey, the rain falling, but the atmosphere here in Paris is very much building as the 2024 Olympics get set to get underway. Stay with us. We'll be back in just a couple of minutes with one of the men in charge of running the show.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:15:00]
 
DAVIES:  Welcome back live to Paris, in this special edition of "Aiming for Gold" as we continue the countdown to the start of the Olympics Opening Ceremony.
 
Paris has waited a very long time for this moment, 100 years, in fact, since it last hosted the Summer Games back in 1924. And now, it becomes just the second city to host three Summer Games after London. And, as with every Games, it's a buildup not without its challenges as it prepares to welcome around 10,500 athletes from 206 national delegations from around the world and an estimated 15 million fans, 2 million of which are due to be from abroad. That's quite something in the current political and socioeconomic climate.
 
The CEO of the 2024 games is a former Olympian. He represented France at the 1996 games in Atlanta in badminton. This is a very different pre games buildup for him for one of the men in charge of pulling it all together. Etienne Thobois.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVIES:  Etienne, you know about the night before an opening ceremony from the athlete's perspective. I'm guessing this is a little bit different this time round after such a big buildup.
 
ETIENNE THOBOIS, CEO, PARIS 2024 ORGANISING COMMITTEE AND COMPETED AT 1996 SUMMER OLYMPICS:  It is. Actually, when you're an athlete, you concentrate it on your competition, but our competition starts tomorrow with the opening ceremony, which is going to be extraordinary.
 
DAVIES:  Are you able to give us any hints about what is going to happen?
 
THOBOIS:  It's going to be on the Seine River.
 
DAVIES:  We know that bit.
 <br>[13:20:00]
 
THOBOIS:  It's going to be a six-kilometer parade. And for the first time, the ceremony is good. They're intertwined. The athlete's parade, the artistic performances, the protocol, you know, things, and that's going to be different, and that's what we aiming for at Paris 2024, to do things that are different, to give our games a spatial flavor games wide open.
 
DAVIES:  I have to ask the question that everybody is asking, is Celine Dion involved?
 
THOBOIS:  You can ask and then you can watch tomorrow and you'll get your answer.
 
DAVIES:  God, not even a little tip.
 
THOBOIS:  I wouldn't know. I mean, you know, I'm only the CEO. No, but it's going to be a fantastic spectacle.
 
DAVIES:  It has been a tricky time politically in France and around the world with the conflicts that we're seeing playing out. What, for you, do you see as the role of this games? Where does it fit in where we are in the current climate?
 
THOBOIS:  Well, I think they are most important than ever. I mean, we are not immune to what's happening and the games are not immune to what's happening on the geographic -- you know, the geopolitical scene. But, you know, with the Olympic truth, the fact that all the countries are getting together and there are fair fight around sport is a fantastic sign that we can live together and listen and, you know, have a peaceful word. And I think the Olympics -- that's what the Olympics is all about and that's what Paris 2024 is all about.
 
DAVIES:  And how are the France team going to do? What are you expecting from them?
 
THOBOIS:  Well, you know, the home team has always been performing well, and we hope that the French won't be different. Definitely, if we can get some medals early on, we know that the cheering is going to be even better. So, we are very respectful of all the other teams. We hope they get a lot of medals. But if the French team can do well, you know, that would be a plus.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVIES:  Well, still no sighting yet of Celine Dion. We are very much on Celine watch for every games. We talk about the importance of a decent showing, don't we, the host country for the success of an Olympics. And Antoine Dupont is certainly keeping up his end of the bargain as things stand, known as one of the greatest rugby players of all time, who skipped playing in the 15 aside version of the games to shift codes with the mission solely to of helping the France Sevens team to their first Olympic Rugby medal since 1900.
 
And he's led them already into Saturday's semifinal. He did it in style. Scoring his side's last match sealing try in their quarterfinal against great rivals Argentina in front of 80,000 fans. A great atmosphere it was. They took it 26 points to 14 to set up a last war encounter against South Africa.
 
France's women's football team got off to a winning start as well in their opening match but the biggest drama so far in terms of sporting events involves defending champions Canada and spygate. Canada soccer have sent home their coach, the coach that led them to gold in Tokyo three years ago, Bev Priestman. As they continue their investigation into reports, the team have been illegally using drones to spy on their opponents and gained tactical advantage.
 
It was on Monday, you might remember, that a Canadian staff member was caught using a drone to spy on New Zealand's practice session. That staff member and an assistant were then sent home. And Priestman stepped aside for their opening game. But after further investigation, Priestman has now also being sent home.
 
Canadian broadcaster TSN claims the team has been "engaged for years" in efforts to film the closed door training sessions of their opponents, including during the women's gold medal winning Olympic tournament in 2021. CNN hasn't independently confirmed the TSN report.
 
In contrast though, a brilliant start for USA women's coach Emma Hayes in her first competitive game in charge. They beat Zambia 3-nil with a great bit of skill from Trinity Rodman to put them one up after 17 minutes. Mallory Swanson then scored two goals just over a minute apart. And despite Zambia going down to 10 players they couldn't add any more goals. But next up for the Americans will be Germany. Alex Popp's Germany on Sunday.
 
Well, Emma Hayes has made no secret of the fact that an appearance at an Olympic Games has been a dream of hers since she used to walk around her living room at home, pretending she was walking in the opening ceremony.
 
And we are getting ever closer to the start here of a ceremony with a difference. With a parade of 100 boats taking to the water on the River Seine into the official start off the action at the games which has huge repercussions and the fight for equality for women in sport. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:25:00]
 
DAVIES:  Welcome back. There's always so much to celebrate at an Olympic Games, isn't there? But here in Paris, a few things in particular, especially as a woman in sport. Firstly, the return of Simone Biles, the greatest of all time, with the opportunity to go out on the high she deserves after her brave move to pull out of Tokyo 2020.
 
Secondly, the first ever children's nursery at the corner of the Athlete's Village at a game set up by seven-time Olympic champion Allyson Felix. It's a massive resource for athletes of parents and toddlers at the games, male and female. And thirdly, for the first time ever on Olympic Games and it's 33rd edition, equal numbers of men's and women's athletes taking part 100 years since women were first allowed here at the games in Paris.
 
And it's a very proud moment for four-time Olympian and gold medal winner with the U.S. women's ice hockey team, Angela Ruggiero. She's a former IOC board member who spent nearly a decade campaigning for this moment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANGELA RUGGIERO, FOUR-TIME OLYMPIC MEDALIST:  This is a monumental Olympics, again, it's the beginning of the Olympics, we haven't been truly equal. And hopefully, the world celebrates. It's a -- it's one of the biggest sports events in the world, if not the biggest sports event in the world. And you have equal male and women, not just walking, but selling, right? That commercial value that it brings, it sends a really positive signal for a number of reasons.
 
So, should we have been here sooner? Absolutely. But I think in the last decade, really, you've seen an enormous amount of advancement. And, you know, you have to have leaders that say we want it, and I think we're there.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) DAVIES:  Well, somebody who's seen the fight, the movement, and has been such a trailblazer in it herself. Just needing a little bit of help there to sort your mic, but I think we're there. CNN's Sport Analyst Christine Brennan.
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORT CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.
 
DAVIES:  I mean, we're talking about this moment. You know, how significant -- you have been here, your 21st Olympic Games. So, I guess we need to start with a congratulations for that.
 
BRENNAN:  Well, thank you. Thank you.
 <br>[13:30:00]
 
DAVIES:  But you know, how significant a moment is this?
 
BRENNAN:  Well, this is the grandest of Olympic cities. Paris, as you mentioned, with three times now hosting. And because we had COVID the last two Olympics, even though COVID still exists, but this is really the chance for the world, the sports world, Amanda, to just burst out.
 
What a perfect location to do it. The views of this city, extraordinary. And I think, again, it's just perfectly time for Paris to be that Olympic city after COVID and with the opportunity to celebrate its 100th year anniversary.
 
DAVIES:  And what have you made of your experience so far? You know so well, every Olympic Games has its own stump, its own brand. We've noticed security.
 
BRENNAN:  Right.
 
DAVIES:  But what have you made of your first few days here?
 
BRENNAN:  Yes, I think Paris is welcoming this. It's -- you know, it's always that delicate balance, and, you know, from your Olympic coverage of the security versus letting a city be a city, right, letting it breathe, letting us see the city as we know it. And I think Paris has done a pretty good job of that.
 
Obviously, the issue with the trains earlier, clearly there are concerns in our world. But I think Paris is so ready to be able to handle this massive event, but also to be able to show itself to be this incredible city that people are racing to come to, to watch the games.
 
DAVIES:  And, you know, it's the first Olympic Games back on European soil since London in 2012. There were some brilliant moments at the London opening ceremony. David Beckham on a boat down the River Thames. The queen.
 
BRENNAN:  The queen.
 
DAVIES:  Jumping out of a helicopter.
 
BRENNAN:  Paul McCartney.
 
DAVIES:  Paul McCartney, Rio. We had Giselle on the catwalk. What are you expecting from this opening ceremony? They have set their target incredibly high.
 
BRENNAN:  Right. This is unprecedented. Always, it's been in a stadium, as you know, and the security, of course, makes it easy then to have it be in a stadium. So, the fact that it's on a river, arguably the most famous river in the world, certainly one of the top three or four.
 
DAVIES:  The Thames might argue with that.
 
BRENNAN:  That's right. That's what I was keeping out -- I thought the Mississippi, but I don't think I've had even count in the states.
 
DAVIES:  Oh, my God, the Amazon. Too many. Anyway, carry on.
 
BRENNAN:  That's right. But the idea that they're trying this and pulling this off and just the beauty of it, it is breathtaking. And the view, the -- you know, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe behind us here, all playing a part. It's almost like they are characters in this incredible show as the as the president, President Macron, said the other day at a media party at his beautiful home, the Palace, you know, he said, this is Paris. The city is now an open theater. And I love the way that Emmanuel Macron described it.
 
DAVIES:  It'll be fascinating to see whether this becomes the new norm, whether other cities -- you know, we've got the L.A. games coming up. Embrace, this is a moment. But you speak about the characters. Let's talk about the main characters over the next couple of weeks.
 
Somebody we are expecting big moments from, as we have done over the last few games, somebody, you know, Katie Ledecky, but she's not going to have it all her own way.
 
BRENNAN:  Oh, no, she's not. And it's going to happen right away. So, she swam Saturday morning in the 400 freestyle. This is the event she won by a lot. I won't say a mile, but a lot in Rio in 2016. When Katie was in the picture and then no one else was in the picture, I think people remember that. It was amazing. Katie then won the silver three years ago in Tokyo. I think a bronze would be great for her here.
 
Not because she is getting worse, but because all of the wonderful young athletes, the swimmers, the girls who grew up idolizing her are now, of course, racing against her, and they're incredibly competitive. So, I think a bronze tomorrow. But then the 800, the 1,500. Basically, with Katie Ledecky, the longer she swims, the better she does. I expect two golds for her there.
 
DAVIES:  Yes. Ariarne Titmus, Summer McIntosh. 17-year-old Summer McIntosh. I love the fact she's got a tabby cat called Mikey. Named after, guess who? Michael Phelps. But, you know -- and speaking of Michael Phelps, Leon Marchand, the French swimmer. I mean, talk about carrying the hopes of a nation in the pool. 22 years of old, they've not won a gold, the French, in the pool since, well, 12 years ago.
 
BRENNAN:  Right. Exactly. And I think the pressure will be extraordinary. His coach, Bob Bowman, of course, was Michael Phelps, his coach, and that's a wonderful tie in there. He is terrific. He's also had big moments in big meets, the World Championships and CAAs. You know, he is tested. He is ready. He's also beloved. People just think he's the greatest thing ever.
 
I wouldn't be surprised at all if he does very, very well, win several gold medals. But when he does that, if he does that, you know he overcame much more than his competition. He overcame the weight of a nation, which can be -- I remember Cathy Freeman at the Sydney Games in 2000, that is really something for an athlete to take that all on and still win.
 
DAVIES:  Speaking of which, somebody who knows carrying the weight and living up to the expectation. I think it's fair to say there's been a different kind of hype around Simone Biles this time around, given what happened in Tokyo, rightly. Actually, maybe people have learned a few lessons. But let's not kid ourselves, Simone Biles is here to win, isn't she? This is what she's had to say about getting the business done.
 <br>[13:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIMONE BILES, FOUR-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST:  That's kind of the epitome of my career and my life story because I've always rise to the occasion. And even after all of the traumas and the downfalls, I've always risen. No matter what happens, I've still come back and still tried to do everything like full force, full difficulty, like even after Tokyo, come back and I'm here. So, still I rise.

DAVIES:  Still, she rises and in pretty spectacular fashion. She's still -- she's not just here going through the motions. She's, once again, applying for new moves to be named after. I mean, do you think she's going to get the happy ending she wants?
 
BRENNAN:  Oh, I think she is. Yes, I think she is just so good, so much better than the others. And again, when you consider she's 27, she and Katie Ledecky born in the same week in March of 1997. What a week in American sports.
 
But, you know, 27 is not young, of course, in gymnastics. I think she's going to get the gold in the individual all around. I think she will help lead the U.S. team to the gold that they did not get because of the twisties and when she happened to withdraw. And then, she's got at least three of -- I think, three of the four events she could win the gold. It's a tall order, but we hope that everything is working for her, that her mental health is great. And this, I think, is the moment she knows she can get all of that.
 
DAVIES:  Brazil's Rebeca Andrade really wants to have a good games as well, doesn't she? But, I mean, we're running out of time. There's so much to look forward to. Anything we've missed that you're particularly looking forward to?
 
BRENNAN:  You know, you've mentioned the women's Olympics, the women's and the equality, and I think, again, the U.S. teams, the U.S. women's soccer team, can it bounce back after that disappointment in the World Cup? And the U.S. women's basketball team, which has not lost since 1992. The best, greatest team on earth, but it doesn't get a lot of attention. So, there's that, but also just the French and how they will rise to the occasion and put on, I think, terrific games.
 
DAVIES:  And we haven't even mentioned the stars of the track and field. We've got plenty of time to do that as well. Christine, it's been wonderful to speak to you. Enjoy it.
 
BRENNAN:  Thank you. You too.
 
DAVIES:  Let's get cracking. And, you know, we've still got plenty more to come here on the show as well. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, has just been pictured alongside French President Macron. The athletes are starting to gather ahead of the opening ceremony. And one team that is sure to have huge support here, the Ukrainian delegation representing their country in Paris as people back home fight for their freedom. When we come back, my conversation with one of those athletes. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:40:00]
 
DAVIES:  Welcome back. The Paris 2024 opening ceremony is underway. The iconic parade of teams has started. As is tradition, the Greek team entering first and, of course, entering in a very different style this time around, on a boat, down the River Seina. Proudly waving their flags. Always a proud moment for the athletes ahead of the action.
 
But this year, for the Ukrainian team at these games, it will mean more than most. Having made it here to Paris with their country having been a war for the last two and a half years since Russia's full-scale invasion. Their president, Zelenskyy, doesn't plan, we understand, on traveling to Paris as things stand. But he has sent a message of support to his athletes.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  It's already an achievement for Ukrainians that despite the war and full- scale Russian terror, we have prepared and are participating in the games. Our flag and anthem will be in France, alongside all other nations that respect life and the principles of Olympism.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVIES:  Well, I got a little taste of what some of these athletes have been through when I traveled to Ukraine. For their national championships, their qualifiers for the games here in Paris last month, seeing the cemetery where some of the 489 athletes and coaches who've been killed since the start of the war are buried, giving an entirely different meaning to that phrase we so often use in sport, fighting for victory.
 
Speaking to a team who, without exception, have had their lives impacted by the war, the loss of their homes or friends or relatives. And in the case of 400-meter hurdler, Viktoriia Tkachuk, qualifying for her third Olympic Games with her brother Ivan fighting on the front line.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVIES:  How did it feel? What was your reaction when your brother was called up to the front line?
 
VIKTORIIA TKACHUK, TWO-TIME OLYMPIC 400M HURDLER:  It was last May. May of last year, and we were thinking, oh, no, he's not ready yet. He cannot go there. But we were doing our best to support him because if he's worrying, and then he will feel our worries.
 
I was printing the small pictures for him like from Polaroids. And he has on his pockets, close to heart and like small pictures with like our together, our family. And he said these pictures always with him. And it's also nice to know this. But when he helps me with the -- my leg, just to the train station, I was sitting in my train already and I saw him through the window and I realized that I really don't know if I will see him again, and that would hurt.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVIES:  That was Viktoriia Tkachuk. And as the head of world athletics Seb Coe put it, this may be the smallest Ukrainian delegation, but arguably, the most important. They are determined to keep their country's fights at the forefront of people's minds by doing what they can on the sporting front with hopes, particularly for high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh one of the worst affected areas of Ukraine, of Dnipro.
 
She broke a 37-year-old world record here in Paris just two weeks ago and is aiming to turn that form into gold and hear her anthem as she gets that medal around her neck.
 
But speaking of world records, U.S. sprint sensation Noah Lyles has set his sights, not only on gold, multiple golds, but Usain Bolt's sprint world records as well. So, let's cross live back to Coy Wire, just down there, under the Arc de Triomphe for us. And Coy, you've been catching up somehow. I know you're quick, but possibly not that quick with the world's fastest man. And he is a man on a serious mission, isn't he?
 <br>[13:45:00]
 
WIRE:  Yes, I definitely wouldn't be catching up with him now after three straight nights of Escargot, Steak Frites and Bordeaux, Amanda. But I did catch up with the fastest man on the planet, six-time world champ Noah Lyles ahead of the game. Larger than life personality. He's got this prize fighter mentality. I talked to him about the height of the expectations and the pressure ahead of these games. I asked him, what is fear?
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NOAH LYLES, TOKYO 2020 200M BRONZE MEDALIST AND FIVE CAREER WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS GOLD MEDALS:  I'm all about making moments. Big moments. I want to do things that nobody has done. And that mentality goes to the idea of, if I shoot for the stars, if I fall, I land on the clouds.
 
WIRE:  Three words to describe Noah Lyles.
 
LYLES:  Creative, inspirational, icon.
 
WIRE (voice-over):  Some people are destined for greatness. Noah Lyles grew up a sprinting prodigy, turning pro as a teenager with aspirations of chasing Olympic gold.
 
LYLES:  I remember when I saw my first Olympics and I was like, oh, that's cool. Because so many family members and close friends were already Olympians. So, in my head, I thought becoming an Olympian was like getting a driver's license. It just happens when you're ready to get it. You know, not everybody has a driver's license, but most people have it. If you want to go get it, you just go get it. That's how, you know, when I was younger, I viewed it.
 
But when I tried to make it in 2021, I was like, oh, this is hard. This is difficult. You know, this is not as easy as, you know, it was made to seem.
 
WIRE:  What does it mean to you to be the fastest man on the planet?
 
LYLES:  Personally, I always knew it was me. It's more for everybody else. It's more like proofless, like, you know, I've been telling you all this and now, I have the title. It's like, see, I told you. One of those situations.
 
WIRE:  You're witty, you're outspoken. How do you feel you've brought the fire back to this sport?
 
LYLES:  Just be me. If you want to have more of an outside presence besides just running, just be you. Show people you. I know that everybody can't do that because everybody has different personalities, but that's what people gravitate towards. They gravitate to the stories, they gravitate to the personalities, and people just want to, you know, say, oh, I see a little bit of me in that person.
 
WIRE:  Watch this. What is fear?
 
LYLES:  I think it's better to say, what is bravery? Because a lot of people say bravery and fear are two sides of the same coin. But when you have bravery, it's not the absence of fear, but the ability to hack fear and still go into the unknown, knowing that it's there.
 
WIRE:  How big do you dream?
 
LYLES:  The impossible. Truly. I think of something and it's like, OK, has somebody done this? OK, if somebody hasn't done this, why haven't they do it? Why can't I be the first to do it? And how can we make this happen? So, it's just pushing that envelope along of, OK, let's see how far we can go
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE (on camera):  Amanda, I love how he went from thinking it was just going to be easy to become an Olympian, thinking everything in life comes easy, right? Then he quickly realized how hard he was going to have to work. He sacrificed, dedicated his life, took home bronze in the 200 at the last Summer Olympics. But this time, he says, including the relays, he plans to take home four gold medals for Team USA here at these games.
 
I'm going to try my hardest not to make it four straight nights of Escargot, steak frites, and Bordeaux for me, because otherwise, I'm going to need some new shirts by the time we're done here in Paris.
 
DAVIES:  Well, I tell you what, instead of doing that, Coy, I think you need to cast a glance at what's going on on the River Seine. We still haven't seen Celine Dion, but Lady Gaga has turned up, looking resplendent in some black and pink feathers surrounded by the dancers. Definitely, it will be one of those moments that we remember from this opening ceremony. For now, Coy, thank you very much indeed.
 
Coming up though, millions of sports fans are expected to be here in Paris over the next two weeks from across the world. And after the break, we'll have some vital advice for them, like how to act like a local. And we'll bring you the sport making its debut at the Games.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:50:00]
 
DAVIES:  Welcome back. So, much focus over the next couple of weeks. We'll be on the pool, the track and the field here in Paris, but we're also set to enjoy and celebrate some new events like breaking, better known as a break dancing. Paris organizers are hoping it will help bring in some younger fans. And Melissa Bell has all the details on how breaking made it from the streets to becoming an Olympic sport.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL (voice-over):  From the sidewalks and subways of the South Bronx to the Paris Olympics, breakdancing is about to take center stage.
 
MENNO VAN GORP "BBOY MENNO", DUTCH BREAKDANCER:  It's not like the Olympics picked us up from the street and be like, hey, what those guys doing on the street is nice. Let's grab this. You know, we already really set also our community on a huge platform ourselves
 
BELL (voice-over):  A huge platform that's already global from the U.S. to France, Pakistan, India, Libya, and Yemen. And for a dance that is highly competitive judged along specific criteria.
 
SOFIANE KINZI "BBOY SOSO", FRENCH NATIONAL BREAKDANCING TEAM COACH: Originality, execution, musicality, technique, and vocabulary. So, you need to be the most complete and you dance show you master all part from breaking and to mix all and to make the best demonstration (ph) at the moment with the music.
 
BELL (voice-over):  Now, breakdancing is coming to the Place de la Concorde, where battles will be held at the very end of the Paris Games. France's team is working on its moves and its confidence.
 
NOE SOBESKY, BBOY NEOSAN", FRENCH BREAKDANCER:  You just have to be the most connected to the moment possible. I think that's the key for me during a battle is forget everything and just face the opponent and be there, hear the music, look at the crowd, look at the judges, and enjoy the moment.
 
BELL (voice-over):  A far cry from its early beginnings and an opportunity for the world to discover just how far breakdancing has come.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVIES:  Well, breakdancing isn't the only part of Paris culture for the estimated 15 million visitors to get their heads around over the next couple of weeks. From your fromage to the faux pas to avoid. Here's a guide from CNN Saskya Vandoorne.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SASKYA VANDOORNE, CNN SR. PRODUCER:  Ah, Paris. Millions of people flock here every year for the culture, couture, cuisine. But how do you avoid being a cliche?
 
Well, this summer, the Olympics are coming to town and in a city that 7.5 times smaller than New York, trust me, it's easy to spot a tourist. There are a few simple ways to navigate Paris like a local. I'll be your guide. Suivez-moi.
 
A classic faux pas, asking for alternative milk with your coffee.
 
VANDOORNE (through translator):  Almond Milk, please
 <br>[13:55:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (through translator):  Sorry, madam, I don't have almond milk here.
 
VANDOORNE:  Short and black. That's the traditional way. Craving a baguette. What you really want to order at your boulangerie is-- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  The tradition.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  The tradition. The Tradition.
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  Tradition bread every day. Tradition, tradition.
 
VANDOORNE:  Merci beaucoup. Tra-dee-si-on
 
Those in the know will avoid traveling by car. Paris traffic is notoriously chaotic. Use a Veline, the city's public bike-sharing service. They're pretty much everywhere and cycle lanes are plentiful.
 
The city's metros are often super congested. And in the summer, unbearably hot. So, try walking instead.
 
In Paris, it's easy to get distracted, but beware of pickpockets. Don't keep your phone in your back pocket and do keep an eye on your belongings.
 
If you're lucky enough to be here for the Games, the first thing to know is that tourist sites like these have been turned into Olympic venues. So, it's probably best to avoid them.
 
Places like Trocadero near the Eiffel Tower, or right here at Place de la Concorde, metro stations will be closed and areas will be shut off to the public.
 
Make sure you know how to pronounce the event venues properly. This place is called Les Invalides.
 
It's a former military hospital. It's pronounced Ahn-vah-leed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Les Invalides.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Je dis Invalides.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Les Invalides.
 
VANDOORNE:  Not Invalides. And lastly, know how to refer to the Olympic Games like a local. Les J.O. JO, for Jeux Olympiques.
 
A lot of young people live in the east. That's the cool hipster area. Great for a glass of wine on a terrace or some nightlife. The French capital's skyline is a familiar sight and the Eiffel Tower might be its most famous icon. Try one of its many rooftops instead. That way, you're only a stone's throw away from some of these other stunning landmarks. Sante.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVIES:  Ashante. Saskya, putting my French pronunciations to shame. The celebration of France, Paris, and this iconic city goes on. The teams are making their way down the River Seine and the delegation.
 
Botswana currently in action in the next couple of hours. The Olympic cauldron will officially be lit. And as they say, that is when the games will really begin. We will be here every step I hope you can join us. Goodbye.
