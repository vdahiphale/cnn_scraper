AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CNN THIS MORNING. It is Sunday, April 9th. I'm Amara Walker.
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Victor Blackwell. Thank you for spending part of your Easter Sunday with us. I don't -- I don't really remember the Easter speeches from childhood. I just know I gave a lot of them.
 
WALKER: Did you?
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, there were Easter speeches. I remember that.
 
WALKER: I want to hear some of that.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, maybe in a break.
 
All right. Here's what we're watching this morning. A weekend of religious celebrations but also escalating tensions in the Middle East. The Israeli military has carried out retaliatory attacks in Syria, and we're live in Jerusalem, with the latest on that.
 
WALKER: Happening now, Pope Francis delivering his Easter message after presiding over mass at the Vatican. His message to the world is coming up.
 
BLACKWELL: The Department of Justice is investigating after trove of apparent U.S. intelligence documents were posted on social media. What the documents show and the potential implications for the U.S. and its allies.
 
WALKER: An Oklahoma death row inmate who has been served his last meal three times may soon have his murder conviction vacated. The reason the state attorney general says he can no longer stand behind the conviction.
 
And we begin with the reaction pouring in from one side of Capitol Hill this morning. While the Republicans stay mostly silent Democrats are furious over a Texas judge's ruling to suspend the FDA approval of a drug used in medication abortions.
 
BLACKWELL: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called it an awful, extreme and unprecedented decision. Senator John Fetterman slammed the ruling as another attempt by Republicans to impose a nationwide abortion ban. CNN's Alayna Treene has more from Washington.
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Democrats immediately started railing against the court's decision once it was announced, and some like Senator Ron Wyden and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez went so far as to say that President Biden should ignore the ruling altogether.
 
Now Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have been far less outspoken and many have been virtually silent on the issue, and that's something that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pointed out on a press call Saturday morning. Here's what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER (on the phone): I think the Republicans know that these -- their decisions, the Dobbs decision, the court decision, are wildly unpopular with the American people. They're probably, at least in some of the survey data unpopular with a large number of Republicans. So they are afraid to speak out, but that is outrageous.
 
(END AUDIO CLIP)
 
TREENE: Now, I will argue that Schumer's press call was on a Saturday during a holiday weekend, so I'm not sure how many Republicans were actually playing close attention to him. But Schumer's point was valid. This is very tricky territory for Republicans to navigate. Abortion in the wake of the Dobbs decision has not been a winning message for them. And we saw that very clearly in the 2022 midterm elections.
 
As for what Congress can do, they don't have many options. The bills that they want to pass are essentially dead on arrival. They can and have already begun applying pressure on the Biden administration to appeal the ruling, but legislatively, there really isn't much that Congress can do.
 
Schumer has said, however, that Senate Democrats remain committed to passing the Women's Health Protection Act, which is a bill aimed at preserving abortion access nationwide, but that legislation failed to pass last year due to the balance of power in Congress and remains unlikely to pass now given Republicans control the House and Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate. Victor, Amara.
 
BLACKWELL: Alayna Treene, thanks so much. Israel says it has carried out airstrikes in Syrian territory, and this is the latest escalation of violence following the Israeli police raids on the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem last week. Israel's defense forces released video it says shows strikes on a Syrian military compound, radar systems and artillery posts. WALKER: Israel says it launched the strikes after rockets were fired from Syria toward Israeli controlled territory. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joining us now from Jerusalem. And, Salma, this latest escalation of violence taking place is three different faiths observe traditions within the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, a very busy and tense morning here, if you will, within the walls of the Old City. Of course, here in Jerusalem three different religious holidays overlapping there. You had, of course, Easter mass taking place. You also had Ramadan prayers taking place at that very contentious Al-Aqsa mosque compound. As is tradition, Muslims were doing overnight prayers at Al-Aqsa mosque last night.
 <br>[06:05:04]
 
And there was a moment of tension it seemed where Israeli authorities were accusing youth of barricading themselves inside that mosque. Jordan, which is the protectorate of the Al-Aqsa mosque complex, was quick to respond to those allegations, warning that if Israel raided the mosque again, remember it was raided on Wednesday twice by Israeli police, Jordan warning that if it was raided again that it would have catastrophic consequences.
 
Thankfully, that did pass peacefully, those overnight prayers. But this morning, Palestinian Muslims saying -- some of those eyewitnesses telling us they weren't allowed to enter for dawn prayers. At the same time in that -- again that very contentious complex, that flashpoint complex known as Haram Al Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims, known as Temple Mount to Jews. On that complex site, there were Jewish visitors this morning, coinciding at the same time as these Muslim prayers.
 
These Jewish visitors were under a heavy police presence. And again, thankfully, that passed peacefully. There were also prayers that just wound down about an hour ago, very important prayers for Passover, called the Priestly Blessings on the western wall. Those also passed peacefully. But you have to remember the wider context that all of these religious holidays are taking place in this period of escalating violence, escalating tensions.
 
I know you mentioned, of course, the rocket fire coming from Syria. What that really does is widen this area of concern, if you will. Already this latest escalation has included Gaza, southern Lebanon, terror attacks in Tel Aviv. Now, of course, the addition of Syria. But it comes to show you just again this one contentious spot, the Old City, the Temple Mount, the Noble Sanctuary, if anything further continues in that area, if anything is perceived to be a violation, or a change of that status quo, how quickly it devolves and pulls in that region.
 
But again, peaceful prayer gatherings this morning, but everyone continues to hold their breath because this is absolutely a time of worry and concern.
 
BLACKWELL: It certainly is. Salma Abdelaziz for us. Thanks so much. Let's go now to CNN's Scott McLean, who joins us now from Lebanon. Scott, in addition to the Syrian targets hit Israel as we know hit targets in southern Lebanon. What's the latest there?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Victor. Yes. So we've just found out that the leader of the Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah has met with the leader of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, to discuss what has been taking place in Jerusalem at that Al- Aqsa mosque, and the readiness of the -- what they described as the resistance access to respond to what has happened.
 
Now, Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for any of the rocket fire into Israel nor are they even being blamed. The Israelis, the Lebanese government, they are blaming Palestinian militant groups. But Hezbollah has such a huge influence on this country that what they say may well set the tone for what actually happens next.
 
In the meantime, it is the job of the Lebanese military to try to prevent any potential future attacks in southern Lebanon to try to locate rockets or rocket launchers and to try to keep some of the militant groups at bay. And yesterday we went to southern Lebanon and frankly realized very quickly how difficult this task is with all of the militant factions. And also, on a more practical level, all the potential good hiding places for weapons amidst the orchards and the hills. There are also there plenty of people who have an ax to grind with Israel, frankly.
 
We went to one of the sites that Israel struck, and we found some locals who made no apologies about rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel. In fact, I asked one man if he wanted peace with Israel, and he said, of course, not.
 
Not everyone feels that way, obviously. It's a different story when you talk to the farmer down the road whose family was sleeping about 200 yards away from one Israeli strike, a strike that had so much impact it left a crater that you could easily fit several cars inside. He actually fled Syria to escape this kind of war. The last thing he wants to see is it follows him into Lebanon.
 
And one other thing to mention and that's -- that we also went to the town that the Lebanese military says that some of these rockets were fired from or at least in that vicinity. And we couldn't find anyone there who wanted to talk to us on camera. But we did speak off camera to one guy who said that -- look, he's not on board with what has happened. He doesn't want to see any kind of escalation. In fact, he says, look, when I see my kid is terrified, frankly, so am I. Victor, Amara.
 
BLACKWELL: Scott, we know that the Israelis have said that they do not want this to escalate. They do not want war. And the early reporting was that they avoided specific Hezbollah targets. Do we know the significance of what was hit days later?
 
MCLEAN: Yes. So, on the surface it doesn't really look like these were all that significant.
 <br>[06:10:01]
 
In fact, it looks quite benign. But upon further inspection, having been in that area, one of the sites was a bridge that went over a new irrigation canal again. Again, these are places that the Israelis say potentially had weapons or militant groups operating there. This bridge potentially, you could hide weapons under. We don't know. The locals say this wouldn't have been a good place to hide them. There were no way weapons there.
 
The other spot was in an orchard. And we know from pictures released by the Lebanese military that there have been rocket launchers, even as recently as yesterday, found amongst some of the groves and orchards in this area, which are really all over the place and provide plenty of good cover. So, the Israelis, yes, have been very careful to make clear in their targeting and what they've said as well that they are not going after Hezbollah. They are going after these Palestinian militant groups that operate in this area because, of course, there's refugee camps there that have been there for decades and a noticeable presence of Palestinian militants.
 
If there were to be a tip for tap with Hezbollah, obviously, the stakes would be much greater because they are frankly a much more formidable fighting force that poses a much greater threat to the Israelis.
 
WALKER: As we know too internally Lebanon has been dealing with a lot of political instabilities. Of course, it just exacerbates the daily lives and the uncertainty for many people there. Scott McLean, thank you very much.
 
BLACKWELL: The Justice Department is launching an investigation into how and what appeared to be classified documents ended up on social media. What we know about what's in the documents and the concerns from American allies. That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:15:44]
 
BLACKWELL: If you celebrate, Happy Easter to you. Live pictures here. You see? Obviously, it's Pope Francis. This is St Peter's Square in Vatican City. The Pope is delivering his Easter message to the faithful who have gathered there.
 
WALKER: The pope arrived in a wheelchair this morning. He is still recovering from a bout of bronchitis that sent him to the hospital late last month. CNN's Delia Gallagher joining us now live from St. Peter's Square. How is the pope doing?
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well you know, Amara, I think you can see he's in good spirits all things considered. I mean, he only got out of the hospital last Saturday for bronchitis. But certainly today, Easter Sunday, we've seen the Pope at his best. He's been around already. The mass is finished. He's giving his Urbi et Orbi blessing that's to the city and to the world. I just want to share with you a few of the things that the pope has said. This is an address when he speaks about conflicts in the world, and he mentioned in particular, help the beloved people of Ukraine on their journey towards peace, shed the light of Easter on the people of Russia. The pope said he also prayed that prisoners may be returned to their families. And, of course, for families who have lost loved ones during the war.
 
He also mentioned the resumption of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, and mentioned conflicts around the world in Syria, Lebanon, Myanmar and various African countries. This is the moment when the pope makes a comment about peace in the world.
 
As you can imagine some of those themes for the pope, very important health wise. He missed a Friday evening event at the Colosseum, the Via Crucis, the Way of the Cross, because it was at 9:00 at night, very cold in Rome. The Vatican said due to the intense cold the pope was not going to be there. Probably a wise decision for an 86-year-old getting over bronchitis. But he has managed to make all of the other holy week events. It has been a very busy week for Pope Francis.
 
Obviously, his mobility is still a problem. He goes around in a wheelchair. He can't stand for very long periods of time. But certainly, we've seen him in good spirits these days. Amara, Victor.
 
WALKER: That is good to hear. Delia Gallagher, thank you. Well new this morning, the Department of Justice has opened an investigation into a trove of leaked U.S. intelligence documents that have been posted on social media in recent weeks. The latest batch of documents surfaced online Friday and cover topics ranging from the war in Ukraine to information about key U.S. allies like Israel.
 
BLACKWELL: Even more concerning, the leak appears to include classified documents, some even marked top secret, the highest level of classification. CNN's national security correspondent Kylie Atwood has details.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The Department of Justice has now opened an investigation into this apparent trove of classified U.S. documents that have appeared on social media sites in recent weeks. And these documents cover a wide range of topics like U.S. support for Ukraine, South Korean officials' concerns about providing ammunition to the United States that could then be given to Ukraine to be used in the Ukraine war, UAE, United Arab Emirates' ties to Russia, information having to do with U.S. allies such as Israel.
 
Now, we don't know the source of these leaks and we also can't independently verify that these documents haven't been altered in some way. But they do appear similar to the initial trove of documents having to do with the U.S. support for Ukraine that caught attention earlier in the week. And U.S. officials did confirm that those documents appeared to be authentic.
 
Now, in addition to the Department of Justice opening this investigation, the Pentagon says they are looking into the matter. And looking at these documents is pretty surreal because they are photos of crumpled up pieces of paper that have classified markings on them. Some holding top secret markings, which is the highest level of classification. Some holding markings of the office at the Pentagon that advises President Biden. So obviously creating quite a bit of alarm among U.S. officials, particularly at the Pentagon.
 
Kylie Atwood, CNN, Washington.
 
WALKER: Here with me now is CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem.
 <br>[06:20:02]
 
Good morning to you, Juliette. I know this has been alarming for many of the Pentagon officials. And you say this is a different kind of national security leak. How so?
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Yes. Just, you know -- look, if you look at the history of sort of what we would call these, like leaked dumps, you know you're sort of lots of papers coming out -- I mean, say, for example, compared to the Pentagon papers, these were just put online with a potentially no fanfare over the course of -- actually, they've been online for over a month. They're not validated by any, what you might call, sort of establishment reporters or media that could determine what their veracity is and whether they have been altered.
 
But the second thing is that they really don't touch on any malfeasance by the United States. I mean, in other words, you know, maybe you could have an argument that, you know, you released classified documents, if it shows that we're doing something illegal or lying about the war, say, Iraq or Vietnam, these basically are sort of what we understand them to be are essentially sources and methods in terms of how we collect information. They are about data and numbers that there's no reason to believe that they're inaccurate, and they've often been reported by the Pentagon.
 
And finally, they are about an ongoing conflict. So, you don't have some historical perspective say you had in Vietnam or some of the classified information that was released about the Iraq War. I mean, these are ongoing intelligence assessments. So, a lot of damage can be done because we have -- there's a war going on, and we are distributing military equipment.
 
WALKER: Yes. Well, I want to talk about that more in a second, but to your first point about the fact that this had been posted on the social media site Discord in early March, and no one noticed until now. I mean, that's alarming as well.
 
But, Juliette, the range of intelligence information that was leaked, right, some with top secret classification. And the fact that the documents were about Ukraine were apparently meant for high level officials. They were part of this larger daily intelligence briefing deck for Pentagon leadership as we understand it. I mean, could this have only come from the inside.
 
KAYYEM: Yes. I -- having looked at what was released, the documentation, how it's recorded, how it's memorialized, and the -- and some of its dating and it's information at the top, this is -- the more likely explanation is that this comes from some sort of United States intelligence leak. And it would be essentially a first in the sense of current presidential daily briefings that are given to the top leadership within the White House and the Pentagon. And the State Department and other agencies are close hold. They are not distributed throughout the agencies.
 
This isn't information that's collected on the ground. This is the top level analysis information. If it comes from the presidential daily brief, that is a breach of trust across the board. It is why we're hearing that the Joint Chiefs are very concerned because they are the ones who essentially compile that information.
 
So we've got -- we've got an external problem in terms of the information that was released and an internal one. Who did this? Why did they do it the way they did? And then what are the consequences of it for today? Not some historical analysis.
 
WALKER: Yes. Obviously, that would be part of the DOJ investigation as to who and the motive and to them --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KAYYEM: Absolutely.
 
WALKER: -- party. What stood out to me was there was, I think, one document about Ukraine that was posted on 4chan, that web forum mostly used by extremists. That appeared on another messaging site Telegram and U.S. officials believe in that second posting the document was altered, right, to make it look like the number of Ukrainians killed in the war was far higher than the reality. Does that make you think Russia could have a role in this? Or does it give you pause, considering both versions of these documents were made available as opposed just to the falsified one?
 
KAYYEM: Right. So, I think it's two separate issues. You just have the basic information, right, which was released. And at least what we understand from the reporting at this stage, this information that was released without any alterations was likely valid. The Pentagon is essentially saying that. And then you have Russia or some other entity coming in to make the war look worse for Ukraine. So, that's in a political agenda.
 
Was the person within the United States part of that political agenda? In other words, is this a release that is meant to say the war is not going very well for the Ukrainians, it's going better for the Russians? And then be part of a political discussion that we're having here that the Europeans are having. And then, of course, what's happening in Russia and Ukraine that would create some false narrative about how the war is going on.
 <br>[06:25:03]
 
Look, you know, we've got a political battle here about continuing support, the Europeans do as well. One of the reasons why we are able to continue to get support for the Ukrainians is because of their successes. Someone clearly wants to undermine that narrative. And so, you look to the political agenda, whether from Russia or someone in the United States.
 
WALKER: Yes. And the fact that these documents being released or leaked in real time, you say, is obviously harmful, especially to what's happening in Ukraine right now. Juliette Kayyem, will leave it there. Thank you.
 
BLACKWELL: Still ahead, a complicated path to the presidency. Republican hopefuls and trying to navigate a tricky landscape after former President Trump's indictment. Has the indictment made it harder for Trump opponents to win the nomination?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WALKER: The road to the White House has grown even more complicated for Republican presidential contenders after Donald Trump's historic indictment.
 <br>[06:30:02]
 
BLACKWELL: Top GOP rivals considering a run are coming to the Former President's defense to avoid antagonizing his loyal supporters. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more now. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): They plan to run against him. 
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): The winners get to make policy. The losers go home. 
 
ZELENY: And believed Republicans were ready to turn the page.
 
NIKKI HALEY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you're tired of losing, put your trust in a new generation.
 
ZELENY: Yet, at the end of a historic week in American politics -- 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it. 
 
ZELENY: Donald Trump's top GOP challengers are suddenly on his side after falling into line and blasting criminal charges against the former president.
 
DESANTIS: You see this guy in Manhattan, and this district attorney, they're weaponizing the prosecutorial power to advance a political agenda. Maybe it's targeting a politician they don't like. 
 
ZELENY: Republican rivals fear their opening against Trump may have closed a bit after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's indictment on 34 counts. ALVIN BRAGG, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY: These are felony crimes in
 
 New York State no matter who you are. 
 
ZELENY: It prompted a storm of outrage even from some of Trump's fiercest critics like Senator Mitt Romney who called it a dangerous precedent, saying, "I believe President Trump's character and conduct make him unfit for office. Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda." 
 
With Republican wagons circling around Trump, or at least against his indictment, it's unclear when the window to forcefully challenges candidacy will open again or who will dare to try. 
 
HALEY: The liberal prosecutor that's doing political revenge against a former president. I mean, that's not a precedent that you want to have. 
 
ZELENY: Not long ago, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis did tiptoe around a critique of Trump's predicament with Stormy Daniels. 
 
DESANTIS: I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair. I just -- I can't speak to that. 
 
ZELENY: Before quickly dropping any references to porn stars and hush money and simply going on the attack against the New York prosecutor. When asked Friday whether the indictment influenced his plans to run, DeSantis answered like this.
 
DESANTIS: It's affected me in the sense that it's reinforced this problem we have in our country where we have the political left weaponizing the rule of law, actually abandoning the rule of law by weaponizing it and using against people they don't like. And that needs to stop in this country. 
 
ZELENY: And unorthodox presidential primary becomes even more so. Advisors to republican campaigns tell CNN the biggest risk of all is to get crosswise with voters deeply loyal to Trump, who once again is dominating and overshadowing the race. 
 
TRUMP: This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election. And it should be dropped immediately. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ZELENY (on camera): Even though Former President Trump has effectively frozen this Republican race into place, at least for now, the show must go on. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who's running against Trump, is going to Iowa next week to campaign. And Senator Tim Scott is also dipping his toe into the waters traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire as he decides whether to jump into this race. There is no doubt the 2024 campaign has been changed dramatically by the Trump indictment. It's an open question, though, if that Trump exhaustion out there among so many Republican voters does still exist. 
 
Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington. 
 
BLACKWELL: And Jeff, thank you for that report. 
 
Let's discuss now with CNN Political Analyst and Princeton University Historian and Professor Julian Zelizer. Julian, good to see you. Typically, I come to you for some historical example that informs this moment. I don't think there is one for a primary that now includes a former president who's been indicted, but let's look at the latest CNN poll here. 
 
Six out of 10 Americans support the indictment. Roughly that. 62 percent of Independent support it. So, Trump is holding strong in the party, but within the party how much does electability beyond the primary matter to these voters?
 
JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well as of now, that doesn't seem to be the top consideration, a former president running for reelection indicted, and he ends the week more popular than ever before. He's rallied Republicans around him. He has crafted his message in some ways of once again him fighting the establishment. And it seems at least now, the Republican voters are more focused on that than questions of general election electability. Primaries come first and primary is usually determined where this all goes. 
 <br>[06:35:00]
 
BLACKWELL: And how about the lesson of 2016, though, when Republicans after -- at least those anti-Trump Republican candidates said that maybe they waited too long to just square up with Trump directly and take him on. Is that supposed to be happening at this point in the process? Should we be waiting deeper into the summer, into the fall? 
 
ZELIZER: Well, I don't know when that's going to happen. I think it's like waiting for Goodell. It's just not coming. It didn't come in 2016, and I'm not convinced that's going to happen now. I think they are more scared of him now than they were back in the 2015-2016 period. He's more formidable. He has a bigger platform. So, I don't -- I don't expect many of them to go after him. 
 
The question is what happens if there are more indictments on issues that are more politically problematic, including the case in Georgia? And so, that's really where we're going to get a gauge if there's ever going to be any serious never Trumpism within the Republican Party.
 
BLACKWELL: All right, let's turn to the Democrats now. President Biden obviously has not yet announced reelection. Privately, CNN's reporting is that he says he is definitely running. However, he's not chosen a campaign manager. He's not chosen the location of his campaign headquarters. The date of the announcement is still up in the air. Although he says he's definitely running, is there some byproduct of the delay of the announcement from the president although people know it's coming? 
 
ZELIZER: Well, I mean, it creates space for a Democrat to potentially step in the more you wait and to say that they want to mount the primary challenge. But as of now, the Democratic field is pretty quiet and I think they're waiting for him to announce, even if it comes a little later than they expect on paper. Despite questions about his stamina and age, he's still remains a pretty formidable incumbent just on paper. And I don't think the delay is really going to have a big effect on his candidacy.
 
BLACKWELL: Your latest piece for CNN.com focuses on the Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. ProPublica reported this week that he has traveled for decades lavishly on the dime of mega-donor, a Republican supporter who he also calls a friend. He released it a lengthy statement saying that he reported as he told he was supposed to. Those disclosure rules are changing, and he will abide by those. 
 
He's not recused himself from the January 6th cases, although his wife has tried to undermine elections. This is a lifetime appointment. So, what do we do with all this information? There likely will not be any impeachment of Justice Thomas. So, what now? 
 
ZELIZER: Well, look, there is the Thomas question, the question about what happens to him, but there's the revelation for many Americans. There are no ethics codes guiding the Supreme Court justices. A lot of this is about informal guardrails and justice is making the right decision. 
 
And I think what the story reveals is there's a lot of room not to make the right decision. So, I think there needs to be a conversation about the Supreme Court. And if not the Supreme Court, Congress through legislation creating some form of ethics codes as other federal judges are subject to so that this kind of behavior is not permissible, and if it happens, there's -- there are penalties.
 
But we don't have that right now, so there is actually a lot of space for Justice Thomas to engage in this kind of relationship. And I think we need to look at the structures of the codes, not just at the individual. 
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. And as we had a guest on yesterday from Fix The Court who says that he wishes actually there was more liberal justice who did the same thing so it wouldn't be in a partisan framework that these rules could actually be in place. But that's not in place, so likely things won't change in the near term.
 
Julian Zelizer, thanks so much. 
 
WALKER: Still ahead, after spending a quarter of a century in prison and avoiding execution three times, the murder conviction of a death row inmate in Oklahoma could be vacated. That is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:40:00]
 
BLACKWELL: Oklahoma's attorney general is now asking to vacate the murder conviction of death row inmate Richard Glossip. Glossip has spent the past 25 years in prison for the death of his boss.
 
WALKER: But now, the attorney general and an independent review have found that several factors cast doubt on that conviction. CNN's Ed Lavandera takes a closer look at the case. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): In almost 25 years on death row, Richard Glossip has stared down an execution date nine times. He's been served his last meal three times before getting last-minute reprieves. But Oklahoma's attorney general now says he can no longer stand behind Glossip's murder conviction and his asking the state's court of criminal appeals to give Glossip a new trial. 
 
And how did Richard Glossip react? 
 
DON KNIGHT, ATTORNEY FOR RICHARD GLOSSIP: I'll never forget that look, you know, of realization that hey, you know, finally somebody into the state is listening. And you know, now he has a chance. 
 
LAVANDERA: Glossip was sentenced to death for the 1997 murder of his boss, Barry Van Treese. They worked at a motel in Oklahoma City. But it was another employee, Justin Sneed, who admitted to killing Van Treese. Sneed who is serving a life sentence was spared the death penalty in exchange for testifying that Glossip offered to pay him for the killing. 
 
The Oklahoma attorney general says Sneed is a compromised witness, though. An independent investigation found that prosecutors destroyed and withheld evidence from Glossip's defense attorneys. There's also evidence that Sneed regretted his testimony. In letters, he writes, "Do I have the choice of recanting my testimony?" And "there are a lot of things right now that are eating at me. Some things I need to clean up."
 
RICHARD GLOSSIP, ACCUSED OF MURDER: All you can have is hope. It's like having a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, finally. 
 
LAVANDERA: Earlier this year, Richard Glossip spoke with CNN from death row about the psychological toll of fighting to get state officials to hear his pleas of innocence. 
 
GLOSSIP: Knowing that you're going to die just eats at you and eats at you. I've tried to do everything in my power to avoid that from happening. I've been through this so many times, but it's still scary. It will always be scary until they find the door and let me go. 
 
LAVANDERA: Oklahoma's attorney general and the independent council he appointed both say calls to give Glossip a new trial doesn't mean they believe he's innocent, but that there must be absolute faith that the death penalty is administered fairly and with certainty. 
 
Right now, with this news, this is probably the greatest sense of relief he's experienced in years. 
 
KNIGHT: We have real hope for the first time in a long time, and rich certainly feels incredible sense of hope for the future and anxiety over what might come next.

LAVANDERA: It's not exactly clear when the Oklahoma court of criminal appeals will determine the fate of Richard Glossip, but we know that as of now his execution is slated for May 18th. And we also know that there is at least one Republican lawmaker in Oklahoma who says he will try to abolish the death penalty in that state if Richard Glossip's execution were to go forward. Victor and Amara?
 
BLACKWELL: Ed Lavandera, thank you. 
 
Coming up, an emotional reunion in Ukraine. Dozens of children reunited with their families after spending months in Russia. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:50:00]
 
WALKER: A father and his 11-year-old daughter were killed overnight as a Russian strike partially destroyed a residential building in the city of Zaporizhzhia. That is according to Ukraine's state emergency service. 
 
BLACKWELL: It's one of several Russian attacks on settlements in the region over the last day that have destroyed and damaged buildings and homes. There is also this. CNN was their children who were allegedly deported to Russian territories were reunited with their families. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins us live now from Kyiv with the story. 
 
And listen, of course, we covered when there were the charges from the International Criminal Court that were against this program of taking children from Ukraine to Russia. And now we're seeing some of those children reunited with their families. 
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Indeed a moment of jubilation despite this exceptionally dark moment in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in which Ukraine charges 20,000 children have been forcibly deported to occupied areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself. 
 
Now, over the past weeks, a Ukrainian NGO has taken some parents of those children who have been deported through a circuitous route up through Belarus, through Russia proper, then background again into occupied Ukraine to try and get some of those children back. 13 parents and the last group taking out 31 children. In fact, you see pictures there of the joyous reunification of some who have not seen their child for months. 
 
We met Irina and Bogdan, age 13, mother and son from Kherson. And this is how they described their months apart. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We were driving here for nearly a week. And I met my mother for the first time in six months. We went to the summit camp for two weeks, but we've got stuck there for six months. Why should I cry now? But I cried when I saw my mom from the bus. I'm very happy to be back.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): There was no phone connection. I was very worried. I didn't know anything, whether he was being abused, what was happening to him. I was calling his teacher asking for at least five minutes just to hear my son's voice, to make sure he was alright. My hands are still shaking.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALSH: Now, even though that ended well, still a snapshot of the sheer horror some families have been subjected to. Bogdan frankly cavalier flippant, almost an indestructible early teenager there. But this is just part of something which is tearing Ukrainian families apart. And the slow small numbers that have been retrieved through this Ukraine NGO's activities just really I think revealing that enormous numbers who Ukraine charges have been deported. 
 
WALKER: It's incredible. And a tiny glimmer of hope for families who I'm sure many of them never thought that they would see this day come. Incredible to see those few reunions. Nick Payton Walsh, thank you. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:55:00]
 
BLACKWELL: Sports now. And we're just 90 minutes away -- 90 minutes or so away from resuming play at this year's first golf major. The Masters was halted Saturday afternoon by more strong storms. 
 
WALKER: Yes. Andy Scholes is here now with some good news that they should be able to finish up the event today. But yesterday, I saw a few clips and man, some of those players are like miserable in those conditions.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR (on camera): Some of them are miserable out there yesterday. Miserable out there yesterday. We should be in for great weather today. A little chilly in the morning, but by the afternoon, it really should be beautiful. Leaderboard Koepka and his group, the guys played 29 holes, though, today to finish the tournament. But again, it should be nice so it should be doable.
 
Saturday, though, like we mentioned, it was miserable at Augusta National, cold, rainy. They finished up the second round in the morning before starting the third, but constant rain started causing puddles on the greens, making the course just unplayable. The play was halted just after 3:00 Eastern in the afternoon. And many of the guys were just happy the day was over. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ADAM SCOTT, 2013 MASTERS CHAMPION: I mean, I feel like I just survived. 
 
SAHITH THEEGALA, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: It was brutal this morning because it's just so cold. 
 
MACKENZIE HUGHES, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: It felt like a different sport today, you know, dealing with all the elements, and the cold, rain. 
 
CAMERON YOUNG, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: I mean, it's basically impossible. I don't -- I don't really know what you're supposed to do. It's playing so long. 
 
SHANE LOWRY, 2019 OPEN CHAMPION: (INAUDIBLE) this morning is freezing, so it's interesting. It's mad how the weather can change in the area. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: All right, now, coming in today, Brooks Koepka has a four- shot lead over Jon Rahm, the LIV Golf star. He played just six holes yesterday, shooting 100 to get the 13 under for the tournament. Koepka hasn't won a major since the 2019 PGA championship. He's looking for his first green jacket. He said after play was called yesterday, not concerned about having to play 29 holes today in order to win the Masters.
 
Tiger Woods, meanwhile, making history yesterday, narrowly made his 23rd straight cut, tying him with Fred Couples and Gary Player for the most ever. Tiger though looking rather miserable in his third round. He hit it in the water on 15 and 16, has two bogeys, two double bogeys so far. He is in last place among the players who have made the cut. 
 
The guys play, as we mentioned, resumes 8:30 Eastern for round three. The final round is expected to start around 12:30 Eastern. They're going to go up and pairs from split tees holes one and 10. 
 
BLACKWELL: All right, Andy, thank you so much. 
 
SCHOLES: All right. 
 
BLACKWELL: All right, Eva Longoria continues her culinary adventure in Oaxaca. The new episode of the "CNN ORIGINAL SERIES EVA LONGORIA SEARCHING FOR MEXICO" airs tonight at 9:00 on CNN. 
 
The next hour of CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.
