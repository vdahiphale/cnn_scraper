THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[16:00:06]
 
REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI):  The Israelis have to make a decision for themselves. Obviously, they had a huge intelligence and military failure in the October 7th attack. He will have to be held accountable for that. 
 
But we want -- we want partners who are able to see that vision beyond just the trauma that they're living through right now. So, that, to me, is a question for the Israelis in short order. 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST:  No question. So much trauma. 
 
These are live pictures of some folks relieved from that trauma, some of those hostages released by Hamas as part of this deal. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, we do appreciate you joining us this afternoon. 
 
Our coverage of today's hostage release continues. 
 
ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN breaking news. 
 
PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST:  Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Pamela Brown in for Jake Tapper. 
 
And we are following the major breaking news today. After more than 49 days in captivity, the first group of hostages held by Hamas are now back in Israel. And moments ago, we just saw some of those hostages met by cheers, as they arrive by helicopter at a children's hospital near Tel Aviv. 
 
We don't know how many people will be brought there. But sources say the mothers and their kids who were freed today, will not be separated. A total of 24 hostages were taken out of Gaza earlier today in these vans right here by the Red Cross, where they then got their initial medical checks. Now, the rest will all be taken to hospitals across Israel based on their current medical needs, given most were believed to be kept underground for nearly seven weeks. 
 
The released hostages include 13 Israelis, ten Thai citizens, and one citizen of the Philippines. Israel identified its citizens as Yapa Adar, Ohanna Peri, Ruth Munder, her daughter Keren, and her grand son Ohad, Margalet Moses, Hana Katzir, Adina Moshe, Daniel Aloni and her daughter Emilia, Doron Katz Asher and her children Raz and Aviv. No Americans were included in today's hostage release.
 
President Biden says he's still hopeful a few will be freed in the coming days, but he has no guarantees. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We don't know when that will occur, but we're going to -- expect it to occur. And we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released. But we know the numbers are going to be released. So, it's my hope and expectation, it will be soon. 
 
REPORTER:  And of the 10 Americans that are unaccounted for, do you know all of their conditions? Are they all alive? 
 
BIDEN:  We don't know all of their conditions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN:  CNN's Clarissa Ward is right outside Schneider Children's Hospital near Tel Aviv, where we have seen those helicopters landing. 
 
Clarissa, what is happening on the ground right now? 
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So, the second helicopter, Pamela, has just landed here on the helipad behind the Schneider Children's Medical Center. Now, the first helicopter, when it landed, we saw them construct a, kind of, screen. And we're seeing that again. They're putting that up. That, of course, is to protect the privacy of the people who are on board, those hostages, now freed hostages. 
 
You can see in the background some well wishers have been waiting for some time to be able to welcome them, hanging Israeli flags. We've heard them clapping and cheering. And now it's actually remarkably quiet with the sound of the blades of the helicopter now turned off. And that moment, as those hostages, who have been through such an extraordinary ordeal, Pamela, for more than seven weeks, are now finally arriving home. 
 
And here at the medical -- the Schneider Medical Center for Children, a huge amount of care and effort has gone into doing everything possible to be as sensitive and as thoughtful to the, sort of, incredible challenges of this moment. The vast majority of hostages released today, Pamela, are residents of the Nir Oz kibbutz, where roughly a quarter of the residents, 400 residents, have either been killed or kidnapped, according to the spokesman for Nir Oz. All of these hostages have lost family members in the October 7th attacks. Many of them may not know about that. 
 
The IDF was given strict instructions on how to engage with these hostages, how to deal with questions that they might be receiving from the hostages, how to, sort of, not answer them but also provide reassurance. And now that they're arriving here at this children's hospital, this is the first place that they will finally be reunited with some of their family members, which, of course, is a wonderful thing. But also the place where psychologists and psychiatrists and doctors and social workers have been assembled and picked to potentially break the heartbreaking news to them about what may have happened to some of their family members and certainly, of course, what happened to their community and communities like theirs across the country. 
 <br>[16:05:17]
 
So, it's a real mixture in terms of the emotion of the moment. It's a homecoming, and you hear the cheering. But there's also a somberness to it. And there's a sadness to it because there's an understanding, as they get onto this bus and are prepared to be moved inside the hospital, that they are very different children and very different people from who they were on October 6th. And that is something that this country will just be starting to get its arms around, Pamela. 
 
BROWN:  Absolutely. And some of these kids, you know, you mentioned they all lost family members. Some of them lost a parent, right? And they may not know that yet. And you have these doctors, medical professionals, there waiting at the hospital to take them in. 
 
But it's a long road ahead, not just physically for them, but also psychologically after all they've been through. 
 
What more can you tell us about how they've been preparing to take in these young patients? 
 
WARD:  So, one thing that I found interesting is that the hospital staff told us they went to great lengths to make sure that the area of the hospital that they will be hosted in doesn't look like a hospital. They don't want it to look clinical or intimidating or cold. They wanted it to feel warm. The words they used were, they wanted to create the feeling of a beautiful hotel. 
 
They've put in lots of toys in the rooms. This is where they'll be reunited with some of their friends and family and loved ones. And this is where, also, they have hand-picked the very best and most appropriate of their staff, of their doctors, of their psychiatrists, to begin the work, the complicated work, of trying to break tough news to them but also of trying to assess the level of trauma that they have undergone. 
 
And it's important to underscore that the freed hostages who have been brought here are not believed to be seriously injured. Those have been taken, at least two, we believe, to other hospitals. Those who have been brought here are children and their mothers. We don't know exactly their names, although obviously there are three families in particular who are the most likely candidates to have been brought there. They did put those screens up for privacy. 
 
And you can't see on camera, but there's a number of onlookers around. Some of them are children. Some of them are families. We spoke to one nurse. She's an ER nurse, not from this hospital but from another hospital nearby, and she knew you could see the helipad. She was working in the ER on October 7th.
 
And she said she wanted to come here to witness this moment. She called it, quote, a drop of joy in a sea of sadness. And she said that while it's unlikely to change the course of events and while there is much more sadness to come and probably, sadly, much more bloodshed to come, she wanted to be here to witness this moment and to hold on to that drop of joy. 
 
And I think, Pamela, that's something that all of us, whether we are watching this, covering this, involved in this, can all relate to is just that sense of one moment after so much horror of joy with, you know, hostages finally being returned home, although to a very different future. 
 
BROWN:  To a very different future. But, as you point out, they are doing everything they can to make it a warm welcoming, having family there, making sure the rooms are not clinical, having toys there for those young children who have already missed out on so many weeks of their childhood, the joys of childhood, trying to bring that to them. 
 
Do you expect any other hostages to be brought to this children's hospital? 
 
WARD:  At this stage, it's unclear. We know that four helicopters took off from the Hatzerim air base. Two helicopters have landed here. So, it is possible that two more will be coming here. 
 
I will say that just observing how it worked with the first two helicopters, there's not enough room on the helipad for more than one helicopter at any given time. So, if there are going to be more helicopters, what we will likely see is that this second helicopter will take off again, and then potentially a third would come in or even a fourth. 
 <br>[16:10:08]
 
But it is also entirely possible, Pamela, that that third and fourth helicopter were going to Wolfson or another hospital, Pamela. 
 
BROWN:  Clarissa Ward, thank you so much. We're going to return back to you for an update soon. 
 
But first we're going to turn now to Major Doron Spielman, the spokesman for the IDF.
 
You just heard the conversation there with Clarissa Ward at that children hospital. What can you tell us about the hostages that have been freed and their conditions, how they're doing? 
 
MAJ. DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  Thank you for having me, Pam. 
 
As Clarissa said, I think we can delve a little bit more in depth. They have gone through an initial medical check, and we have seen that there is nothing life threatening. However, the process, mostly the psychological process, of what these children have been through and what these adults have been through, is going to take time to unfold. And we have to multiply that by what is going to be happening to them in the next few minutes. 
 
These are the minutes where they're going to be meeting with their families, with all that joy, with the hugs and tears. And then those children and those adults are going to look around and say, wait, what about my sister? What about my father? What about mom? Why are they not here? 
 
And that news is going to be delivered to them that, in fact, every one of these hostages that are being returned, every one of them has family that has either already been murdered or has been abducted. And the process is going to be a long process. They're in the hospital with their families. And it's going to be a case by case basis. 
 
The most important thing is to try to nurture them and keep them protected so that they can really see hope in the future. Remember, these hostages have no idea what the rest of the world knows. They don't know the extent of October 7th. And that is now going to be known to them in the next few minutes. 
 
BROWN:  So, tell us more about how that is being handled, telling them what happened on October 7th, the extent of it, and telling them, these young children, you know, that they've lost their family members, in some cases, their parents. How is that being handled? 
 
SPIELMAN:  Well, families have been coached with the medical personnel that are there. We have the top experts in Israel that have all volunteered and have been standing ready to deal with this, one of the most difficult national situations we've ever been in. 
 
As for the president of the United States, when he mentioned the teddy bear, he wasn't being facetious. We put out toys for them each step along the way. The first meeting at the initial point, there were teddy bears. 
 
There was candy. There were things to welcome them in. Now they're being flown by helicopter, which is a ride. It's somewhat exhilarating for them. So, they get to land. 
 
Hopefully this will cheer them up. When they enter into that area, it's going to be a slowly unfolding process. And how does a 2-year- old, a 4-year-old, a 5-year-old, and a 9-year-old come to grips with this? 
 
I think you said it yourself, and I think you said it very well. They will not be the same ever going forward that they were before. But what they will see when they leave that hospital is an entire nation who feels like these are our children. 
 
We've been waiting for them, and this entire nation, who's been serving the army. So many of the moms and dads of their friends have gone in the army now because we realize we have to protect our family. 
 
BROWN:  Of course, this is the first round, right? There are other children and women that are being held still. What can you tell us about other hostages that are being held? Do you know if Americans will be in the next batch? Of course, there is a lot of interest about the 3-year-old little
 
 girl, little Abigail, actually 4. She just turned 4 today. That's right. Today was her birthday. If she will be released next. 
 
And do you know if Americans are even still alive? 
 
SPIELMAN:  There's a lot that unfortunately we don't know. As the president said, regarding Abigail, we hope -- God willing, we hope she's alive with the other 230, 220 hostages that are still being held in Gaza. There's a lot of misinformation. One of the women that came today, Hana Katzir, there was a fake news report that was very carefully calculated by Islamic Jihad and other terror groups around four days ago that said she had been killed. That went out on all the Israeli news, including a lot of international news. And she actually came home today alive. 
 
So, her family has already been living through the drama where she was killed, so to speak, and now she's home. We're aware that Hamas will play this deception until the very end. I think we will not know about the Americans until they arrive, and the same thing with the Israelis. 
 
We saw Noa Marciano was found dead in this hospital. And we saw pictures of her alive not long before that. 
 <br>[16:15:02]
 
One thing we can be sure, Hamas cannot be trusted. And the only thing we can do is that when we have a commitment that when these phase is gone and all these hostages will come home, will continue the military campaign so that they feel pressure. As President Biden said, that is the only thing they respond to. And we have to hope and pray for the best. 
 
We actually have to hope and pray that Hamas will behave like human beings and not shed their humanity like they did on October 7th. 
 
BROWN:  Major Spielman of the IDF, thank you so much. 
 
SPIELMAN:  Thank you, Pam.
 
BROWN:  Hostages released today are being taken to hospitals to be examined. Dozens more families await anxiously word on whether their loved ones will be the next released. We'll talk with a relative of one of those families up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BROWN:  And we are back with our breaking news. An initial group of hostages held by Hamas has been released. That includes 13 Israelis, 10 Thai citizens, and one Filipino citizen. All are now in Israel, where they are going through medical evaluations before reuniting with their families. 
 
I'm joined now by Omer Lubaton Granot. He leads Hostage and Missing Families Forum in New York and is also the cousin of four hostages. 
 <br>[16:20:06]
 
First off, Omer, how are you feeling today, as you see this initial group of hostages return to Israel? 
 
OMER LUBATON GRANOT, RELATIVES HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS IN GAZA:  I think that today, after six weeks that was so hard and so long, we finally got a glimpse of hope and happiness. And we are really, really, really happy for the families and the hostages that are now back home. I'm excited just to say it and waiting to see what comes next, if the deal would continue and will be completed the next few days, and waiting for our loved ones as well. 
 
BROWN:  Your family members, who we are seeing now -- we're going to show -- they were not part of this initial group of hostages. Has your family gotten any update from officials? 
 
GRANOT:  They weren't -- they weren't part of the first group. We still don't know and can't say much about the next few days. But we are waiting and hope to see them come, as well as all the others. 
 
BROWN:  What are you hearing from the other families who are still anxiously waiting for their loved ones to be released? 
 
GRANOT:  There's, I think, it's a mix of emotions. We must remember that a lot of the families that were -- that their loved ones were released today still have family members that are still in Gaza. One family has a woman and two men and two children, babies, that are in there. Other families as well that I know of, the Munder family, Adar family. 
 
So, they took only part of the family. So, as much as the families are glad to get some of their loved ones, they're still very worried about the others. And all of the other families and all of the Israeli society and all of the Jewish community here in New York and around the world is waiting to see what's going on in the next days, and is highly devoted to keep and work and put as much pressure as possible to bring on another deal, because we need more deals. It should be only the first one out of many. 
 
BROWN:  Yeah, and on that note, how hopeful are you that these releases will continue to go smoothly now that the first group is out? 
 
GRANOT:  I think it's a good sign. But Hamas is not trustworthy. They're very irrational player. They're actually holding all the hostages they're promising to release.
 
So, every day is going to be an emotional roller coaster for us and for an entire nation. I can tell you that the entire nation was holding their breath to see who's coming. And I think it was also a lot of surprises this morning. One of the women that was released, the Islamic Jihad published just a few days ago that she was murdered. 
 
So, I can't imagine what the family's going through. And I'm so glad for them that she's back home. Her name is Hana Katzir. And I wish her the best recovery that she can have and also a big hug for this lovely family. BROWN:  Omer, thank you for coming on. I know it is such an emotional
 
 day for you, so many different feelings you must be feeling. We appreciate your time. Thank you. 
 
GRANOT:  It is, it is. And thank you. Thank you for hosting me, and thank you for giving attention to this important subject because we need the international attention for it because it's not over yet. 
 
BROWN:  It is certainly not over yet, and we are staying on top of it here at CNN. Thank you, Omer. 
 
GRANOT:  Thank you so much. 
 
BROWN:  And we continue to wait for details about tomorrow's anticipated release of more hostages currently being held in Gaza. I'll talk with a former hostage negotiator up next. 
 
Plus, we'll go live to the West Bank, where Palestinians are marking the return of prisoners released today. We're back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:28:50]
 
BROWN:  And we are back with our breaking news coverage of the first hostages released by Hamas. Twenty-four of them are now safely back in Israel. 
 
Meanwhile, buses reportedly carrying the 39 Palestinian prisoners have left a prison in the occupied West Bank, as part of this hostage deal. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir is in Jerusalem. 
 
Nada, before these prisoners were released, there were these clashes between Israeli military and Palestinians right near that prison, right? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Yeah, we did see some minor clashes around the Batunia crossing, which is just a couple of hundred meters from the Ofer Prison where these 39 prisoners were held before they could be released and returned back to their homes. Our team was there reporting, as we saw Israeli forces firing tear gas at some of these smaller crowds, which had gathered to watch the crossing take place. This was earlier in the afternoon. 
 
Of course, as we understand it according to the Palestinian Red Crescent society, at least two people, teenagers, one 16, one just 12 years old, two boys, were injured by live fire and taken to hospital. While we were there, we did see that tear gas coming into the crowd, also coming near to where many journalists had gathered to report on the crossing of these 39 prisoners. 
 <br>[16:30:07]
 
We did also see some young men, teenagers, throwing stones towards the Israeli troops there. But, of course, as we saw there, those crowds were all gathered to see the unfolding situation of those 39 prisoners being released around the Batunia crossing. Later on our team moved on to the Batunia municipality center where other family members had gathered to welcome some of those 39 prisoners, arriving to meet with their families at the municipality office. There were these enormous crowds, thousands at least, gathered around there to celebrate the release of these 39 prisoners. Of course in exchange for at least 13 Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 
 
BROWN: Nada Bashir in Jerusalem, thank you so much. 
 
And in the coming days, we expect to see more hostages released during this four-day pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas. Also part of this deal, for every Israeli hostage freed, three Palestinian prisoners in Israel are released. 
 
Joining us now is former Navy SEAL hostage negotiator Dan O'Shea. 
 
So, Dan, first off, the hostages have been released by Hamas, this first round. What is your perspective on how the deal is going so far and what lies ahead? 
 
DAN O'SHEA, FORMER NAVY SEAL COMMANDER AND COORDINATOR, HOSTAGE WORKING GROUP U.S. EMBASSY:  Well, first off, this is a first day that everyone has been waiting for since October 7th. It is a positive step. The fact that it's gone smoothly, even though, like you said in the earlier interview with your reporter on the ground, there are clashes. And my fear is that something like a firefight or another missile launch potentially from maybe the West Bank by Hezbollah could damage this ceasefire. 
 
So, it's a very positive first step. Hopefully, the next three days will go smoothly. But this situation could change in an instant. 
 
BROWN:  Well, we've seen past truces, pauses in fighting between Hamas and Israel, go awry, right? And so, I think that is the worry that tensions could overflow. You're already seeing some of those tensions outside that prison that we just heard about that Nada. As it pertains to these hostages released, there is a lot of focus on the fact that -- yes, it is joyful they've been released. But they have a long road ahead, psychologically, physically. I can't even imagine, just emotionally processing everything they've been through. 
 
Given your experience, tell us about that, what these people who are freshly freed from captivity go through? 
 
O'SHEA:  Yeah, I have been through that, resistance escape training. I became a repatriation subject matter expert with a number of debriefs that I did with hostages that were released the in Iraq. So, first and foremost, is the medical check, which they're all going through right now. I know all the hostages have been pulled out of Gaza, are all in hospitals now, as I understand. They're being medically checked and examined. 
 
As you know, there are four or five women in their 70s and grandchildren. So I think the age range is between 5 and 72, as I recall. So, there's going to be different physical exams for both. But the mental aspect of this and the psychological damage, especially with these young children, it is going to take months and potentially years and potentially a lifetime of trauma, especially for these kids who are have likely been held in a bunker-type situation underground, probably in darkness, for the last 47-odd days. A nightmare for anyone involved. And it continues for nearly 200 still left behind. 
 
BROWN:  And now some of them are finding out they lost their family members, perhaps their parents. You know, so that's a whole another chapter that they have to go through, to process, to wrap their heads around. I can't imagine, you know, you've heard Netanyahu talk about the goal, the mission being to release all of the hostages, right? Do you see a world where all of the hostages will be released, or do you think that is just wishful thinking? 
 
O'SHEA:  Well, I'm a pessimist just because I worked 400-odd kidnappings in a two-year period in Iraq. And I can honestly count the happy endings on one hand with fingers to spare, especially when it came to the 44 Americans that were taken, held hostage over my time. 
 
So, I'm not optimistic that this will go smoothly or quickly. More hostages will be released. But right now these hostages are the only bargaining chip that Hamas has. Holding these hostages means there's survival for another day. It will get down to a calculus, the value of what a hostage is worth. And it will come down to the nationality, their age, and for all military-age males of the Israelis held in Hamas, those men that are 18 to 40, as most know, you serve in the Israeli military for two years minimum. And I think up until 40 for the reserves. Those men and the women that serve in the IDF that are captured, they may have an enduring captivity ahead for them. 
 
BROWN:  Dan O'Shea, thank you. 
 
Well, three Americans, including a 4-year-old girl, are still being held in Gaza. Her birthday is today. Will they be part of the next round of releases? That is a looming question. What CNN is learning up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BROWN:  President Biden today praising the release of the first 13 Israeli hostages, but noting that, while he expects American hostages to be released soon, at this time he is unsure when. 
 <br>[16:40:03]
 
CNN's Alex Marquardt is here with us now, our chief national correspondent. 
 
So, Alex, do we have any idea of a timeline of when we could see these American hostages released? I know there was so much hope that little Abigail who just four today would be among the first --  
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Abigail Edan, 4 years old today, marking her birthday in captivity after almost 50 days. Pam, the thinking is there are three eligible Americans to come out, two women and young Abigail. There are ten Americans overall, but only two of these women and children. 
 
President Biden earlier today saying he doesn't know what conditions they're in. The earliest these three could come out is tomorrow. If not tomorrow, the expectation would be in the back half of this four- day pause. But there certainly is a hope they will come out tomorrow. President Biden, speaking earlier today, said he hadn't gotten the list yet of who's coming out tomorrow. 
 
The Israelis will get the list first. Presumably they'll share it with the U.S. and because these are Israeli citizens, the Israelis will tell the families as well. So, right now, the earliest would be tomorrow. 
 
President Biden did speak from Nantucket, where he's spending Thanksgiving. He said his hope and expectation is that it will be soon. He also said, we will not stop until we get these hostages brought home. 
 
Administration officials have said this deal is incentivized for Hamas to release more hostages. And indeed, Hamas has an incentive to prolong this pause because it means that the fighting will stop. They will have time to rest and regroup. And remember, for every hostage they release, they get three Palestinian prisoners. 
 
BROWN:  Yeah, that's right. That's good context to keep in mind. Big picture here, you know, there's this concern about could this spill into a broader conflict. And we're seeing U.S. forces being attacked, four times in Iraq and Syria just yesterday. What is going on there? 
 
MARQUARDT:  This really does speak to major concern by administration officials that this conflict could expand. We have now seen more than 70 attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria in just the past few weeks since October 17th, 73 to be exact. Four of those were yesterday, two against bases in Iraq and two against bases in Syria. 
 
We're told that there were no casualties or damage to infrastructure, but it really does raise questions about whether the U.S. is being effective at deterring these attacks, which are primarily being carried out by Iran-backed groups. In response to these now more than 70 attacks, the U.S. has carried out airstrikes four times, targeting infrastructure of these Iran-backed groups, three sets of strikes were in eastern Syria. One was in Iraq. 
 
The Pentagon is saying that this does show that they are managing to deter a wider conflict because that has not yet happened. But clearly, these strikes and the targeting of U.S. forces continues, Pam. 
 
BROWN:  Yeah, it's concerning. And these are retaliatory strikes from the U.S. as you point out, the question, are they really deterring? Because these attacks keep happening, right? 
 
Alex, thanks so much.
 
I want to bring in Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. He is the member of the Intelligence Committee. So, Congressman, no Americans were released today as part of the first
 
 group of hostages. We're watching for the three Americans who are expected to be among the first 50 women and children released, including little 4-year-old Abigail whose birthday is today. We were just talking about her. 
 
Have you heard anything about when we might see American hostages released? 
 
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL):  I've not heard more than what's in the published reports. We're expecting that some will be among those initial group of 50. But remember that there's at least 10 Americans, and there's no assurance that all 10 of them will be among those 50. So, that's why a group of us, led by -- 
 
BROWN:  If you could hold on. I'm so sorry to interrupt, congressman, but there's a press conference going on right now at Schneider Children's Hospital near Tel Aviv that took in the hostages. Let's listen. 
 
HOSPITAL OFFICIAL:  -- to get to undergo a medical evaluation process conducted with utmost sensitivity and dedication by hospital staff. This is the first time that the state of Israel has had to prepare for the arrival of so many hostages, including young children, the preparation for their arrival, including collection and consultation of all the medical information, about the returning hostages. 
 
However, we are receiving the released hostages today and consolidation of all available medical information about the returning hostages. However, we are receiving the released hostages today without any prior knowledge of changes in the medical condition that may have appeared since they were kidnapped. This is a complex event, both medically and emotionally, for the released hostages who have returned to Israel, for their families, for the entire people of Israel, whether in Israel or abroad. 
 <br>[16:45:04]
 
Alongside our joy and the feeling the hostages are now a part of our family, we must ensure their privacy and dignity. The ministry of health and all personnel of the Israeli health system are overjoyed with the return home of hostages, and we will do everything in our power to give them the most comprehensive and precise care. And we yearn for the return home of all our hostages. Thank you very much. 
 
BROWN:  We just heard from an official there at Schneiders, the hospital there, taking in some of these hostages, these young hostages, that have been released by Hamas. And we know from our Clarissa Ward, who is on the ground there, that they are prepared. They are ready to help these young hostages who have been through so much these last several weeks, being held in tunnels by a terrorist group. Some have lost their family members, even their parents, and they haven't even been told yet. 
 
We know that there are family members there at the hospital receiving some of these hostages. And there is a whole protocol on how to talk to them about what they've been through and to break the news to them of what actually happened on October 7th and the other family members they have lost. 
 
We might go back to that press conference, depending on if other officials speak. 
 
But I want to turn back to my conversation with Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. 
 
I'm sorry to cut you off there, but we wanted to hear what that official said, and, of course, the condition of these hostages, these children who were released by Hamas in this first round. What is your reaction to all of this? 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  Well, I'm thankful, I'm grateful that they are among this first group of hostages. I'm concerned about their wellbeing. As you said, they're emotionally scarred from the initial attack on October 7th and everything that's happened ever since. I'm sure that the authorities are going to do everything they can to, kind of, take care of their physical and their mental state right now. And I'm hopeful that more can be released ASAP. 
 
BROWN:  As far as the 10 Americans -- we were talking about that before we dipped out, the 10 Americans still being held by Hamas -- have you seen evidence that all ten Americans are still alive? 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  No. And I think that's one of the big question marks and concerns, which is, you know, we want to have proof of life with regard to the condition of the hostages. We need to know about how they're doing. I've only read the published reports about members of the International Red Cross, who are supposed to visit with the hostages and provide them with medicine and other care that they need. 
 
But we don't know their condition right now. 
 
BROWN:  Yeah, and that is key. This hostage release comes amid this four-day pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas. Where do you see this war going after the prisoners have been released and the four days are up? 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  Well, look, Pamela, this is a hopeful moment in a very, very, very dark period, where there's been a halt in fighting. And based on published reports, it appears that this halt in fighting could be extended with the release of more hostages. So, that's, I think, where a lot of people are looking for additional guidance. Like, Hamas needs to release all of these hostages ASAP, like, now. 
 
And so, if they do what is the humane and civil thing to do, which is to release these hostages, we could see this temporary ceasefire extend. And I think that's what a lot of people are hoping for right now. 
 
BROWN:  But do you see that as just wishful thinking that they would just release all the hostages, given the fact that it's their biggest bargaining chip, especially, you know, when you think about the men, the women of fighting age, who could be part of IDF, those that are still within captivity held by Hamas. Do you see Hamas releasing them? 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  I don't know exactly what is the mental state of Hamas and its leadership, but I think that there are others who are also working with them, whether it's the Qataris or others, who are going to put pressure on them to release these hostages because, you know, that's the only way that this temporary halt to fighting can extend. 
 
It's clear that the fighting is having a negative impact on Hamas. The bigger problem is, of course, it's having a much bigger, also, impact on civilians. So, Hamas needs to decide, you know, how much pain are they going to endure and how quickly can they release these hostages so that the truce or this halt in fighting can extend beyond just these four days.

BROWN:  You just heard by colleague Alex's report that U.S. forces have been attacked at least 73 times since October 17th. U.S. forces were attacked just four times yesterday in Iraq and Syria. How concerned are you about the threat to U.S. forces abroad? 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  I am very concerned, and this is something that unfortunately Iranian-backed proxies are, kind of -- they have our forces in their crosshairs throughout the region. So, the administration along with Congress, is going to back any response necessary to protect our troops, and at the same time, we don't want to widen the war, so it's kind of a balancing act. 
 
So far, I think the Biden administration's response has been appropriate. 
 
BROWN:  All right. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, thank you. 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  Thank you.
 
BROWN:  And this truce agreement also having a major impact in Gaza, where for the first time in nearly two months, the fighting has stopped. 
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh explains how people inside Gaza are taking advantage of this temporary pause. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's the sounds of life, not death, today on the streets of Gaza. For first time in nearly 50 days, they are not running for their lives. No bombs raining down on them from the sky. So children can even smile again, even if only for a brief while. 
 
But there's nothing to celebrate. Too many lives have been lost, so much gone. They know there will be more. 
 
The Israeli military dropping leaflets on Friday warning people that the war is not over. It will soon resume. Telling them to stay away from northern Gaza and its troops. 
 
Many tried to head back to the homes they fled with nothing more than the clothes on their backs to see what's left and grab what they can find, including their dead. 
 
We want to see what's happened to our loved ones. So many are under the rubble for 20 days, Abu Hamad says. We need to get them out. 
 
"Who else will bury them? Who will bury our 2-year-old and her father?" says Hama Abdullah (ph). What did she do to them? 
 
It was a tense scene on the Salah al Din Street, TThe highway linking north and south, people here saying Israeli forces opened fire on those trying to head back north. We want to get to our homes, they say. We're civilians. They shot people. One was shot in the head and the other in the mouth. 
 
Gunfire and the panic that ensued captured in this video geolocated by CNN. Asked about these shootings, the military says its troops are stationed along the, quote, operational lines in accordance with the framework of the agreement, but that didn't stop those determined to get back to what's left of their lives. 
 
Sisters Hanin and Sada (ph) are cradling their cats who have been through it all say they know the risks, but they just want to go back home. Gazans know all too well what comes after the brief calm. 
 
What's this truce for, to hand over the hostages? What happens after they hand them over? What happens to us, Hama Abdullah (ph) asked? We feel like we are dead, she says. 
 
They hope it doesn't all start again, but all they can do now is prepare for a crucial winter ahead.

BROWN:  And our thank you to Jomana.
 
Coming up, I'm going to speak with one man who had three family released from captivity today. What he's learning about the condition they are in, up next.

ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN breaking news.
 
BROWN:  And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Jake Tapper. 
 
WOLF BLITZER, NN HOST:  And I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv. 
 
After spending, what, 49 days in captivity, 24 people who were held hostage by Hamas are now free, and they are all back in Israel. Here is the moment some of their images were displayed in Tel Aviv's so called hostage square earlier today. The release is the result of a truce between Israel and Hamas. 
 
Israel has identified its 13 citizens as Yafa Adar, Ohanna Peri, Ruth Munder, her daughter Keren and her grandson, Ohad, Margalet Moses, Hana Katzir, Adina Moshe, Dnaiel Aloni and her daughter Emilia, Doron Katz Asher and her kids Raz and Aviv.
 
Hospital officials near Tel Aviv just confirmed they have received some of the women and children at the hospitals, and they are saying they are in good physical condition. Eleven foreign nationals were also released as part of a separate deal. They include ten Thai citizens and a Filipino. 
 
None of the hostages released are Americans. President Biden speaking today saying he is hopeful that will soon change. By the end of this four-day pause in fighting, 50 hostages are set to be freed. Also part of the deal, dozens of Palestinian prisoners are being released and critical aid is now making its way into Gaza.</pre>
