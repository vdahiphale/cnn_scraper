ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and to everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church.
 
Just ahead. With less than a week to go, Kamala Harris makes her final pitch to voters, framing the election as a choice between freedom and division.
 
Plus, it was the most pro-Biden County among all the swing states in 2020 but this year, many of the voters there say they're still undecided.
 
And digging for bodies with bare hands in besieged northern Gaza, after an Israeli strike kills more than 90 people.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta. This is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Well, Kamala Harris picks a prominent place for her big pitch to Americans one week before election day. The Vice President's speech along the National Mall in Washington, D.C. attracted some 75,000 attendees. That's according to her campaign. The location laden with symbolism, it was the same spot Donald Trump rallied his supporters on January 6, nearly four years ago before they stormed the U.S. Capitol. Harris asking voters to choose freedom and unity over chaos and anger.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS (D) UNITED STATES VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: America for too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust, and it can be easy then to forget a simple truth. It doesn't have to be this way. We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: When it comes to policy, Harris stressed the need to lower costs for people struggling to pay bills. She said Trump is focused on tax cuts for billionaires and policies that help those at the very top and hurt everyone else.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: America, this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And to people who disagree with me, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me, are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: CNN's Priscilla Alvarez was there for the Harris speech and has this report.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Vice President Kamala Harris sent her closing arguments here at the Ellipse introducing herself again to voters. Heading into the remarks, senior advisers to the Vice President said that they wanted to target undecided voters, those voters who may still be on the fence, like disaffected Republicans or those who are just fatigued by former President Donald Trump.
 
And over the course of her remarks, the Vice President laid out her policies and proposals on a number of issues, including on immigration, on health care, on reproductive rights. And as she did so, she compared each of those to the priorities of former President Donald Trump, essentially casting him as consumed by revenge or in the case of the military, as someone disrespectful to the military service.
 
Now the vice president did, of course, spend some time talking about January 6, that speech back in January 6 of 2021 by former President Donald Trump, leading to supporters storming the U.S. Capitol. Now she talked about, again, the former president being focused on what she called "the enemies list" versus her to-do list for Americans. And what was telling about the remarks was how much time she was spending introducing and reintroducing herself, at one point, saying that many of those that were watching may not know her well yet.
 
A recognition of her truncated campaign, but also her explaining that she has not spent all time -- all of her political career in Washington, calling back to her time also in California. And to that end, the Vice President, saying that she would welcome other opinions and include those who disagree with her at what she calls a seat at the table.
 <br>[02:05:00]
 
So again, the Vice President, her team seeing these remarks as the kick start to the home stretch of the election as she again tries to peel off those Republican voters with former President Donald Trump, but also convinced those that the campaign believes still needs some convincing.
 
Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington.
 
CHURCH: With six days left to go, Donald Trump isn't waiting to begin suggesting the election is rigged after Pennsylvania election and law enforcement officials announced they were investigating some 2500 voter registration forms for suspected fraud. Speaking at a rally in Allentown, Trump warned supporters they need to get their ballots in as soon as possible.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They've already started cheating in Lancaster, they've cheated. We caught him with 2600 votes. Now we caught him called 2600 votes. Think of this. Think of this, and every vote was written by the same person. I wonder how that happened. Must be a coincidence. It must be a coincidence.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Trump also defended his controversial Madison Square Garden rally where speakers lobbed a range of vicious insults against Kamala Harris, calling her everything from a prostitute with pimp handlers to the antichrist.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: I don't think anybody has ever seen anything like what happened the other night at Madison Square Garden, the love -- the love -- the love in that room, it was breathtaking. 
 
Politicians that have been doing this for a long time, 30 and 40 years, said there's never been an event so beautiful. It was like a love fest, an absolute love fest, and it was my honor to be involved.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Talking about Tony Hinchcliffe, the comedian who called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage, Trump conceded probably he shouldn't have been there.
 
Ron Brownstein is a CNN senior political analyst and senior editor at The Atlantic. He joins me now from Austin, Texas. Always good to have you with us.
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hey, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: So, before a massive crowd of supporters, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered closing arguments for the 2024 election Tuesday at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. where Donald Trump held his January 6 rally in 2021. What did you think of her address, and did she move the needle? BROWNSTEIN: I thought it was an extremely powerful speech. I mean, you know, she was not a great candidate for president when she ran in 2019. She didn't even make it to 2020 but I think any objective analysis would have to say that she has really stepped into this role this time and delivered a -- has delivered a lot of strong performances at really every big set piece, moment, the convention, the debate tonight.
 
And I also thought what was important about this speech was the way it bridge what has been the debate about -- among Democrats about how to close the race. I mean, obviously there are Democrats who believe that she needs to stress democracy rights, abortion rights and the threat to the constitutional order that Trump has articulated so explicitly in the final days, an argument aimed mostly at White Collar voters who respond to that most powerfully.
 
And then there are others who say that she has to emphasize what she will do to deal with the kitchen table concerns of working-class Americans and really what she unveiled in the CNN town hall about a week ago has continued right through this speech tonight. It really was the cornerstone of the speech when she essentially argued that Trump will come into office with an enemies list and I will come into office with a to-do list.
 
And that really kind of bridges those two views about Democrat -- among Democrats about how to close the race and puts it in, I think, a very powerful final package for her.
 
CHURCH: And Ron, Harris, talked about unity and seeking common ground, saying, and I'm quoting here, "it's time to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms." And she also said it's time for a new generation of leadership in America. How did Harris go contrasting what she will do for America compared to what Trump would do?
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes. I mean, look, I mean, you know, we've had a succession of presidents come into office, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, with Trump as the conspicuous exception who have said that their goal was to lower the temperature, break the fever, bring the parties together. It's really hard to do. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why our country has become more polarized. Biden had some successes at various points in his first two years.
 
But the difference between all of those presidents, plus Harris and Trump is that Trump really is the only one in the modern era who has sought not to narrow our divisions, but widen them. He believes he benefits from really heightening the tension in American life, who has sought not to narrow our divisions but widen them.
 <br>[02:10:03]
 
He believes he benefits from really, you know, heightening the tension in American life. And it is a fundamental contrast and it is one of the reasons why Harris has had some success at peeling away white- collar voters who may not have identified as partisan Republicans, but certainly were Republican leaning independents. It was essentially the same appeal she made when she appeared with Liz Cheney a few days ago in white collar suburbs of Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.
 
And in the end, it will be important for her because to win, she is probably going to need some voters who don't really agree with her on issues but believe that she would be fundamentally, you know, more of a bomb for America, whereas Trump would be more toxic and divisive.
 
CHURCH: And Meantime, Donald Trump was in Pennsylvania Tuesday defending his divisive, racist and vulgar Sunday rally in New York City. He called that rally a love fest, and said, "we had a ball." And he claimed he didn't know the comedian who made those racist jokes and called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Will that rally end up costing Trump, do you think?
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, I think the most, you know, there are two ways in which it could cause Trump. One is in the kind of the micro, you know, among the Puerto Rican community in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania still feels to me like the Battle of the Bulge in this election. I have felt all year that someone is going to win Pennsylvania by 50,000 votes or less, and that person is very likely to be the president.
 
And, you know anything that might hurt either candidate at the margin in that state and here is something that could certainly have a cost for Trump among Puerto Rican voters or a big constitutive there, about 500,000 Puerto Rican residents, I think it's about 300,000 voters. But more broadly, I mean, the rally really did symbolize the argument that Harris is trying to make, that, you know, if you re-elect Trump, it probably is a pretty good preview of the tone and tenor of national life that you will see over the next few years.
 
Not only with, you know, divisive rhetoric but policies that could pit Americans against each other, like the mass -- the militarized mass deportation that he is talking about. I mean, Trump, I thought, you know, that rally reflected their confidence that there are enough voters to satisfy with the economy, particularly inflation under Biden that they are in the driver's seat and they can kind of let it rip.
 
But that might be premature and if it is, I think it again, it is precisely because of those voters who might lean Republican in their policy preferences on things like the economy and immigration but really are unsure whether they want to return Trump to power. I think that gave them a pretty good clear -- pretty clear vision of, you know, that there is more to returning him to power than potentially lower prices for eggs and gas.
 
CHURCH: Ron Brownstein, many thanks for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
BROWNSTEIN: Thanks for having me.
 
CHURCH: President Joe Biden is trying to walk back comments he made about Trump supporters that have Republicans outraged, criticizing the dark language at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. In particular, the comedian's tasteless joke about Puerto Rico being an island of garbage. Mr. Biden said this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something. I don't -- I don't know the Puerto Rican that that I know, or Puerto Rico where I've -- in my home state of Delaware. They're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization is seen as unconscionable and it's un- American. It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Republicans, swiftly denounced Mr. Biden's comments likening them to Hillary Clinton's 2016 description of Trump supporters as deplorables. A short time later, President Biden posted on X that he was referring to the hateful rhetoric used about Puerto Rico at the rally when he used the word garbage. Writing, Trump's demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.
 
The Trump campaign has seized on the gaffe, quickly turning it to their advantage, saying there's no way to spin it, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him.
 
Human rights groups are condemning an Israeli air strike on a residential building in northern Gaza that killed dozens of Palestinians.
 <br>[02:15:00]
 
Gaza's health ministry says at least 93 people, including 25 children were killed in Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. A warning. Images from the scene are disturbing. The Israeli military says it's "trying to understand why so many people were in the city at the time of the strike, as civilians had been ordered to evacuate several weeks ago." The U.S. called the incident horrifying and says it's asking Israel for more information.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond has the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These men aren't looking for survivors, amid the rubble of another Israeli air strike, they are here for the bodies. After all, how could anyone survive destruction on this scale? More than 90 people were killed in this Israeli strike in northern Gaza early Tuesday morning, including 25 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
 
An Israeli military spokesman said the military was targeting a suspected terrorist in the area and did not intend to collapse the building. But the bodies have not yet all been counted, as this man can attest.
 
There's a body and here's another and another, he says, pointing out their locations. And then there are the bodies of this boy's uncle and cousin, wedged between two thick slabs of concrete. A pair of feet is all that is visible. Gaza's rescue workers cannot reach this part of Northern Gaza, which has been besieged by the Israeli military for nearly a month. That means no heavy machinery, just bare hands sifting through the rubble.
 
Dr. Hussam Abu Safia is one of just two doctors here and he's growing desperate, calling for a humanitarian corridor to bring surgical teams to his hospital.
 
There are children with bones protruding from their bodies needing orthopedic surgery. There are brain injuries that require neurosurgeons, he says.
 
But Israel's Parliament may make matters worse. In an overwhelming vote, Israeli lawmakers moved to band UNRWA, the main U.N. agency aiding Palestinians from operating in Israel or engaging with Israeli officials. Israel accuses UNRWA of ties to Hamas, after linking a handful of its thousands of employees to the October 7th attacks, a blanket charge UNRWA vehemently denies. It's a move the U.S. says could not come at a worse time.
 
MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: There's nobody that can replace them right now in the middle of the crisis. So, we continue to urge the Government of Israel to pause the implementation of this legislation.
 
DIAMOND (voiceover): In Gaza, that urgency is all too real.
 
If UNRWA is gone, who is going to feed us, who will provide a security, this young man asks. Who is going to take us in?
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN Jerusalem.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: Indirect negotiations are once again underway for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. Sources say the U.S. and Israel are discussing a proposal that involves a month-long ceasefire in exchange for some of the hostages. That's a shorter time frame than the six-week period discussed before talks fell through.
 
Meantime, sources told CNN that those involved in the negotiations believe the key decision maker for Hamas in Gaza is now Mohammed Sinwar. He is the brother of Yahya Sinwar seen here who was killed by Israeli forces earlier this month. However, Hamas has not made any official announcement about a new leader.
 
Lebanon is reporting its highest daily death toll in nearly a month. At least 82 people were killed and nearly 200 injured in Israeli attacks on Monday, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
 
And more than a dozen people were killed in Israeli strikes across southern Lebanon on Tuesday. According to CNN tally, more than 2000 people have been killed since Israel ramped up its campaign against Hezbollah in mid-September. Meanwhile, Hezbollah's Senior Counsel has elected Naim Qaseem as the Iran-backed group's new secretary general. And this comes after his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike last month. State media says Iran's President is praising Qaseem saying and calling him a "bright figure who will strengthen resistance against the country's foes."
 
A more extreme rainfall is expected across parts of Spain where floodwaters have already wreaked havoc in one southeastern city. We'll have details after the break.
 
Plus, South Korea is warning the world about the dangers of North Korean troops in Russia. We're back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:22:05]
 
CHURCH: Flood waters seen rushing through the streets of Valencia in Spain where severe flooding tore down walls and swept away cars after some areas saw up to 300 millimeters or 12 inches of rain in just a few hours on Tuesday. Valencia's regional leader now says some bodies have been found as rescue teams search the area. Extreme rain warnings are in effect across Valencia and forecasters expect the warnings to continue through Wednesday for parts of eastern and southern Spain.
 
Kong-rey has quickly strengthened to a super typhoon in the Philippine Sea. It's now as powerful as a category four Atlantic hurricane and could impact almost the entire island of Taiwan when it makes landfall early Thursday.
 
Our meteorologist Chad Myers has the latest.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, now a super typhoon. Greater than 240 kilometers per hour is the threshold to get you there. This thing went from 120 to 230 kilometers per hour in just 24 hours. What an impressive rapid intensification headed right to Taiwan. On the east side of Taiwan, there will be places that will pick up more than 500 millimeters of rainfall, half a meter, and that's the entire area.
 
That's white. That's the computerized forecast of how much precip is going to come down. Now there's going to be, obviously, flooding damage. But this is a wind event. Everything has a certain factor. Is it a wind? Is it a surge? Is it a flood? We know the one that moved through Philippines didn't have much wind, but it certainly had flooding just last week. So, this is what we're seeing here, as the wind and the surge will probably be equal to, or not even greater than the flooding potential here.
 
An awful lot of wind damage here, many spots here, all the way even into China, are going to see tropical cyclone winds. Somewhere, maybe even over 100 kilometers per hour, and then on up toward Kyushu. Now, Taiwan is no stranger to these big things. Since like 1950 there have been 30 Taiwan landfalls of what's an equivalent of a category four or five Atlantic hurricane. So yes, major damage can happen there in Taiwan and it does.
 
But this year, we've already had two, and really in another but Krathon and Gaemi on and also get me has already taken its toll there in damage across the eastern parts of Taiwan. There's going to be more. Obviously, we could even still see this continue to increase in intensity, probably likely go down before landfall but we're still going to have to watch this. This is going to be a very damaging and likely deadly storm.
 
CHURCH: Russia has launched a new drone attack on the Ukrainian capital. According to Reuters, the mayor of Kyiv wrote on Telegram that several apartment buildings are on fire. He says at least nine people are wounded, including an 11-year-old girl.
 <br>[02:25:01]
 
Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry is claiming a new victory on the Eastern Front, saying troops have captured the Ukrainian town of Selydove in the Donetsk region. The town has been crucial for Ukrainian forces in keeping Russian troops away from the key city of Pokrovsk.
 
The Biden administration is telling Ukrainian officials it wants to provide more assistance for Kyiv, both to help with the harsh winter and the possibility of a second Trump presidency. According to a U.S. official, national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a top Ukrainian official about plans to send more guided rocket systems, armored vehicles and hundreds of long-range air defense missiles.
 
This comes as Russian forces are getting new reinforcements in the form of North Korean troops. Some Western intelligence officials believe a small number of them are already inside Ukrainian territory. And South Korea is sounding the alarm, as CNN's Mike Valerio reports.
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, South Korea's spy agency just revealed some striking details about North Korean troops in Russia. They are training to fight in the war against Ukraine, and that is according to NATO, the United States and South Korea. But lawmakers who were briefed by South Korea's National Intelligence Service here in Seoul say that North Korea may be trying to hide from its own people that these deployments to Russia are actually happening. 
 
So, let's take you through what we know. We have two lawmakers briefed by South Korea's spy agency, the NIS. And the NIS says that North Korean families of these soldiers are being told the troops went to a, "military exercise, not to Russia, not to Ukraine." The lawmakers add news of these troops going to Russia has spread within North Korea despite the regime's effort to contain the truth.
 
And they say there is some, "unrest among North Korean residents and soldiers about why they're making this sacrifice for another country." That certainly would be remarkable, considering North Korea tolerates virtually no dissent against the regime of Kim Jong-Un. We also heard from South Korea's president on this subject. Listen to what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOON SUK YELO, PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA (through translator): This illegal military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a significant security threat to the international community, and could pose a serious risk to our national security.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALERIO: So, what he means by that North Korean troops potentially threatening South Korean security, analysts tell us that North Korean troops could potentially come back home with more knowledge about modern warfare than ever before. The Secretary General of NATO has also said that North Korean troops are already in Russia's Kursk Region. That is where Ukraine has had a foothold in Russian territory since August.
 
The Pentagon is also saying that it assesses there are about 10,000 North Korean troops who have been deployed to train in Russia. Pyongyang and Moscow have neither explicitly confirmed nor denied these troop deployments.
 
Mike Valerio, CNN Seoul.
 
CHURCH: Russia has conducted a long-range missile test meant to simulate its response to a nuclear attack from the west. The Russian defense minister says Tuesday's drill demonstrated how they would conduct a massive nuclear strike with a full arsenal of ground, sea and air launched missiles. President Vladimir Putin has said it would be, "an extremely exceptional measure to use nuclear weapons against the West."
 
But that hasn't stopped him from making veiled nuclear threats throughout Russia's war on Ukraine.
 
Still to come. CNN talks to black voters in the swing state of Georgia to find out who they plan to vote for and why in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:31:05]
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. Well, less than one week to go before Election Day in America and in the battleground state of Georgia, early voting is in full swing. F&amp;M's new state poll finds Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are tied at 49% each among likely voters in the state. So far, early voting data shows 29% of black voters in Georgia have cast their votes. That's a little lower than the 31% that had voted in the same timeframe in 2020. CNN's Elle Reeve spoke with black business owners and residents about how they plan to vote this time.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUCE WRIGHT, PET STORE OWNER:  This is probably the hardest election decision I've ever had to make because I'm basing it off of not my personal self, but my -- just my core belief of who Trump is inside, is what's driving me towards Kamala. ELLE REEVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is Clayton County, Georgia, just south of Atlanta, where more than 84% of voters picked Biden in 2020. That makes Clayton the most Democratic county in all this year's swing states.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  2020 when Biden won, it was Clayton County who turned Georgia blue and got Biden the presidency.
 
REEVE:  How so?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our people turned out. Clayton County turns out. We expect the same for Kamala Harris.
 
REEVE (voice-over):  Almost 300,000 people live here and nearly 70% are black. The campaigns are fighting hard for these voters. Kamala Harris was just here with Stevie Wonder. 
 
We spoke to people at black-owned businesses about what they were thinking in the last weeks before the election.
 
CHAI RICHARDSON, BARBER:  I'm really not into politics, but Kamala Harris, her movement, I will say I support two things that she said and is doing. The $20,000 loan thing for the black entrepreneurs, I really like that because it gives us a chance to get our businesses up off the ground. And another thing is she's trying to legalize marijuana because a lot of us get locked up just for our car smelling like weed. It's a lot of synthetic weed out here, a lot of fake weed that's bad for us.
 
REEVE:  You want it to be legalized and regulated?
 
RICHARDSON:  Yes. And what gets me the most is, it is banned in the South where it's mostly African Americans or black people down here. But up in the other states, the union states, the blue states, whatever you want to call them, it's legalized.
 
REEVE:  Well, who would you vote for if you do decide to vote?
 
VALERIE BURKS, HAIR STYLIST:  I don't know, maybe Harris.
 
REEVE:  And why?
 
BURKS:  Just listening to (inaudible) that she's said so far, as far as like helping people. I'm big on helping.
 
REEVE:  So why would you be undecided right now then?
 
BURKS:  I would have to say, because this will be my first time.
 
REEVE:  Yeah.
 
(LAUGH)
 
BURKS:  First time, like, woo. Okay. My mom, none of them, they -- they've never done it. So --
 
REEVE (voice-over):  We found a little more ambivalence about Harris than we expected based on past voting here.
 
SHARON LOVE NELSON, PODCASTER:  Am I decisive? I'm going to be straight up with you.
 
REEVE:  That's okay. Tell me more. Why?
 
NELSON:  Because it's two of the lesser evils. They're all bashing each other and saying this and saying that. Then I take that and I go do research. And when I research it, I'm like, but I do know one thing. Trump is so bold that if the aliens is coming, he going to [ph] tell you.
 
(LAUGH)
 
REEVE:  Yeah. So in an Independence Day scenario --
 
NELSON:  Yes.
 
REEVE:  He would tell you to evacuate?
 
NELSON:  He would tell -- so I mean he just -- he can't keep his mouth shut.
 
REEVE:  What are your constituents saying about the election?
 
ERIC BELL, GEORGIA STATES HOUSE DEMOCRAT:  You get a mixed bag of peanuts. You get a lot of people that say, Go Kamala. You get a lot of people say, I'm not into politics. And then, you even have voices say that I'm voting for Donald Trump.
 
REEVE:  Early voting numbers were really high. What do you think that means?
 
BELL:  I think that means people have something to vote for. I think that people are impassioned, emboldened. They're excited to vote for something. I'm just hoping they're voting for Kamala Harris, honestly.
 
BRITNEY TUCKER, REGISTERED NURSE:  We -- our house is divided --
 
REEVE:  Really?
 
TUCKER:  -- at this time.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
My husband, he's more leaning towards the Trump side and I'm leaning more towards the Harris side, but I'm still trying to persuade him to come to the other side.
 
REEVE:  And what is his objections?
 
TUCKER:  Well, he just doesn't feel that like a woman is fit for the job, so to speak.
 
JAMAL SIMS, BARBER:  What you getting? (Inaudible)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.
 
SIMS:  And then, we bringing the top down?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah.
 
SIMS:  I'm going to be honest with you. During his time in presidency, a lot of money was flowing around.
 
REEVE:  Yeah.
 
SIMS:  You know what I mean?
 
REEVE:  Yeah.
 
SIMS:  So, that was kind of like my reason for being like, hey, if you are going to do that again, we run that [ph] back. He does a lot of stuff for shock value, just to get you to look at him, you know what I mean? So I don't really be taking none of that stuff serious. I'm going to take my time with it because, you know, it's like the lesser of the two evils type of thing.
 
REEVE:  One topic of conversation has been the idea that some men don't want to vote for a woman president. Do you think that's a factor?
 
CRICK THE BARBER, CLAYTON COUNTY RESIDENT:  I hear that a lot.
 
REEVE:  Yeah. What do they say?
 
CRICK THE BARBER:  Women are too emotional to run the country.
 
REEVE:  What do you think of that?
 
CRICK THE BARBER:  What do I think of that? I'm married. You think I'm about to answer that?
 
(LAUGH)
 
REEVE:  What do you say to them?
 
CRICK THE BARBER:  What do I say to them?
 
REEVE:  Yeah. When they say that.
 
CRICK THE BARBER:  I tell them the same thing I told you. I'm married, so -- and my wife runs my household. So, you know what, if they run a household like that, they could -- I believe they can do it. I just thought about it. I believe a woman could run the presidency. I believe that.
 
SHARENE BING, VOTED FOR KAMALA HARRIS:  I've never seen a president tweet so much out of emotions. So to say a female cannot run the country because of emotions and then the person she's running against stay on Twitter all day, reacting because of emotions, doesn't make sense. There are some men that are very much emotional. Their emotions might come out in different ways, anger, rage, but it's still an emotion. If you all say a woman can't run the country because she's emotional, well then, he can't run the country because he is emotional and that's all we got. It ain't like we got 10 candidates to pick. We got one and two. So it's -- you want the emotional female, so to speak, when I say and I'm quoting it, emotional female since women are emotional or do you want the emotional male?
