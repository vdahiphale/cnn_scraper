COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What`s up lovely people. Happy Friday, Friyay. Let`s unleash our full potential, take good vibes and lots of love into 
 
 this weekend. Make a feel-good Friday. Remember what is within influences what happens without. 
 
I`m Coy. This is CNN 10. And we start with news on Hurricane Lee. On Thursday, this storm was already making quite a scene in Bermuda, whipping 
 
 up some serious winds. It looks like this hurricane is taking a Northern route and picking up the pace. 
 
Lee is expected to bring some heavy rain, strong winds and coastal flooding, and it looks like it`s making its way all the way up towards new 
 
 England and Canada, and will likely stick around through the weekend. 
 
Hurricane Lee might only affect coastal areas, making landfall somewhere between Northeast main and Nova Scotia in Canada. Hurricane and tropical 
 
 storm watches have already been issued for many coastal areas in new England. 
 
We`re not entirely sure what to expect in terms of damage just yet, but we do know that conditions in the ocean like the atmosphere and super warm 
 
 water temperatures have been creating greater risk from increased storms this season,.
 
Let`s head to Morocco now where there`s a scientific mystery that if solved might be able to help us predict earthquakes before they happen. Video 
 
 taken before Friday`s 6.8 magnitude earthquake in Morocco captured mysterious lights in the nighttime sky. They`re called earthquake lights 
 
 and reports of these types of atmospheric illuminations actually date back to Ancient Greece would you believe. 
 
Experts say earthquake lights can appear in different forms and colors. They could be dancing across the sky or look like glowing floating spheres. 
 
 They could even appear as flickering flames creeping across the ground. Seismologists and scientists are trying to unlock the mysteries of these 
 
 illuminating outbursts. Some experts say that certain crystals in rocks generate electricity when they break during an earthquake. 
 
The hope is that one day we might be able to use these earthquake lights or the electric charge that causes them to help predict major earthquakes 
 
 before they happen.

NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sheltering from the sweltering September heat, survivors of Morocco`s earthquake spend 
 
 another day coming to terms with a tragedy that has befallen this shaken community. 
 
Temporary shelters for those left homeless by the earthquake have been set up across this region. Many of the tents that you can see here have been 
 
 supplied either by the Moroccan government or by local organizations and charities. But the Moroccan government has also requested assistance from 
 
 members of the international community. And we`ve seen these international teams on the ground providing support, not only on the search and rescue 
 
 front, but also with the humanitarian relief effort.
 
ROBERT NORMAN, UK INTERNATIONAL SEARCH AND RESCUE, COMMAND SUPPORT OFFICER: The immediate priorities for our team is always saving life, following on 
 
 from that where we can help medical assistance identify humanitarian needs. So that even when that rescue phase does close, we`ve provided all the 
 
 information we can to help humanitarian relief that will follow us.
 
BASHIR: Across the quake zone here in Morocco, there has also been an outpouring of support from the local community, with donations or food, 
 
 water, and medication. 
 
The volunteers here tell us they still need more tents and crucially long- term support with the rebuild effort. The government says the reconstruction of homes lost in the disaster is a priority, but for so many 
 
 impacted families, there is no telling how long it`ll be before they have a real home to return to.

WIRE:  Let`s talk now about the future of AI or artificial intelligence, the science of making machines that can think like humans while also 
 
 processing large amounts of data in ways that humans can`t. Some of the largest leaders in tech high profile CEOs and members of the Senate met 
 
 this week in Washington. Why? They were in deep conversation about the future of AI regulations. And they had some serious words of caution about 
 
 AI, including the potential impact on humanity, like potentially putting humans out of jobs or what might happen if it`s not used responsibly and 
 
 regulated correctly. But it wasn`t all doom and gloom. They also chatted about how AI could be a total game changer in a good way for our future 
 
 society. To give us the low down on all this AI drama, here`s CNN Tech Quiz, Brian Fung.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN FUNG, CNN REPORTER:  There`s broad agreement that government should have some role in regulating AI, but there is still no consensus on how. 
 
 That`s the big takeaway from a day long summit on Capitol hill involving some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world. 
 
In the meeting, Bill Gates spoke of how AI could help end world hunger. Others talked about its potential to cure cancer. Elon Musk to the meeting 
 
 "may go down in history as being very important for the future of civilization." But questions are still swirling about how the us might 
 
 approach AI regulation. Does the U.S. need a new federal agency to regulate AI? What about bans on AI and political advertising? How soon could 
 
 Congress come up with a comprehensive bill? Many of these questions are still unresolved after Gates, Musk, and others like Mark Zuckerberg 
 
 descended on Washington to offer their views. 
 
Meanwhile, officials in the meeting from the entertainment industry and labor and civil rights groups called for protecting workers, writers, and 
 
 minorities from some of the harms that AI could cause. Senators coming out of the meeting said most everyone agreed, the United States should remain a 
 
 leader in AI development while also trying to protect people. But outside of the meeting room, some lawmakers took issue with how the sessions were 
 
 closed to the public.
