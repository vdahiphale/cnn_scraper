ANN COREN, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to all our viewers watching around the world. I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.
 
Ahead on CNN Newsroom, six months since the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel. Now we wait to see if Israel will allow aid to enter Gaza via the Erez Crossing to help ease the humanitarian crisis there.
 
Another grim milestone, Rwanda marks 30 years since the genocide that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis. How the date is being remembered.
 
And one of our top military experts we frequently speak to has just spent the week in Ukraine. We'll get his assessment of the war as Kyiv urges its allies to step up their support.
 
Hamas says it's sending a delegation to Cairo today for ceasefire and hostage talks. Sources tell CNN that the directors of the CIA and Israel's intelligence services will also be there.
 
Sunday is a milestone in this conflict, six months since the Hamas attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza. Well, Israel could allow aid to go through the Erez Border Crossing in the coming hours where you can see the Erez Crossing in Northern Gaza on this map.
 
Israel has also said it will allow more aid to flow through the Kerem Shalom Crossing. So far, most aid to Gaza has gone through the crossing at Rafah.
 
Well CNN, Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman joins us now live from Beirut. And, Ben, any sign that this desperately needed aid is in fact going through.
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  No sign yet as far as we can tell here from Beirut, Anna. But yesterday, the Israeli cabinet did approve the supply of humanitarian aid through the Erez Crossing and also first through the port of Ashdod nearby.
 
Now, it's one thing to approve it, it's another thing to actually make it happen. And we know that as a result of intense Israeli bombardment of the northern part of Gaza, particularly the area around the Erez Crossing, that many of the roads have been severely damaged or are completely impassable at this point. So, it's one thing to approve it, it's another thing to actually make it happen.
 
Now, we've heard from the U.N. that the Israelis have said they will allow the reopening of 20 bakeries in the northern part of Gaza and are also reopening water supply lines that have been cut since the 7th of October.
 
The question is, of course, for instance, with water, the pipe system in Northern Gaza has probably been severely damaged as well. And if you reopen bakeries, if you can't resupply them, what good can they actually be?
 
So, I think the coming days are going to show how, in reality, the humanitarian situation can be improved in Gaza. And also keep in mind, Northern Gaza is the most severely hit. The southern part of Gaza near the Rafah crossing is somewhat better supplies. And I stress the somewhat part of that. But northern Gaza, the situation, by all accounts, is desperate and that aid needs to get in as quickly as possible.
 
Now, according to some reports, we're seeing, the Israelis have agreed to double the amount of trucks carrying humanitarian aid from Jordan from 25 to 50. But there as well, those trucks are headed to the southern part of Gaza, not to the north. Anna?
 
COREN:  Ben, overnight, tens of thousands of Israelis turned out for anti-government protests in Tel Aviv. Families of hostages joined the movement. I mean, there's groundswell against Prime Minister Netanyahu and his right wing government certainly appears to be growing. What is your sense?
 <br>[03:05:00]
 
WEDEMAN:  Yes, it is growing it's significant. It wasn't just in Tel Aviv it was in other Israeli Cities as well. And it's important to underscore that this is against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It's not against the war. The majority of Israelis, a large majority of Israelis, according to all the opinion polls, continue to support the war in Gaza. Many feel that the Israelis have not been strong enough in pursuing Hamas and, in general, conducting the war in Gaza, but it's against the prime minister himself.
 
Now, what we saw as a result in some of these demonstrations is that there were arrests and, in fact, there was an incident where a 71- year-old man in Tel Aviv rammed into a group of demonstrators leaving at least three injured. So, these demonstrations definitely underscore the vulnerability of Prime Minister Netanyahu. They underscore the desire of many Israelis to see a change in leadership. However, they do not indicate any desire at this point to end the war in Gaza. Anna?
 
COREN:  Ben Wedeman joining us from Beirut, great to have you on this story, thank you so much.
 
A top Iranian general says his country will decide how and when to respond to the Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria that killed seven officials, including top figures from its Revolutionary Guard cause.
 
The chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces called Monday's attack, quote, a suicide committed by Israel that won't remain unanswered.
 
More now from CNN's Priscilla Alvarez in Washington.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  The U.S. and Israeli governments are on high alert for a potential attack by Iran as soon as next week. That attack stemming from an Israeli airstrike in Damascus that killed multiple top Iranian commanders.
 
Iran vowed revenge, and the U.S. made clear that they were not involved in the airstrike, nor did they know about it ahead of time, also warning Iran that it should not be used as a pretext to attack U.S. personnel and facilities.
 
But the U.S. and Israeli officials are staying in close touch and preparing around the clock for this potential attack that U.S. official described as, quote, inevitable.
 
Now, it could unfold in multiple different ways, and it's unclear when exactly would happen. Officials anticipate that it would target U.S. or Israeli assets in the Middle East.
 
Now, President Biden and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talked about this in their the phone call was a major point of discussion, and, of course, the top concern for the administration is that if there is a direct strike on Israel by Iran, that it could rapidly escalate an already tense region, and the White House has been trying to avoid a broader regional conflict.
 
So, the U.S. and Israeli officials staying in close touch as they monitor for this potential attack.
 
Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington.
 
COREN:  Ukraine is reeling from a barrage of Russian strikes that hit at least three cities. Officials say Kharkiv was struck Saturday afternoon on the heels of a similar attack hours earlier. At least seven people were killed in those strikes and 14 others injured.
 
The city of Odessa took missile fire as well on Saturday, which left one person dead, while Russian missiles also took aim at Zaporizzhzhia for a second straight day but didn't cause any casualties this time.
 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for Ukraine's allies to help it strengthen air defenses around Kharkiv.
 
For more analysis, we're joined by Mick Ryan, a retired major general of the Australian Army. He's also the author of book, War Transformed, The Future of 21st Century Great Power Competition and Conflict. The major general is speaking with us from Warsaw, Poland. Mick, great to have you with us.
 
You have spent this week in Ukraine and have only just come out. Tell us, what did you learn on this trip? I know you spent time with President Zelenskyy's national security adviser. And how would you describe the mood in the country right now?
 
MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN (RET.), AUSTRALIAN ARMY:  Well, hello, Anna. I would describe the mood as one of concern. They are very worried about Russia's potential mobilization, building additional forces for ground combat, but in particular this campaign of enhanced strikes against Ukrainian cities, which is designed primarily to terrorize the Ukrainian population and force further dislocations of their lives and force the Ukrainian population to move further west.
 <br>[03:10:01]
 
COREN:  We just mentioned those strikes on Kharkiv. Russia has also been pounding Ukraine's infrastructure in recent weeks. And there is this strong sense that Russia is gearing up for a big new offensive. I mean, how will Ukraine withstand this push by Russia if that $61 billion U.S. aid package isn't passed through Congress?
 
RYAN:  Well, it will be very difficult. The Ukrainians believe they can hold this year, but the Russians have a significant advantage at the moment. They're able to recruit around 30,000 people per month at the moment, according to British intelligence. It's possible they'll undertake another mobilization of around 300,000 people, but this will set them up for some form of large-scale offensive in the back half of the year, which will comprise a real danger time for the Ukrainians.
 
COREN:  Ukraine, as we know, desperately needs weapons, munitions, air defense systems. Russia is reportedly firing at least five times as many artillery rounds as Ukraine. Knowing this and the recent losses on the battlefield, what is Ukraine hoping to achieve in the months ahead? Is it holding ground or is there a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the works?
 
RYAN:  Well, Ukraine, at the moment, is planning on getting through 2024, Wall Street constituting its military. The president, when he appointed General Syrskyi as a new commander in chief, not only directed a military strategy for this year, but also a transformation of the Ukrainian forces for passing (ph) the fight and building the ability to go on the offensive in 2025. So, really, this is about getting through 2024, sustaining western support, getting this big package of aid through the U.S. Congress and build the ability to go on the offensive next year.
 
COREN:  Ukraine, at times, is hitting back. It's striking targets inside Russia such as oil refineries. From a military standpoint, what is the value of these sorts of assaults on Russian territory?
 
RYAN:  Yes, Ukraine is fighting a couple of fights here. It's obviously doing the ground fight, the close battle, but this long distance fight through this maturing and very sophisticated, strategic strike complex they've developed is designed to hurt Russia economically.
 
Russia has been undertaking economic warfare against Ukraine since the beginning of the war. Ukraine, who is not able to make big gains on the battlefield at the moment, is seeking to hurt Russia economically at long distance. COREN:  You mentioned Russia's mobilization. Ukraine also needs more troops. How is the mobilization bill reducing the age from 27 to 25 years of age being received in Ukraine? And is this enough?
 
RYAN:  Well, the mobilization bill was clearly a difficult political fight in Ukraine. It was subject to around 3,000 -- 4,000 amendments before it got through. It will change the dynamics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It will bring in more people. But, clearly, the Ukrainians will also have to be provided with far more firepower if they're going to succeed in 2024 and into 2025. And that's why this bill from the United States is so very important to them.
 
COREN:  Absolutely. We're all watching, hoping Congress will pass it.
 
Major General Mick Ryan, as always, great to speak to you and thank you for joining us from Warsaw, in Poland.
 
RYAN:  Thanks, Anna, great to be with you.
 
COREN:  Well, it's been 30 years since the genocide in Rwanda shocked the world. We'll bring you the latest as the country remembers with ceremonies and vigils.
 
Plus, tensions dramatically escalate between Ecuador and Mexico following a raid on Mexico's embassy. How world leaders are reacting, that story ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:15:00]
 
COREN:  Rwanda is marking 30 years since the 1994 genocide, when an estimated 800,000 members of the Tutsi ethnic minority were slaughtered. Wreaths have been laid at the mass graves by dignitaries. Among the other events, the lighting of a flame of remembrance in the capital of Kigali, a national commemoration ceremony and a vigil.
 
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is leading the American delegation. He was in office during the 100-day spree of murders, beheadings and rapes by members of the Hutu ethnic majority that horrified people everywhere, and the allegations the world failed to act as the carnage unfolded.
 
COREN:  Well, there's growing condemnation following a raid on Mexico's embassy in Ecuador to arrest a former Ecuadorian vice president. The United Nations secretary general says he's alarmed. Leaders from Latin American countries condemned the raid, expressing solidarity with Mexico.
 
Nicaragua said it would break all diplomatic ties with Ecuador. Ecuadorian police entered Mexico's embassy on Friday to arrest Jorge Glas. He had been sheltering there since December and was granted political asylum on Friday. Glas has been convicted twice on corruption charges, which he says are politically motivated.
 
Mexico has denounced the raid, calling it barbaric and an outrage against international law. Ecuador says the raid was carried out because there was a real risk that Glas could have escaped.

GABRIELA SOMMERFIELD, ECUADORIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  The decision of the president of the republic was taken in the face of a real risk of imminent escape of the citizen wanted by justice.
 
The Mexican embassy, by receiving Mr. Glas Espinel, contributed to the failure to comply with the obligation to appear weekly before the judicial authority, thus affecting Ecuador's democratic institutions, clearly contravening the fundamental principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other estates.

COREN:  On Sunday night, Mexico's presidential hopefuls will hold their first debate ahead of general elections in June. It's sure to be a remarkable election. The two leading candidates are women, so it's likely that Mexico will soon have its first female president.
 
They'll be making their cases to voters about how they see the future of the country and the future of Mexico's relationship with the U.S.
 
CNN's Gustavo Valdez has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Claudia Sheinbaum wants to make history as Mexico's first female president. She has a comfortable lead in the polls running as the candidate of the ruling party, Morena.
 
Her main challenger is Xochitl Galvez, who represents a coalition of opposition parties. Jorge Alvarez Maynez, a former congressman, is in a distant third place. Whoever wins the June election will shape the future of the Mexico-U.S. relationship.
 
DUNCAN WOOD, MEXICO INSTITUTE, WILSON CENTER:  There is no bilateral relationship in the world that matters more to the lives of Americans than the relationship with Mexico.
 
VALDES:  Duncan Wood is senior adviser of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington. He says it's not surprising that border related issues, like trade and drug trafficking, are key with migration being top of the list.
 
WOOD:  Making sure that Mexico continues to be a good partner on migration will be very, very important and absolute priority.
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
VALDES:  Claudia Sheinbaum makes no secret that she would continue the leftist, nationalist, populist policies of current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, favoring coordination over subordination.
 
But Wood says Mexico's cooperation with the United States has not been the best in recent years.
 
WOOD:  U.S. government officials feel as though there has been an under-investment in the relationship by the Mexican government over the past six years.
 
VALDES:  Xotchil Galvez believes that the Mexican president has used migration to blackmail the United States, threatening to facilitate the transit of migrants who wants to get to the states whenever American officials say or do something he doesn't like. She vows to engage in meaningful negotiations with the White House.
 
WOOD:  We're looking at a much more open approach to bilateral relations, a return to a more institutional approach.
 
VALDES:  Also in play, the future relationship of Mexico with China, as Beijing continues to increase its investments in Latin America
 
WOOD:  It offers an opportunity for Mexico, perhaps, to diversify a little bit away from the United States. It presents a risk perhaps to Washington as well, and it's being observed very closely here.
 
VALDES:  But Mexican voters are not the only ones who will decide the future of the bi-national relationship. Whoever wins the November elections in the United States and his personal relationship with the next Mexican president will be also a big factor.
 
Jorge Martinez, professor of economics at Monterrey's Technical Institutes, says that one thing is perception and another reality. His perception is that Trump would have a more adversary relationship with Mexico, given his rhetoric, but he managed to negotiate a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.
 
In the end, the tone of the bi-national relationship might be defined by the personalities of the next presidents.

COREN:  Well, it's almost here, only one more day until Monday's rare total solar eclipse in North America. When we come back, an inside look at how the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is crafting the perfect total eclipse of the sun playlist.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN:  That rendition of Bonnie Tyler's timeless hit comes courtesy of the in-house tribute band at Cleveland, Ohio's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which has big plans for Monday's eclipse across North America.
 
Miguel Marquez reports.
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I'm not sure if you knew that Cleveland rocks on a good day, but during an eclipse, it will totally rock. It is in the path of totality. This is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that is in Cleveland, famous for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame here.
 
Basically, it's like a concert. They have their themed eclipse glasses. It's a little like a concert because we have our backstage pass to Solar Fest. They even a T-shirt, like a rock T-shirt, a tour T-shirt for the path of totality tour with all the cities on the backside.
 <br>[03:25:09]
 
Now, this is downtown Cleveland, the Science Center, which is right next door in the sun. If it is a cloudless day like it is today, it will be right up there and it should be a perfect day if we get a beautiful day like this.
 
One of the cool things that the Rock and Roll Hall of doing, they're going to have speakers set up throughout the city and there will be a special playlist to go along with the eclipse itself.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GREG HARRIS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME:  When it happens, we're all out here. We're going to have music blasting and it's going to blast on our plaza and all through downtown Cleveland, we play speakers. We're all going to have the same soundtrack as this happens and we're playing celestial music.
 
MARQUEZ:  You are D.J.-ing the eclipse?
 
HARRIS:  Yes, we are D.J.-ing the eclipse for everybody that's in town. And you're going to hear David Bowie, Elton John Rocket Man, Donovan, you'll hear probably some Taylor Swift thrown in, but then Pink Floyd Eclipse is going to be our penultimate moment.
 
MARQUEZ:  Dude, rock and roll.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUEZ:  So now, during totality, Pink Floyd's song Eclipse should be playing. If all the timing works out, we just now need a cloudless sky. The weather for Monday is partly sunny, partly cloudy, depending which way you look at it. We are hoping for the partly sunny bit. Back to you.
 
COREN:  And join us Monday for the total solar eclipse as its path moves from Mexico, then through the Eastern United States and into Canada. Experience the total eclipse from numerous locations, along with plenty of science and excitement along the way. Our special coverage starts at 12:00 P.M. Eastern.
 
Parisians are expected to get a break today from the unseasonably warm weather they've had over the last few days. On Friday and Saturday, the French capital hit the mid-20s, with temperatures as high as 30 degrees in the south of France. But today, the French weather service forecasts a high in Paris of about 17 degrees Celsius with some showers. That's about normal for this time of the year. Forecasters say parts of France usually don't hit the 30-degree mark until at least mid-May.
 
Well, it will be a showdown between UConn and Purdue for the NCAA Men's National Championship on Monday. With an 86-72 win Saturday over Alabama, defending champ UConn has a chance to make history. If victorious on Monday, the Huskies could become the only the eighth program to win back-to-back titles.
 
But the Purdue Boilmakers will try to stop that. They're heading into their first national championship game since 1969, after they put an end to North Carolina State's miracle run 63-50.
 
Thanks so much for your company. I'm Anna Coren. African Voices Changemakers is next, and I'll be back in 30 minutes' time. See you then.
