JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST:  Because, you know, as I mentioned earlier to Boris, you know, they're divided. But the one way to get Congress off of their back, and the way to get the -- give more -- the public more confidence, which is really what this is all about, as I keep stressing, this is our Supreme Court. The way the give the public more confidence and to have the Congress standdown is for them to adopt their own rules, then you don't have any kind of tension of between what can Congress do and what can Congress not.
 
And I know that there are members of the nine who want that, they just have not been able to get it. And I think they're starting to realize that this, you know, they don't like the word crisis, you know, crisis is a word that's overused. But it's certainly something that has provoked the public, and it has added to the overall loss of stature and esteem that this Supreme Court has. And I think that, again, some of them are taking that to heart. Some of them, apparently, are not.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR:  And Norm, if we can step back and look at the big picture of the context of what Joan is referencing, the judicial branch is such an important part of a democracy. If their decisions could potentially be perceived as being clouded by financial interests or by personal gifts and other things that the justices might be receiving, that's a pretty big problem.
 
NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS CZAR:  It is, and that's why, for example, Justice Kagan from the liberal wing has stepped forward and publicly disagreed with Justice Alito and said, look, Congress can regulate constitutionally. We see the crisis in the plummeting poll numbers for the Supreme Court, once the most trusted branch of our government, now was sinking in the public esteem.
 
We see it in the questions about, not just one justice, but running across the board. The Clarence Thomas situation is the most extreme. But there has been a series of stories. And you know, in a time in our country when our democracy is under stress, it's all of the more important that the Supreme Court, which is the ultimate decider when there are disputes, that they be trusted.
 
And this is a wound that just keeps bleeding. They -- something must be done. But for now, certainly, we didn't see in these disclosures, any recognition by either of the two justices that they have done anything wrong. Quite the contrary, they are standing by their positions.
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Well, for one thing, the conversation will certainly continue, I'm sure. Joan Biskupic, Norm Eisesen, thank you both. And we'll be right back.

SOLOMON:  Welcome back. Sentencing is now underway for a Proud Boys member who was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the January 6th attack at the Capitol. Joseph Biggs is the first of five members of the far-right group to be sentenced this week and next.
 
SANCHEZ:  Let's go live outside the courthouse now with CNN's Evan Perez who's been tracking all the developments. So, Evan, what happened in the hearing?
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the hearing is still underway. It just got underway a little while ago, Boris and Rahel. What we have here is the first of the number of Proud Boys who are going to be sentenced in the coming days. Joseph Biggs is an organizer -- was an organizer with the group in Florida. And he entered the Capitol, he said not with violence, but he did enter the Capitol.
 
But right now, what the judge is saying that the conduct of the members of the Proud Boys that day was not spontaneous aggression. What he's saying is that they were, in his view, making a deliberate attempt to help the mob push their way into the U.S. Capitol.
 
Of course, we've heard testimony from members of the Capitol police, police officers that day who were on the receiving end of the horrific violence on January 6th. One of them testified just a few days ago in court ahead of the sentencing that, I wasn't sure I was going home. For first time ever, that officer said, coming to work was not sure, she would be going home that day because of the violence that was carried out.
 
Now, as you pointed out, five of these members are going to be sentenced in the coming days. The prosecution has asked for at least, at least 30 years for each of them. One of the things prosecutors have said in their request for sentencing is that the members of the Proud Boys were at the vanguard of political violence for many, many years. And that they sought to change course of American history on January 6th. Of course, the violence happening just right across from where we're standing right now at the Federal Courthouse, the U.S. Capitol just a few hundred yards from where I am standing. We're watching this hearing as it continues. Again, Joseph Biggs is the first of five members of the Proud Boys that are going to be sentenced in the coming days, guys.
 
SOLOMON:  All right. Evan, keep us posted as that hearing continues. Evan Perez live for us outside court in Washington. Evan, thank you.
 
Also happening this morning, President Joe Biden vowing to help Americans affected by two major natural disasters happening just weeks apart. Biden's announcement includes $95 million to help Maui improve its electrical grid after those fires that killed more than 100 people. 
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
Plus, he's also vowing to help those affected by Hurricane Idalia which slammed into Florida's Gulf Coast yesterday as a powerful category 3 storm.
 
SANCHEZ:  Let's take you to the White House now with CNN's Arlette Saenz. So, Arlette, Biden also issuing a warning to the Republican Party about funding.
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, he did, Boris. President Biden said that the federal government will be there for the long haul to help in these recovery efforts, not just with Hurricane Idalia but also those wildfires in Maui.
 
But he said that in order for FEMA to be able to do its job, to be able to carry out these recovery efforts, they need Congress to pass additional funding. Now, the White House has requested about $12 billion in funding for disaster relief fund from Congress. And FEMA Director Deanne Criswell, just earlier this week, said that they currently only have $3.4 billion in their covers, in their disaster relief fund. She expects that that will run a deficit at some point in mid-September.
 
Really highlighting some of the issues that FEMA will be facing as they're facing strains not just of this hurricane, not just to the wildfire, but also preparing for future disasters. And President Biden said that he is ready to call out Republicans if they don't get on board with this disaster relief funding. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The answer is if I can't do that, I'm going to point out why. How can we not respond? My God. How can we not respond to these needs? And so, I'm confident even though there's a lot of talk from some of our friends up there on the hill about the cost, we got to do it. This is the United States of America.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) SAENZ:  Now, the White House had made this request a bit earlier in August and had also tied it to additional funding for Ukraine, something that Republican lawmakers have expressed some opposition to. So, this is setting up one of the looming spending fights that will proceed as Congress is set to return in September.
 
Now, I also want to note, President Biden announced that they are devoting $95 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to try to help harden Hawaii's electric grid in the wake of that wildfire. Of course, these are two natural disasters and crises that FEMA is dealing with in this moment. And of course, there's still more to come in hurricane season as FEMA is preparing for recovery efforts, but also preparing for what could come ahead.
 
SOLOMON:  Absolutely. All right. Arlette Saenz live for us there at the White House. Arlette, thank you.
 
Boris.
 
SANCHEZ:  The impact of the war in Ukraine has been far and wide. And now, a new report is shedding light on how the continued fighting is creating major issues for the global food supply. We'll be back in just a few moments.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
SANCHEZ:  New this morning, Russia shooting down four drones in two separate incidents as Ukraine brings the war to Russia. Earlier this week, Russia saw the biggest wave of drone attacks since the war began. Six regions, including Moscow coming under attack earlier this week, no casualties reported. All of this while Ukrainian officials say that Kyiv came under a massive bombardment, the most powerful assault in months, killing two people. One indirect effect of the continued fighting is major disruption to the global food supply.
 
An unclassified report released by Congress describes it as the worst in decades for food security, especially impacting poor countries in the Middle East and Africa. Joining us now to explain the findings, CNN's Katie Bo Lillis who's live for us from Washington. So, Katie Bo, what is the intelligence community think of all of this?
 
KATIE BO LILLIS, CNN INTELLIGENCE REPORTER:  Boris, so, according to this unclassified report from the U.S. Intelligence Community, even though international food security concerns have abated somewhat since the beginning of this year, what happens next for global food prices depends on a couple of big factors.
 
One of them, intelligence committee is closely watching is what happens with the Black Sea Grain Initiative? This had allowed Ukraine to safely transport its agricultural products out of Black Sea ports and to the international market. But Russia, in July, scuttled that deal. And even though Ukraine has found a couple of work-arounds, getting their stuff out of the country remains a huge, huge challenge.
 
This is a big deal for intelligence community who are concerned about instability in some of the countries caused by food insecurity.
 
SANCHEZ:  So, Batie Bo, if these countries in the Middle East and Africa can't provide food for their populations, that has huge implications for their stability, and for the ability of those governments to stay in place to even function, right?
 
LILLIS:  I -- Boris, that's precisely why the intelligence community cares here, right? Their concern with food insecurity is that if these governments in Northern Africa and in the Middle East aren't able to provide enough food to their populations, and if starvation does in fact become a problem, this could lead to popular uprisings to insecurity. That's why you're seeing house intelligence committee members who released this report yesterday accused Putin of weaponizing global food supplies. Boris.
 
SANCHEZ:  Katie Bo Lillis, some really astounding findings in the report. We appreciate the reporting. Thanks so much.
 
Rahel.
 
SOLOMON:  OK, Boris. Coming up for us. Senator Republican Leader Mitch McConnell reassuring allies and staying on the job after a second public incident sparked health concerns. What's McConnell's office and Capitol Hill are saying about his health? When we come back.

SOLOMON:  Welcome back. With racket in hands and tears in her eyes, Caroline Wozniacki had a big win at the U.S. Open last night. The former number one player in the world returned to the tennis court after three years away. CNN Sports Anchor Andy Scholes joins us live with the details. Andy, she was a super mom on the court.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Rahel. So, Caroline Wozniacki, she retired from tennis for three and a half years, had two kids, but the former number one player in the world is back now, just playing as good as ever. And last night, Wozniacki pulling off the upset of 11-seat (ph) Petra Kvitova winning in straight sets to advance to the third round.
 
This is the first Grand Slam tournament back for the 33-year-old since the 2020 Australian Open. Wozniacki -- she's actually wiping tears away after the win. And said, it was such a dream come true to be back winning at Arthur Ashe stadium.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI FORMER WORLD NUMBER 1:  Being out here on Arthur Ashe Stadium night session, playing in front of a packed crowd, I mean, this couldn't be better. It's a dream come true. And if you'd asked me three years ago -- if you'd asked me three years ago, I would have said, I'll never be back here playing on this court. But to be back and to be the world's number 11 feels very, very special. So, thank you everyone for coming out tonight and supporting me. It really means so much to me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  And Wozniacki will face American Jennifer Brady in her next match set for tomorrow.
 
Coco Gauff, meanwhile, looking strong. Cruising into the third round with the straight sets win over 16-year-old Russian Mirra Andreeva. The 19-year-old American says she learned to be more aggressive after struggling to win her first-round match. Coco now moves on to face 32nd seated Elise Mertens of Belgium. Coco's best finish at the U.S. Open is an appearance in the quarter finals.
 
And on the men's side, you got Novak Djokovic, just continuing to impress in his return to the U.S. Open. Djokovic is headed to the third round after winning in straight sets last night. The 36-year-old Serbian looking to add to his record tally of 23 men's Grand Slam title. He missed the U.S. Open last year because he's unvaccinated against COVID-19.
 
Joker -- he's actually won six of the last nine Grand Slams he's played in. But despite that, Rahel, he says he still has the hunger, and here's hoping him and Carlos Alcaraz keep winning because it would be great to see them in the final like they did at Wimbledon. That's such a good match.
 
SOLOMON:  Absolutely. Absolutely. I would love to see that. All right. Andy Scholes live for us in Atlanta. Andy, thank you.
 
SCHOLES:  All right.
 
SOLOMON:  Boris.
 
SANCHEZ:  Idalia is moving out to the Atlantic after setting new records and leaving behind a trail of destruction across four states. Just ahead, where the storm's heavy rains and gusty winds remain, and a look at what will be a massive clean-up operation. "CNN News Central" is back in minutes.
