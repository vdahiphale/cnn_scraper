THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[15:30:00] 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: We're in the midst of what is expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period ever. Right now millions of Americans already hitting the roads, heading to airports ahead of the upcoming holiday.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: In all, the TSA expects a record-setting Thanksgiving holiday at airports with more than 18 million people taking to the skies and on top of that another 71 million expected to gas up and drive to their Thanksgiving location. 
 
But be warned, a mix of wintry weather and ongoing air traffic controller shortages is threatening to disrupt some of those travel plans. CNN's Pete Muntean joins us now live from DCA, the mayor, the unofficial mayor we should say of DCA.
 
Pete, set the stage for what travelers can expect this weekend and perhaps the most important thing that they should be packing.
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Oh, their patience of course boys. You know, so far so smooth here at DCA, the Terminal 2 North Checkpoint. Rush is building a little bit of the current wait times right now, between 8 and 11 minutes according to the live tracker here for standard screening. About five minutes to get through pre-check. 
 
TSA says it's anticipating about 2.8 million people at airports nationwide today. An even bigger number tomorrow, about 2.9 million people. TSA getting pretty good at making these predictions because the top 10 days in TSA history for air travel numbers have been in 2024. The really interesting thing here is according to TSA administrator David Pekoske, he tells me that some airports might be so slammed that they may not be able to keep the standard wait time promise for standard screening. That's about 30 minutes or less for pre-check. That's about 10 minutes or less. 
 
Of course a lot of people are driving. It's really more of a driving holiday. AAA says 80 million people in total will travel 50 miles or more. 70 million of them will drive. And I want you to listen now to AAA's Aixa Diaz.
 
She says the really interesting thing now is AAA is considering this a seven-day rush. It used to be a five-day rush because a lot more people now can work from home or in some cases on the road. I wanted to tell you about the best and worst times to travel as well.
 
The best time according to AAA is to wait until after 7 p.m. tonight. The worst time tomorrow between 1 and 7 p.m. They say really the best time tomorrow maybe hit the road before 10 a.m. So you might want to get started a little bit early. The big thing that happens on days when it's an early rush like this is when that holiday traffic meets the normal congestion of commuting will be especially bad today and also especially bad on Monday, AAA says, when so many people are coming home all at once.
 
KEILAR: Yes, like when I went to Reagan to pick someone up at 4:30 on Friday. Bad news! It turned out to be a bad idea, Pete. 
 
MUNTEAN: Ouch.
 
KEILAR: It was bad. All right, Pete Muntean, thank you so much. Live for us from Reagan.
 
We'll have much more in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I spoke with the Prime Minister of Israel and Lebanon. I'm pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. I want to thank President Macron of France for his partnership in reaching this moment.
 
For nearly 14 months, a deadly conflict raged across the border that separates Israel and Lebanon. A conflict that began the day after the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. Hours later, at 2 a.m. in the morning, Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations backed by Iran attacked Israel in support of Hamas. Let's be clear. Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either. Nor did the United States. 
 
Over the past year, including the days immediately following October the 7th, I directed the U.S. military to flow assets and capabilities into the region, including aircraft carriers, fighter squadrons and sophisticated air defense battery to defend Israel and deter our common enemy at critical moments.
 
Since the war with Hezbollah began, over 70,000 Israelis have been forced to live in refugee -- live as refugees in their own country, helplessly watching their homes, their businesses, their communities as they are bombarded and destroyed.
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
And over 300,000 Lebanese people have also been forced to live as refugees in their own country in a war imposed on them by Hezbollah. All told, this has been the deadliest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in decades. How many of Hezbollah's senior leaders are dead, including its longtime leader, Nasrallah? And Israel has destroyed Hezbollah's terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon as well, including miles of sophisticated tunnels which were prepared for an October 7th-style terrorist attack in northern Israel. But lasting security for the people of Israel and Lebanon cannot be achieved only on the battlefield.
 
And that's why I directed my team to work with the governments of Israel and Lebanon to forge a ceasefire to bring the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to a close. Under the deal reached today, effective at 4 a.m. tomorrow local time, the fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border will end -- will end. This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.
 
What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed -- I emphasize -- will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again. Over the next 60 days, the Lebanese army and state security forces will deploy and take control of their own territory once again. Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon will not be allowed to be rebuilt.
 
And over the next 60 days, Israel will gradually withdraw its remaining forces. And civilians, civilians on both sides, will soon be able to safely return to their communities and begin to rebuild their homes, their schools, their farms, their businesses, and their very lives. We're determined this conflict will not be just another cycle of violence.
 
And so the United States, with the full support of France and our other allies, has pledged to work with Israel and Lebanon to ensure that this arrangement is fully implemented, the agreement totally implemented. You know, there will be no U.S. troops deployed in southern Lebanon. This is consistent with my commitment to the American people to not put U.S. troops in combat in this conflict. 
 
Instead, we, along with France and others, will provide the necessary assistance to make sure this deal is implemented fully and effectively. Let me be clear. If Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense, consistent with international law, just like any country when facing a terrorist group pledged to that country's destruction.
 
At the same time, this deal supports Lebanon's sovereignty. And so it heralds a new start for Lebanon, a country that I've seen most of over the years, a country with rich history and culture. If fully implemented, this deal could put Lebanon on a path toward a future that's worthy of a significant past.
 
Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza. They, too, deserve an end to the fighting and displacement. The people of Gaza have been through hell.
 
Their world is absolutely shattered. Far too many civilians in Gaza have suffered far too much. And Hamas has refused for months and months to negotiate a good-faith a ceasefire and a hostage deal.
 
And so now Hamas has a choice to make. Their only way out is to release the hostages, including American citizens, which they hold. In the process, bring an end to the fighting, which would make possible a surge of humanitarian relief.
 
Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. With the hostages released and the end of the war without Hamas in power, that becomes possible. As for the broader Middle East region, today's announcement brings us closer to realizing the affirmative agenda that I've been pushing forward during my entire presidency.
 
A vision for the future of the Middle East where it's at peace and prosperous and integrated across borders. A future where Palestinians have a state of their own. One that fulfills its people's legitimate aspirations.
 <br>[15:45:00]
 
One that cannot threaten Israel or harbor terrorist groups with backing from Iran. A future where Israelis and Palestinians enjoy equal measures of security, prosperity, and, yes, dignity. To that end, the United States remains prepared to conclude a set of historic deals with Saudi Arabia. To include a security pact and economic assurances.
 
Together with a credible pathway for establishing a Palestinian state. And the full normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It's a desire they both have.
 
I believe this agenda remains possible. And in my remaining time in office, I'll work tirelessly to advance this vision for an integrated, secure, and prosperous region. All of which, all of which strengthens America's natural security.
 
Getting all this done will require making some hard choices. Israel has been bold on the battlefield. Iran and its proxies have paid a very heavy price.
 
Now Israel must be bold in turning tactical gains against Iran and its proxies into a coherent strategy that secures Israel's long-term safety and advances a broader peace and prosperity in the region. Today's announcement is a critical step in advancing that vision. And so I applaud the crazy decision made by the leaders of Lebanon and Israel to end the violence.
 
It reminds us that peace is possible. I'll say that again, peace is possible. As long as that is the case, I will not, for a single moment, stop working to achieve it.
 
God bless you all. I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long. May God protect our troops.
 
Thank you. SANCHEZ: We have been listening to President Biden in the Rose Garden at the White House. Let's actually listen to him answering this question.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How is this push any different from the previous one?
 
BIDEN: (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, what have you told the new administration?
 
SANCHEZ: The president there being asked about comparing this current ceasefire deal between one that was brokered between Israel and Hezbollah back in 2006, which clearly fell apart. It was difficult to hear what the president said there, but I think he said that there were significant differences. The president there saying that this agreement between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon to enact this ceasefire deal along with France, another significant player, is a critical step in advancing a vision of peace for the region.
 
The president repeating multiple times that peace is possible. He talked about lasting security for Israel not being achieved solely on the battlefield. He talked about diplomacy being a significant factor here.
 
He said that this ceasefire would take effect at 4 a.m. and it is, in his mind, designed to be permanent. But he added that if Hezbollah or any other actor breaks the terms of this deal, that Israel has a right to self-defense. He also called it a new start for the people of Lebanon.
 
KEILAR: Yes, he said that Hezbollah won't be allowed essentially to reconstitute and that Lebanon can be on a path to a future worthy of its significant path. He also then pivoted to Gaza and he said that the people of Gaza deserve an end to hostilities, that they've been through hell and that Hamas has a choice to make. We're going to see, of course, what happens now that Israel is turning its attention away from Lebanon and back towards Gaza.
 
Let's go now to CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, who's live for us in Jerusalem. Nic, what stood out to you?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, I think this notion that Hezbollah won't be allowed to rebuild and there's an opportunity for Lebanon here to sort of have a different and better political future, this concept that Hezbollah has been so decimated on the battlefield, so many leaders killed and some of their ties with Iran fractured physically and broken, that this gives Lebanese society an opportunity to grow in a way that it couldn't where Hezbollah was so dominant.
 
Remembering that Hezbollah grew dominant out of the Lebanese civil war back in the sort of 70s and 80s. At the end of that, all sides were supposed to put down their weapons. Hezbollah didn't.
 
They got a political front. They had the military force. They dominated.
 
And the idea that President Biden is putting forward here is that that's over and this is a chance for Lebanon. The right to strike back for Israel, hugely important. Just over five hours till that ceasefire comes into effect.
 
I'm not sure all the people who will be able to go back in the north quite believe yet what President Biden is aspiring Lebanon could achieve, that Hezbollah is effectively sidelined militarily.
 <br>[15:50:03]
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, and Nick, as you were speaking, we got confirmation from the White House that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with President Biden, thanking him for the U.S.'s involvement in obtaining the ceasefire agreement, but also notably for understanding that Israel will maintain freedom of action in its enforcement. Notable words there coming from Netanyahu.
 
Nic Robertson, live for us in Jerusalem. Thank you so much, Nic.
 
Stay with CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back in a few minutes.
 
SANCHEZ: Black Friday, the official start of the holiday shopping season, is just three days away.
 
KEILAR: Get ready. This year, businesses are bracing though, for a potential slowdown. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is with us now. Tell us what you're hearing here.
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, : Yes, we're hearing this is going to be a record year, but a record because we're expecting 183 million shoppers this Thanksgiving weekend, spending about $989 billion on average. People are going to spend about $900 on holiday gifts this season. 
 
The but is that sales growth is expected to be moderate or normal, the lowest level that we've seen in five years. Sales growth this year, about 3.3 percent. Compare that to about the average we've seen over the past couple years, 4.3 percent. And that is because shoppers are being more discretionary with their spending. This year, Americans have 30 percent more debt than they did last Christmas. And so you have retailers fighting over every dollar that people are going to spend. 
 
Target, for example, had really slow sales in the third quarter. So they are ramping up sales and promotions in the fourth quarter around the holiday season to bring people in. 
 
Foot Locker, on the other hand, guys, they learned their lesson last year. They got stuck with too much inventory, so they are not offering as many sales and promotions.
 
The one thing that all retailers know this year, the holiday shopping season is a week shorter. So less time for people to do their shopping. But that could mean some good news if you're a last minute shopper. If stores have inventory, they're going to move that inventory really quick. You could see some good deals if you're a last minute shopper, guys. 
 
KEILAR: Maybe you could give New Year's presents.
 
SANCHEZ: Not a bad idea.
 
KEILAR: Vanessa Yurkevich, thank you so much for that report. And "THE LEAD" with Jake Tapper starts after a quick break.
