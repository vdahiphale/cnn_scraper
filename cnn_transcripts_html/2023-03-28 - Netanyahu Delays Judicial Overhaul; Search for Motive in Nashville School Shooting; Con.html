BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST (voice-over):  I'm Becky Anderson live from Abu Dhabi where the time is 6 o'clock in the evening. This is CONNECT THE 
 
 WORLD. 
 
Coming up this hour, relative calm in Israel after Benjamin Netanyahu pauses that controversial judicial reform bill. 
 
Authorities continue to investigate another horrific school shooting in the United States. 
 
Not a new round of major protests and strikes in France. 
 
Well the national football team scores an incredible goal against Ireland. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  "We're in the middle of an important debate. We will overcome it." 
 
That message from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a day after he hit the pause button on his controversial plan to overhaul Israel's 
 
 judiciary. 
 
Mr. Netanyahu apparently giving into growing unrest in his country and growing international pressure, announcing on Monday he was holding off on 
 
 the legislation until after the Knesset's Passover break in April. 
 
But he also made it clear the delay is only temporary, insisting reforms are needed. It didn't stop protesters on both sides from taking to the 
 
 streets. Once again, the country's largest labor union is threatening new action if the prime minister revives the plan. CNN's Hadas Gold takes a 
 
 look at how we got here. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A political crisis and now a potential security crisis on the streets of Israel as the 
 
 country was brought to a standstill by the largest general strike in Israeli history, sparked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to 
 
 weaken the Supreme Court and his firing of the country's defense minister for speaking out against the overhaul.
 
Fiery protests erupted Sunday and grew Monday, with demonstrators descending on Jerusalem from all over Israel, chanting for democracy as 
 
 they gathered en masse in front of the country's supreme court and outside Israel's parliament, the Knesset, nearby.
 
GOLD:  These changes to the judiciary in Israel would be the most significant since the country's founding in 1948 and at their core, they 
 
 would give the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, and therefore whatever parties and politicians are in power, more control over the judiciary, from 
 
 how and who the judges are going to be selected, to even the ability to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
 
Now critics of these reforms fear that would destroy the independence of the Israeli judiciary. They would heart -- hurt minority rights and it 
 
 would also hurt human rights in Israel, from everything from freedom of speech and expression to freedom of religion.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  On Monday, flights were halted and Israel ports stopped work alongside universities, embassies abroad, malls and even McDonald's.
 
The leader of Israel's largest union demanded the historic general strike to stop what he called "this judicial revolution, this craziness."
 
It seemed to have had the intended effect.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Out of the desire to prevent a rift in the nation. I decided to suspend the second 
 
 and third reading of the law in this session of the Knesset to give time to try and reach a broad agreement.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  For Netanyahu, this may be more than just a political setback. Critics say the overhaul will help Netanyahu in his ongoing 
 
 corruption trial, a charge he denies.
 
In a Saturday evening interview with British journalist Piers Morgan, Netanyahu denied he was pushing for autocratic rule.
 
NETANYAHU:  To try to paint me as some third-world autocrat is ridiculous. I believe in the balance. I'm a classic democrat with a small D. I don't 
 
 want to get into trouble with my American friends. 
 
But I must -- I'm a classic believer in the balance between the three branches of government. That's what ensures democracy and it's been thrown 
 
 off-balance in Israel. We have to bring it back.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  Before his speech to the nation on Monday, he acknowledged the precarious situation the country is in, as some right-wing 
 
 groups began calling for counter-protests, tweeting, "I call on all the demonstrators in Jerusalem, on the right and the left, to behave 
 
 responsibly and not to act violently. We are brotherly people."
 
With the country in chaos, there are fears now that this divisiveness could still lead to bloodshed.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  Let's bring in Hadas, who's joining me live from Jerusalem with the latest. 
 
Mr. Netanyahu there warning about a potential civil war between brothers. 
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
ANDERSON:  He says he's delaying this legislation to give more time for dialogue. So let's just be quite clear here, who wins at this point? 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
GOLD:  I mean, I don't think anybody is really declaring victory right now. If anything right now, the coalition -- and including the ministers like 
 
 Itamar Ben Gvir and national security minister -- are vowing that these reforms will happen whether or not the negotiations are successful. 
 
And that's something that Benjamin Netanyahu echoed, saying that these reforms will happen in some form or another in the next parliamentary 
 
 session. 
 
Ben-Gvir was clear that Netanyahu promised him that, if the negotiations don't work, that then they will push through the reforms as they are 
 
 currently planned, which is considered rather extreme for a wide swath of Israeli society, according to recent -- according to recent polling. 
 
But I mean, they're still going to open up negotiations right now. We are hearing from Israeli media reports that negotiating teams are being drafted 
 
 amongst the coalition government and the opposition leaders and that they should be meeting with the Israeli president, who is expected to act as 
 
 mediator. 
 
But keep in mind the time here; the next session starts in just about a month. It ends on the end of July. There's a lot of work to be done to try 
 
 and come to some sort of compromise. 
 
And of course, even being able to reach any sort of compromise reform, I think, will be a very difficult task for all parties involved. And I don't 
 
 think that even a compromise reform will help tamp down on these protesters, who say that they are going to continue taking to the streets 
 
 even during this pause. 
 
They essentially do not believe Benjamin Netanyahu when he says he will have negotiations. They want to continue their protests until they see 
 
 these -- this overhaul completely taken off the table. Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Is it clear whether Benjamin Netanyahu has redeemed himself in the eyes of, for example, Washington and capitals around the region where I 
 
 am here in the Gulf? 
 
GOLD:  Well, without question the U.S. and allies have been expressing a lot of concern over this judicial overhaul. They seem to continuously give 
 
 Benjamin Netanyahu some sort of civics lessons while they have calls with him about how important it is to have checks and balances in a vibrant 
 
 democracy. 
 
And it has been very, very notable that Benjamin Netanyahu has not been invited yet to the White House, has not been invited yet to the UAE, for an 
 
 official visit, things that I'm sure he is very much dying to do. 
 
Now. We did. Actually hear from the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, that they do expect that the prime minister will be invited to Washington at some point 
 
 for a visit after Passover. But no date has been set. 
 
And we haven't heard anything from Washington, saying that for sure the prime minister has been invited. But even just the fact that Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu talks about this long friendship with the U.S. President Joe Biden has not yet been invited yet goes to show you sort of the sensitivity 
 
 of the situation here, that he hasn't been invited to Washington, hasn't been invited to the UAE. 
 
There is a lot of concern amongst Israel's allies about what these reforms are doing to Israeli democracy and what it's doing to Israel's status, as 
 
 it continuously tries to boast that it is the only vibrant democracy in the Middle East. 
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, and what these reforms mean for an emboldened settler opportunity as it were. And certainly that is an issue. The Palestinian 
 
 issue is one which is keenly watched from here in the UAE and around this region. And we have seen the disquiet, the ratcheting up in violence and we 
 
 continue to watch that as a -- as a story as well. Thank you. 
 
Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says he okayed Mr. Netanyahu's pause on this judicial overhaul in exchange for a promise to 
 
 create a national guard under his control. 
 
The implications of that are important. We will dig a little deeper into that angle next hour. Chuck Freilich is former Israeli deputy national 
 
 security advisor. He's going to join me to discuss the potential implications of that deal. 
 
And legal advisor Dalla Bhutto (ph) will join me to discuss the Palestinian view. 
 
Police in Nashville, Tennessee, are putting together the pieces of what led up to a fatal shooting at an elementary school. Three adults and three 
 
 children were killed. Police shot and killed the shooter, who they say left behind detailed maps and plans for the attack. 
 
CNN's Amara Walker has the latest from Nashville. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AVERY MYRICK, DAUGHTER OF COVENANT SCHOOL TEACHER:  I don't know how somebody could go through with doing something like that and especially 
 
 children, like just -- it's disgusting. And I -- yes. I just -- I have no words. 
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This morning, another community is in mourning after what police are calling a targeted 
 
 attack by 28 year old Audrey Hale, a former student, who showed up on campus to execute a prewritten plan. 
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
CHIEF JOHN DRAKE, NASHVILLE POLICE:  It indicates that there was going to be shootings at multiple locations. And the school was one of them. There 
 
 was actually a map of the school, detail and surveillance entry points, and how this was going to be carried out on this day. 
 
WALKER (voice-over):  Metro Nashville police releasing more than two minutes of surveillance video, showing the moment Hale arrived on campus. 
 
 In the video, Hale is seen driving through the parking lot of the Covenant School in a silver Honda Fit. 
 
The security camera footage then cuts to video of Hale opening fire on glass double doors at an entrance of the school before climbing in. As the 
 
 video continues, you see Hale start roaming the hallways. Police say Hale had three weapons, an AR style rifle, an AR style pistol and a handgun 
 
 along with significant ammunition. 
 
Police say they believe two of those weapons may have been obtained legally. Officers say, when they arrived on scene, Hale fired on them from 
 
 a second story window. One patrol car taking a bullet to the windshield. 
 
Police say two officers confronted Hale on the second floor and Hale was killed. During the shooting, Avery Myrick was texting with her mother, a 
 
 teacher at the school. 
 
MYRICK:  I texted her and I said, just like what was going on. She said she was hiding in the closet and that there was shooting all over. 
 
WALKER (voice-over):  She later spoke to her mother by phone and learned she was safe. This morning we're learning more about the victims.
 
DON AARON, METRO NASHVILLE POLICE SPOKESPERSON:  The three 9 year olds who were killed:  Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kenney, Hallie Scruggs. 
 
WALKER (voice-over):  Also killed, 60 year old Katherine Koonce, who, according to the school's website, was the head of the school. Police also 
 
 identifying 61 year old Mike Hill, a custodian, and 61 year old Cynthia Peak, a substitute teacher. Police continue to investigate a motive but say 
 
 they have a theory. 
 
DRAKE:  There's some belief that there was some resentment to having to go to that school. I don't have all the details to that just yet. And that's 
 
 why this incident occurred. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  This is the 130th mass shooting in the United States this year. CNN's Carlos Suarez is live in Nashville right now, where the community, 
 
 frankly, is grieving and a former -- understandably, a former classmate of the shooter says she received a message ahead of the attack. 
 
What can you tell us about that?
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's exactly right. Becky, good morning. So Averianna Patton is a former basketball teammate of the 28 year 
 
 old attacker in this shooting. And according to her, she received a direct message on Instagram from the 28 year old in the minutes before the 
 
 shooting took place.
 
Patton told CNN that she receives this text message a little before 10 o'clock in the morning. She goes on to call authorities here in Nashville, 
 
 Tennessee around the time the shooting takes place. 
 
But according to her officers do not show up to her house until about 3:30 in the afternoon. That is several hours after the shooting left six people 
 
 dead. 
 
Now according to this Instagram message, the 28 year old attacker tells her former basketball teammate, quote, "One day this will make sense. I have 
 
 left behind more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen."
 
Patton was on ""CNN THIS MORNING"" and described her reaction to the shooting. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AVERIANNA PATTON, AUDREY HALE'S FORMER TEAMMATE:  I just -- I just -- I just couldn't believe it, like, and then the fact, you know, that I did -- 
 
 you know, I tried to reach out, you know, not even knowing that it was her. 
 
I didn't -- I just -- I don't know. I don't know. I don't know where she was, you know, what she was dealing with. I just -- I don't know like ...
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUAREZ:  All right, Becky, so we're expected at some point today to see some bodycam video from some of the officers that responded to the site of 
 
 this school shooting. 
 
According to authorities out here, in all, five officers responded to the scene here. Two of the officers were able to engage the 28 year old shooter 
 
 on the second floor of that school building. Those two officers were the ones that killed the 28 year old attacker, who has been identified as 
 
 Audrey Hale. 
 
We're also expected to learn a little bit more information on the investigation, as well as some additional information on some other sites 
 
 that the attacker had apparently planned to visit after this school shooting. 
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
SUAREZ:  However we were told that the decision to not go there apparently was made after the attacker deemed that there just was too much security at 
 
 these other locations -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Thank you, sir. 
 
As many as 900,000 people are staging massive protests today across France. They are blocking streets. They are disrupting train and air travel and 
 
 making their anger known over plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. 
 
French police out in force, hoping to guard against violence amid warnings that, quote, "radical" individuals might join the protests. Sam Kiley 
 
 tracking this story for us from Paris. 
 
And what are we seeing on the streets where you are, at least today, Sam? 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you can see, Becky, it is a pretty long and large demonstration. We don't have any 
 
 official figures for this one. 
 
The last one last Thursday had 120,000 people, according to the interior ministry. It may or may not be larger than that. We simply don't know yet. 
 
But the main concern from the government's perspective, Becky, is that they are worried there  could be an increase in violence and that is because 
 
 there was violence over the weekend in an unrelated environmental protest that ended up in pitched battles between demonstrators and the police. 
 
Now the interior ministry says there's about 1,000 hardcore troublemakers effectively that are scattered around the country. But there is a real 
 
 concern that they could focus on this demonstration later on today. 
 
The unions have called for dialogue with the government. The government has agreed to that dialogue but not agreed to even discuss making a U-turn on 
 
 what effectively is this movement from 62 to 64 in terms of the pensionable age, which is very shortly going to end up on the statute books once it 
 
 clears the constitutional council. 
 
That is the only roadblock politically in terms of the legislation that is faced. But of course, the political consequences for Emmanuel Macron and 
 
 his government in the National Assembly could be longer term. And that is really what the unions are now focusing on, is trying to get a dialogue 
 
 going on perhaps a wider range of issues to do with the economics reform that Macron is trying to bring to France, whilst the unions, of course, 
 
 trying to cling to more old-fashioned, in Macron's view, idea of how the economy here should be structured. 
 
But there is a great deal of anger on the streets that is carnival atmosphere as you can see, at the moment. But in the past -- and this is 
 
 the 10th day of these formal demonstrations, we've seen spontaneous demonstrations here, particularly since last Thursday week, Becky, when the 
 
 government rammed legislation through without a National Assembly vote. 
 
That sparked a lot of anger; there could be a lot more later on today -- Becky.
 
ANDERSON:  Sam Kiley's in Paris. Sam, thank you. 
 
Well, "SVB's failure is a textbook case of mismanagement." 
 
Those are the words of a top U.S. regulator. He and his colleagues are facing a grilling on Capitol Hill, which just got underway this hour. The 
 
 Senate Banking Committee asking the questions.
 
They want to know why Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in the U.K. A little earlier, the Bank of England chief told a parliamentary committee he was 
 
 surprised by the speed of SVB's failure. 
 
Here's how U.S. and European stocks are trading, not much movement, it has to be said with the Dow Jones up there about a third of 1 percent and the 
 
 S&amp;P -- well, as you can see, just flattened. The Nasdaq slightly lower. 
 
The European trading day drawing to a close, those markets slightly higher. Let's get you to CNN's Rahel Solomon, live from New York. 
 
I mean, this U.S. hearing into SVB and its collapse in the early stages, so just set a wider context for us if you will. 
 
Why didn't regulators see this collapse coming?
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is the trillion dollar question, Becky, and you're right, that we are in the early moments of this 
 
 hearing. It started just about 18 minutes ago. 
 
And as you pointed out, lawmakers are still addressing the hearing. But what we expect to hear from the regulators from three different agencies -- 
 
 and we can point out exactly who we expect to hear from, from the Treasury Department, from the FBI through to the Federal Reserve. 
 
And the question, of course, is what happened but also why didn't regulators catch this?
 
I should say that, you know, just based on early comments from the chairman of the banking committee, you know, clearly trying to make it a point that 
 
 there's a lot of financial jargon here, in his words. 
 
Senator Brown of Ohio but saying that this really comes down to -- this really is coming down to hubris, entitlement and greed. So also trying to 
 
 make this plain that it doesn't exactly have a lot of sympathy for some of these banking executives and the banks that are at the center of this. 
 
But the question in terms of why regulators didn't catch this, I should say, just based on prepared remarks, which we expect the bulk to come from 
 
 FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg.
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
SOLOMON:  But based on prepared remarks, Becky, we expect most of the regulators to say that investigations are ongoing so not really pointing to 
 
 a definitive cause just yet. But I should say that in Michael Barr's comments from the Federal Reserve, he actually points to on page 5 and 6 -- 
 
 these are the prepared remarks, Becky. 
 
On page 5 and 6, he points to about five or six different events, where he suggests that banking regulators actually did sound the alarm, saying that 
 
 began and as early as the end of 2021, saying that, and mid February 2023, that supervisors did actually present to the Federal Reserve board of 
 
 governors that they have real concerns about these banks who were sitting on this interest rate -- interest risk liability, these liability concerns 
 
 but also specifically had concerns about SVB. 
 
The question is, however, that if these supervisory staff relayed that they were actively engaged with SVB, which he says they were, what happened?
 
Was it too late by that point?
 
I mean, that is mid February of 2023. We know the bank fell on March 9th, March 10th. 
 
So the question is, if they were aware of these concerns, did they act soon enough?
 
ANDERSON:  Hmm. Fascinating. Keep an eye on it for us, please. That hearing just getting going. Thank you. 
 
Crypto's biggest player, Binance, is being sued in the United States for allegedly circumventing regulations around crypto derivatives. In a 
 
 nutshell, these are bets on the prices of cryptocurrency without ownership of the actual coin, which is illegal in the U.S.  
 
Now this lawsuit was brought forward by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It can't bring any criminal charges to Binance but it can seek 
 
 financial penalties or a registration ban for the future. 
 
Ukrainian officials in Kyiv say air defenses destroyed 14 of 15 Russian drones fired over the region overnight. Intercepted, that is just a portion 
 
 of what Russia launched across Ukraine overnight to a hospital in the city of Kherson was hit by Russian shelling, causing extensive damage. There 
 
 are, thankfully, no reported civilian injuries. 
 
Meanwhile a rocket attack in Kramatorsk Monday night damaged a kindergarten and a school. 
 
And in nearby Slovyansk, officials say two people were killed in a missile strike on Monday and dozens were injured. 
 
Everyday life is a hardship for so many people in Ukraine, especially for those with physical and mental disabilities. One man says he's been told 
 
 care and support for people with intellectual disabilities and their families is a luxury during wartime.

Coming up, a deadly blaze ripped through a migrant detention center on Mexico's border with the United States. What investigators are saying about 
 
 that is after this. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
ANDERSON:  In Mexico, a fire has killed at least 39 people at a migration center just near the border with the United States. Authorities say that 
 
 the fire broke out after 17 migrants were picked up off the streets of Trinidad to Juarez and brought to the National Migration Institute in that 
 
 city. 
 
Mexico's president says the migrants started the fire during a protest. Let's bring in Ed Lavandera, who is live from Dallas in Texas. 
 
What more do we know at this point, Ed?
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we've just learned that, according to the president of Mexico, he says that, as you mentioned, 
 
 this fire started during a protest between the migrants being held at this detention center in Juarez, Mexico, which is just across the border from El 
 
 Paso, Texas, after several migrants had learned that they would be deported from Mexico, then set mattresses on fire. 
 
And from there, the fire raged out of control, killing at least 39 people, injuring dozens of others, other migrants there at the National Migration 
 
 Institute. 
 
And this comes after months and months of frustration for many migrants, especially Venezuelan and South American migrants, who have really 
 
 struggled to be able to get to the United States, can cross the border at the end there, to request asylum here in the United States. 
 
There have been -- we have spoken over the over the last few months with hundreds of migrants, who have essentially been camped out in this Mexican 
 
 border town, waiting for the opportunity to cross into the United States to request asylum. 
 
So the news that they would be deported and sent back elsewhere is the kind of news that has caused a great deal of frustration for many of those 
 
 migrants. 
 
But this is a tragic case here, where at least 39 people killed in this fire, dozens more injured. The Mexican government says that the cause of 
 
 the fire is still under investigation. And obviously that would include the events leading up to what caused  these migrants, if what the president of 
 
 Mexico is saying is correct, saying that these mattresses were set on fire, which caused this fire to spread out of control at that detention center. 
 
ANDERSON:  Ed, thank you. 
 
Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now.

ANDERSON (voice-over):  Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson and the time is half past 6 here, you are watching CONNECT THE WORLD. And wherever you are 
 
 watching from, you are more than welcome. 
 
Your headlines this hour:  embattled Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying, quote, "We are in the middle of an important debate. We 
 
 will overcome it." 
 
This comes after he paused controversial plans to overhaul the country's judiciary amid widespread strikes and protests. A vote on the legislation 
 
 is now delayed until after the Passover recess in April. 
 
Police in Nashville in Tennessee are trying to understand the motive of a school shooter who killed six people on Monday, three adults and three 
 
 children. Police shot and killed the shooter. Investigators say she drew maps ahead of time, laying out the attack. 
 
All across France, protesters are taking to the streets to show their anger over president Emmanuel Macron's pension reforms. Trade unions say they 
 
 expect some 900,000 people to join in the ongoing protests, many of which have targeted airports and train stations. 
 
Britain's MI-5 security services raised the terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland to severe, meaning they believe an attack there is highly 
 
 likely and they cite recent attacks on police. 
 
This comes just weeks before political leaders will gather there to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the peace deal that largely ended decades 
 
 of sectarian violence known as The Troubles. U.S. President Joe Biden is planning to attend, along with former president Bill Clinton, whose 
 
 administration helped broker the Good Friday agreement. 
 
Britain's Prince Harry back in London and back at London's high court today for what is a second day of hearings regarding a privacy lawsuit against 
 
 the publisher of the "Daily Mail." 
 
The Duke of Sussex, along with Elton John and several other high profile figures, accused Associated Newspapers of using illegal means to obtain 
 
 personal information. Joining us now from London is our royal correspondent, Max Foster. 
 
And this has been a long case in the offing, as it were. We've had day one. 
 
What can we expect from day two? 
 
And provide if you will just a little bit of context for those viewers who may be playing catch-up on this, Max. 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT:  There's several cases involving Prince Harry and the British tabloids and the Associated Newspapers, which 
 
 owns the "Daily Mail." 
 
This one looks at a range of different privacy issues effectively. And he's joined forces with six other high-profile people, including Elton John and 
 
 Liz Hurley, the actress. There are others as well; Stephen Lawrence's mother, Baroness Lawrence, as well is also involved in all of this. 
 
And what they accused Associated Newspapers of doing is things like paying off policemen for information, for private information illegally; for 
 
 obtaining medical information; for planting bugs with people to get information and also phone hacking, which, of course, Harry's accused other 
 
 newspapers of as well, all as a way to get stories, specifically with Prince Harry in relation to his girlfriends, he says. 
 
And he actually says that this affected his childhood years or his younger years because these stories were ending up in newspapers. He assumed those 
 
 stories could only come from friends. And he cut off those friends as a result. 
 
He's trying to describe what it meant for him and the other six. But also he's suggesting that this might be the tip of an iceberg, that lots of 
 
 people have suffered in similar ways. 
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
FOSTER:  He wants to expose the practices if you like, all of which Associated Newspapers denied. Of course, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  So that's why he's in London. This is day two of this high court case. And as you say, this is not just Prince Harry but a number of very 
 
 high profile characters, including Elton John, that you saw in the images there. 
 
Meantime, Prince Harry being back, of course, in London, has raised questions about whether he will be hooking up with his brother, Prince 
 
 William, during his stay. 
 
What are your sources telling you?
 
FOSTER:  What I'm being told, that the Cambridges, as they were, Prince William's family, are not in Windsor because it's the school holidays, a 
 
 suggestion there that they're not going to meet. 
 
A similar sort of story coming from Buckingham Palace. King Charles is not in London or in Windsor, so it's not effectively an opportunity for them to 
 
 meet. I don't think they are going to meet. 
 
It's been suggested to me that Harry might be in every day for this four day hearing as it were, so I think he's around all week, so there would be 
 
 opportunity, I'm sure if they wanted to meet but they're not going ahead with that. 
 
The looming question as well, will Harry and Meghan be coming over to the coronation in May? 
 
They're both invited; no indication yet about whether or not they've decided on whether to do that. But it's interesting, Becky, to see Harry 
 
 here because he did have an issue didn't he about security. He was concerned that he didn't get police security. He wouldn't be safe here. 
 
But he's not getting police security whilst he is over. He's got his own security. So perhaps he does feel confident enough to come over himself, at 
 
 least, for the coronation without that police security issue resolved. 
 
ANDERSON:  Thank you, Max. 
 
Max Foster is in London for you. 
 
Good to have you on. 
 
FOSTER:  Thanks.
 
ANDERSON:  Still to come on, CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson, a checkin with our colleagues at "WORLD SPORT," including the latest stunning 
 
 goal from a Euro 2024 qualifying match. You'll want to stick around for this, stay with us.

A New York grand jury wrapped up another meeting Monday without an indictment of former U.S. president Donald Trump. Prosecutors brought in a 
 
 surprise witness to testify, who was the former publisher of the "National Inquirer." CNN's Paula Reid with the details for you.

PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  David Pecker's appearance at court Monday, shrouded in secrecy. He arrived here and 
 
 departed in a car with tinted windows, holding his head down, clearly trying not to be spotted by the world's media that had been assembled at 
 
 court.
 
But Pecker could potentially be a very valuable witness for prosecutors. Exactly one week ago, attorneys for the former president had requested that 
 
 Robert Costello --
 
REID (voice-over):  -- appear before the grand jury and Costello's role was to attack the credibility of Michael Cohen and his version of how these 
 
 hush money payments were arranged.
 
Now over the past week or so prosecutors have been contemplating whether they needed to call another witness to rebut Costello's testimony and 
 
 button up their case before moving on to vote on a possible indictment.
 
Pecker would be able to rebut that testimony because he was involved in putting together these hush money schemes for Stormy Daniels and at least 
 
 one other woman to get them to keep quiet about their alleged affairs with the former president.
 
Now at this point, the next time we know the grand jury will meet will be on Wednesday. We'll see what happens then. It's unclear if they will move 
 
 to vote on a possible indictment of the former president, something that would be the first in U.S. history -- Paula Reid, CNN, New York.
