BRUNHUBER: Another deadly mass shooting rampage in America, this tragedy unfolding near Dallas, Texas. Witnesses tell us what they saw as a gunman opened fire at an outlet mall. 
 
Plus, in Kentucky Derby overshadowed by the death of two more horses. CNN Sports Coy Wire joins me to look at the latest controversy surrounding Derby week. And this weekend's coronation festivities pulling out all the bells and whistles including a "Big Lunch," live at Buckingham Palace to see what's on tap for today.
 
ANNOUNCER:  Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Kim Brunhuber.
 
BRUNHUBER: Residents of Allen, Texas are in shock and mourning this hour after their city became the latest in the U.S. to suffer mass shooting. The deadly rampage happened at a crowded mall on Saturday and some of the scenes were captured in a video which we have to warn you, may be hard to watch.
 
BRUNHUBER: You see there, people running for safety as the gunman opens fire. Authorities say at least eight people were killed and seven were wounded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEN FULK, ALLEN, TEXAS MAYOR: Today is a tragic day for the city of Allen, our citizens, our friends and visitors who are at the Allen Premium Outlets today. We are a strong and caring community and we all want the victims and their families impacted by this tragedy to know that we will wrap our arms around you and we are here for you. The city of Allen pledges to offer our complete support. We know you are grieving. We are grieving. Rest assured the nation and the world are also grieving.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Police say the gunman was killed by an officer who happened to be at the scene when it was finally safe. Hundreds of people exited the area many holding their hands up. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Texas with more on how the shooting unfolded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is the scene of the deadly shooting that took place at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas, a suburb north of Dallas. The area that you see behind the lights pointing at us there is where we believe at least six of the victims were killed here in this shooting attack. From what we've been able to piece together from speaking with witnesses. That was the area where the shooting attack happened. 
 
We're also told that -- and we spoke with a witness who watched the very end of all of the shooting attack when an officer took out the suspected gunman. We saw a woman who shared a picture of that final scene with us showed the gunman laying on the ground wearing a tactical vest with ammunition on his body and assault style rifle laying on the ground next to him. 
 
We are trying to figure out exactly who that gunman is. Investigators at a press conference Saturday night would not take questions as to what has happened. They only confirm that this -- they believe the suspect acted alone and that there were eight victims in all, three of those in critical condition fighting for their lives tonight. Ed Lavandera, CNN, Allen Texas.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: We're also hearing details of the harrowing events from witnesses who survived the attack. Listen as they describe the chaos that ensued after hearing the initial gunfire.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We heard like a bunch of shots but we thought it was firecrackers at first. And then a lot of people just started running like straight to our door, trying to come in and everything but our manager he went out and like I guess when he was opening the door like people just kept running in, trying to run in. But he saw -- I guess he saw the person he was like, what the best and everything he had a gun. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My mom and I were in Johnston &amp; Murphy shopping and out of nowhere heard about like 10 pops go off. And I looked at the customer next to me as I was like, was that gunshots and he was like no it's probably just construction or something and then like heard 10, 15 more shots go off. And so I ran at the front of store and we're like no that's shooting. And we see the guy. There's this guy dressed in all black wearing a vest, has an assault rifle and he's just shooting at people 
 <br>[05:05:11]
 
Right across, he was at like Francesca's area, shooting at people. So we got everyone in the store, at the back of the store and just camped out there. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I saw two ladies rushing towards me. And then one was like someone is shooting, someone is shooting and then right behind her on the other side, right in front of the kid is another guy it's just had, he held his neck like this. And it was like blood just dripping down, you know. And then we went inside. And then I was -- I had like to be in front of me. When I go down, go down, so we all went down. And then I had like three shots, boom, boom, boom.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: President Biden was briefed on the shooting after he returned from church on Saturday. The White House says it's in touch with the local and state officials to offer support. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden has been briefed on the shooting in Allen, Texas. And additionally that the White House is closely monitoring the situation. White House officials have been in touch with local law enforcement and local officials to offer any potential support as well as federal officials as well. We look back at the previous statements that President Biden has issued in the wake of these mass shootings. He is very quick to call for action. 
 
He -- we are no longer in a phase where a President of the United States would see a report like this and talk about thoughts and prayers, and not immediately pivot to what he sees as the legislative solution. That is exactly what we have seen from President Biden. In the wake of recent shootings, he has said how many more Americans must die before Republicans in Congress take action. That was the statement that President Biden released after that shooting in Louisville, Kentucky last month. 
 
And we have seen President Biden in the wake of these shootings quickly talk about the need for a ban on assault weapons, a ban on high-capacity magazines, safe, safe storage laws. And what we've also heard from President Biden more recently is that he believes he has done all that he can from an executive action standpoint, and that ultimately now, the burden rests on Congress. We know, of course, that the dynamic in Congress, though, remains
 
 unchanged, Republicans control the House of Representatives, and even in the Senate, Democrats does have a slim majority, certainly not a filibuster proof majority to be able to move the kinds of legislative solutions that they would like to see.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: Earlier, our Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey, spoke about the shooting and explained what police are likely doing now in their investigation. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Unfortunately, we have eight dead not counting the shooter himself. We don't know a whole lot more than that, because there wasn't a lot of information given at the press conference. You know, the type of weapon, we believe it was an assault weapon, but until that's really verified, as well as the history of that weapon, now that's individual got their hands on that particular type of weapon is still something that we really have not yet been told. The identity of the shooter is still unknown. And so there's a lot of information that is yet to be given out. 
 
The police are going to be doing a lot of things right now. One, you're processing the crime scene, a pretty extensive crime scene there at the mall, both inside and outside of the mall. As far as the shooter goes, by now, they should have positively identified that individual. So now they're executing search warrants. You have a car, apartment, a home, interviewing family, friends, trying to mirror the computer, get on their social media, see if there are any clues there. So there's a lot of work that's being done right now and it'll continue throughout the night.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: And in Columbus, Ohio, the police chief there is condemning the availability of guns after a series of shootings in the city. At least two people are dead and several more injured after three separate incidents Saturday. Chief says guns are ending up in the hands of too many people. She says part of the problem is a new Ohio law that allows eligible adults to carry a concealed handgun without a license or training. 
 
And an off-duty police officer was shot and killed in Chicago early Saturday. The 24-year-old officer had just finished her shift. It happened in the city South Side Avalon Park neighborhood. The responding officer found the female officer with multiple gunshot wounds and immediately took her to hospital where she died. 
 
A confirmed tornado touchdown in northern Missouri Saturday night. The storm system brought high winds that damaged roofs and buildings and also had baseball sized hail. Fortunately, there are no reports of any injuries or death. Still to come, Democrats and Republicans spar over veterans benefits
 
 and then the debt ceiling showdown. We'll hear what both sides have to say. 
 
Plus, a Russian mercenary leader reportedly moves forward with his plan to pull out Bakhmut. We'll get a live report from Kyiv. 
 <br>[05:10:07]
 
And not everyone was rejoicing in the U.K. during Saturday's historic coronation. We have complete coverage ahead. Please stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER: Festivities are continuing across the U.K. day after the historic coronation of King Charles III.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God saves the king.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: The coronation big lunch is expected to start in the coming hours. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will also be hosting a big lunch later in the day which will be attended by U.S. first lady Jill Biden. 
 
Street parties are expected to go across the country in a coronation concert will be held on the grounds of Windsor Castle. And our own Royal Correspondent Max Foster covered the historic coronation Saturday and joins us now to preview the events in the coming hours. Max, you've been extremely busy, so what more can we expect?
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, today is the community day, I guess, the party day. So the street parties up and down the United Kingdom. Lots of people have applied to hold them. You have to get permission to close down the street. So it looks like it will be a busy day. And more junior members of the royal family will be dropping in on random ones around England, at least. So some of those street parties will have an extra sort of touch to them. 
 
But this is something that's traditionally done on big royal events and it's a community city day, really. And then tonight we have this big concert at Windsor Castle, which features Katy Perry, take that, a lot of British artists and a lot of British orchestras. And then we're expecting a big speech as well from the Prince of Wales at the end of it, which I'm sure will be quite memorable as well. 
 
And actually, they're using a side of the castle, which is the private side of the castle, we don't normally get to see. So that's a big moment tonight and everyone in the U.K., I'm sure, will want to tune in at some point and see that. This is being broadcast across the U.K. So that's really what we're expecting tonight. A lot less formal than yesterday. BRUNHUBER: And then, Max, you know, in the longer term for King
 
 Charles, he and the royal family have to contend with a host of issues, you know, in Britain, questions of relevance in the Commonwealth, some countries looking to potentially ditch the monarchy, not to mention, you know, all the discord within the royal family. It promises to be an interesting, it potentially rocky reign, is that fair? 
 
FOSTER: I think that's true. I mean, there are certain countries like Jamaica, Belize has certainly got very strong Republican movements and a lot of support in government as well, to remove King Charles as head of state and go for an elected head of state president instead. We saw that happening last year in Barbados, didn't we? They're probably more of that. And King Charles says that's absolutely the choice of local people and what they want to do.
 
He did -- you would have seen in the service, try as hard as he could to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, that ultimately it was a Christian event, you know, a white hereditary monarch taking his position in an ancient ceremony, which fundamentally hasn't changed at all. But he certainly has talked about how he wants to represent all of the U.K. 
 
And he sees protecting Britain's diversity as one of his key roles as monarch is quite an abstract thought and it's quite an emotion thought in many ways for him, whether or not he can bring those diverse communities into the idea of monarchy. So that's a long-term project, and I think that'll take time to see whether or not that's successful. 
 
And then there's just his personality and whether or not he can break through and appeal to all Brits in the same way as his mother did.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, we will see. All right. Max Foster at Buckingham Palace, thanks so much. 
 
For decades as a monarch in waiting, King Charles has been a vocal advocate for climate change issues and protecting the environment. One of his private residences, Highgrove House, is a prime example of his commitment to sustainability. The estate's gardens have environmentally friendly features like solar panels and natural sewage system. 
 
In 2021, he attended the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow as then Prince of Wales, when he called on world leaders to take more meaningful action on climate change. Here he is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KING CHARLES III: You do not need me to tell you that the eyes and hopes of the world are upon you to act with all dispatch and decisively, because time has quite literally run out. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Earlier, I spoke with Craig Bennett, the CEO of Wildlife Trusts, a group of 46 independent wild life conservation charities in the U.K., and I asked him, what are the King's Bona Fide's on the environment. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CRAIG BENNETT, WILDLIFE TRUSTS CEO: He's been patron of the Wildlife Trusts since 1977, and the first speech he made on the environment was back in the very early 1970s, when he highlighted the link between air pollution and the impact on people's health.
 
So he's been a real leader on this issue and he's often led the way well before many other people to highlight just how important the climate nature crises are and how we've really got to move much faster to address these interlinked crises.
 
BRUNHUBER: So, I mean, the sovereign meant to stay out of politics. So looking ahead to what this actually means, what can he really do? Can he make a real material difference? And if so, how? 
 
BENNETT: Well, I mean, the first thing to say is, you know, this is an issue in the U.K., at least, where there's cross party-political support, in theory at least, for action on the climate and nature crisis. But sadly, often governments struggle to make the progress that is needed in the context of short-term electoral cycles. So you can have a big discussion whether we should or shouldn't have a monarchy, but, I mean, if you're going to have a monarchy, arguably one of the things it absolutely should do is be thinking about the long-term.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[05:20:04]
 
BRUNHUBER: Of course, not everyone supports the British monarchy. London Metropolitan Police say 52 people were arrested during protests against the coronation. Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PROTESTERS: Not my king. Not my king. Not my king.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: You can hear the protesters they are shouting not my king. The anti-monarchy group Republic tells CNN that police arrested organizers without providing any reason. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has the story from London.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This protest was called for by the group Republic that for long has opposed the British monarchy. They say they don't want to see the coronation of another British monarchy. Say they want a real democracy and an elected head of state.
 
They called on protesters to gather on Saturday morning in Trafalgar Square. But authorities had blocked off the area, making it very hard for many to reach the square. But they have gathered close by. Now, what we've seen happen is a number of protest organizers have been arrested. They say that authorities didn't give them a reason for those arrests, that hundreds of their, not my king placards had also been confiscated by authorities.
 
But what the police are saying is they arrested seven people. They say four were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance and three others were arrested, they say, for possessing articles that could cause criminal damage.
 
This coming just days after a new hardline legislation was passed really putting restrictions on the freedom of protesters in the country. And what we had heard also from authorities earlier saying that they had very low tolerance for any disruption today. 
 
But despite that, you can still see that hundreds of protesters are still gathered. They're wearing yellow, as was called for by the group Republic. They pay for maximum visibility. Take a listen to what some of these demonstrators told us earlier.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a huge amount of money that the taxpayer is paying when everyone else is struggling throughout the country.
 
KARADSHEH: Certainly for these protesters, they say they have managed to come out and make their opposing views heard. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, still ahead, much more on the mass shooting that devastated a Texas community. We'll hear from more witnesses about what they experienced and how they survived. 
 
Plus, a roadside bomb hits the car of a Russian military blogger, leaving him wounded. Now, the Kremlin's pointing a finger, but not only at Ukraine. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:26:23]
 
BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
At least eight people have been killed in the latest U.S. mass shooting. Police say it happened Saturday in Allen, Texas, north of Dallas, when a gunman opened fire in an outlet mall filled with hundreds of people.
 
The shooter was killed by an officer who happened to be at the scene. Seven victims were taken to hospital. Some are in critical condition. Those who survived are speaking out about the trauma they experienced.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Loud banging like, a couple of them and we thought something fell down outside of the store. So I went to go check it out and it just kept happening. Saw him bouncing off the bricks outside. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And what store was this?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Escros Sneakers. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Then what did you do after that? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got behind him and we ran to the back of the store. And at that point we opened the door to the back and there was people back there and everyone started freaking out. It sounded like he had went into the store next door to ours. But we didn't -- it was just confusion. 
 
I saw him on the camera. It was a skinny, masked up. It looked like he was pretending to be a police officer, which we -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Moscow is blaming Ukraine and several Western nations for an apparent attack on a pro-Kremlin military blogger about 240 miles east of Moscow. Russian state news agency says Zakhar Prilepin was wounded after his car was hit by a roadside bomb on Saturday. Investigators say they later arrested a suspect who reportedly confessed. He received his orders from Ukraine. The Ukrainian Security Service is neither confirming nor denying its involvement in the blast east of Moscow.
 
Prilepin has a telegram channel with some 300,000 followers. Another pro-Kremlin blogger was killed in an explosion in St. Petersburg last month, but Ukraine has denied any role in that attack. 
 
Meanwhile, a Russian mercenary leader is laying the ground for his possible pullout from Bakhmut. Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops would withdraw by Wednesday because of a lack of ammunition. The move could potentially leave an opening for Ukrainian forces. But now, Prigozhin says Wagner will hand over their positions to the forces of this men, Notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. He's an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his own army fighting in Ukraine. Kadyrov says he is ready. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAMZAN KADYROV, PRO-RUSSIAN CHECHEN LEADER (through translator): Yes, I have also written a letter to the supreme commander-in-chief that we are ready to take over Bakhmut. We'll be very pleased to take over the territory remaining there. 
 
But Ukrainian military officials apparently say they're calling Prigozhin's bluff. They've released this video saying it shows incendiary weapons raining down on Bakhmut Friday. The footage could contradict the claim that Wagner is running low on ammunition. 
 
We're also getting word of a deadly Russian strike in the Kherson region. For more, Sam Kiley joins us from Kyiv. So, Sam, let's start there. What more can you tell us about that strike? 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kim, there are two rescue workers. Both women are in hospital following this strike that killed six emergency service employees in the Kherson region, which is very heavily mined indeed. 
 
Now, these six were involved in demining operations, which is something that goes on throughout the areas, particularly that have been liberated by Ukraine's last counter offensive in the fall and summer of last year. They came -- the Ukrainians say, under very heavy Russian bombardment from the other side of the Dnipro River, just a few days after 24 people were killed in a very deliberate series of attacks in and around the railway station in Kherson city itself.
 <br>[05:30:16]
 
This is an area where the Russians fear there could be a summer offensive being launched by, at some stage, the Ukrainians, and clearly there, making life impossible for civilians and those who are trying to protect the area for civilians like these emergency workers. Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: And then, Sam, another incident of note, Ukraine claiming it shot down, a hypersonic missile. A surprise, if true. 
 
KILEY: Yeah, a real surprise here, Kim, because the Kinzhal missile is developed by Russia. They claim can fly at 10 times the speed of sound. It's a technological breakthrough in terms of military technology that the Russians claim they have the edge over the rest of the world on. And that includes the people, the American scientists and weapons experts that design the Patriot missile, which was designed before such missiles were ever dreamed of, or rather only dreamed of. They're not designed to be able to hit a hypersonic missile. 
 
But according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, that is exactly what this Patriot battery has done. Now, if that is true, then it does give a kind of moral boost, a morale boost rather, to the Ukrainian forces. But at the same time, they are really, really desperately demanding and screaming for effectively more aerial defenses, because the Russians are absorbing a huge amount of the surface to air missiles that they make themselves or have themselves here in Ukraine and those that have been supplied in a deliberate campaign by Russia to absorb the capacity of Ukraine to defend its skies possibly ahead of what they anticipate to be this summer offensive being planned by the Ukrainians. Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, appreciate the updates. Sam Kiley, thanks so much. 
 
Pro-Russian officials are also stepping up evacuations of civilians in southern Ukraine ahead of that expected offense counter offensive. They say about a thousand people have already been moved away from the front lines in the Zaporizhzhia region, with more to follow. The evacuations include the city of Enerhodar, the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to the head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. He's describing the situation there as increasingly unstable and dangerous, but local leaders say the plant's operating staff aren't leaving. 
 
Funerals have begun in Serbia after two mass shootings in as many days. Services were held Saturday for a security guard killed along with eight children when a gunman went on a rampage in a school in the capital, Belgrade. Police say a 13-year-old is in custody and undergoing psychiatric assessment.
 
A day later, eight more people were killed in separate shootings in villages south of the capital. The country is holding three days of mourning for the victims of flags flying at half-mast.
 
A glimmer of hope in Sudan at this hour as representatives of the two warring factions have gone to Saudi Arabia, reportedly for face-to- face talks. A prominent Saudi diplomats tweet Saturday morning suggested that representatives of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces had arrived in Jeddah, but so far there's no confirmation a meeting has actually taken place. A supposed ceasefire is underway in the country, but people on the ground told CNN that earlier RSF forces were trying to take control of strategically located hospitals to use as bases.
 
And meanwhile, Turkey says it's moving its embassy in Sudan because of security concerns. The Turkish foreign minister says the move from Khartoum to Port Sudan is temporary but necessary after the car of Turkey's ambassador was fired on in the Sudanese capital. 
 
Iran has executed a dual Swedish-Iranian citizen, and Sweden is furious about it. A media outlet affiliated with Iran's government says Iran on Saturday put to death Habib Chaab, accused him of being the leader of a separatist group responsible for the shooting attack on a military parade in 2018 that killed 29 people. Sweden staunchly opposes the death penalty and summoned Iran's ambassador to complain. 
 
Atlanta police have released excerpts of a 911 call during the shooting in midtown Atlanta this week as the 24-year-old suspect remains in jail. We'll bring you the latest on that.
 
And a look at this year's Run for the Roses, a legendary race overshadowed by the deaths of seven horses since the start of Kentucky Derby week. We'll have all the details on that coming up. Please stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:37:51]
 
BRUNHUBER: Atlanta police have released one of the 911 calls from Wednesday's mass shooting at a medical facility that killed one woman and injured four others. The suspect, a 24-year-old military vet, is in jail and his mother has apologized to the victim's families. CNN's Isabel Rosales has details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Police are still combing through these 911 calls and plan to release more of them once they're done with that process. But listen, this one 911 call from it, we get a real sense of this scary and very serious situation unfolding within the hospital. A place that anyone would have an expectation that they are safe within. Instead, what we saw was an eruption of chaos and violence. Listen what appears to be a worker talking to a 911 operator, describing what they are seeing and hearing.
 
CALLER: We hear gun shots in the hall. One of the doctors says he sees -- he thinks he sees someone on the floor by the elevators on the 11th floor, but it's definitely loud. 
 
911 DISPATCHER: Are they still shooting? 
 
CALLER: We don't -- they're not shooting at this moment, but there were several shots that we heard. 
 
ROSALES: And the suspect is named Deion Patterson. His mother, according to a high-level source within the Atlanta Police Department, told investigators that her son was seeking treatment there at the hospital because he was dissatisfied with the service that he was getting from the V.A.
 
But then, according to a CNN affiliate WSB, that mother told them that at some point her son got angry after doctors refused to give him antianxiety medication, and that is when he pulled out a gun and started shooting.
 
What ensued was an eight-hour manhunt. Technology played a critical role here, with cameras capturing -- a system of cameras, capturing footage of the truck that the suspect had stolen, and then tracking it over into Cobb County, about 15 miles away. Officers then rushed to the scene over there. 
 
Then came barking dogs. A resident within a condo complex there heard those dogs and was worried that perhaps the suspect was hiding in the pool area. That is when she alerted officers. And eventually he was confronted and captured.
 <br>[05:40:00]
 
Listen now to Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. He is calling for change, gun reform change in response to this shooting. 
 
ANDRE DICKENS, ATLANTA, GEORGIA MAYOR: This cannot be the new normal. We know the common-sense gun laws that we should have, universal background checks should be just adopted and established as a norm.
 
We should not allow convicted felons to have the ability to buy guns and violent misdemeanors. Anyone that's mentally unstable, we should disallow them to have access to guns as well. 
 
ROSALES: Altogether, four women were injured in this shooting. One was killed, her name was Amy St. Pierre, 38 years old. She worked for the CDC. Family called her a loving wife and a mother, a devoted mother of two. What we have heard at last check from Grady Health System is that two of the injured are in critical condition. Isabel Rosales, CNN, Atlanta. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: And that shooting in Atlanta put a spotlight on veterans mental health care, with the suspect being a former member of the U.S. coast Guard. Late last month, House Republicans narrowly passed a bill that would temporarily suspend or raise the federal debt limit and also cut spending by more than $4 trillion. 
 
Legislation doesn't identify which discretionary programs would see future spending cuts, but some Democrats have claimed that the bill would lead to deep cuts in several areas, including health benefits for military veterans. The White House says this week that the Department of Veterans Affairs would be, "gutted." Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It makes a series of deeply devastating and unpopular cuts to things like veteran's health benefits. There is no constituency in this nation that supporting -- that supports threatening to kill millions of jobs unless the VA is gutted. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy pushed back on these claims by Democrats and said the bill doesn't cut Veterans Affairs Department. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: Can you tell me where in the bill it cuts the VA a dozen? See, this is the damage that when people do not tell the truth about the bill, it actually goes to the funding where we were four months ago. If you look at back to the Obama-Biden budget that they passed for the next ten years, this actually spends more than what they proposed at this time.
 
And the work of Congress gets to decide where spending is, just like every family household. I'm very sad that the Democrats would think about cutting the veterans because we would not. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: For more on this, I'm joined by Mona Pearl Treyball, a professor at the University of Colorado College of Nursing and specialty director of veteran and Military Healthcare Programs, and she's also a retired colonel of the U.S. Air Force. Really great to have you on this topic here. So just want to say off the top, we don't know all the details about this shooting here, so I won't ask you about this specific case, but just looking across the country, the situation of a desperate veteran not getting the health care they need, physical or mental, and ending in violence against others or more commonly, unfortunately, against themselves. I mean, sadly, it's hardly unique, right? 
 
MONA PEARL TREYBALL, PROF. OF VETERAN &amp; MILITARY HEALTH CARE, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO: Not at all. Our veterans have been subjected to so much in service to our country, and they mirror our population, and they have health care needs, and it is a dire thing, and there is sometimes a gap in what services are available. But anywhere from 20% to 75% of our veterans have some type of mental health need, whether it's a military member or a veteran, and they need and deserve the care that we should be able to provide for them.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. And unfortunately, the statistics for suicide and suicide attempts is just tragically enormous amongst veterans, right? 
 
TREYBALL: Absolutely. It's, you know, official statistic is 22 a day. But in deep dive research, it is actually 44 a day.
 
BRUNHUBER: 44 a day.
 
TREYBALL: It's crazy how many people are so hurt by the service that they've given and that they're not getting the care that they need. And they don't feel understood in the community. 
 
BRUNHUBER: You spoke of a gap in the healthcare. So from your perspective, as someone who special specializes in military veteran health care, where is the biggest gap exactly? 
 
TREYBALL: We have a need for more providers, more mental health providers, and that's both in the community and in the VA. And the VA care is essential for our veterans. They truly understand the culture, the competencies, the service-connected conditions. So VA healthcare is truly essential. But many of our veterans and service members get care in the community, and that's up to 60% to 80% and their families, because families are also affected by the trials of war.
 
BRUNHUBER: Now, this is happening, as I mentioned before, in the context of the debt ceiling fight. The White House saying the Republican plan would gut the Department of Veteran Affairs. Republicans saying that's not true. Do you do you have any insights or thoughts upon on the possible effects of this bill?
 <br>[05:45:17]
 
TREYBALL: I know that we need to fund these services. I don't know the extensiveness of this bill and what it would do, but I think we need to add more funds for our veterans, not less. And while our veterans are getting some benefits and well-deserved benefits, we need to actually fund this more, not less, in my opinion.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, I mean, either way, it's sad that the brave men and women are caught in the middle of this political fight. 
 
Before we go, I want to end with this. The mother of the Atlanta shooting suspect offered a heartfelt plea. I just want you to listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And when someone is saying they need help, or you see that they are acting out of sorts, they need help. Help them, just don't disregard them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BRUNHUBER: I mean, that's -- 
 
TREYBALL: Absolutely.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah.
 
TREYBALL: My heart goes out to her. We need to help them. You know, we need to connect them to services, veterans, family members, you can dial 988, press one and be connected to somebody. But we do need to help them and we do need to provide them care and support. I absolutely agree with that, mom. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, the need is absolutely huge. Really appreciate all of your insights on this. Mona Pearl Treyball, thank you so much for speaking with us. 
 
TREYBALL: Thank you for having me.
 
BRUNHUBER: So, as she just mentioned, if you're a veteran or know a veteran who needs help, please call 988 and press one to speak to someone. You can also text 838255 or you can go online to veteransCrisisLine.net for more information. We'll be right back.

BRUNHUBER: The sport of horse racing is under continued fire from PETA and other animal rights groups. A total of seven horses were euthanized in the course of a week leading up to the Kentucky Derby Saturday night. So more on that is CNN Sports Coy Wire. So, Coy, the officials at Churchill Downs, I mean, they still don't exactly know what's behind this, right? 
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, they're still going to investigate this for quite some time, I would imagine. But this is, you know, one of the biggest sporting events on the U.S. calendar every single year. But this has been absolutely overshadowed by these horrible deaths. One trainer had already been suspended earlier in the week after two horses in his care died. 
 
Then two more deaths in the early races Saturday. Track officials saying euthanization was the most humane treatment they could offer. Churchill Downs called all seven deaths over the past week unique, saying there was no discernible pattern detected in the injury sustained and that they're committed to the health and well-being of the horses. 
 
This is a sobering reminder, they said, to the entire industry, to explore every avenue possible to minimize any avoidable risk. The sport also facing continued scrutiny over doping. Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert. He's nearing the end of his two-year ban from the sport after his 2021 Derby winner, Medina Spirit, failed at a post-race drug test. 
 
Pre-race favorite in this Kentucky Derby forte, at three to one odds, was scratched due to injury himself just hours before the race. So it was Mage at 15 to one odds, holding off two fills and Angel of Empire to win the 149th running of the Kentucky Derby. Jockey Javier Castellano from Venezuela, winning the first run for the Roses in 16 tries for him. So a lot to be learned, a lot to be investigated to try to get to the bottom of this because it's really unacceptable. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, I know for years, I mean, they've been calling for change, and, you know, they certainly have to get to the bottom of that situation so that they can do something about it because they can't just sustain that. 
 
Listen, we have to pivot to, you know, something a bit more entertaining here. The NBA, the NBA playoffs. I mean, the series between the Lakers and the Warriors, not all the big names, but not exactly living up to the hype, right? 
 
WIRE: Right. Yeah. Game 2 was a 27-point blowout in the warriors favor. And then last night, they go out here in Game 3, it's in L.A. And it's a 30-point blowout win for the Lakers. L.A., they were down eleven points halfway through the second, Kim. And then they went on a 22 to two run and never looked back.
 
LeBron James scoring 21 points on just eleven shots. D'Angelo Russell becoming the first Laker to ever hit five threes and score 20 points before halftime of a playoff game. But check out LeBron here, the old man playing defense. Huge block rallying his team and the crowd, which include it his son, Bronny, Kim, loving it. Anthony Davis -- 
 
BRUNHUBER: (Inaudible) later. 
 
WIRE:  Yes, we will. He racked up a team high 25 points and 13 rebounds as the Lakers win 127-97, taking a two one series lead.
 
NHL playoffs now. Different sport, same theme, Kim, blowout city in Sin City, Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl is on an all-time hitter. Just over two minutes into Game 2. He puts home a bouncing puck, the Oilers fifth goal of the series, all five by Leon Draisaitl at this point.
 
Then it's Connor McDavid's turn. The MVP frontrunner swiping the puck from Shea Theodore, winning the race. And then right between the legs, there Laurent Brossoit's legs for his first goal of the series. Draisaitl sealing the win before the first was even finished. His 13th goal in just eight playoff games. The all-time record for goals is 19. Oilers win five to one evening the series at one apiece. Nothing like playoff hockey. I couldn't imagine what it's like in Vegas. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely. Just be crazy out there. All right. Also a big day for Formula One here in the States. The second ever Miami Grand Prix. This afternoon you had a chance to talk to seven-time F One Champ Lewis Hamilton. He was at a charity basketball game. Is that right? 
 
WIRE: Yeah. Flew down to Miami to spend time with the greatest of all- time, right? And has won more races than any other racer. The legend qualified 13th, though. That was his worst ever for a race on U.S. soil. 
 <br>[05:55:02]
 
And I'm hoping our conversation down there, Kim, wasn't partly to blame for this. In my research, I discovered that he has fears. Spiders and onions. And I brought it up during our chat. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE: You're one of the most fearless people on the planet. Last time I was with you, with Tom Brady, we were talking about being fearless. You drive a rocket on wheels, 200 per hour. You skydive, but onion? Are you afraid of onions? 
 
LEWIS HAMILTON: No, I'm not afraid of onions. 
 
WIRE: There's video out there of you, like, looking like.
 
HAMILTON: No, (bleep). Love to do that. 
 
Yeah, I generally don't like raw onions. It's like my Kryptonite.
 
And I can't even touch it. 
 
If you've taken a bite out of raw onion and we're at the restaurant, I just can't speak to you, like, keep you distance. Raw onions is a big, big nugget for me. 
 
WIRE:  Raw onion.
 
HAMILTON: Yeah. But all my friends love onions. I just -- I just don't. I don't get it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: I hope that his competitors did not get wind of this interview and throw some raw onions in his car. If anyone can bounce back, though, from qualifying 13th and make the way to the front, it's Lewis Hamilton. We'll see how he does there, with Sergio Perez on the pole today. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Absolutely. I was just caught up in the battle of the biceps there. Both of you looking good there in that shot. All right, listen, stand by, because I want to talk you to talk through this here, have a look. Bronny James, the son of NBA superstar LeBron James, of course, is committed to play basketball at the University of Southern California. James is a four star and top 50 ranked nationally and has played high school basketball at Sierra Canyon in Los Angeles.
 
LeBron made headlines last year when he said he wanted his final season in the league to be played alongside Bronny, saying, "I would do whatever it takes to play with my son for one year."
 
WIRE: And he's one step closer. I mean, he's going to school right there in L.A. intervening that.
 
BRUNHUBER: I can't imagine. That would be so cool. I'd be, like, seven if I played with my son, who's eight right now. Anyway, that wraps this hour of CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Kim Brunhuber.
 
For viewers in North America, CNN THIS MORNING is next. The rest of the world is Connecting Africa.
