COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, from Los Angeles, lovely people, we`re halfway through to the week. We`re going to keep on grinding and shining 
 
 because that`s what we do. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. 
 
And today is our first hashtag your word Wednesday of the season. Follow me at Coy Wire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, and put your unique 
 
 vocabulary word in the comment section on my most recent post. And we`re going to choose one winner for tomorrow`s show.
 
On Instagram, my most recent post is about Jesse Billauer, championship surfer who`s overcoming incredible adversity in his life to become an 
 
 inspiration for people all around the world. I`m here in LA with my producer, Ryan Bergeron, dad of CNN tenor, Sylvie. What`s up Sylvie. We 
 
 can`t wait to share Jesse`s story with all of you soon.
 
Now to your news, late on Monday evening, former president Donald Trump was criminally charged for the fourth time this year in a sweeping indictment 
 
 from the State of Georgia. Let`s break it down. An indictment is another term used when a person is formally accused of committing a crime and it`s 
 
 one of the first moves made in our legal system before a case can go before a trial, an indictment is different from being convicted of a crime, and 
 
 it`s also not the same as receiving a guilty or not guilty verdict. 
 
The former president is now facing 91 charges across four indictments. The indictment Monday night included 18 defendants in addition to Trump. And it 
 
 was the result of a long running investigation that started in early 2021. Monday`s charges concerned Trump and others conduct after the 2020 election 
 
 and say that Trump`s team allegedly misled state officials in Georgia, organized fake electors, harassed and election worker and breached election 
 
 equipment in rural Georgia county. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and his attorneys slammed the indictment saying that the grand jury presentation 
 
 was one-sided and called Monday`s events, shocking and absurd. This all comes at the same time that Trump is running for president in 2024. And he 
 
 is the current front runner for the Republican party. 
 
We`ll keep you posted as this story unfolds right here on CNN 10.
 
Up next, we have more information on the devastation in Hawaii after wildfires ravaged the island of Maui. It`s still not known what started the 
 
 fires, but there`s been a renewed focus on the power lines that fell on the ground in the burned area. And the gust of winds that knocked them over. 
 
Now, some locals are blaming Hawaiian electric for not shutting off power to high-risk areas. They say that could have prevented the deadly fire. The 
 
 fires have also brought tension in Maui between locals and tourism as residents and officials warn tourists against traveling to Maui especially 
 
 as many hotels are now needed to host evacuee and first responders. We`ll go now to our Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir, who met with 
 
 dedicated individuals, bringing aid and resources to the region.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHARLIE FLECK, MAUI RESIDENT: Me and Brittany will lead the front. We got right behind us. Just stay close.
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When Charlie and Brittany Fleck saw pictures of the devastation on Lahaina, the couple from 
 
 Maui knew they had to do something.
 
C. FLECK: Come, come. We need to give you cash. We got cash.
 
BRITTANY FLECK, MAUI RESIDENT: You need some money?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, we need ices right now.
 
C. FLECK: OK.
 
B. FLECK: I think there`s a big ice truck.
 
C. FLECK: We got help on the way.
 
WEIR (voice-over): So they put out a plea on Facebook. And when thousands of dollars began rolling in, they began handing it out.
 
C. FLECK: Hey.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you so much.
 
C. FLECK: We`re coming for you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.
 
C. FLECK: Aloha.
 
WEIR (voice-over): But that didn`t seem like enough, so they organized a caravan and sweet talked their way past red tape and checkpoints. And when 
 
 they finally saw what Lahaina looks like for the first time, they wept.
 
But just on the edge of the burn scars, we find an inspiring example of Hawaiian togetherness.
 
ARCHIE KALEPA, HALL OF FAME WATERMAN: Towel for your neck.
 
WEIR (on-camera): Cold towel, OK. That is Aloha hospitality.
 
KALEPA: Yes.
 
WEIR (on-camera): Thank you.
 
KALEPA: There you go, man. Right there over your neck. Keep you nice and cool.
 
WEIR (voice-over): Archie Kalepa is a hall of fame surfer and lifeguard with Maui roots that go back nine generations.
 
(on-camera): This is your actual house here or?
 
KALEPA: Yes, this is my actual home. And we was really lucky because our neighbors, they were here fighting the fire right at this corner. And the 
 
 fire department said, this is our last stand. We`re going to hold the line right here.
 
WEIR (voice-over): While there`s so much frustration over the official response so far, he says authorities deserve some understanding, given the 
 
 size of the disaster.
 
KALEPA: This right here is a crime scene. And so what people don`t understand is the government has to do due diligence before they start 
 
 moving in.
 
WEIR (on-camera): So it`s a humanitarian response in the middle of a working crime scene.
 
KALEPA: Exactly.
 
WEIR (voice-over): But at another relief pod on a beach nearby, frustration has turned to anger.
 
ALIKA PENEKU, VOLUNTEER: Nobody came for help for us, you know what I mean, we rely on people like you guys that get compassion like we do. You know 
 
 what I mean? That willing to help us because, please, we need help. We need help. We need the next step. This is just the first inning. This is the 
 
 first inning of what we`re facing.
 
KALEPA: Tourism is our number one source of income. I would hope that our representatives, our politicians, our government would ask the people from 
 
 here, when can we open? They should not be telling us, oh, we want to open six months from now. The truth of the matter is, when you look at the 
 
 overall devastation, we are not going to be ready to allow people to see what we`re living through in six months.

WIRE: Ten second trivia. Which archipelago is said to have inspired a Shakespearean play and is nicknamed the shipwreck capital of the world?
 
Bermuda, Canary Islands, Seychelles, or Galapagos Islands?
 
Often considered to have inspired Shakespeare`s the tempest, Bermuda is the correct answer here. And up next, we`re taking you to meet one doctor who 
 
 has bred over 100,000 snails that were thought to be extinct, Lesser Bermuda Land Snail, as the name suggests come from Bermuda, but a number of 
 
 environmental factors have caused the snails to be critically endangered. We`ll meet one man, whose mission is to reintroduce them back to the wild 
 
 and will join the snails as they take part in a 3000-mile journey from a zoo in the north of England, all the way to Bermuda.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In a small collection of shipping containers, just outside Chester Zoo in the U.K. Gerardo Garcia is looking after plethora of 
 
 newts, frogs, salamanders, and snails. As head of ectotherm he is in charge of almost 60% of the animals in the entire zoo, but often the creatures 
 
 that have almost zero scientific information known about them. Since 2013, Gerardo has carried out much of his field work in Bermuda with two native 
 
 species of snail, the Greater and Lesser Bermuda Land Snails.
 
Having grown up in the containers at Chester Zoo, the snails are now making the 3000-mile journey to Bermuda where wildlife ecologist, Mark Outerbridge 
 
 is waiting for them.
 
GERARDO GARCIA, CURATOR, LOWER VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES, CHESTER ZOO: Good to see you again. 
 
MARK OUTERBRIDGE, WILDLIFE ECOLOGIST, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT, BERMUDA: All right.
 
Bermuda`s biodiversity is -- has its roots, its origins with many other islands. So we`re talking about a relatively small land area and in 
 
 Bermuda`s case, a very small land area in the middle of the ocean. And unfortunately we have evidence that we have lost species in Bermuda. They 
 
 are -- they are extinct.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Starting with only 60 of those snails, Gerardo`s team has since bred and released more than a hundred thousand. One of the 
 
 biggest wildlife reintroductions in history. Now, he`s returning to one of the release sites, Trunk Island to check on their progress and work out if 
 
 the area will be suitable for releasing their smaller cousins.
 
GARCIA: Was it this the first spot? 
 
TREVOR RAWSON, CONSERVATION MANAGER, TRUNK ISLAND: So this was the first spot we ever released the snails. We brought a bunch of Palm Fronds here 
 
 because we saw how much they were feeding off Palm Fronds in on ports island, sorry. So far so good. Let`s see if we can find any. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, I can see one right now.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I see one there.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A careful rummage with the fallen Palm leaves reveals a thriving community of the Greater Bermuda Land Snails and indicates a 
 
 perfect location to release the lesser snails.
 
GARCIA: Many people would ask why to bothered about our snails and, um, the question is, why we bothered about any other species that we have on the 
 
 planet? Every single one animal and plants, every single one has a role to play. You may, we don`t know, we may don`t understand, we may underestimate 
 
 the role, but everybody has a very important ecological role.

 Park in Indiana. The plans come complete with a jar of cranberries sauce. The ride called good gravy is set to open during the Park`s 2024 Season. 
 
And now on my favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to James Wood High School in Winchester, Virginia. Rise up, looking forward 
 
 to your submissions for your word Wednesday. So bring it baby. I`m Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.
