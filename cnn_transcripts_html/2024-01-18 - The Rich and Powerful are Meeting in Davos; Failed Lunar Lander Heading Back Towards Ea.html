COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. It`s Thursday, January 18th. Welcome to the best 10 minutes in news, where I tell you the, "what" 
 
 letting you decide what to think. Happy Friday Eve. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. 
 
We start today by heading to the mountain town of Davos in Switzerland. It`s known for its ski resorts and the World Economic Forum, which is 
 
 happening this week. It`s an annual meeting of business, political, and academic leaders. More than 60 heads of state are meeting in Davos, 
 
 including Presidents of Ukraine and Israel. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Prime Minister of China, Li Qiang, Microsoft CEO Satya 
 
 Nadella, and Sam Altman of OpenAI are attending as well, among many other business executives. 
 
So, what`s the goal of the World Economic Forum? Davos gives space for all of these powerful people from different countries and industries to meet in 
 
 formal and informal ways to share ideas and brainstorm solutions to the world`s biggest problems. What`s on the agenda? Global conflict, including 
 
 tensions between China and Taiwan, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The world leaders are also expected to talk about climate catastrophes and 
 
 pivotal elections happening this year in several major countries, including the U.S., India, and Mexico. Among other big topics are how artificial 
 
 intelligence will impact jobs, and the pandemic`s impact on the world economy that`s still in recovery. 
 
CNN`s Richard Quest is in Davos and he`s found a pretty unusual way to explain the goals and ambitions of the event and the basics of the global 
 
 economy. He`s doing it through the sport of curling. Take a look.

RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is a scene of Alpyn Beauty, the landscapes of winter, the Davos, the peaks, the visitors, the snow. The 
 
 World Economic Forum`s theme this year, "Rebuilding Trust," where it aims to hit the target. That`s also the philosophy of the Davos Curling Club. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So when the skip says, here, you make the curl like that.
 
QUEST: So that`s why it`s called curling, because you curled. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s curls. Yes. 
 
QUEST: Think of these stones as being the economy, various governments, prime ministers, presidents, finance ministers, they set their course and 
 
 send it on its way. 
 
So many factors threatened to sweep the economy. For starters, interest rates, central bankers have hiked them to the point where economies have 
 
 slowed down to kill inflation. And now they`re trying to hit that target 2% without them knocking themselves off. Global growth is expected to slow 
 
 this year. I hope it`s not going to spiral it all down.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go.
 
QUEST: That did nothing, that did nothing. Because I wasn`t able to sweep enough out the way. And so the economy came to a stop. 
 
(On camera): It is also the year of elections, political candidates charting their collision course for victory, hoping to knock rivals off the 
 
 stage. 
 
AI is like a curling stone. Heavy, once set free may be difficult to control. And even if we do the right things, well, accidents can still 
 
 happen. It`s unbelievable. 
 
The world of curling can teach us much about today`s global economy, having raised interest rates and then still trying to keep things going without 
 
 coming to a complete stop. And then when all set and done in a competitive environment, you want to knock your competitors to one side, but you don`t 
 
 want to completely ruin the game. Richard Quest, CNN Davos.

WIRE: Ten second trivia.
 
What year was the latest space mission in which humans successfully landed on the moon? 
 
1959, 1969, 1972 or 1970?
 
If you said 1972, you are correct. That was the last time humans set foot on the moon during the final lunar landing mission in NASA`s Apollo 
 
 program, Apollo 17.
 
Last week, the U.S. launched its first Lunar Lander mission in more than 50 years, there was no crew on this craft, but the moonshot, this time was not 
 
 successful due to a critical fuel leak, the Peregrine spacecraft had to turn back from the vicinity of the moon and head back towards earth. 
 
Astrobotic, the company that built the Peregrine Lander under a 108 million contract with NASA said the spacecraft was about 218,000 miles from the 
 
 earth. There were options to crash land the Peregrine on the moon or leave it to the Cosmos. But Astrobotic decided that the safest option would be to 
 
 turn the spacecraft back and allow it to smash into the thick atmosphere of the earth at high speeds. If the Peregrine`s mission had been successful, 
 
 it might have become the first U.S. spacecraft to land on the moon since Apollo 17. 
 
All right, we possibly have some good news for air travelers. The airline industry is set to have its first quote, "normal year since the pandemic. 
 
 Airfare is at a 15-year low and more passengers are now ditching the economy seats and upgrading to more premium seating arrangements, did you 
 
 know? 
 
CNN has been speaking with a travel expert, who`s giving predictions on what`s next for airlines and passengers.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KATY NASTRO, TRAVEL EXPERT &amp; SPOKESPERSON, GOING.COM: If I had to pick one word to describe travel in 2024, I`m going to have to say, normal. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: After years of pandemic related disruptions, 2024 is set to be the first full year of relative normalcy for air travel since the end 
 
 of the pandemic was declared last year. So we asked travel expert, Katy Nastro, to share her crystal ball with us.
 
NASTRO: Airfare is 12% lower than it was a year ago. It`s almost 25% lower than it was in 2019. Airfare hasn`t been this cheap since 2009.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: While inflation might have consumers worried about price increases at the grocery store, Nastro doesn`t expect airfare to skyrocket 
 
 like it has in recent more volatile years when the pandemic may travel unpredictable.
 
NASTRO: Without these sort of spikes that we saw over the last two years, we`re likely to see 2024 mirror those years in 2019, 2018. Cheap flights 
 
 are so available. And the amount of people looking and wanting to travel is not going to go down, it`s likely to go up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course not all airlines survive the pandemic. And some airlines amidst continuing financial struggles, proposed mergers last 
 
 year to make their businesses more competitive, they claim. But Nastro warns the opposite could be true for travelers.
 
NASTRO: The single biggest factor for why we see cheap flights is competition. So even if you never fly on a budget carrier like a Spirit, we 
 
 want those carriers in the mix because it actually places downward pressure on the legacy carriers like a Delta, an American in United. And so 
 
 basically when we hear of mergers between airlines, that`s the first thing that comes to mind, less competition. And that means less availability of 
 
 cheap flights for consumers.

WIRE: Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 is proof that some ambitious travel plans don`t even need a plane ticket. Briana DeSanctis, a hiker from 
 
 new England has decided to hike the entire United States. Her goal is to be the first woman to complete the American discovery trail. It spans more 
 
 than 6,800 miles of hiking and biking route.
 
On her journey, Briana said she encountered wild animals. She hiked through a temperature drop at one point where it went from 22 degrees to just two 
 
 degrees in a 40-minute time span. She said, people don`t really get outside that much these days. So she`s determined to push herself in hopes of 
 
 inspiring others. 
 
I hope some of you out there are finding a path that might inspire others along the way. Remember you never know when or how or for whom, but you 
 
 will be the light that someone needs someday. So shine bright baby.
