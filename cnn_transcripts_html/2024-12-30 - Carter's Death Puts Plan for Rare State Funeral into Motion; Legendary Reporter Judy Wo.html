BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Anne Fogel.   
 
FOGEL:  --looking forward --

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, "ANDERSON COOPER: 360": Good evening we begin with an unprecedented period of American history poised to unfold in front of the entire nation, promising to be a time of change and continuity of parallels and contrasts and returns and farewells.   
 
For starters, three weeks from tonight, the nation's 47th president, who was once the 45th president, will have been back in office for eight hours. Bearing witness at Donald Trump's inauguration earlier in the day will be the outgoing president, Joe Biden, whose hopes for re- election were of course, dashed in part by high prices, the war in Gaza and a lack of confidence in his leadership.   
 
The ceremony will take place 44 years to the day that another one-term president, also beset by inflation and overseas hostage crisis and plummeting popularity, peacefully transferred power to his successor.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   
 
REPORTER: The last time that Jimmy Carter will hear hail to the chief occupying that office   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER: That was President Jimmy Carter, and as you no doubt know by
 
 now, he died yesterday at the age of 100. We'll reflect tonight on President Carter's life and faith, his legacy of public service with two of his closest friends or close friends from his beloved hometown of Plains, Georgia, as well as presidential historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin and veteran journalist, Judy Woodruff.   
 
I'll also talk with Patti Davis, whose father, Ronald Reagan, defeated Jimmy Carter, about how a president's family copes with what Edward Kennedy once called unbearable sorrow endured in the glare of a million lights.   
 
But first, former President Carter's death means there will be two intricately planned and highly choreographed events in the nation's capital in the weeks ahead. The presidential inauguration and a rare state funeral together stunning in their timing and symbolism.   
 
We begin tonight with Kayla Tausche at the White House with new details on the funeral. What do we know so far -- Kayla.   
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Anderson, we know that the late 39th president will be honored with a procession marked with many details to honor his legacy and his place in history.   
 
Beginning on Saturday, President Carter's Secret Service detail will carry his casket to his motorcade, which will begin a procession that stops by his family's farm in Plains, Georgia, ringing the historic farm bell, 39 times.   
 
The motorcade will then travel to the Georgia State Capitol and then on to the Carter Presidential Center. His post-presidency hub for diplomacy, where he will lie in repose for three days before then traveling to Washington, DC on Special Air Mission 39.   
 
He will lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda from January 7th to January 9th, and then on January 9th, he will be honored with a state funeral here in Washington at the National Cathedral.   
 
President Biden will be among those eulogizing him. And after that funeral, President Carter will fly home to Plains, Georgia, for a private interment and to be laid to rest -- Anderson.   
 
COOPER: What have you learned about the eulogy that President Biden will deliver?   
 
TAUSCHE: Well, President Biden has said that President Carter asked him to deliver this eulogy. The two have known each other for decades. They shared a lifelong bond, and in some ways, they shared an arc of their career.   
 
Biden was a young senator when carter, then the governor of Georgia, decided to run for the presidency, and Biden was among the first and most frequent campaigners for him.   
 
He was also the first sitting senator and the first politician outside of Georgia to endorse Carter for president. Now, Biden often chaffed at what he viewed as Carter's seeming unwillingness to cater to political allies. But certainly the two shared a very strong bond.   
 
Biden often calling him, seeking his counsel over the years multiple times. He spoke to him in the first days of his own first term and only term as president, visiting Plains, Georgia around the time of his 100th day in office, he said they talked about the old days, and Biden will remember his friend one last time next week -- Anderson.   
 
COOPER: Kayla Tausche, thanks so much.   
 
President Carter was born a hundred years ago in the small town of Plains, Georgia. He returned there after his presidency and it was there that he died at his home, yesterday afternoon.   
 
Eva McKend joins us now from Plains.   
 
So how are people there in Plains, remembering the former president?   
 
EVAN MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, it is a mix of sadness and pride tonight as you speak to people here.   
 
I was speaking with the mayor, 540 people live in Plains. So this is a tremendously small community. And all throughout the world in the coming days, President Carter will be remembered for his lifetime of service, for his courage, his commitment to racial and social justice. 
 
But to the people here in Plains, he was their neighbor. It wasn't long ago before he fell ill, when it wasn't uncommon to see him in the Dollar Store, to see him walking along Main Street or worshiping in church. And so, take a listen to how they are thinking about this moment.   
 <br>[20:05:15]   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   
 
PHILLIP KURLIND, GEORGIA RESIDENT: Let's face it, the Carters be alive in Plains. So, we want to continue the spirit and continue the good in the world.   
 
WILLIE JOHNSON, GEORGIA RESIDENT: He was someone that all -- everybody in the community always looked up to. Somebody that always brought positivity and somebody that was spiritually strong. And this is somebody from worldwide that we are going to miss, and he left a very good example for us to live by.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
MCKEND: And Anderson, as we were driving into Plains this morning, we passed through several other small towns. This is a very conservative part of the state.   
 
And so we saw many Trump signs scattered across lawns. And we were speaking to a family friend here of the Carters. She's a proud Republican, but she said that she will always remember Jimmy Carter as Mister Jimmy, despite disagreeing with him on political issues.   
 
And so, the affection -- really the respect for his service and for his legacy in this community transcends politics -- Anderson.   
 
COOPER: Eva McKend, thank you so much. I appreciate it.   
 
The view from Plains, Georgia.   
 
We came across this video of Jimmy Carter. It was taken back in 2017, taken by a fellow passenger aboard a Delta flight from Washington to Atlanta, a smiling Jimmy Carter shaking the hands of pretty much everyone, it seems, on board the flight.   
 
Now, the man who took the video later said, "It's hard to put into words what a nice reprieve from the current political theater this moment was. His enthusiasm was authentic and humble in a way that made things feel less heavy for a moment."   
 
We're joined now by two people who were personal friends of the former president and First Lady, Rosalynn Carter. Jill Stuckey, superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Park, and Tony Lowden, Carter's personal pastor.   
 
Appreciate both of you joining us. I'm so sorry for the personal loss that both of you are feeling, as well as the country's loss, of course.   
 
Jill, what do you want people to know about the Jimmy Carter you knew? 
 
JILL STUCKEY, FRIEND OF PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY CARTER: Oh, an amazing man. You know, he cared about everybody else. He was giving and he is going to be sorely missed in this community and around the world.   
 
COOPER: Pastor Lowden, I know you were President Carter's pastor for six years. I've heard you say that most of the time you were trying to pastor him. He was actually pastoring you. What was that like?   
 
TONY LOWDEN, PRESIDENT CARTER'S PERSONAL PASTOR AND PASTOR OF JABEZ MINISTRIES: Anderson, It was incredible. I mean, from teaching me about the history of Archery, Georgia to teaching me about the history of Plains, teaching me about Black history, teaching me about Bishop William Decker Bonner, who was a preacher during the time when he was a kid that ministered to African-Americans, that was on his father's farm.   
 
Rachel Clark, taking me out to Archery, Georgia and showing me the cemetery, the unmarked cemetery where African-Americans who fought in the World War I and World War II, being able to talk to me about faith and hope, but then start asking me questions.   
 
He would ask me four questions every time I sit with him, and those four questions would be, Anderson -- Where have you been? What have you done? Who have you helped and how can I help you help them?   
 
Him and Miss Rosalynn was like that every time I sit down with them in their living room, wanting to serve other people, even when they were down.   COOPER: And Pastor, I mean, he's famously, you know, gave a sermon,
 
 continued to, I think, at Sunday school or to teach or occasionally give sermons. What were those like?   
 
I talked to a friend of his last night who said that, you know, at times when you heard a sermon from him or a lesson from him, it almost sounded like he made it come to life. It almost sounded like he had experienced it personally.   
 
LOWDEN: Oh, absolutely, Anderson.   
 
One of the things that he would do, at the end of every one of his messages in Sunday school that he would challenge people to take the Word of God that he was teaching them and go back out and do something. Do something for your neighbors. Serve somebody. Don't just hear the word, but take the word outside of the church. And that was one of the most remarkable things for him to do.   
 
Of course, he just didn't teach Sunday school down in Plains. He did it in Washington, DC, too, as well. And Jill will tell you when you have hundreds and hundreds of people sleeping in the parking lot on Saturday just to get into the church on Sunday to hear this Sunday school teacher teach.   
 
I think when we look back at the time, you know, him and Miss Rosalynn was very competitive and she went home. God opened up heaven and brought her home on a Sunday and President Carter, God opened up heaven and brought him home on a Sunday as well.   
 <br>[20:10:11]   
 
He brought the Sunday school teacher home, who was teaching us about compassion and hope and love and how we should treat our fellowmen.   
 
And I will say this, Anderson, and I'll be done with this. We need more people that can take their left hand and put it on the Bible and raise their right hand and keep the Covenant with our nation as we make this transition to serve and be servant leaders for our great nation, as well as around the world.   
 
COOPER: Jill, I know you regularly dined with the Carters in Plains. I mean, they were famously no frills. They liked, I understand, buffet dinners with friends. What was it like to just be able to spend time with them? What were they like as a couple together so together?   
 
STUCKEY: So, together they occasionally would bicker about some little things, but they always went home happy --   
 
COOPER: If they were together seventy seven years, if they didn't bicker, I would be -- that would be insane.   
 
STUCKEY: Seventy seven-and-a-half years, there's going to be a little bicker or two, but every night before they laid their heads on their pillows, they would make up.   
 
But we'd serve wine sometimes in solo cups, and they didn't mind paper plates. They were just very, very down to earth. And you know, anything you serve them, they would happily eat sometimes when they didn't even like it.   
 
COOPER: And Jill, I mean, obviously it's tragic, you know, when anybody dies and a life comes to an end. But, I mean, Jimmy Carter had talked about, you know, his belief about what happens when you die. And I think it's a great comfort to a lot of people, this idea that they -- that he and Rosalynn are together again.   
 
STUCKEY: Definitely, and he is, you know, yesterday, President Carter's wish came true. He is with Rosalynn again. And since she left us a little over a year ago, that's been his wish.   
 
So, it's very bittersweet. You know, the selfish part of me wanted him to just live on forever. But we're going to have to get used to a world without Jimmy Carter, and that's going to be very difficult to do.   
 
Pastor Lowden, I talked to a friend of the Carters, Beaus, who knew Jimmy Carter since Beaus was ten years old, and when he was in the Boy Scouts, he told me something which I had not realized that Miss Lily and Jimmy Carter's mom, who was a midwife, delivered Rosalynn carter.  
 
So Jimmy Carter was -- his mom, delivered his wife. That's amazing.   
 
STUCKEY: That's correct. And little Jimmy lived next door to Rosalynn. 
 
LOWDEN: You're talking about divine moments.   
 
COOPER: Yes, I'm sorry. What was that story, Jill?   
 
STUCKEY: So, little Jimmy was three years old. He lived next door to Rosalynn's parents' house. So when he was three, his mother took him next door. And he peeked over at the bassinet and saw his wife, future wife for the first time.   
 
COOPER: I mean, that's incredible. Pastor, I mean, I want to play something, Pastor Lowden, that President Carter said during a Sunday school service in 2019. He was speaking about his brain cancer diagnosis.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   
 
JIMMY CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I obviously prayed about it. I didn't ask God to let me live, but I just asked God to give me a proper attitude toward death. And I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death.   
 
It didn't really matter to me whether I died or lived. I have, since that time, been absolutely confident that my Christian faith includes complete confidence in life after death. So, I'm going to live again after I died.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
COOPER: I mean, what an extraordinary thing to have that faith, to have that confidence and to think about death in that way.   
 
LOWDEN: Yes, Anderson, it was unbelievable to watch him live out his faith. I remember the time when he had fell and he had a Habitat build that he was going to do in Tennessee, and Secret Service rushed him to the hospital. We get to the hospital and the Secret Service said, "Tony, we need you to go in there and tell him he should not go to Tennessee because he's -- we need to keep him in the hospital."   
 
Going to the room, and he tells -- I said, "President Carter, they said, you shouldn't go to Tennessee. Maybe you should just rest." He said, "Listen, Tony," he said, "Hospitals are just like prisons. They're easy to get in, but hard to get out. You need to help me get out of here so that I can go and serve the people in Tennessee."   
 
The next thing I know, he had a bandage on his head, a blackeye, and he's on his way to Tennessee to build homes for people who need homes. It was that Navy motto that I die to myself and I serve my nation.   
 <br>[20:15:12]   
 
And that's who he's always been. We have one of the greatest servant leaders that ever walked this earth. And at a time when our government and other nations around the world are looking at transition into leadership, I think it's only fitting that the world get an opportunity to see when we have another opportunity where we have nations in crisis and crisis in confidence in our governments --    
 
So, Jimmy Carter's life put on display what it means to be a true servant leader with a servant heart.   
 
COOPER: Yes, well, he certainly was that.   
 
Pastor Tony Lowden, Jill Stuckey, thank you so much on this day. I appreciate you spending some time with us. Thank you.   
 
I want to get perspective now from legendary presidential biographer and Pulitzer prize winning author, Doris Kearns Goodwin. Her bestsellers include the most recently "An Unfinished Love Story: A Personal History of the 1960s," and she's a guest on an upcoming podcast episode of mine on "All There Is."   
 
Doris, in his farewell address to the nation in 1981, President Carter famously said he was going to take up once more, "The only title in our democracy superior to that of president. The title of citizen." I'm wondering what your thoughts are on this moment of passing.   
 
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Yes, it's so interesting that you bring up that quote, because I think it foreshadowed the next 43 years of his life. You know, two terms are usually necessary for a president to leave a lasting legacy. And Ronald Reagan's defeat of Jimmy Carter in 1980 prevented that second term. And he was very sad and he acknowledged it. He said that night that he had promised he would never tell a lie, and he had to admit that this really hurt, that he couldn't say that it didn't hurt.   
 
But then what happened is that a few days later, a few weeks later, he gives that farewell address where he says the citizen is even more important as a title than president.   
 
And as a citizen, he said, which is an incredible quote that he made. He said that, you know, "There's only one chance and one life to count for something. And my faith tells me, or my faith demands, that I use whatever I have whenever I can, to make a difference in people's lives."   
 
And so for 43 years, he had a long second term where he made such a difference in people's lives and that's what we're remembering now.   
 
He didn't like to think it was just the post-presidency divided from the presidency because he said, without the presidency and the power and the influence and the resources that it had, he never would have had the chance to do what he did.   
 
But boy, did he use that power and resources for good, as we've all been talking about in these last couple hours, eradicating diseases, the Camp David Accords that had happened before, but introducing human rights into more and more discussions in the country as a whole and just really building those homes and doing so much to make life better for ordinary citizens.   
 
So, I think that when biographers look at him, it'll be the whole life that they're going to look at, not simply the presidency, but how one contributed to the other and what a life he led.   
 
COOPER: There's a story about President Carter mowing the lawn behind his church. Can you just share that with us?   
 
GOODWIN: Yes, it just shows what happened when he went back to Plains, Georgia. He just became part of that little community.   
 
So a man comes by and he sees this old guy mowing the lawn, and he says to him, is this the church? It was behind a church. "Is this the church where Carter preached?" And Carter just looked up and just smiled and said, "Yes, that's the church." Not even saying I am Carter.   
 
So, there was a sense, I think, you know, Lyndon Johnson used to say he wanted to go back to the home, to the place where they know when you are sick and they care when you die. That's something that I think Carter wanted to do to go back, and that modesty, I visited him in that home when I interviewed him in 1976.   
 
It's a very simple, lovely home. And the people knew him and he walked around the streets and he really went back. It's almost like full circle to where it all began meeting as we're just hearing, you know, meeting little Rosalynn Carter as a tiny baby. The first date they had, he knew he wanted to marry her and what a marriage they had.   
 
COOPER: It is incredible to think now, you know, when you think about, I mean, how he kind of redefined what a president might do once they left office. And it wasn't just, you know, lots of presidents have libraries and make speeches and sit on boards, but, I mean, he rolled up his sleeves. I mean, it was an extraordinary post-presidency. Obviously, it went on for 43 years. So he certainly had a lot of time to work on it.   
 
GOODWIN: I have no idea how he was able to accomplish everything he could. You know, in the middle of running around the world and monitoring elections and helping to eradicate diseases and getting rid of river blindness and the guinea worm. He also wrote 32 books. Can you imagine that? Thirty books.   
 
And quite a few of them after he reached the age of 80. It gives me great hope that there's a lot of years left to be continuing to write. But I've only written nine books, and I've not spent my life being president and being the post-president that he was.   
 <br>[20:20:05]   
 
So, somehow he had that discipline that he wanted to use, as he said every day of his life, to do something that would make a difference. And, you know, I think that's the greatest legacy. You just think, what if we all thought that in our smaller ways, you know, to make some act of kindness, some act of compassion that might make a difference in somebody's life, to be powered by that sense of faith, I think really, really gave him something that was a foundation for what he did.   
 
And he'll be remembered for that, for the kind of man he was, for his character, humility and empathy and resilience and kindness and compassion. You know, a good man who really did well by doing good and who had a fundamental decency to him.    
 
COOPER: There's this saying my mom used to like, which is by McLaren, who said, "Be kind because everybody you meet is fighting a great battle," and he certainly was.   
 
I mean, his example of kindness, I just think it is so important in this day and age when you know, it's not the virtue that that is most often spoken about or prized by a lot of people these days. But it makes -- it does matter and his entire life is an example of that.   
 
GOODWIN: And I think it did come from his faith in God. I remember when I interviewed him in 1976, he told me this story about before he had found God. When he went on an elevator, he was so ambitious to get to the top floor, 12 or 14, wherever he was going, that he looked on the other people who were pressing two, four, six buttons with anger almost preventing him from getting from the top.   
 
But now, suddenly, after God came into his life, he just looked on them with a certain brotherly love and wondered and tried to figure out maybe there's some way I can help them.   
 
What a different attitude really toward -- really toward ambition it's a metaphor for his larger attitude toward his life, I think.   
 
COOPER: Yes, and yet he was --    
 
GOODWIN: Every time I go in an elevator, I think to myself, what am I going to do about these people?   COOPER: Well, I must admit, I have found myself on elevators, annoyed
 
 at other people pushing buttons. So it's a good lesson. I'm glad you brought that up.   
 
Before President Obama's inauguration in 2009, President Bush hosted a lunch at the White House with former living presidents at the time George HW Bush, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter. How do you think Jimmy Carter fit into that group? What were his relationships like with those in the so-called Presidents Club? Because he did something that a lot of former presidents didn't do, which is criticize other serving presidents.   
 
GOODWIN: Right, there's a famous picture of that meeting where he's standing off to the side, sort of different from the rest of the people there. And I think it was because he saw his role as a citizen rather than a member of that exclusive club, where there's a sort of rule that you don't criticize the sitting president. And he was able to say what he thought of George Bush's foreign policy, or what he thought of what X or Y had done. And that didn't sit well, maybe with some of the other presidents.   
 
But it was all in keeping with the idea that now I'm a citizen, I can say what I want, and I have ideas and I have opinions and I have -- I want to say what I think is right or wrong.   
 
COOPER: Can you speak to how kind of rare it will be to have two intricately planned, highly choreographed events in Washington -- a state funeral and the presidential inauguration in the weeks ahead?   
 
GOODWIN: Yes, you know, the ritual of an inauguration is almost like a new beginning for many ways, in which one hopes that the next presidency will give us what we hope a presidency will be. And here we've got a farewell to a president who had a life so well lived.   
 
And these rituals matter. I mean, the state funeral were going to see were going to feel a sense. We'll remember other state funerals. Those of us who are older, you know, whether it would be John Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson or the other presidents who've died.   
 
And at the same time, when the inauguration happens, we'll remember other inaugurations. It's when history comes into play. I mean, that's why I think these rituals matter so much, because they take us back in time.   
 
It's not only seeing the current president inaugurated and a current president dying, but a former president dying. But you think of all the other ones that went in between, and there's not that many when you think about it.   
 
We're not talking about hundreds of leaders over this period of time, but only a select few. And we are going to see, as you say, a remembrance of one who's died and a new form of a new, even though he's the same president coming back, it is a new presidential inauguration that we're going to see of a second term.   
 
COOPER: Yes, Doris Kearns Goodwin, always so wonderful to talk to you. Thank you, Doris, appreciate it.   
 
GOODWIN: Thank you for having me.   
 
COOPER: Still to come tonight as we remember the legacy of the 39th president of the United States, were going to hear from an acclaimed journalist who covered the Carter White House years after she reported on his ascent in Georgia politics, Judy Woodruff, who also eulogized First Lady Rosalynn Carter last year, joins me.   
 
Also, when a nation loses a president, some lose a father or a grandfather. Patti Davis, the daughter of Carter's 1980 opponent, Ronald Reagan, will join us as well.   
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)   
 <br>[20:28:58]   
 
COOPER: Few journalists covered President Jimmy Carter as closely as my next guest, Judy Woodruff actually began her career covering Jimmy Carter's rise in Georgia State politics. And after covering Carter's successful 1976 presidential bid, Judy took on the White House bid for NBC.   
 
He was there on election night in 1980, where she reported that Carter would be a one-term president, watch.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   
 
JUDY WOODRUFF, AMERICAN BROADCAST JOURNALIST: Reporters haven't seen the president since he flew back to Washington from Georgia earlier today, where he voted. But when he spoke to the townspeople in Plains this morning almost 12 hours ago, he choked up as he talked about, hoping that he had fulfilled his commitment to the people of his region.   
 
I think it was evident at that point that the people who have been following the president in this long campaign, that the president knew what was ahead.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
COOPER: Judy Woodruff, the remarkable Judy Woodruff, a senior correspondent and former anchor for the PBS "News Hour," also former CNN anchor, joins me now.   
 
Judy, it's so great to have you on this night. And so great to see that clip.   
 
You began, like right out of college in Georgia and started covering Jimmy Carter when he was running for his second time, actually, to try to get to be the Georgia governor. He had lost the first time.   
 
WOODRUFF: Exactly right, Anderson. I was a year-and-a-half out of college. I had just been hired by the CBS affiliate in Atlanta to cover Georgia politics. And guess who was running for governor? A peanut farmer who had tried unsuccessfully in 1966, but he was trying again. He was running against the former governor of the state, but he managed to defeat -- not only to defeat them, but to defeat expectations.   
 
And I think, you know, that's been the story or was the story of his life.   
 
Again, and again, and again. Jimmy Carter was underestimated, written off, and look at what he achieved.   
 
And yes, his presidency ended in one term, but he went on to do the things that you've just been discussing with your guests.   
 <br>[20:30:58]   
 
COOPER: And he -- I mean, he was an -- he was a long shot to become the governor. As you said, he had lost it once before. He wasn't really part of the Democratic machine in Georgia. He was kind of an outsider. I mean, you know, this is a state that, you know, it was a brutally racist state under segregation. Lester Maddox had, you know, had the power there. He was a real departure.
 
And as governor, he made a famous speech in which he really, he said towards the effect of, you know, the time for racial segregation is over.
 
WOODRUFF: And it was interesting, Anderson, because in his campaign for governor, he had been very careful to appeal to the most conservative Democrats in the state. He invited George Wallace to come and speak in Georgia. He reached out to notorious segregationists.
 
And yet, as you just said, when he was inaugurated governor, the line that everybody remembers is the time for racial segregation is over. He was then seen as the up-and-coming governor, you know, representing the, quote, New South. He had a tough time, though, with governor.
 
I will never forget an interview with the Georgia speaker of the State House of Representatives who told me in an interview, he said, Jimmy Carter is trying to run the state like he's the commander of a nuclear submarine. In other words, he thought he could give out orders. And that was Carter's background. He was a nuclear engineer. He had worked under Hyman Rickover. And he was really brilliant.
 
I mean, he was -- he brought all those engineering skills, his interest in literature, faith, theology, art -- the arts, music to -- to his career in politics. And -- and you put it all together. It didn't necessarily make for a great mix in politics. And I think that attributed to his loss after one term.
 
COOPER: Well, I find it so interesting, though, because, you know, I think for a lot of people who only know him as a post president and as an older man, you know, you see this kind of soft spoken guy, aw shucks, he seems. But I mean, nobody becomes president of the United States or governor of Georgia at that time by just kind of showing up.
 
I mean, he and from what I've heard, I've heard you say before, I mean, he had a will of steel. He was driven in ways that I think a lot of people don't realize.
 
WOODRUFF: Completely driven. And it's and what I think all of us would love to know is what was the secret sauce. His father was demanding, and Jimmy Carter wrote about this. And in one at least one of his books, he wrote about how his father was very tough on him, expected him to achieve at a high level.
 
He was a first-born son. And -- and he said he could be punitive when I didn't achieve what I -- what I was expected to do. He said that I he said I would hurt. It would hurt me. But then I would get over it. I'd get up the next day and keep going.
 
Probably some psychologists could tell us, you know, how that all played -- played out over his life. But there was something burning deep inside of Jimmy Carter that drove him to want to -- to make the most of every minute. And you heard this, I think, from your first guest in the hour from Jill and from -- and from the pastor. He wanted to do everything he could to help those who couldn't help themselves. And -- and it's the reason he worked on the peace in the Middle East. It was the reason he made human rights the passion of a lifetime for him.
 
He put it on, literally put the battle for human rights on the map. It wasn't something that people talked about before Jimmy Carter.
 
And then, of course, we know what the Carter Center has done.
 
COOPER: Yes. Judy Woodruff, getting to work occasionally alongside you was has been one of the highlights of my career. And I love watching you on television. And I love having you on the show tonight.
 
So, thank you. I really appreciate it.
 
WOODRUFF: Thank you so much. Great to see you.
 
COOPER: Take care.

Few people know what it is, what grief is like when the person that you've lost was your dad, who also happens to have been the president United States.
 
Patti Davis, daughter of President Ronald Reagan, does know what that's like, and she joins us next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COOPER: Jimmy Carter was a president, a governor, a peacemaker, and a Nobel Prize winner, but also a son, a father, a husband, and a family man who embodied the values of hard work and perseverance, something President Ronald Reagan, who defeated President Carter in 1980, touched on in 1986, the dedication of the Carter Presidential Center.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD REAGAN, FMR PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: Of course, the Carter Presidential Center will mean something different for each of the millions who will visit it and benefit from it each year. But going through the Jimmy Carter Library just now and admiring the many photographs and films, it struck me that perhaps the central gift that this center will give to the nation is a story, a story of one man's life, a story that is distinctively American.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[20:40:06]
 
COOPER: Well, joining us now, the daughter of the late President Ronald Reagan, Patti Davis, actress as well as author of a number of works including Dear Mom &amp; Dad, A Letter About Family, Memory And The America We Once Knew.
 
Patti, it's great to see you. I'm sorry it's under these circumstances. You are really one of the relatively few people in this country who know what it is like to lose a father who was a president and to also to not have it be something that was sudden, to have it be something that was an anticipatory grief, something you had time to prepare for as much as anyone can.
 
What are your thoughts on the passing of President Carter?
 
PATTI DAVIS, DAUGHTER OF FMR PRES. RONALD REAGAN: Well, first of all, my condolences to the Carter family. I know it's a sad time and, you know, it's very surreal to grieve in public, to go through this mourning process or part of it anyway in public. And from what I've read, the Carters are going to go through pretty much the same thing that we went through, like a week of services and eulogies and a kind of pageantry, you know.
 
And I remember that I was, of course, I was mourning, but I was but there was a bit of remove there because there were millions of people mourning along with me. And they kind of kept me sort of floating above the currents, you know, the currents being my own personal, private grief. And I knew I was going to have to dive down into those currents, but none of us really want to. Grief is hard. You know, we -- we would love to be able to avoid it.
 
And, you know, we were flying back across the country for these different services with my father's casket. I mean, we were flying back and forth with his body.
 
And I remember, I think, in the last leg of it, when we were flying back to California, I said to my mother, could we just fly to some other states? Can we just like keep this going? Right. They'd love to have us. Right.
 
Because I didn't want the week to end because I knew what was waiting for me. I knew that I would have to get to my own personal and private grief.
 
COOPER: Yes. DAVIS: But the week does end and the world moves on to other news stories and the cameras go away. And then you are left with -- with the solitariness of your own grief. And you know what? At that moment, you were exactly the same as every other person who has ever lost a loved one.
 
You are caught up in the messiness of grief and the unpredictability of it. The -- the moments when grief kind of drives you to your knees because you saw something or heard a song or smell something that made memories crash. It's pretty universal.
 
COOPER: Yes, I was going to say in that sense, it is universal for so many families who, you know, when somebody dies, there's the adrenaline and it gets -- 
 
DAVIS: Yes.
 
COOPER: -- you through the first few days and the planning of the funeral and then the -- the actual funeral. And you're surrounded by friends if you're lucky and family members. But then at some point they leave and the world does keep spinning and you are left with the grief.
 
And it's in your case, in the case of a public death like that, it is the crash is perhaps even greater because suddenly, I mean, everything has stopped and now it's just normal life again, but not for you.
 
DAVIS: Yes.
 
COOPER: What -- what was it? I mean, I was out -- I was in California when your father was interred at the -- at the Reagan Library. I was covering it and I -- it was -- I mean, it was incredibly moving. The entire week was so extraordinarily moving.
 
DAVIS: It was.
 
COOPER: How were you conscious of that at the time when you're in that -- I don't know if it was a bubble or were you conscious of all that -- 
 
DAVIS: Oh yes.
 
COOPER: -- going on?
 
DAVIS: Because I'll tell you, you know, one of the most profound things for me was I had resented America for a long time because I've called it this weird kind of sibling rivalry, right, with America and my father, you know, because I felt like, well, America is more important to my father than I am sort of thing, you know.
 
And -- and when he died and when there was this outpouring of grief and thousands of people were on freeway overpasses as we drove up to the to the Reagan Library, I -- that resentment went away and I really -- I appreciated that support.
 <br>[20:44:59] I appreciated that sort of big raft that I felt like I was being put on so that I could float above the messiness that I knew was coming. You know, I really appreciated that I was -- I had all of that surrounding me.
 
But actually, you know, to be honest, I think some of that changed during the 10 years of his Alzheimer's too.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
DAVIS: Because I felt like there was, I had this sort of vast support system then as well.
 
COOPER: Yes. Patti Davis, thank you so much for being with us. I appreciate it.
 
DAVIS: Well, thank you. I appreciate it.
 
COOPER: I wish you well.

With more on what was an incredible love story. Here's Randi Kaye.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JIMMY CARTER, FMR PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: I knew that she was -- she was quiet. She was extremely intelligent. She was very timid by the way, beautiful. And there was just something about her that -- that -- 
 
OPRAH WINFREY, HOST: You're blushing.
 
J. CARTER: (INAUDIBLE) well I can't help it. RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jimmy Carter telling Oprah why he fell in love with his wife Rosalyn. The Carters grew up together in Plains, Georgia before tying the knot in 1946. Theirs was the longest marriage in the history of U.S. presidents. Seventy-seven years until Mrs. Carter's death in November 2023.
 
As President Carter told it he took her to a movie on their first date and was smitten.
 
J. CARTER: The next morning my mother asked me what did I do when I know had a family reunion? I said, well, I had a date. She said who'd you go with? I said Rosalynn Smith. She said what did you think of Rosalynn? I said she's the one I'm going to marry.
 
KAYE (voice-over): They married after he graduated the U.S. Naval Academy. He was 21, she was 19. Their decades-long marriage had its challenges but shared interests seemed to be the glue. Over the years they skied, fly-fished and bird-watched and read the Bible together every night. Both volunteered with Habitat for Humanity.
 
ROSALYNN CARTER, WIFE OF JIMMY CARTER: I'm going to talk a little bit about Jim and he's not going to like it.
 
That has never been any kind of damage at all to Jimmy Carter's heart. I knew he had a good heart.
 
KAYE (voice-over): On the campaign trail Jimmy Carter called his wife his secret weapon. Rosalynn reportedly visited 40 states during the 1976 presidential campaign. After her husband became president in 1977.
 
J. CARTER: I, Jimmy Carter do solemnly swear -- 
 
KAYE (voice-over): The Carters teamed up in the White House. When he lost his bid for re-election, they moved back to their same home in Plains, Georgia. In this interview, Barbara Walters wanted all the details.
 
BARBARA WALTERS, HOST: I don't how to ask this, so I'll just ask you. But do you sleep in the double bed or twin bed?
 
J. CARTER: Double bed.
 
R. CARTER: Double bed.
 
J. CARTER: (INAUDIBLE). Sometimes we sleep in a single bed -- bed, so much more comfortable having a double bed.
 
KAYE (voice-over): Rosalynn was by his side through it all, skin cancer that spread to his brain in 2015, a mass on his liver, a broken hip. Jimmy Carter credited his loving marriage as the reason he was otherwise in good health.
 
The Carter's certainly slowed down with age, but still enjoyed a full life with four children, 12 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. According to The Washington Post, the couple had a Saturday night routine of walking half a mile to a friend's home for dinner and a single glass of Chardonnay. They also managed to figure out what else it takes to keep their love alive.
 
J. CARTER: First of all, we give each other plenty of space to do our own thing.
 
KAYE (voice-over): If anything, their love only grew stronger. Jimmy Carter said marrying Rosalynn was the pinnacle of his life.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you look back, what are you most proud of?
 
J. CARTER: In my entire life's experience, I would say it was marrying my wife Rosalynn. She's been a very profound beneficial factor in my entire existence and still is.
