THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[14:30:00]
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: What DeSantis said in that news conference was that it was sort of adjacent to the governor's mansion. So that's certainly good news. No one injured. 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Joining us now is the deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, Jamie Rhome. 
 
Thank you so much for joining us. A busy day for you. 
 
It's still churning as we watch your radar screen through Georgia. It's weakened, as it does, when it makes landfall, but what are the remaining dangers as it passes and then up to South Carolina? 
 
JAMIE RHOME, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER: The focus now is shifting to this heavy rainfall threat that we have been talking about. You can really see it unfolding in the radar behind me. 
 
Look at the heavy rain just developing out in front of this system as it races across southern Georgia and South Carolina. This is going to fill in over the next several hours. 
 
You can already see the flood warnings coming with it as it moves over southern Georgia in the next couple of hours and into South Carolina. 
 
KEILAR: OK, as we talk about that, because obviously there are people who have been concerned on the coast but we're looking at those bands a little more inland there. 
 
What are you expecting? What are people needing to keep in mind? 
 
RHOME: I'm really concerned about this area here along I-20 from Augusta to Columbia. I think the heavy rain is going to just set up right in there and just going to get rainfall rates that are just so strong that you're just going to get immediate flooding as the center sort of pulls along. 
 
At the same time, you see the southerly wind wrapping around the east side. That's going to start shoving the ocean up these rivers in the form of storm surge. 
 
So these two forms of water are going to collide and produce very heavy rain and flood potential over eastern South Carolina. Then, ultimately, extending up into southeastern North Carolina. 
 
SCIUTTO: Is this the storm you expected when you were looking at this as we were discussing yesterday? And do we know yet? It's still moving through there. 
 
RHOME: We don't know yet. But what little bit I have seen from down here in Florida from this morning is, unfortunately, it materialized as forecast. 
 
KEILAR: As we expected. 
 
I also wonder, at this point in time, we're hearing from a lot of people who left the area, Jamie, which is great news, but there's still some people who decided to stay in that Big Bend area. 
 
We may not have heard from them because power is out. They are among the Floridians who power is out for, or people have not been able to get back to their homes in those areas. 
 
What are you expecting here in the coming hours as the high tide dissipates and people are able to get back and survey the damage? 
 
RHOME: So, immediately, we'll be trying to support search-and-rescue to enable them to get back into those communities as quickly but as safely as possible as the conditions start to subside on the backside of this system. 
 
And that is really urgent. It's imperative we get into these communities that are probably completely cut off. This is low-lying area. Some of these places are islands. 
 
So they are probably just completely cut off roads are impassable. So getting these first responders in fast to help anybody who stayed. 
 
SCIUTTO: Still a lot to learn about this storm, but we're just entering the peak of hurricane season and there are a lot of indicators these seasons are only going to get worse with the warming of the wears down south and so on. 
 
What do you expect? What are you predicting for the three months ahead? 
 
RHOME: We're still very much at the peak of hurricane season. September is typically our busiest month. So I think we still have a long ways to go and need everybody, all coastal residents to remain vigilant and prepared. 
 
KEILAR: Be vigilant and prepared. That warm water certainly there in the gulf is just intensifying everything. It doesn't cause the storms, as we have heard so many people say, Jamie, but it certainly makes it worse. 
 
Jamie Rhome, thank you so much for taking us through that. We appreciate it. 
 
RHOME: Thank you. [14:34:12]
 
SCIUTTO: Well, from the National Guard to the Coast Guard. Thousands have been deployed to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia. We'll have a live report from Gulfport, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [14:38:50]
 
KEILAR: Two men have died in Florida as a result of Hurricane Idalia, the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the Big Bend region in 125 years. Winds as strong as 125 miles per hour. 
 
You see what it did here near Perry, Florida. Powerful enough winds toppling a gas station structure. 
 
SCIUTTO: Perry is inland a little more than 15 miles northeast of the coast. 
 
Listen to what one resident, who lives right by the water, went through. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's hailing down there. The wind was blowing this morning about 80 miles an hour. The water, within 15 minutes, covered all of my yard. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: You said I've got to go? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got to go. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCIUTTO: Good to see folks were listening to the evacuation orders. 
 
Idalia is now barreling through Georgia. So much rain. About 300,000 households currently without power in both Florida and Georgia, but FEMA expects that number to rise. 
 
CNN's Carlos Suarez is in Gulfport, Florida. 
 
Carlos, it looks like folks are starting to come out and survey the damage. 
 <br>[14:40:01]
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly right, Jim. So right now, the cleanup effort is well underway here in Gulfport. We are in Pinellas County, just on the other side of Tampa Bay where there's still some flooding concerns for a part of this city. 
 
The mayor tells me they are still waiting for the water to recede so that officials get a clearer picture of the kind of damage that they are dealing with here. Jerry, if you can show them, just up the street from where we are
 
 along the coastline, you can see one emergency crew is out here on a pickup truck. They have been driving up and down further up the street out here. 
 
We're told some streets up there are pretty blocked off. Cars can't get in and out of that area. 
 
We are in Gulfport, parts of Pinellas County where we expect that a lot of this storm surge to take hold. It's what it was the one thing really that emergency officials across the Tampa Bay area and Pinellas County were worried about. 
 
They didn't want folks to be out here doing exactly what they are doing because, still, we're going to have all this water coming off the coastline out here. 
 
We have had a little bit of rain, although much of that has clear cleared. So officials really were just telling them to stay away from this part of town. 
 
We are still dealing with significant flooding. The mayor tells me that a lot of the damage does seem to have been more storm-surge related than anything else. 
 
There was one bridge that reopened earlier today connecting Pinellas County and Hillsborough County, which is home to the Tampa Bay area. 
 
But again, Brianna and Jim, right now, at least where we are, restaurants have started to open their doors, although they are not serving food. 
 
They are looking at the damage. They are sweeping some of the water and debris out, as this part of Pinellas County tries to get on with things considering the last 24 hours -- guys? 
 
KEILAR: Yes. Looking at the palm trees, you wouldn't even know a hurricane whipped through there. But you look at the street and see this was really a water event for Gulfport, Florida. 
 
Carlos, thank you so much for that report. 
 
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis confirming search-and-rescue teams have been deployed with help from the National Guard. 
 
We have CNN's Oren Liebermann live at the Pentagon for us. He has more on the military response to this. 
 
Oren, what can you tell us? 
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Brianna, Governor Ron DeSantis had thousands of Florida National Guards members ready to go ahead of the storm. 
 
That means they wait in armories throughout the state, waiting for the storm to pass until they can come out and see the damage and find out how they are needed. 
 
They can be used in any number of roles, from clearing trees to helping with power lines to helping local law enforcement with traffic or anything like that. It's really where they are needed. 
 
Because of the severity or the worry about the storm, Governor DeSantis made sure to have thousands of guard members on standby. 
 
Meanwhile, Governor Brian Kemp in Georgia also said he's put about 1,000 National Guards members from his state on standby depending on the damage there. So he, too, is ready for this. 
 
And if the damage is that severe in Georgia, there's the possibility, based on the agreement, to move some Florida guardsmen to Georgia or vice versa. They can help each other out.
 
The question, let's see where the damage is and find out where the National Guard is needed. 
 
Meanwhile, the Navy moved several ships and aircraft out of Florida, including out of a Mayport Naval Base outside of Jacksonville ahead of the storm. Those expected back later this week. 
 
And two commands based in Florida, U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command, moved some of their personnel to a different location just to get them away from the storms so they could essentially keep on operating.
 
Again, we'll keep you posted on when that's expected to come back to normal. 
 
But you can see how seriously the military is taking this, not only with the National Guard assistance for the expected recovery efforts, but also active duty being careful on where this is going to hit and how severe it could be -- Jim, Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: Oren, I just want to let our viewers know, as you stay with us, we're awaiting the president speaking here about Hurricane Idalia. He is focused very much today on the hurricane. 
 
Also he's focused on the recovery there in Hawaii, too. Big natural disasters that his administration is dealing with. 
 
But, Oren, as you see the military participating in these efforts, what are you expecting as this is a Georgia event now at this point in time? So what is sort of the long-term commitment there? 
 
LIEBERMANN: So, first, we have seen the military -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: Oren, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry to interrupt you, Oren, but for the president. 
 
But let's listen to President Biden at the White House. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I made a point to speak to
 
 all the governors most likely to be impacted by the storm. I spoke with Governor DeSantis several times, Governor Kemp, Governor McMaster, Governor Cooper about the impacts of the storm.
 
And it made landfall at 7:45 this morning as a category 3 hurricane. And it's moved over land. It's now shifted to category 1, but it's still very dangerous with winds up to 75 miles per hour. 
 <br>[14:45:07]
 
And the impacts of the storm are being felt throughout the southeast. Even as it moves up the eastern coast of the United States, affecting Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina.
 
And we have to remain vigilant. There's much more to do. 
 
I just came from the Oval Office, where I met with the FEMA administrator, who is standing to my left here, and our federal response folks. 
 
Early Monday morning, long before the storm made landfall, I spoke with Governor Ron DeSantis and approved an early request for an emergency declaration to enable him to have the full support ahead of time to protect the people's lives of the state of Florida. 
 
I resurged personnel to Florida to help the state move people to safety and out of the danger zone. And to help the governor and his team to the greatest degree possible in advance and in advance of the hurricane's arrival. 
 
And I directed the FEMA to redeploy resources, including up to 1,500 personnel and 900 Coast Guard personnel throughout the southeast. 
 
I directed the Administrator Criswell to stay in close touch with the governor. She was with me when I was speaking to him as well. He may be tired of hearing from us, but he seemed like he welcomed it. 
 
As a matter of fact, I've asked that she get on a plane and leave for Florida this afternoon. She will meet with Governor DeSantis tomorrow and help conduct the federal assessment at my direction. 
 
Federal teams on the ground are going to continue to work with the first responders in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, to get people to safety. 
 
You have all been reporting this and seeing it on television, a number of rescues already taking place, as I walked out of my office a moment ago to begin to recover from the impacts of the storm. 
 
I let each governor I spoke with know, if there's anything, anything the state ss need right now, I'm ready to mobilize that support with what they need. 
 
I don't think anybody can deny the impact of a climate crisis anymore. Just look around. Historic floods, more intense droughts, extreme heat, significant wildfires have caused significant damage like we have never seen before, not only throughout the Hawaiian Islands but in Canada and other parts of the world. We have never seen this much fire. 
 
While we're dealing with this latest extreme weather event, I remain laser focused on the recovery and rebuilding efforts in Maui. We were out there and many of you were there. It's devastating what happened there.
 
When I took office, I directed my team to raise our game in how we lead and coordinate our responses to natural disasters. Because I have been around awhile and I have known how these function, to ensure we met people where they are when they need our help the most. 
 
Because of the devastation of wildfires from California to Mexico, Oregon, Washington State or Idaho, Louisiana, we have learned a heck of a lot. A lot of damage in the meantime. We have learned a heck of a lot. We are putting the lessons we learned to work. 
 
And in a few moments, I'm going to meet with my entire cabinet in the next room over who are leading the federal recovery in rebuilding efforts to report on their progress in providing urgently needed support for the people Maui. 
 
If I can note for just a moment, when you have your home washed away, when you are -- a fire that's taken your home away, when your school has been destroyed and you can't send your kids to school, these are urgent needs. 
 
And no matter how bright and informed and how wealthy or poor they are, you just need reassurance. How in god's name are we going to get through this? 
 
We'll Jill and I saw the devastation in Maui firsthand. 
 
I want to thank Governor Josh Green, who is doing a hell of a job, along with their congressional delegation, and for everything they are doing to support the recovery effort. 
 
I directed my team to do everything we can for as long as it takes to help Maui recover, rebuild in a way that respects and honors Hawaiian traditions and cultures and the needs of a local community.
 
We're not going to turn this into a land grab. We're not trying to see mobile homes on the beach. We want to restore that part of the island like it was before. Only better. 
 
To that end, when I was on the island last week, I appointed Bob Fenton, one of the leading emergency managers -- and I mean that, not as hyperbole -- who has been on the ground in Hawaii since before the fires erupted as our chief federal response coordinator to lead our long-term recovery on Maui. 
 <br>[14:50:11]
 
I have charged him with making sure the community does everything the government can offer to heal, to build back better as fast as possible. He will be giving me a report on Maui when I walk out of this room and go to the cabinet room. 
 
And as an example of our commitment, we're not only building back, but we're going to build back stronger and more resilient, which means we need to be ready to withstand any challenge coming our way in rebuilding the way Maui wants to rebuild. 
 
Today I'm announcing $95 million from the bipartisan infrastructure law is on the way to Hawaii to harden the ground power, harden the grid. 
 
I know when we start talking about the grid, the average American thinks, what are we talking about? The ability to transmit electricity. 
 
Let me tell you what it means. It means investments to make sure electricity can continue to reach homes, hospitals, water stations, even during intense storms and extreme weather. 
 
Funding will be used for stronger, better poles holding up the wires that transmit the electricity. It will mean stronger material. 
 
It means burying these lines that transmit the electricity underground. It's more expensive to do that, but we're positive we should put them underground. They are safest. 
 
It means clearing brush. Like the kindling that exists out there. That's what it ends up being when one of the wires comes down. 
 
This is going to pay for installing technology like smart meters that can tell you where the problem actually is when the line goes down. 
 
That's part of the problem. A lot of these -- Maui is not that big, but in parts of California, Oregon, where did the wire go down. 
 
We're going to be installing meters to let the person sitting back at headquarters know it went down at such and such coordinates to quickly identify which lines are damaged or down so repairs can happen as quickly as possible and prevent damage from occurring. 
 
Anything else at our disposal and the Department of Energy -- Secretary we're going to be talking about this in a minute -- accelerated the announcement of this funding to meet the moment. 
 
All this can help Maui and the entire state of Hawaii better withstand future disasters. 
 
I've watched some of you folks standing in front of me on television in dangerous circumstances reporting on the stuff. You know it. 
 
It's one thing to look at it on television and hear someone else report, but you're standing there and you're wondering, whoa, what's that behind me. It makes a difference. We have done it before. 
 
Under the Obama and Biden administration, we invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the state of Florida, replacing wooden power poles and steel poles and buried these electric lines. 
 
I wonder what happened now, if we hadn't done that. I'm not sure. But the point is, we did it. 
 
It helped withstand and recover from disasters more quickly. It costs a lot of money, but it works. It saves a lot of money long-term. 
 
When Jill and I visited Maui last week, we saw firsthand the magnitude of the loss. Lives had been dramatically changed. 
 
If anyone in Maui is listening, you lost everything. I mean, they lost everything. 
 
We're doing everything we can to move heaven and earth to help you recover, rebuild and return to your lives. 
 
We have already dedicated $24 million to removal of hazardous material left behind in the fire's wake. Pollution is that material. A lot of that, you can't just go in and take bulldozers and clear it all out. You have to take the bad stuff out. You have to take out the polluted, dangerous stuff.
 
Once we have done that, we'll be able to move all of the debris. But it's going to be frustrating for people. They say, why can't I go back and look and see if I can find that wedding ring or that album? I can't find that thing I lost in the house. It's really tough. Really, really tough.
 
I didn't have anything like that but lightning struck my house. We had to be out of that house for about seven months because so much damage was done to the house. Half the house almost collapsed. And you wonder what's going to happen. 
 <br>[14:55:05]
 
We have already dedicated $400 million to pay for the debris removal. Once we get the toxic stuff out to take all the removal. And the federal government is going to pay for that. The state is not paying for that. We're going to dedicate more, if necessary. 
 
But you want to be clear with the people of Maui about what to expect. The work we're doing is going to take time. In some cases, a long time. We're going to do it in a way to make sure we're respectful to the wishes and the traditions of the people of Hawaii as well. 
 
The process of removing hazardous material and cleaning the environmental damage means folks can't get become in the area right away. The start of school has been disrupted. It's painful. I get it. What can I tell you? 
 
The one thing I can tell you is we're going to be with you every step of the way. We're not walking away. 
 
When Jill and I visited, we were struck by the courage of the people there. People who lost loved ones, lost everything. People are just trying to find out whether the ones they lost are gone
 
 or dead or missing. Are they just not accountable? Where are they? They have lost everything. 
 
Everywhere we turned, we saw and felt the aloha spirit. Neighbors helping neighbors. I mean, I know this sounds kind of corny but it's true. It's true.
 
Everybody is reaching out, trying to help the other guy. Turning pain into purpose. Keeping the faith. 
 
I've instructed my administration to continue working with urgency and focus to help the people of Maui on their journey to recovery and healing. And we're going to make sure you are healed and you're in better shape than before. 
 
I said when I was on the island last week, we're not leaving until the job is done. And we'll be there as long as it takes. 
 
I know there's a lot of questions you probably have. I'll take a few, but I have a cabinet meeting coming up right away. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Can you assure Americans that the federal government is going to have the emergency funding that they need to get through this hurricane season? 
 
BIDEN: The answer is, if I can't do that, I'm going to point out why. How can we not respond? My god. How can we not respond to these needs? 
 
So I'm confident, even though there's a lot of talk from some of our friends up on the Hill about the cost, we have to do it. This is the United States of America. 
 
Yes?
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Governor Ron DeSantis is also running for president. You are running for reelection. Do you sense any politics in your conversations with him about this issue? 
 
BIDEN: No, believe it or not, I know that sounds strange, especially how the nature of politics today, but I was down there with the last major storm. I spent a lot of time with him walking from village to community to community, making sure he had what he needed to get it done. 
 
I think he trusts my judgment and my desire to help. And I trust him to be able to suggest that this is not about politics. It's about taking care of the people of the state. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: On the hurricane, in your conversations with the governors, is there anything that you heard from them that gives you pause? Things that need to be there that are not there yet? 
 
And, secondly, are you making any contingency plans on your own schedule either with this Labor Day for your own personal travels and your international travels that are coming up next week in case you need to reshuffle things? 
 
BIDEN: Well, I may. I just don't know yet. 
 
First of all, each of the governors seem to be focused. I think what's changing, particularly the governors from North Carolina and South Carolina and Georgia, is there wasn't an anticipation that it would be moving up the coast. 
 
They were hopeful. And initially, it looked like it was going to go further east and not affect them. 
 
So I think they are all in the process of rapidly focusing on what may happen, what may not happen. 
 
And what I hope the people of those states listen to is the warnings when they come from -- I mean, a lot of it -- they may not see 130- mile-an-hour winds coming through. But guess what? You may also be on the shore of a low-lying area and have an eight-foot surge, wind surge coming from off the ocean. 
 
But they seem -- they have all went through it. The guy furthest north, Cooper, Governor Cooper, he's really focused on it.
 
I mean, they all are. I don't mean to pick. But he is the least likely to have the most impact occurring on his shores. But there's a lot of low-lying country. 
 <br>[14:59:59]
 
I was joking with him. I mean, my state, if you have anything like a hurricane in my state, in Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland, we're three feet above sea level.</pre>
