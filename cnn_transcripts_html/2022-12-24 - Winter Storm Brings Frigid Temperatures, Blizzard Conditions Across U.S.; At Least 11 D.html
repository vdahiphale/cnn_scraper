COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: He had 894, but who knows? We'll see if he can pull it off. 
 
MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR: So, the winning, the winning football coach, they get dosed with chicken soup, is that it? 
 
WIRE: That would actually be awesome, kind of thing, we never did that -- but yes, the hot chicken broth. I looked over one time Marty, and players on the sidelines using it to warm their hands like a hot sick. That's how cold it was.
 
SAVIDGE: Well, good to hear from you. Merry Christmas. 
 
WIRE: You too. 
 
SAVIDGE: I think that's --
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN ANCHOR: That's good -- oh, sorry, Martin, go ahead.
 
SAVIDGE: Yes, I was just going to the next hour of CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.
 
WILD: All right. Good morning, and welcome to CNN THIS MORNING. I'm Whitney Wild. 
 
SAVIDGE: And I'm Martin Savidge. A massive winter storm, it's blanketing the U.S. It's leaving thousands without power and it's, of course, making a mess of holiday travel. Live pictures right now. Take a look at Buffalo where a blizzard warning is still in effect, it will be until tomorrow morning. All of the impacts and when we could see some relief, that's coming up.
 
WILD: The January 6th Committee laying blame for the insurrection squarely at the feet of former President Donald Trump. The key takeaways from that 845-page report coming up, and the potential legal implications, we explain all of that soon.
 
SAVIDGE: Plus, flu cases. They are rising across the country but medication to treat the virus could be hard to come by. The steps the Biden administration is taking to try to combat that travel.
 
WILD: And a devastating setback for girls and women in Afghanistan as the Taliban exercises its power. That's ahead on CNN THIS MORNING.
 
Good morning and welcome to CNN THIS MORNING. It's Saturday, December 24th. We begin with the frigid and frustrating start to this holiday weekend, more than 200 million Americans are under windchill alerts with an arctic blast, delivering freezing temperatures, powerful winds and heavy snow and ice. 
 
High winds produced dangerous windshield readings across the United States. Cities from the Midwest to the East Coast are experiencing their coldest Christmas Eve in decades. And this week, in Wyoming, wind chills dropped for two -- this is going to shock you -- to negative 75 degrees. And in parts of Alaska, the winds are gusting over 50 miles per hour.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The weather in general, I, I -- weather, today, in general is really challenging.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SAVIDGE: That's an insult that across the country snow, ice and powerful winds caused a multi vehicle crashes are causing them and its left drivers stranded on roads and highways, many have spent hours in freezing conditions. Now, officials in four states are blaming the winter storm for at least 11 deaths and they are reminding drivers that if you don't need to travel, don't go. Stay off the roads. 
 
But it is not just snow and ice. In New Jersey, and several coastal cities across the northeast, the storm brought major flooding. This morning, about 840,000 homes and businesses are without power. And utility companies in Tennessee have ordered rolling blackouts to try to manage the power demands. The storm knocked out electricity to more than a million customers nationwide on Friday.
 
WILD: Meanwhile, air travelers are bracing for another day of frustration. This morning, nearly 1500 U.S. flights are already canceled. That comes a day after 5700 flights were canceled nationwide, Friday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
TRISHA QUIGLEY, STRANDED IN SEATTLE: Every solution we went to, we can reach anyone. I stayed on hold actually for eight hours today and then was disconnected, that wasn't fun. 
 
Super frustrating because you know there's nothing they can do and there's nothing we can do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WILD: It's so difficult and it feels like it always happens at the holidays. So, let's go now to Polo Sandoval in Buffalo, New York where the winter storm is bringing heavy snow and subzero wind chills. So, Polo officials they're saying don't take any chances, don't go on the road. What do you see?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, resist the, the urge to head out to see your loved ones this Christmas if you live in and around Buffalo. That's a message that we're hearing here on the ground from authorities. That wind chill, negative 13 -- I almost have to stand at an angle here, because if not, that wind hits you in the face like a thousand needles and it's a stinging sensation. You guys have experienced snow storms. 
 
Now, in terms of the situation on the ground here, I have to say, visibility has actually improved, but that's just a little bit of good news because at the end of the day, you're still looking at these just horrendous wind gusts. Yesterday, a wind gusts of 79 miles an hour confirmed by the National Weather Service Office here in Buffalo. That surpassed that of the wind gusts back in the blizzard of 1977. So, authorities are not kidding when they say that this is an extraordinary storm even for Western Buffalo. 
 <br>[07:05:00]
 
But you can kind of, you, you don't know -- you can even listen to the wind, you can even see the snow being whipped around and this is why authorities are warning people to stay home. Here in Buffalo, travel ban, driving ban, all still in place. And unfortunately, there were some reports last night of many, many, many vehicles stranded, could be as many as 250 vehicles stranded in and around buffalo. 
 
So, authorities basically spent all night. They started their Christmas Eve going from one vehicle to another, making sure that people are, in fact, safe. But really, this, these are the conditions are going to continue throughout much of today. They don't expect -- the forecast does not call for any sort of significant improvement, potentially until tomorrow morning here in Buffalo. Guys, back to you.
 
SAVIDGE: All right. Polo, try to stay warm. Thanks very much for that. Of course, this is one of the busiest travel periods of the year, but widespread weather delays are making it very difficult for some people to get home in time for Christmas.
 
WILD: CNN's Omar Jimenez is at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with more.
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Whitney and Martin, the travel situation, especially flying just hasn't been great. We've already seen more than 5200 flights canceled across the U.S. over the course of Friday, and that's on top of the around 9000 flights that have been delayed. And of course, all of it coming just in the final stretch leading up to Christmas, the crucial moments where people would be trying to get to loved ones. 
 
But it's just because of these winter conditions being so intense in some places; it's part of why Buffalo's airport said that they were going to shut down over the course of Friday night, canceling all flights, essentially and operations. And that's because they were seeing wind gusts approaching hurricane force level winds close to the 70 miles per hour in that range, at the very least. And in other places, including here, in Chicago, we've seen dozens and dozens, if not hundreds of flight cancellations. 
 
O'Hare, around 500 flight cancellations on Friday, including one passenger we caught up with who told us that now the earliest flight she can get rescheduled to her final destination is on Christmas. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BELLA DELA TORRE, TRAVELER: So, we were just anticipating to see cancel on our flight, but it kept on saying green on time. And so, we got here, went through security, checked our bags. And then about a half hour before boarding began, we actually got a notification from the United app that the flight was canceled. It's no surprise that this would happen, it's just unfortunate that this is how this weekend is going to go.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JIMENEZ: And while flights haven't been great, driving has been difficult for many people as well in some locations, visibility has been an issue but also extremely low temperatures, high winds also have complicated things for people. And again, all that happening and what is typically one of the highest traveled times of the year in any year. And of course, this winter system, just complicating all of it at maybe the worst possible time. Again, just right before Christmas, as people are trying to get to their loved ones. Martin, Whitney.
 
WILD: Omar Jimenez, thank you. The severe weather is bringing high winds, cold temperatures to most of the country. And it's disrupting, again as Omar said, holiday travel plans for thousands of people. So, our last check in here is that about 1500 flights have been cancelled. More than a thousand are delayed. Yesterday, there were more than 5900 flights canceled and another 10,000 delayed.
 
SAVIDGE: The head of the storm airlines did begin granting waivers and encouraging travelers to reschedule, but what happens if that wasn't enough to save your travel plans? Joining us now is a person who certainly has some good advice: Katy Nastro, and she's a travel expert with Scott's Cheap Flights. Morning to you, Katie.
 
KATY NASTRO, TRAVEL EXPERT: Morning. Thanks so much for having me. 
 
SAVIDGE: You bet. And what should anyone who is, let's say, hoping to get on a flight in the next couple of days be aware of?
 
NASTRO: Well, look -- I mean, this was really unprecedented historic past few days. You know, just for some context over Memorial Day weekend of this year, we saw only 2500 cancellations over that four- day period. Yesterday alone, I saw almost 6000. So, this is just a really hectic time period for all involved. 
 
So, the next few days for all of the travelers that have gotten rebooked and the people that were traveling that day in general, just know that flights are going to be packed, more so than they typically would over the holiday itself, which we actually see traveled down a bit when it's the holiday itself because people have already gotten to their destinations. 
 
This year, that's not the case. And we can see people getting rebooked well into next week and unfortunately, having to just maybe celebrate your holidays a little bit later.
 
WILD: So, what kind of backup plan can you have in place? Because the weather is so bad. It's not like you can just hop in the car and say, OK, well I'm going to drive five hours, 10 hours whatever, so what can you do?
 <br>[07:10:05]
 
NASTRO: Sure. Honestly, I mean as a traveler if you do have to fly, know that you know because of the winter weather waivers, regardless of your ticket, you are entitled to get rebooked on a flight for no additional cost. So, you should not be paying anything additional to get to where you're going, even if it is a few days later. And honestly, the biggest and best backup plan in this scenario, get your travel, travel credit from your ticket and try to travel in January and February, when honestly, flights are up to 80 percent cheaper than they are at the end of December time period anyway. So, you know, potentially you take the whole family way, and do the winter holidays in January and February, versus having that one ticket credit -- you could take the whole family way instead,
 
SAVIDGE: And have the rules changed that airlines have to follow. And if so, I mean, as a traveler, what do I have to do to try to make sure that the airlines keep to those rules?
 
NASTRO: Sure. So, I think first and foremost, as a traveler, you should know that under federal law, you are entitled to a full cash refund in or out of the airline's control. So, in this scenario, weather being out of our control, out of the airline's control, if an airline cancels or significantly delays your flight, so you get a cash flow -- you're entitled to a cash refund or a rebooked flight, regardless, end of story, no matter what. So, that's something that you can feel in confidence, regardless of the policies that vary by airline to airline, that you are entitled to a new flight or a full cash refund in this scenario.
 
WILD: It's so difficult because even you know, if you get a voucher, and you take it later in the week, like this is your time off from work. So, you know, you can't, a lot of people can just tell their employer like, hey, well, sorry, I couldn't make my flights and now I'm going to take my vacation a week later. So, so what can you do to make the most of those flight vouchers? Is it something that you should just, you know, say, OK, the holidays didn't go as planned? Now, I'm going to take a trip in April, June, October, what can you do?
 
NASTRO: Yes, honestly, just exactly what you just mentioned there, Whitney. I mean, take that flight credit and look to travel in an off- peak season. You know, potentially wait until the shoulder season like in April where, you know, the chance of having a weather disruption goes down by quite a bit. Or, you know, you take that credit and apply it to a flight in January and February when it is an off-peak season and flights are significantly cheaper. 
 
And you know, you're not dealing with the hordes of people that are in airports because it is an off-peak season. People don't tend to travel as much; travel is not top of mind. So yes, unfortunately, I wish I had better news in saying that maybe just waiting to travel is your best, your best-case scenario for this time period, unfortunately.
 
SAVIDGE: Yes, Katy Nastro, it's not necessarily the news everyone wants to hear, but it is good advice and we thank you for joining us.
 
NASTRO: Thanks so much for having me. Happy holidays.
 
SAVIDGE: And to you. For more on the hardest hit areas, we're talking weather, let's bring in meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, live from the CNN Weather Center. And Allison, what do you have your eye on now? Hopefully, warmer temperatures at some point?
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, I would say look to next week because we will finally start to see a lot of these temperatures rebound now. For some places, that rebound begins today. Cities like Denver, Dallas, New Orleans will finally start to get those temperatures back above freezing once we get to later today. But for a lot of other areas, especially along the eastern portion of the country, it's likely going to be early next week before we really see those temperatures rebound closer to normal. 
 
But for today, still a lot of wind chill warnings still a lot of wind chill advisories out there, the actual temperature right now in Chicago is only one that with the windchill of minus 20. Again, Nashville's temperature right now is still only seven degrees. So, even places far south, you're still dealing with those very cold temperatures, but it's also the wind. Buffalo, sustained wind, that means consistent wind of 31 miles per hour gusting up to 47. New York, 25 mile per hour sustained wind gusting up to 33. Even Detroit seeing some gusts up around 40 miles per hour. 
 
The thing is, when you take that wind and you mix it with the snow, you're likely to get some blizzard conditions, especially when you're talking those winds in excess of 30 to 35 miles per hour. So, you still have some of these winter weather advisories, blizzard warnings and even winter storm warnings. But the snow for today is really going to be isolated to the Great Lakes region. So, you've got some snow showers across areas of Michigan, portions of Ohio, same thing for upstate New York. 
 
And New York is really where we're going to see the highest snowfall totals going forward. Everywhere else, you're talking likely two to six inches of additional snowfall today, but it's upstate New York right there along Lake Erie in Ontario where you could even pick up an additional one to two feet of snow on top of what they've already had. Here's a look at the high temperatures for today. Yes, the high in Minneapolis is three but it will start to warm up in the coming days. Again, Dallas looking at 36, New Orleans, 37; Denver 42 -- so we're
 
 starting to see that warming trend in some of these cities and that will gradually continue as we make our way into next week. Look at all of these above average temperatures finally starting to swing back. The unfortunate thing is for most folks, it's not going to be until Wednesday of the upcoming week, but I promise it is there. Just get through your white Christmas and you will finally have some warmer temperatures to start the new year.
 <br>[07:15:24] 
 
WILD: All right. Allison Chinchar, thank you.
 
SAVIDGE: And coming up later this hour, we've got some tips to winterize your home and your vehicle during this brutal cold.
 
WILD: The January 6th Committee releases its final report laying blame for the insurrection directly on former President Donald Trump. The potential legal implications ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WILD: Good morning and welcome back to CNN this morning. The house January 6th committee released new transcripts from interviews with more than 40 witnesses. They include testimony from key figures in the Trump administration, and that includes Attorney General Bill Barr, White House Lawyer Pat Cipollone, Communications Director Hope Hicks, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and the President's own daughter, Ivanka Trump. This comes on the heels of the panel's long awaited final report after nearly 18 months of investigation that concluded that Trump was principally responsible for the riot at the capital. 
 
Joining us now to discuss is former Federal Prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig. He also served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy for Homeland Security and as a Senior Counsel on the Whitewater investigation. So, intimately familiar with a lot of angles that this report presents. So, there are so many headlines here that have come out of this report. It's 845 pages, so much information to comb through. But when you look at it, from your perspective, what is the biggest headline here?
 
PAUL ROSENZWEIG, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, with the caveat that nobody could possibly have fully read all 845 pages overnight, it strikes me that the biggest real headlines are the depths of information about the actual activities of Donald Trump and his closest confederates: Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani.
 <br>[07:20:15]
 
Particularly with respect to the scheme to have fake electors sent from the states false electors sent from the states and with the scheme to try and pressure, Georgia and now we know Arizona and Michigan elected representatives to try and change the rules after the election and steal those states for Trump. That kind of depth of detail is really quite damning. We knew about these things in advance, but we didn't know the depths of the activity.
 
WILD: How does this report help, help or hinder DOJ's own investigation into the events of January 6th? I mean, is it helpful in that they have a wealth of information to draw from, is it more difficult because it presents a new political weight to it? How do you see this impacting DOJ as they move forward? 
 
ROSENZWEIG: Well, yes, to both of those, of course, and of course, the, the legal answer is that it doesn't mean anything one way or the other. I actually think though, that in the end, it has a, an impulsive effect on the Department of Justice, which is to say that if it's doing the job, right, and I think they are, the Department of Justice is trying to assess the nature and the seriousness of this offense. And no matter what you think of the process, whether you think it was too political or not. 
 
The depth and breadth of the information gathered, demonstrates that the seriousness of this offense, its nature was truly significant, truly unique in American history. And by laying that all out for the public, to see, it increases, I think the likelihood that the Department of Justice, looking at the same set of facts will reach the conclusion that that I've reached, which is that this is one of the most significant criminal activities of my lifetime, for sure, and possibly in the history of the nation. And that will lead, I think, to bring charges if they can prove them.
 
WILD: All right, turning now to the transcripts from the witnesses that the committee has released, could any of those present a potential legal action against Trump or others in his orbit for, you know, a list of, a list of potential crimes? I mean, it seems like there were a lot of issues raised for example, Cassidy Hutchinson testified, she was advised by her lawyer to withhold information from committee investigators. How do you see those transcripts impacting potential investigations and potential charges into former President Trump?
 
ROSENZWEIG: Well, I think their biggest influence really is that it increases the likelihood of cooperation amongst some of those witnesses. We saw, for example, testimony that suggested that Mark Meadows might have promised a job or action on behalf of somebody like Cassidy Hutchinson, if she testified the right way. That is a potentially obstructive act. And that increases the possibility that Mr. Meadows himself might be charged, which in turn increases the possibility that he would agree to cooperate more fully with the Department of Justice. 
 
We always say that it's not the crime, it's the cover up. And in this instance, much of the cover up is collateral, I think, to the actual crime, the riot, the insurrection, we attempt to obstruct Congress, but it will provide levers of opportunity for the Department of Justice, to secure the truthful testimony of some of the witnesses close to Trump who have thus far been unwilling to testify.
 
WILD: All right, Paul Rosenzweig. Thank you.
 
ROSENZWEIG: Thank you. SAVIDGE: And we're continuing to track this massive winter storm and
 
 springing plunging temperatures and treacherous conditions across the United States. Take a look a live look, actually, right now in Chicago where it is just one, that's right, one degree outside and we're not factoring in the wind chill. 
 <br>[07:24:07]
 
Next, how to protect yourself and your home from this bitter cold?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SAVIDGE: All right now let's take a look at the other top stories that are making news this morning. A massive $1.7 trillion spending bill to fund critical government agencies now headed to President Biden's desk. The House passed it Friday along with a one-week funding measure that averted the government shutdown yesterday. 
 
Biden signed that short term bill which provides enough time for the year-long measure to be formally processed and sent to the President. The spending bill includes $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine, and about 40 billion for emergency disaster relief. It also includes a measure to ban TikTok from federal devices and an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election. 
 
A jury in Los Angeles has convicted rapper and singer, Tory Lanez, on three counts related to the July 2020 shooting a fellow rapper, Meghan Thee Stallion. Megan said Lanez shot her in both her feet after she got out of a car following an argument. Lanez could be sentenced to more than 20 years in prison and possibly deported back to his native, Canada. 
 
This morning, more than 175 million people across the US are under wind chill alerts. We're going to show you a live look now at Buffalo, New York. That has been one of the areas that has been hardest impacted. The National Guard has already been deployed to assist with potentially life-threatening conditions. And the forecast calls for up to four feet of snow and your hurricane force winds. 
 
The storm is also bringing life threatening cold to almost the entire nation. The elderly and young children especially are most at risk. But the truth is anyone's susceptible. CNN's Tom Foreman is at the magic wall to share some tips on how to stay warm and stay safe in your home and how best to prepare yourself if you need to leave.
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If you are in one of these areas of severe weather, make sure you wrap or cover any exposed pipes and let the taps trickle. Remember the pipes of the back of your washing machine, underneath the sink. Open those cabinet doors get some warmth for them. Find the main water shut off because when things start thawing, if you have a leak, you want to make sure it doesn't come all through your house with no way to stop it. 
 <br>[07:30:02] Keep the heat in. Don't open the doors unnecessarily, block, drafty windows and doors, stuff a towel in there, something. Don't just let the heat get away that you've paid for and you're trying to keep your house warm with.
 
Fireplaces and stoves are pretty much ineffective. Fireplaces don't put that much heat into the room. Stoves are actually a dangerous way to do this because possible carbon monoxide risks.
 
Same thing for generators. If you have power go out, get those away from the house out of the garage. You need some separation so you don't have carbon monoxide issues and space heaters. Look out for any kind of fire danger too close your curtains, things like that.
 
And have your food, water, flashlights, and warm clothing ready. Know exactly where it is. Don't go fishing around in the dark when the power goes off, be ready to do it now.
 
If you have to go outside, full tank, full phone, plus emergency supplies ready in your car now. Have that so that you can get to that easily and be safe when you go out.
 
Make sure your windows and lights are completely clear to snow and ice. Drive slowly, brake gently, yes to your headlights on, no to cruise control on. This is not good on snow and ice.
 
Don't pass ploughs or emergency vehicles. They may be slow but in front of them is going to be more dangerous from where you are.
 
Give other people plenty of room. They can't drive any better than you can in these conditions and stay in your vehicle if you get stranded in most cases. You're safer in there than trying to step outside where those crushing temperatures will get after you fast, which brings us to the subject of you going outside.
 
First of all, stay sheltered. Try not to, but if you have to, wear sufficient clothing, plus shoes and boots with good traction. There's an old saying, there is no such thing as cold weather just people who don't know how to dress for cold weather. So, make sure you are dressed for it.
 
Use handrails if you're near them so you don't fall. Do not overexert yourself. People have heart attacks every year out there trying to shovel snow or chip away eyes. Take it easy, realize that you're exerting a lot just by moving through that environment.
 
And most of all, limit exposure. Don't stay out there long. If you have to be out there, make it short, do what you have to do, and get back into safety.
 
SAVIDGE: Good advice. Thank you very much, Tom.
 
With an early and severe flu season straining resources, the Biden administration now moving to make access to a key medicine easier. We'll explain next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:35:36]
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING. This use -- this year's flu season hit hard and it hit early, straining resources across the country.
 
So, the Biden administration is stepping in to help states struggling to keep up with the patient surge.
 
SAVIDGE: CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen explains how the health department is now offering up a vital medicine from the national stockpile.
 
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: In light of this year's intense flu season, the Biden administration is offering up access to the Strategic National Stockpile.
 
They're calling states and saying, if you don't have enough in your own stockpiles, you can have access to the national stockpile.
 
Now, it's not known it's not been said that there's any kind of big national shortage of Tamiflu, which is an antiviral use to treat flu.
 
But some pharmacists have said that they've had trouble getting access to the generic version. So, let's take a look at what flu is looking like in the United States.
 
All of these states in red and orange and purple. That means flu is at very high or high levels. There are only five states where flu is not at a very high or a high level. So far this season, there have been at least 150,000 hospitalizations with the flu, and at least 9,300 deaths.
 
Not only has the flu season been severe, but it's been very early. The numbers were very, very high in November and continue to be high in December.
 
And there may be some places, hospitals, or pharmacies that weren't quite ready to be seeing this kind of demand on medications this early in the season.
 
Back to you.
 
SAVIDGE: Thank you, Elizabeth.
 
This year, the holiday season is also unprecedented for the reason of respiratory viruses. According to the CDC, all the five states are experiencing high or very high respiratory virus activity. So far this season, at least 18 million people have had the flu. 12,000 have died because of it.
 
COVID is on the rise again, hospitalizations are up nearly 50 percent over the past month. And there is some good news though. RSV rates have slowed and the hospitalizations have dropped over the last month. Joining me now to discuss is Dr. Syra Madad, epidemiologist, and senior director of System-wide Special Pathogens program, New York City Health and Hospitals.
 
Good morning to you.
 
DR. SYRA MADAD, SENIOR DIRECTOR, SYSTEM-WIDE SPECIAL PATHOGENS PROGRAM, NEW YORK CITY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS: Good morning. Thanks for having me on.
 
SAVIDGE: You know, we have reported earlier that the Biden administration is, of course, giving states the ability to use state and federal Tamiflu stockpiles. And I'm wondering, is the shortage really that serious? And is it possibly an indication they're expecting the worst to come?
 
MADAD: Yes. The great question, so, as you know, we've heard from Elizabeth, we are seeing a confluence of multiple different respiratory viruses. So, flu, COVID-19, and RSV being the top three.
 
And what's happening is that because for example, with flu, and even with RSV, we're seeing these rates much higher this time of year.
 
You know, the manufacturer and distributors weren't anticipating this high of a demand. And that's where you're seeing some of the spot national shortages of the suspension of also time of year.
 
And amoxicillin was also, I think, worrisome that if you go to some of these major pharmacy chains, like CVS and Walgreens, there is, you know, disruption to over the counter pain relieving and fever reducing medication for children.
 
But it's important, this is not a shortage of these medications, it's just a demand issue. And so, there is limitations happening right now. So, this is real.
 
It's playing a crowd -- playing, you know, across the United States, but if these are in certain locations, that's not all states.
 
And so, what's important, is that if you are sick, make sure you secure your healthcare provider to see what medication is right for you.
 
SAVIDGE: You know, obviously, if you're a parent of a sick child, you're under a great deal of stress, not being able to find the medicines, especially over the counter, as you just outlined, what's a parent to do? What can you try to do? Is there any way to supplement?
 
MADAD: Yes. So, I'm a parent of three myself. So, I totally understand what parents are feeling, especially if you go to the pharmacy, and you're looking to get Tylenol for your child and you don't see it on the shelf.
 
So, it certainly is nerve racking. And it's a -- it's a scary situation. So, what I would say is, number one, if your child has a fever, not all fevers actually require medication. So, certainly, talk to your pediatrician.
 
And then, if you can't find it on medication, there are alternatives. And as I mentioned, these are spot shortages. So, one pharmacy may not have it, you may well have to go to drive to another pharmacy to see if they have this medication.
 <br>[07:40:02]
 
But just be in contact with your health care provider and see what other alternatives are there for you.
 
The one thing that I also mentioned is that you know, with this holiday season, and many individuals coming together, it's just really important that if you're sick, don't be around others. Stay home.
 
SAVIDGE: And that was my very next question, which is, you know, what should we be doing at a time like this? You mentioned, you know, if you're sick, don't go.
 
But if you're not sick, should we wear masks again? Should we get back into the routine we were at when we were in the thick of COVID?
 
MADAD: Yes. So, when we talk about reducing our risk of all these different respiratory viruses. And the good thing is that all these different measures that I'm going to mention, work against all these retroviruses.
 
So, masking is a really, really great strategy. And it's not all or nothing, right? So, people think, well, either I'm going to wear it or I'm not going to wear it at all.
 
We talked about masking. What's important is that during high risk activities, like when you're traveling, when you're around a lot of people, when you're indoor crowded situations, take that mask out your pocket, and put it on.
 
Certainly, get tested before any major gatherings. You want to make sure you're not, you know, bringing home a virus to your grandma or your -- or your, you know, your child.
 
You know, the best protection or the best holiday gift you can give anybody is a gift of protection. So, making sure you're not bringing that virus to them during his holiday gatherings.
 
Have good ventilation. If you can host some of these events outdoors, certainly do so. We're in the middle of a bad weather and many parts of the U.S., so, that may not be possible. But some of these measures will go a long way.
 
SAVIDGE: And real quick, I want to ask you. We saw a decline in life expectancy, I think at the lowest level since what? 1996. Where you as a medical person shocked by that?
 
MADAD: Absolutely. You know, in this day and age, we would think that life expectancy is going to increase. But unfortunately, because of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid overdose that we have here in the United States, this is driving life expectancy down.
 
So, if we're just looking at, you know, how, you know, what's the decline here? We're just looking at just last year, right? You know, we are at, for example, 76.4 years in 2021. And that's from 77 years in 2020.
 
So, this is certainly worrisome, and we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to increase life expectancy here in the United States.
 
SAVIDGE: The gift of health. Dr. Syra Madad, thank you very much for joining us today. Wishing you a healthy New Year.
 
MADAD: You too, thank you.
 
WILD: A major setback for millions of women across Afghanistan. As the Taliban rolls back the right to attend university classes, now, students are pushing back. That story is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:45:44]
 
SAVIDGE: They dream of becoming doctors, teachers, engineers, but now they face the nightmare of being banned from attending universities by the Taliban.
 
WILD: The radical group promised a more moderate approach after retaking Afghanistan, but they have steadily eroded women's rights.
 
Details on the latest move from CNN chief international editor Christiane Amanpour.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice over): Another week, another dramatic reversal of women's rights in Afghanistan. The Taliban new edict suspending university education for females is a major setback for millions of women there, and the ministry of education says the rule will take immediate effect.
 
KAYANAT HASTI, AFGHAN STUDENT BARRED FROM ATTENDING UNIVERSITY (through translator): There is no life for women in Afghanistan anymore, since they've closed all the routes toward success for women.
 
When the doors of schools and universities are closed for the women who are half the society. It means the process of human evolution and development is paralyzed.
 
AMANPOUR: Young women showing up to class and universities across the country, and now being told to go back home. Even worse, fears the ban could extend to elementary schools.
 
The principals of three Kabul girl schools tell CNN, the Taliban have written to them, telling them to shut down. Students quickly showed their opposition to the new law. Both men and women, including a Nangarhar University in the city of Jalalabad.
 
According to Reuters, male medical students, there even walked out of their final exams to support their female classmates.
 
They couldn't go to school. Why? We cannot work. Why? Could somebody, somebody please tell me why?
 
AMANPOUR: This new policy is, the latest announcement on what many are calling the systematic expulsion of Afghan women from all aspects of public life.
 
And when I traveled to Kabul this spring, I confronted a Taliban official. The very day they demanded that all women in work even on television had to be masked.
 
Afghan women are afraid that this is the beginning of your efforts to erase them from the workspace.
 
Back then, the most senior Taliban government official Sirajuddin Haqqani, told me that he would safeguard the rights of Afghan women, including the right to an education.
 
SIRAJUDDIN HAQQANI, INTERIOR MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN (through translator): There is no one who opposes education for women. And already girls are allowed to go to school, up to grade six. What I am saying to you is that very soon, you will hear very good news about this issue, God willing.
 
AMANPOUR: But that promise never materialized. And this week, women's and girl's rights have taken a major step backwards.
 
In fact, officials who pledged they would be different than Taliban 1.0 are now accelerating their march back to that same harsh version.
 
This is my interview with the Taliban official back in 1996.
 
AMANPOUR (on camera): A lot of people want to know what you're going to do about the women issue. What about women's education, girls, education, women working, widows who have no other way to support themselves?
 
I know that, especially in Western news media, it's the propaganda against that we are against women education, which is not right, which is not correct.
 
But the girls can't go to school. We've been to schools here that are all closed.
 
Since the Taliban came back to power last year, women have been banned from most workplaces, from politics, and from entering public parks, and public baths.
 
They even now require a male guardian for long distance travel. More pragmatic Taliban sources tell CNN, these bans come straight from the Taliban so-called supreme leader, Amir Akhundzada, and his kitchen cabinet based in Kandahar. They form the core of the hardline religious leadership.
 
The United Nations says it's outraged and is calling on the Taliban to reverse the decision. The United States says that it would further alienate the Taliban from the international community and deny them the legitimacy and recognition they crave.
 
In the last two decades since the Taliban was first driven out of Afghanistan, many urban women were excelling in school and in the workforce, contributing to the country's economy, society, and culture.
 <br>[07:50:07]
 
Now, that half the population is being erased from public view and public works, this country is falling ever faster, ever deeper into extreme poverty and hunger, as another bleak winter takes hold.
 
Christiane Amanpour, CNN, London.
 
WILD: Still to come this morning, the holidays are about joining together. But for military families, 1000s of miles separated -- separates many loved ones. Up next, we'll hear from kids on how they cope with this difficult time. And we're continuing to track plunging temperatures as a major winter storm blankets much of the U.S. We'll have the very latest just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SAVIDGE: In the hours ahead, Pope Francis will mark Christmas Eve with the traditional midnight mass in St Peter's Basilica. It is one of many ways the Vatican celebrating the holiday of this year.
 
WILD: They've also installed dozens of nativity scenes that represent regions around the world. CNN's Delia Gallagher gives us a tour.
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Christmas at the Vatican is not complete without the nativity scene, an Italian tradition that dates back to St. Francis. There are 100 of them in all corners of the Vatican, including here, in the Sistine Chapel.
 <br>[07:55:01]
 
Joseph Apassery (PH) and his wife, together with two friends spent nine months painstakingly creating this Neapolitan inspired scene, making sure the colors and fabrics complement Michelangelo's famous frescoes.
 
In St. Peter's Square, artisans from the Venice region used sustainably sourced to cedar, from trees that had already fallen down to sculpt the statues.
 
GALLAGHER (on camera): With all the hustle and bustle and commercialization of Christmas, Pope Francis says the nativity scene is the visible sign of what this season is really about.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER (voice over): Friar Agnello, the Franciscan priest in charge of St. Peter's Basilica explains the paradox of the Christian belief at Christmas.
 
FRIAR AGNELLO STOIA, PASTOR, SAINT PETER'S BASILICA (through translator): God, in order to come close to men and women makes himself a baby, the most fragile thing in the world.
 
GALLAGHER: Each nativity scene is an expression of the people who made it, he says. Like this one from Ukraine.
 
STOIA: It's so beautiful that there are miniature nativity scenes: Japanese scenes, Indian, African. Each one represents the meaning of the Nativity.
 
GALLAGHER: Friar Agnello says the true nativity scene is in each person's heart. The important thing is that it is open and ready to welcome the hope of the season.
 
Delia Gallagher, CNN, Vatican City.
