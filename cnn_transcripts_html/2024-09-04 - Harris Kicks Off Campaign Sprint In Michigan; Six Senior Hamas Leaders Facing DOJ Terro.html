KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR:  All right, 5:34 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at Detroit, Michigan on this Wednesday morning. I love to see it. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us.
 
We are just 62 days away from November 5 and Kamala Harris, of course, kicking off her final sprint to Election Day in Michigan. It's one of the Midwestern battleground states known for its deep-rooted organized labor and is the home, of course, to the Motor City, which we just saw. 
 
Harris stopped by Detroit on Labor Day where she made this appeal to union workers.
 <br>[05:35:14]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm going to count on everyone here -- all the leaders here for your work in organizing, knocking on doors, and getting votes to the polls because put bluntly -- Michigan, you all know how to win. You know how to win.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  And new CNN polling out this morning shows Harris with a slight edge over Donald Trump in Michigan. The polling conducted right after the Democratic National Convention. It shows Harris leading Trump 48 percent to 43 percent. A reminder, of course, Donald Trump won Michigan in 2016 narrowly, but President Biden flipped it back in 2020.
 
And joining me now are two Michigan experts. Jonathan Oosting, the deputy editor for Bridge Michigan, and Zoe Clark, the political director and co-host of "It's Just Politics" on Michigan Public Radio. Welcome to both of you. I'm so grateful to have you this morning.
 
Of course, one of the people that we talk to a lot on this show and I'm sure you all are very familiar with as well is Debbie Dingell, the congresswoman who, of course, tried to warn the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 that Michigan could potentially go for Donald Trump. She will say no one listened. Of course, Trump won that time.
 
I kind of want to get the perspective from both of you. Jonathan, let me start with you in terms of what you are seeing on the ground in Michigan. We obviously have this new poll that shows Harris with a lead here. There obviously have been things that have changed since Biden was defenestrated from the top of the ticket.
 
Does this polling line up with what you know, Jonathan, in reporting and what you're seeing on the ground, or what else would you have us know?
 
JONATHAN OOSTING, DEPUTY EDITOR, BRIDGE MICHIGAN (via Webex by Cisco): Well, you know, I think there's some other polling that suggests it's a closer race. But either way, I think pretty much everybody agrees this race is very close in Michigan right now. 
 
I think we've -- it's been a remarkable campaign, right? There's been an assassination attempt, a criminal conviction. But for a lot of voters we've been talking to the economy is still a very, very big issue. We -- we're out in mid-Michigan this week talking to voters there and a lot of folks talked about yeah, inflation has technically gone down but the cost of everyday goods is still very high. And they are sort of on the fence.
 
I mean, I think this election could come down to, again, what we've thought all along. The economy versus Kamala Harris saying she'll offer a more stable hand. A lot of voters talk about the importance of democracy to them, and that's one thing that Kamala Harris certainly has in her favor. But the economic anxiety is still very real here in Michigan.
 
HUNT:  Yeah.
 
Zoe, to pick up on that -- I mean, one of the other things that we are seeing in our poll is that enthusiasm is up among Democrats in particular, in Michigan, and that may help explain why Harris seems to be doing better here. That the base, basically, is coming home. They weren't sure about Joe Biden. She will need as much of that as possible to stand up to what Jonathan was just explaining. 
 
In your reporting and kind of understanding, and your conversations with Michiganders across the state, how are you understanding these dynamics, and where do you think the race stands right now?
 
ZOE CLARK, POLITICAL DIRECTOR AND CO-HOST, IT'S JUST POLITICS, MICHIGAN PUBLIC RADIO (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. Well, I'll start with the latter first, which as Jonathan said, it is close, right? I mean, the one thing we can say is it is a lot closer than it was when Biden was at the top of the ticket, right? That Kamala Harris, to your point, has really enthused voters whereas Donald Trump time and time again in the polls earlier in this race was above.
 
It is all going to be about turnout for Democrats here in Michigan. When Democrats turn out -- when more voters turn out in Michigan Democrats win. And so this enthusiasm is really important.
 
You know, Donald Trump has a low ceiling, meaning his base is his base and they're going to turn out. But there's not a lot of room for growth. 
 
What we're seeing with Kamala Harris here in Michigan, particularly in a city like Detroit, is enthusiasm. If they can get that to be turnout it's really what could make the race here in Michigan.
 
HUNT:  Jonathan, I want to play an ad for you that a Republican-linked super PAC is up playing. It has to do with the Israel-Palestine issue because obviously, Joe Biden -- there were 13 percent of Michigan Democratic primary voters who voted uncommitted because they were upset about how he was handling the war in Gaza.
 <br>[05:40:00]
 
This is how this group is now trying to characterize Harris' position on the Israel-Gaza war. And again, it's a Republican-linked group. Let's watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FUTURE COALITION PAC POLITICAL AD:  Harris has made herself clear she stands with Israel and the Jewish people. She has again and again. She understands the unbreakable bond between the U.S. and Israel. And when supporters of a Free Palestine stood up for Gaza, Harris put them in their place. And supporters of Free Palestine -- they hate her.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  I mean, pretty strong language there. They are clearly trying to, it seems, suppress voters who may have these kinds of concerns. 
 
I mean, how do you take that ad in, and how much does this dynamic on Israel do you think affect the presidential race at the top of the ticket now that Harris is there?
 
OOSTING:  Well, obviously, Republicans are trying to poke the nest there and rile up folks who might be unclear where Kamala Harris exactly stands compared to Joe Biden. But look, it's a real issue for Kamala Harris. She wouldn't have met with Arab American leaders last time she visited Michigan -- or two times ago, sorry -- if she didn't think it was serious.
 
I mean -- you know, in the -- in the grand scheme of things it was about 100,000 votes in the primary that went uncommitted. That's not a huge number. But Michigan has been decided by closer margins. Less than 11,000 votes decided the race in 2016 when Donald Trump won Michigan. So it is an issue. 
 
Harris, of course, is more nuanced than that ad would let you believe but she hasn't done what the uncommitted leaders, at least, have publicly stated they want, which is to call for an arms embargo on Israel. She hasn't done that. And so it's going to remain an issue for her unless things change materially in that conflict or his position. HUNT:  Interesting.
 
Zoe, can I ask you when you look at the map -- when you think about -- you were talking about some of the different groups in Michigan. Is there either a location -- you know, a Grand Rapids or a Detroit suburbs, or an Ann Arbor that you're looking at in terms of helping to decide this, or a group of voters? Is it going to be those UAW halls again outside Detroit? Is it going to be young, Black men who maybe are voting for Donald Trump in larger numbers? 
 
Where are you looking that we in the national media may not be seeing because we're not as close to this as you are?
 
CLARK:  Right. Well, first of all, let me say all of the above because Michigan is such a microcosm of the country, right? That we have a really big city like Detroit that goes Democratic. We also have really wealthy pockets in the suburbs -- Oakland County -- sort of the suburban moms that we have sort of watched go back --
 
HUNT:  Grosse Pointe.
 
CLARK:  -- and forth. I think -- exactly. 
 
But let's go back to Debbie Dingell who we were talking to -- about at the beginning who, yes, we all talk to all the time. 
 
You know, one of the things that she's very focused on is labor because these were folks who in '16 helped Donald Trump win in Michigan. I often like to say it wasn't so much that Donald Trump won Michigan in '16, but Hillary Clinton lost, right? And so in '16, some of these labor workers who tended to go back to Bill Clinton went to Trump. Then in 2020, they went back to Biden.
 
Harris has some work to do, which I think is exactly why saw her meeting with labor on Monday doing what many former presidents have done. Barack Obama was here in Detroit on Labor Day really firing up this base. You know, labor leaders tend to go Democratic but labor workers -- that is something she's going to need to watch.
 
HUNT:  Yeah.
 
CLARK:  So we're looking at that. Again, it's the suburban moms, Oakland County. It's a microcosm.
 
HUNT:  For sure.
 
All right. Jonathan Oosting, Zoe Clark, thank you both so much for being on the show today. I really appreciate your time.
 
All right, coming up next here on CNN THIS MORNING, the Department of Justice announcing criminal charges against the leaders of Hamas for their role in the massacre of 1,200 Israelis on October 7. 
 
Plus, the governor of New York reacted to news that one of her top staffers is allegedly an agent for China.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[05:48:43]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Those defendants armed with weapons, political support, and funding from the government of Iran, and support from Hezbollah have led Hamas' efforts to destroy the state of Israel and murder civilians in support of that aim.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT:  The Justice Department charged six senior Hamas leaders for their role in the October 7 terrorist attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel. The indictment is the first criminal step by the DOJ to hold Hamas accountable for the massacre. The defendants face seven charges, including terrorism, conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction resulting in death.
 
Demonstrations, meanwhile, intensifying on the streets of Israel. Protesters demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compromise and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. 
 
Desperate hostage families showing little faith in the prime minister.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RONEN NEUTRA, FATHER OF ISRAELI AMERICAN HOSTAGE:  Unfortunately, not. We met him in the White House with President Biden. We looked him in the eyes. And unfortunately, our feeling is that he has his own political future ahead of him rather than the safety of our son.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[05:50:00]
 
HUNT:  All right, let's bring in CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger. David, good morning to you.
 
Obviously, it's been such a difficult period of time for these hostage families. What do you make of what they said there about the political dynamics with Benjamin Netanyahu, and how do you see this evolving?
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, AUTHOR, "NEW COLD WARS" (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Kasie, good morning, and thanks for having me on.
 
Yeah, the tragedy that started over the weekend with the execution of these six hostages now is having its predictable political effects. 
 
I mean, even before that moment the families of the more than 100 Israelis who have been hostage -- and there are a small group of Americans among that -- among that number all were saying, or many were saying that they believe that of the many priorities that Prime Minister Netanyahu laid out, releasing the hostages wasn't the top of close to the top. That, in fact, he was trying to extend the war and use the line that
 
 he had to completely defeat Hamas -- not entirely clear what that means -- in order to make that the chief priority. And, of course, they believe that is because he's trying to extend his time in office and avoid prosecution on completely unrelated charges. A trial that's been in a ban since he's been prime minister. And so that's the dynamic underway. 
 
What's really hurting him is that his own defense minister has charged that he is putting the hostage -- that Netanyahu is putting the hostage agreement on the back burner for no apparent reason other than this commitment to total victory.
 
HUNT:  Yeah.
 
David, while I have you -- and I'm sorry that we're running a little short on time here -- but I wanted to get your take on this aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul in New York who was arrested on charges of spying for China. 
 
What more do you know about this and how concerning do you find it?
 
SANGER:  Well, first of all, it's interesting that it's a relatively old case that's come to -- into the public just last night. She was fired in early 2023. 
 
And as you read into the charges what's really interesting is that what she was allegedly being paid to do -- and if you believe the indictment -- being paid millions of dollars to do was to keep officials from Taiwan from having meetings with senior New York State officials. Making sure that no one in the New York State government talked in a positive way, or at least from the senior members, about Chinese dissidents or dissident groups. 
 
So basically, what they were -- if you believe the indictment, what they were seeking to do was try to extend the repression that -- of free speech that is taking place across Xi Jinping' China into New York State. And it's not the first case in which we've seen that charge being made.
 
HUNT:  Really, really interesting. Very -- it tells us so much about the interest of their government.
 
David Sanger --
 
SANGER:  Sure, it does.
 
HUNT:  -- so grateful to have you, as always. Thank you so much for being here. I'll see you soon, I hope.
 
All right --
 
SANGER:  Great to see you.
 
HUNT:  You, too.
 
Time now for sports. For the first time in 15 years, an American man guaranteed to play for a Grand Slam tennis singles final.
 
Andy Scholes has this morning's Bleacher Report. Andy, good morning.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yeah, good morning, Kasie.
 
You know, we are in for one fun weekend in New York. So both Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe winning yesterday to book their spots into the semifinals, and it's going to be the first Grand Slam semifinal between to American men since the 2005 U.S. Open. 
 
Now, Tiafoe's best finish of his career was reaching the semis back in 2022, so he's matched that. And the 26-year-old beating Grigor Dimitrov in this one, who had to retire due to injury in that fourth set. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FRANCES TIAFOE, ADVANCES TO SECOND  CAREER MAJOR SEMIFINAL:  It's not the way I want to get through but obviously I happened to get through another semifinal here. Incredible. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  So, Tiafoe and Fritz -- they're good friends. They've been playing against each other since they were 14. Fritz holds a 6-1 head- to-head edge over Tiafoe as pros.
 
And last night Fritz beating fourth-ranked Alexander Zverev in four sets to reach a major semifinal for the first time in his career.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAYLOR FRITZ, WILL PLAY IN FIRST CAREER MAJOR SEMIFINAL:  I feel amazing, you know. I've had a lot of looks at quarterfinals over the past couple of years and today just -- today just felt different. I really felt like it was -- it was my time to take it a step further. And, I mean, it's only fitting I'm doing it here on this court at the Open in front of the crowd.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  All right. Aryna Sabalenka, meanwhile, is back in the semifinals a year after losing to Coco Gauff for the women's title. Obviously, the New York crowd was all on Coco's side last year in that one. 
 <br>[05:55:05]
 
Sabalenka is going to be going up against American Emma Navarro tomorrow in the semi, so the crowd likely not going to be on her side again. But she tried to change that after her win last night.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ARYNA SABALENKA, 2-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION:  Um, drinks on me tonight? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, drinks on you? Is that what you said -- for everybody?
 
(CHEERING)
 
SABALENKA:  OK, guys. Drink on me and please give me some support in the next match.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  Kasie, I'm wondering how many people went straight to the bar and said I'll have this -- it's on Aryna Sabalenka? 
 
HUNT:  I mean, I might have. 
 
Andy Scholes, thank you --
 
SCHOLES:  All right.
 
HUNT:  -- as always, my friend. See you soon.
 
All right. Coming up next here on CNN THIS MORNING, we are in the final sprint to the White House, and we've got brand new CNN polls out this morning showing the narrow race. Just nine weeks to go until Election Day.
 
Plus, the son of late Sen. John McCain speaks out for the first time about the controversy over Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIMMY MCCAIN, SON OF SEN. JOHN MCCAIN:  The least we can do is when they're gone if they -- you know, when they're in Arlington is to respect the rules and regulations that are in place, like not politicizing the fact that these men and women are there.
