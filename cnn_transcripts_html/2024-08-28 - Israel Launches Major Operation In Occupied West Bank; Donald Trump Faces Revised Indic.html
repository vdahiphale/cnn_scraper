PAULA NEWTON, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  And a very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Paula Newton in for Isa Soares. Tonight, it's 2:00 p.m. 
 
 in New York, 7:00 p.m. in London, 9:00 p.m. in the West Bank, where the Israeli military has been carrying out its most expansive raid in years. 
 
We are live in Tel Aviv with more. Plus, Donald Trump is indicted All over again in his election subversion case as the special counsel tries to work 
 
 around the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. And opening ceremonies underway in Paris for the 2024 Paralympic games. We'll have more 
 
 on why the games are expected to be historically popular. You'll want to see it. 
 
The U.N. Human Rights office warns that a major new Israeli operation could inflame the quote, "already catastrophic situation in the occupied West 
 
 Bank." And it is calling on Israel to abide by its obligations under international law. Today, Israel launched the largest offensive in the West 
 
 Bank that we've seen in years, carrying out coordinated raids and airstrikes in Jenin and several other towns. 
 
Palestinian authorities say at least ten people were killed. They also say the lives of hospital patients and medical staff are now under threat, 
 
 accusing Israeli forces of blocking roads to some of those facilities and obstructing the movement of ambulances.  
 
Israel's Foreign Minister says the operation is meant to combat what he calls Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure. He accuses Iran of trying 
 
 to establish an eastern front against Israel, and suggests Israel must address the threat with the same, quote, "determination used in Gaza."
 
He says, quote, "this is a war". We want to get more now from Jeremy Diamond who is live for us in Tel Aviv and has been following all of this. 
 
 Can you try and put this into context for us in terms of the escalation that it may represent in this region, I will add a region that can afford 
 
 no escalation. And how much longer are we expecting this operation to last? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Israeli military said today that this operation is in its first phase. And so, that suggests that it 
 
 could last for several days. What we are seeing so far appears to be one of the largest Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank since in 
 
 recent years. 
 
And what we are seeing are Israeli troops, we're seeing Israeli border police officers going into two key cities in the West Bank, Jenin and 
 
 Tulkarm, which have been hotbeds of militant activity. They have gone in there, not only with forces, but also with overhead assets carrying out 
 
 several airstrikes in the area of these two cities. 
 
So far, ten people have been confirmed dead according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Israeli military says that they have gone into 
 
 these cities for two key reasons. The first of which is they say that Iran is smuggling weapons into the West Bank. They say they've gone in there to 
 
 get those weapons. 
 
The second reason being that they say that a number of militant attacks have been carried out against Israeli troops and civilians from militants 
 
 originating from these two cities. And so, we are seeing this military operation ongoing right now with reports of gunfire, clashes, people 
 
 trapped in their homes because it is unsafe to go outside.
 
And also these reports of Israeli troops surrounding several hospitals in the area, including one hospital in Jenin, which the Israeli military 
 
 confirms they were surrounding. They said that it was to prevent Palestinian militants from going into those hospitals and seeking shelter 
 
 there to carry out operations against Israeli troops. 
 
What is clear though is that, this is just the latest escalation of Israeli military activity in the West Bank. We have seen a number on a nearly daily 
 
 basis in the West Bank, Israeli military raids into several of these cities, design the Israeli military says to try and stem the militant 
 
 activity that is happening in those areas. 
 
And we know that since October 7th, at least 650 Palestinians, that's both civilians as well as combatants have been killed so far there, 4,500 people 
 
 at least have been arrested in the West Bank so far. 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
And so, this is just the latest military activity that we've seen in this area, but it certainly does represent a step up in that activity from what 
 
 we've seen so far. 
 
NEWTON:  And we will stand by as you said, perhaps more incursions there expected. Our Jeremy Diamond for us, always in Tel Aviv, appreciate it. 
 
 Now, our next guest says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government are expanding their war in Gaza now to the West Bank, accusing 
 
 them of acting with quote, "total impunity". Khaled Elgindy is a Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington.  
 
He is also author of "Blind Spot: America and the Palestinians, from Balfour to Trump". And I thank you for joining us on, obviously, what is a 
 
 concerning day and perhaps days to come. The Israeli military describes their operation as targeting militant strongholds, meaning it sees these 
 
 areas as a threat. 
 
Now, this is on a scale rarely if ever seen. Do you expect this to continue? And if it does, what do you believe the reaction will be?  
 
KHALED ELGINDY, SENIOR FELLOW, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON:  Yes, I mean, I think it's a very alarming set of developments. I think typically 
 
 what we see is in something like this is a very large response, but that is limited, and that's what we're hearing also from Israeli officials that 
 
 this is just the first phase. 
 
And so, I think it's extremely likely that this is just the -- you know, just the beginning of a much wider operation. I mean, I -- we've seen a 
 
 steady kind of ratcheting up of violence, both from the Israeli army and from extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank in the last 11 months in 
 
 particular. 
 
And what is happening now really looks like Israel is bringing the horrors of the Gaza war to the West Bank. We see many of the same tactics besieging 
 
 and attacking hospitals, destroying civilian infrastructure, and I think it's quite alarming --   
 
NEWTON:  Now, you -- 
 
ELGINDY:  When -- yes -- 
 
NEWTON:  You understand that, of course, Israel says what they're doing is protecting themselves. I do though, want to point out that the Foreign 
 
 Minister, as we were just saying, Israel Katz saying that this was to thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure. But I also note as you 
 
 say, he says, we must deal with the threat just as we deal with a terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including evacuations. 
 
What do you believe the possible escalation in the region could be? The possible reaction -- no one else from the government is saying that, that 
 
 will happen. But that is his pronouncement on social media. 
 
ELGINDY:  Yes, I mean, I think that should run a chill down everyone's spine. We've seen exactly what Israel has done in Gaza over the last 11 
 
 months, and it's quite -- it's quite horrific. I think there's no credible observer who would look at what happened in Gaza and say that Israel is in 
 
 some way abiding by international law.  
 
I mean, we've seen massive and egregious violations repeatedly. And I think the danger here in the West Bank is if there's a muted response from the 
 
 United States, the U.K., the international community in general as there has been in Gaza, then Israel will take that as a license to ramp up and 
 
 move to the next phase, which could very well be these mass evacuations that this -- that the Israeli Foreign Minister is talking about.
 
I mean, I certainly don't think he's joking. I think when he raises the specter of mass evacuations and compares what is happening now to what 
 
 we've seen in Gaza, people should be very alarmed. Now, with regard to the assertions that you know, there's Iranian weapons and so on and so forth, 
 
 Israel has not produced any evidence of this. 
 
And I think what is even more alarming is we know that this is a very extreme government, they have a very -- I would say even unworkable -- 
 
 unworkably broad definition of what constitutes terror. But in this particular case, they're not even pretending that these are militants who 
 
 are targeting Israeli civilians. 
 
They're targeting an occupying army, an army that has been ravaging the Gaza Strip for 11 months. And that has been on a rampage -- 
 
NEWTON:  Yes -- 
 
ELGINDY:  In the West Bank as well --  
 
NEWTON:  And just to give some people some context here, I mean, nearly 3 million people in the West Bank there, and the Palestinian Health Ministry 
 
 reported just on Tuesday, 652 Palestinians including 150 children, they say have been killed in the West Bank and occupied east Jerusalem. That is 
 
 since the October 7th attack, thousands more injured.   
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
But I do want to ask you about the response, right? Hamas, through all of this has called for a general mobilization against the occupation and its 
 
 settlers everywhere. Do you expect this would include martyrdom operations?
 
ELGINDY:  Well, that remains to be seen by which I assume you mean like suicide bombings. I think -- I think it's quite possible, you know, the 
 
 reality is that while Israeli officials say that they are trying to prevent those kinds of attacks, the reality is that they're making those kinds of 
 
 attacks much more likely. 
 
When you -- when you come in with this kind of massive overwhelming disproportionate violence and kill people consistently, destroy 
 
 infrastructure and so forth, you create the conditions and the motivations for people to want to pick up arms and to find weapons wherever they can 
 
 get them. So, it doesn't make sense to simply treat the symptoms by creating more symptoms.  
 
NEWTON:  The -- 
 
ELGINDY:  There has to be, at some point level heads that say we have to address the underlying issue here. And that is Israeli repression, Israeli 
 
 violence, an occupation that has lasted 56 years, the denial of Palestinian rights. These are the root causes. 
 
NEWTON:  Now -- 
 
ELGINDY:  As long as you have occupation, you will have resistance to occupation --   
 
NEWTON:  I will -- I will say you've outlined some fairly sobering consequences there. But I do also want to note that the IDF just today in a 
 
 statement says that these settlers attack in the West Bank in mid August, they do describe it as a serious terror incident, meaning that those 
 
 assaults that, you know -- that attack by Israeli settlers, they are condemning that. Do you see in that any kind of hope that Israel may be 
 
 prepared to take a different attack? 
 
ELGINDY:  No, unfortunately, I don't, because I think those kinds of condemnations are primarily directed at western ears and international 
 
 audiences. But the reality is that, well, we've seen this time and again that when these settlers rampaged through Palestinian towns, they're very 
 
 often aided by or at least have kind of a passive presence of the Israeli army.
 
Sometimes they participate and sometimes the army just simply stands by and watches. But ultimately, there are the cases where individuals are actually 
 
 held accountable for destruction to Palestinian life or property are extremely rare. So, Israel's record of kind of policing itself especially 
 
 when you have a government that is made up of extremist settlers itself. There is not a lot of motivation there to act against those violent 
 
 elements from the settlers.  
 
NEWTON:  Khaled  Elgindy, we will have to leave it there as we await what happens in the coming hours and days on the   West Bank. Appreciate it. 
 
 Now, moments ago, the FBI released new information on the investigation into Donald Trump's assassination attempt. FBI officials say the gunman who 
 
 tried to kill the former U.S. President spent months in fact, looking to   attack a major gathering before deciding to target Donald Trump. 
 
They also say the gunman searched more than 60 times for information on the former President and Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden. Now, this moment 
 
 comes after Trump's new political attacks during an interview with TV personality Dr. Phil, without evidence, Trump blamed U.S. Vice President 
 
 Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, in part for last month's shooting in Pennsylvania. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When this happened, people would ask whose fault is it? I think to a certain extent, it's 
 
 Biden's fault and Harris' fault. And I'm the opponent -- look, they were weaponizing government against me. They brought in the whole DOJ to try and 
 
 get me. They weren't too interested in my health and safety. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON:  I want to bring in our chief law enforcement and Intelligence analyst, John Miller, you are with me live in New York. And John, you've 
 
 had a long career, not just in journalism, in law enforcement, including crucially, the FBI deputy Commissioner with the FBI, and then deputy 
 
 Commissioner of Counterterrorism Intelligence at the NYPD.  
 
And this is why I'm asking you. These are the kind of situations that you were involved in, right? The Secret Service comes into town, you are the 
 
 law enforcement on the ground. So, leaning on that experience, given what you just heard in the last hour, does this give you any information, any 
 
 more information where you can kind of glean what happened. 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
Was this poor communication? Was this bad Intelligence? What was it?  
 
JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST:  Well, the FBI briefing today actually didn't cover that, because they are focused on 
 
 the shooter and his actions. So, the news that came out of it was that there is no news as to motive, but they said they learned a lot about his 
 
 mindset going through his computers. 
 
That he had been focused on making improvised explosives since 2019. He had been focused on doing some kind of attack, and involved in detailed attack 
 
 planning for weeks before this event. But that he became hyper-focused on the Trump rally when he realized Trump was coming to the area that was very 
 
 near his home. 
 
We also were told that their investigation hasn't shown any evidence of co- conspirators or other people involved, and that most of what he used -- the gun was -- the gun that he purchased from his father, the explosives he 
 
 ordered online and assembled based on online instructions, that it was a mixture of ideologies. 
 
But to tackle your other question, the Secret Service report, the mission assurance report is due out in about 20 days, and it's going to conclude 
 
 that the local law enforcement contingent on the ground supplied all the resources they had, but not enough for what was required there, that 
 
 communications between the local law enforcement and the Secret Service radio communications was broken because they were on two separate systems 
 
 that couldn't talk to each other.   
 
And that they weren't running one unified command post. But strangely, two command posts, one with local law enforcement agencies and another with the 
 
 Secret Service and the state police. So, that event and the planning around it was just broken.
 
NEWTON:  And you say that broken, I'm sure you don't say that lightly. When you look at the details of this now, and we were just playing, of course, 
 
 the video of such a chilling attempt on the life of the former President. What do you see? Should they not have been doing the open-air rallies like 
 
 this because they clearly could not handle all the security threats coming their way?
 
MILLER:  Well, it's an interesting question. You know, the Secret Services isn't the boss in these things. It's the candidate, it's the President, 
 
 it's in this case, a former President who is a candidate, who says, we want to do open air or air rallies. The Secret Service can say we really wish 
 
 you wouldn't do that, but they can't say no. 
 
So, they have to adjust to the environment rather than adjust the environment to their wishes. But that said, the idea that there was that 
 
 rooftop, that it wasn't covered, that the gunman was able to get up there, we learned from the FBI today, and spent just six minutes up there, but 
 
 that six minutes that he wasn't interdicted because there wasn't either a local law enforcement or a Secret Service sniper team or even law 
 
 enforcement officers posted on that roof. 
 
That was within direct line of sight a little more than a football field away from where the former President was speaking.
 
NEWTON:  Yes, six-minutes, you will note that it's a long time. John Miller, we will leave it there for now, and we will continue to check in 
 
 with you as this investigation on multiple levels continues. Appreciate it.  
 
MILLER:  Thank you. 
 
NEWTON:  Now, it will almost certainly not make it to trial before November, but the 2020 election interference case against Donald Trump 
 
 could impact the race for the White House. The special counsel has now revised the indictment against Trump after the Supreme Court's ruling on 
 
 presidential immunity. 
 
While some arguments supporting Jack Smith's first indictment have been removed, Trump is charged with four felonies, including obstruction and 
 
 conspiracy. Now, the former U.S. President is taking his frustrations to social media by claiming the new indictment is both a witch-hunt and a 
 
 hoax.
 
Trump will once again need to enter a plea in court. CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Katelyn Polantz joins me now live from Washington. I 
 
 am wondering what you thought when you saw this new indictment, apparently 36 pages in terms of what was included or not, and what impact it will have 
 
 when we're just a little bit more than two months out from this campaign. 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Paula, it's going to put things back into court very quickly and have a lot of 
 
 needs of a judge and appellate courts very likely, even the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether this indictment is sound.   
 
This focuses on Donald Trump, the person, the campaigner for a second term in the presidency, and not what he was doing while he was the President, 
 
 including things like talking to executive branch aides, giving -- putting pressure on the Justice Department and speaking to Jeffrey Clark, someone 
 
 there who is trying to assist them -- him, who was a Justice Department employee, and also getting briefings from the federal government.
 
All of that is cut out of this version of the indictment. You mentioned Donald Trump is expected to enter a pleading to this in the coming days, 
 
 very likely -- it's very likely he'll do it and say he's not guilty still to these same four charges he was charged with before. 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
But we are set up not just for him to do that in court either on paper, potentially in person. But we're also set up to have a lot more hearings 
 
 and briefings from both the Justice Department and Trump's team, where they're going to have to work out with the judge if these things in the 
 
 indictment can remain.
 
Things like Trump's tweets after the election that he was sending from his account that he also used for official business, and also his conversations 
 
 with Vice President Mike Pence. The Justice Department says Pence was part of the Senate overseeing the congressional proceeding and working as 
 
 someone campaigning with Trump. 
 
So, there's a lot to be disputed here. Here's a little bit more about what Trump's running mate currently J.D. Vance had to say on the campaign trail 
 
 yesterday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SEN. JAMES DAVID VANCE (R-OH) &amp; U.S. REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Yes, I haven't read the whole thing, but it looks like Jack Smith doing 
 
 more what he does, which is filing these absurd lawsuits in an effort to influence the election. I think it's clearly an effort to try to do more 
 
 election interference from Jack Smith. 
 
He should be ashamed of himself, and it's one of the reasons why we have to win, because he should not be anywhere near power. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
POLANTZ:  Now, these criminal charges, they are going to have to go through a judge still before they get to trial, which would be a long way away. And 
 
 Paula, to also note J.D. Vance says this is all Jack Smith's doing, but actually this indictment, it went through a grand jury of nearly two dozen 
 
 people for approval before it was released publicly yesterday.  
 
NEWTON:  And yet, most certainly do observe that if Donald Trump is re- elected, the investigation will likely go nowhere. Katelyn, thanks again for that update. Now, there is new footage of Nancy Pelosi evacuating the 
 
 U.S. Capitol on January 6th as rioters stormed the building. 
 
This was filmed in fact, by the former Speaker's daughter, Alexandra Pelosi as part of an "HBO" documentary. Then it was turned over to Congress and 
 
 obtained by CNN. Now, it reveals something we just haven't seen before, Pelosi's unfiltered reaction to the violence and chaos on that day, 
 
 including the admission of at least some responsibility. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  We have responsibility, Terri(ph), we did not have any accountability for what was going on there, and we should have. 
 
 This is ridiculous. Why weren't the National Guard there to begin with?  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They thought that they had sufficient -- 
 
PELOSI:  No, there's not a question, in fact, they had been -- they don't know, they clearly didn't know. And I take responsibility for not having 
 
 them just prepare for more. Because it's stupid that we should be in a situation like this. Because they thought they had what? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK. 
 
PELOSI:  They thought these people would act civilized? They thought these people gave a damn? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
NEWTON:  Incredibly revealing moments there. Now, the video clips are being collected by Republican-led panel to discredit a previous investigation by 
 
 the January 6th Select Committee. Still to come for us tonight, if you're a stressed parent, yes, I get it, you're not alone. Trust me.
 
America's top doctor has just named parental stress as an urgent public health issue, and he has a plan to try and lighten the load. We'll have 
 
 those details next. Plus, flooding in Sudan is adding to the country's humanitarian crisis. We speak to the director for Refugees International 
 
 about the situation on the ground. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
NEWTON:  Now, it's a well-known truth, right? Raising children can be stressful. But today, America's top doctor is sounding the alarm about just 
 
 how much parents are taking on and the impact it's having on families. The U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy says caregivers nowadays are 
 
 increasingly feeling exhausted, overwhelmed and perpetually behind. 
 
He's warning the levels of burnout are serious public health concern, that's what's different. And he's calling for new levels of social and 
 
 economic support. CNN's health reporter Jacqueline Howard joins us with more. I mean, Jacqueline, you know, we don't need testimonials about this. 
 
 We all know it firsthand, right? 
 
Being a parent is stressful, but how big of an issue is this and why is the Surgeon General coming out with this now?
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER:  Yes, well, like you said, many parents will say, look, we know that being a parent is stressful, and this 
 
 is not new information. But what the Surgeon General is doing in this advisory is officially calling parental stress a public health issue. 
 
And in this advisory, Dr. Murthy pointed out that about 33 percent of parents reported feeling high levels of stress in the past month. That's 
 
 more than 20 percent of other adults who said that they felt high levels of stress in the past month. So, we do see   this increased stress among 
 
 parents and caregivers. 
 
And in a video that Dr. Murphy's office released today, here he is talking about parental stress as a public health concern.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL:  Parents and caregivers in America are under pressure. As a father of two kids, I feel this pressure too. Raising 
 
 children has always been a rewarding, but stressful. There are the usual difficulties of parenting. Dealing with financial concerns, worrying about 
 
 our kids health and safety, and getting through their teenage years. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HOWARD:  And. Dr. Murthy said that outside of those traditional stressors that come with parenting. Today, we have the added stress of social media. 
 
 We are experiencing a youth mental health crisis. We do know that half of parents who report feeling stressed say that stress is overwhelming. 
 
We also are seeing a loneliness epidemic. So, mental health is a big concern right now, and Dr. Murthy is kind of shedding a light on how 
 
 parents, particularly are feeling the stress. 
 
NEWTON:  And again, the magic question, right, Jacqueline, what can be done about it? What is he suggesting?  
 
HOWARD:  Right, well, he presented recommendations at the policy level, cultural level and personal level. So, when we talk about policy, he called 
 
 for in the United States for there to be a national family and medical pay to leave program. He also called for parents and caregivers to be screened 
 
 for mental health conditions. 
 
And then when we think about cultural norms, he called for more research on parental stress, and really looking at parental stress as a normal area of 
 
 research for instance. And then at the personal level, he said when parents are feeling stressed, really lean on each other for that community and that 
 
 support, and definitely do not shy away from taking a break if you need some self-care.  
 
NEWTON:  Yes, all good advice, I will say as well for families, though the affordability crisis in the last few years has been a huge point of stress 
 
 -- 
 
HOWARD:  Absolutely -- 
 
NEWTON:  And likely has parents working more than they indeed want to. Jacqueline, again, fascinating, thanks so much for joining us. Still to 
 
 come for us tonight, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are taking a bus tour around the state of Georgia. We report live from Savannah, plus a new 
 
 humanitarian crisis in Sudan as flooding kills more than a 100 people. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
NEWTON:  The country of Sudan has already been plagued by a civil war and now flooding in the region has killed more than 130 people. Now, state 
 
 media reports many of those casualties happened Sunday in the northwestern Red Sea state. Here's a closer look at how the disaster is impacting many 
 
 there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  Dozens dead as floods ravage an already crumbling Sudan.
 
MALEHASHIM MOHAMED, FARMER (through translator):  We lost everything and we could barely rescue our families. The water washed away our farms, 
 
 vehicles, livestock, and crops. It's the worst water flows I've seen in my life.
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  Locals are burying their neighbors as more than a hundred people are found dead due to severe floods. According to government 
 
 officials, flash floods in the country caused a dam in Eastern Sudan to burst. It swept through villages, destroying more than 12,000 homes. The 
 
 U.N. says the death toll could still be higher. Many people are still missing under the rubble.
 
ABU ALI AHMED, ARBAAT LOCAL (through translator):  The situation is catastrophic to be honest. We have children, families and elderly and 
 
 others that need continuous medication, and this is the fourth day. The water came onto them and destroyed all the villages and we don't know the 
 
 circumstances they are going through now.
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  The aftermath of these floods could be more fatal still in Sudan, a country already plagued by civil war. A new independent 
 
 report found that more than 20,000 people have been killed in Sudan since the start of the conflict in April 2023. The country is suffering from a 
 
 humanitarian crisis. According to the U.N., more than half of the population faces acute hunger. The growing crisis affects the education of 
 
 millions of children as well, with schools in Sudan either destroyed or shut down.
 
ASRAR SABER ESSAM, DISPLACED STUDENT (through translator):  I have lost my normal life and my dreams have been shattered. I aspired to become a 
 
 doctor, but with the school closed, I feel as though my future and the meaning of life have slipped away.
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  The arrival of aid complicated by a civil war that continues to ravage the country. As peace talks in Switzerland, led by the 
 
 U.S. and Egypt, are ramping up, so too are diplomatic efforts to secure food and medicine.
 
For the first time in six months, humanitarian aid resumed in Sudan's capital. Famine threatened Darfur region. The convoy of food is a short but 
 
 much needed relief to the thousands of people at the brink of this tragedy.
 
Now, in the eastern part of the country, thousands are reeling with the aftermath of floods. People are cut off from the capital, Port Sudan, and 
 
 many are searching for the bodies of their loved ones.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON (on camera):  Joining us now is Daniel Sullivan. He's the director for Africa, Asia, and the Middle East at Refugees International. And I want 
 
 to thank you for joining us. Earlier this summer, you were in the area and we wanted to get your perspective. I will also say that Antony Blinken, the 
 
 U.S. Secretary of State, just as us underscored in the last few days, that Sudan, right now, this hour, is the most grave humanitarian crisis in the 
 
 world, 25 million facing acute hunger, 10 million displaced. You say that, despite that this crisis is largely ignored. Why?
 
DANIEL SULLIVAN, DIRECTOR OF AFRICA, ASIA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST AT REFUGEES INTERNATIONAL:  Yes, thank you for having me. Yes, there's a lot of reasons 
 
 why a lot of different things happening in the world, but when you look at the pure scale of the suffering, as you just pointed out, the largest 
 
 displacement crisis in the world and now the largest hunger crisis, there already has been a determination that famine is present in parts of Darfur 
 
 and that's likely in many other areas as well.
 
So, you have this hunger, you have an atrocity determination that was made by the United States earlier. And these atrocities and the hunger continue 
 
 and are getting worse. So, really, there is -- there's no excuse for not getting more attention to what's happening in Sudan.
 
NEWTON:  And, again, we want to highlight just how many things are going on. The floods, obviously, this is just the latest. Obviously, the most 
 
 grave and critical is the conflict going on. I want to show everyone right now just those 10 million displaced. Some are refugees, some are internally 
 
 displaced, and the numbers are staggering. And you can see from the map we're about to show you that they're just going wherever, wherever they can 
 
 get a safe spot.
 
You were in the Nuba Mountains, the bordering South Sudan, earlier this summer. You know, as you describe it, it was a window into the larger 
 
 crisis, hundreds of thousands escaping mass atrocities again and now scrounging for food, the basics. What did you hear from them about what 
 
 they've been through and what they fear will happen in the coming months?
 
SULLIVAN:  Yes, exactly. The Nuba Mountains, which is bordering South Sudan, I had the opportunity to travel there earlier and interviewed people 
 
 that were arriving from all across the country. And so, that's why I said, really, it's a window into what's happening because, you know, there are 
 
 people arriving from Khartoum.
 
We talk about leaving the attacks by the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group that's fighting Sudanese Armed Forces, and then coming 
 
 into areas where they were bombed by the Sudanese Armed Forces. And then having to go through gauntlets of checkpoints and having their things taken 
 
 along the way, and many of them have been displaced multiple times.
 
You know, there was a -- I spoke to a man who just arrived from further to the west who had gone several days without eating. And many of the people 
 
 who are in the camps, they've seen children dying along the way, and even when they get to the camps in the Nuba Mountains, relative safety, they're 
 
 surviving on leaves from trees. And as I said, many are multiple times displaced.
 
Another woman said she left Khartoum because of the war. She left another city, Kadugli, because of hunger. So -- and just to put a finer point on 
 
 it, since the time I was there, the authorities in the Nuba Mountains have now said that famine is present there as well. So, it is a place of refuge, 
 
 but far from untouched by the tragedy that's happening in Sudan.
 
NEWTON:  Yes, I'm from the pictures and the video, your organization has provided, you can certainly see this is not hospitable territory and again, 
 
 going through drought conditions with very little aid getting in.
 
About that aid, Blinken again had a statement out on Monday saying that some aid has been getting in. But the other thing the U.S. and its allies 
 
 are trying to do is broker a peace deal. Talks took place in Switzerland last week. In terms of the outcome there, do you have optimism that in the 
 
 coming months this can be rectified? And again, I want to state Khartoum, Khartoum has been absolutely destroyed in this conflict.
 
SULLIVAN:  That's right. And, you know, it's -- the attention that Sudan is getting in the high -- not lack of high-level attention is appalling. I 
 
 mean, I acknowledge the talks that happened and there were -- there are some very positive things that came out of it in terms of actually getting 
 
 the parties that have leverage with the warring parties together and seeing the concrete outcome of trucks coming in.
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
But the fact is that the parties themselves, you know, the countries were not able to bring the parties to themselves together at the table, and that 
 
 these new deliveries of aid, never should have been stopped in the first place, they're tenuous and there's a huge question as to how much they can 
 
 be scaled up to reach.
 
So, there's really a need to go beyond this. You know, I think we see an opportunity with the U.N. General Assembly coming up in a couple of weeks 
 
 in New York, where we'll see world leaders. Again, great to see the special envoy for the U.S. to Sudan's Tom Perriello and to see Secretary Blinken 
 
 getting involved, calling directly to General Burhan. But we're yet to hear anything significantly from President Biden.
 
And just given the scale of this tragedy, we really need to see that stepped-up attention. And particularly the bad actors like the United 
 
 Emirates who are supplying weapons still to the RSF that is committing atrocities in Darfur. So, that needs to be called out. There needs to be a 
 
 much greater surge of diplomatic efforts and support, including cross- border aid and support for local groups.
 
NEWTON:  And again, as you noted, the scale of this is enormous and will take some years to rectify. Thank you for your insights there and we'll 
 
 continue to follow it. Appreciate it.
 
SULLIVAN:  Thank you.
 
NEWTON:  Now, Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov has been released from police custody in France. Now, he was taken to meet a judge who will decide 
 
 whether to place him under formal investigation. It comes after the Russian-born billionaire was detained in Paris on Saturday related to 
 
 Telegram's failure to moderate content posted by users.
 
CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance has our details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is an extraordinary situation because what the French authorities are doing is 
 
 holding the owner of a social media platform accountable for the content on that platform. The owner, of course, is Pavel Durov. He's one of the 
 
 world's richest men. He's the founder of Telegram, which is one of the world's most popular social media platforms, particularly in the former 
 
 Soviet Union, Europe, and to some extent in the United States as well.
 
It's sort of prided itself, Telegram has, for its lack of moderation compared to, for instance, Facebook or X, which are much more judicious in 
 
 what they allow to be broadcast and their platform used for. But, you know, Telegram has been used by autocratic governments like, like Russia, in the 
 
 Middle East, China, the Ukrainian government uses it as well as the Russians as well. You have criminal gangs that use it. You have, you know, 
 
 groups of pedophiles or neo-Nazis or anti-Semites, they use it to sort of propagate their sort of hate speech as well.
 
But you also get libertarians, you know, people who are strong believers in the freedom of speech who value Telegram as an essential asset in the sort 
 
 of media landscape. And so, it's this extraordinary sort of coalition of, you know, sort of disparate groups that have come together in support of 
 
 Pavel Durov as he is sort of scrutinized by the French authorities in this way.
 
The Russians have been very outspoken, of course. He's originally a Russian citizen. And they've called this an attack on freedom of speech, which is, 
 
 you know, ironic given that there's been a huge crackdown in Russia on free media over the course of the past several years.
 
But of course, it's about a much broader concept as well of, you know, the extent to which social media platforms should obey the law and should be 
 
 held accountable and their owners should be held accountable for the content that goes inside them. And that's something that the French 
 
 authorities now Pavel Durov are currently exploring.
 
Matthew Chance, CNN London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON:  Still to come for us tonight in Paris, the opening ceremonies for the 2024 Paralympic Games are now underway. This hour, we will have the 
 
 latest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
NEWTON:  Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are targeting the battleground State of Georgia with a two-day bus tour that kicks off later 
 
 today. Now, they will roll through Southeastern Georgia. Remember, this is an area that leans Republican. Joe Biden won the state by less than 12,000 
 
 votes in 2020. He was the first Democrat to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992. Harris' campaign is spending a lot of time and money on the ground 
 
 there and has 24 field offices in Georgia.
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is live for us in Savannah, Georgia. And that's the thing that's fascinating about this, not just that they're going to go to 
 
 perhaps Atlanta and the suburbs where the Democrats might have more strength, but they're going to places that the Republicans will likely win. 
 
 Why?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It gives us a clear indication and window into what the campaign strategy is going to be in this critical 
 
 battleground state. Now, what they're trying to do here is take a page from the playbook of Senator Warnock and his successful run in the runoff in 
 
 December of 2022. At the time, what they did was try to peel voters away from Republicans, and the person that was leading that campaign was Quentin 
 
 Fulks.
 
He is the same person who is part of the Harris campaign strategies, the deputy campaign manager. And what he told me is essentially it's not just 
 
 doing very well in metro Atlanta, but it's also trying to close margins with Republicans in Southern Georgia. And that is going to be key to their 
 
 strategizing in this state, trying to win additional votes and take away votes from Republicans.
 
And they have opened field offices also in South Georgia to continue their infrastructure building and organizing in the state. Because again, it's a 
 
 state that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes. So, they know that it's going to be difficult for them to pull off a similar or 
 
 bigger victory in this election year.
 
Now, of course, the other part of this too is the Tim Walz factor. And Democratic strategists say that he may have an important role here. He has 
 
 a rural upbringing. He has roots with football and a military background. And so, how he resonates with voters is also going to be closely watched to 
 
 see how this ticket works together.
 
Now, of course, coinciding with this swing is also a lot of money being poured into the Savannah area media market. Over the last three weeks, $1.7 
 
 million in ads flooding the markets here. This is going to be their strategy moving forward as well, as from the economy to today, Project '25, 
 
 setting that contrast between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.
 
So, they know it's going to be a uphill battle for a state like Georgia, but that's also true for the election as a whole. The Harris campaign 
 
 officials consistently talk about how close of a race this is going to be. So, when you try to understand how exactly they're trying -- they're going 
 
 to approach that and tackle it, just take a look at what they're doing today, going to places like South Georgia, places that typically lean 
 
 Republican, essentially setting their sights on just trying to lose by less. And by that way they say, like Warnock did, they can try to pull off 
 
 a win.
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
NEWTON:  Yes, and that 12,000 votes, every vote is critical. I will be on the lookout for Mr. Walz's flannel shirt, which might be right at home 
 
 there at a barbecue, although a little warm right now for that flannel shirt, I will say. Priscilla Alvarez, thanks for being on the ground there 
 
 as we will follow that bus tour. Appreciate it.
 
Now, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will have their first interview since the Democratic Convention right here on CNN with Dana Bash. That's Thursday at 
 
 9:00 p.m. Eastern. We're all looking forward to that.
 
Still to come, thousands of athletes gather in Paris for the opening ceremonies in the 2024 Paralympics. Stay with us. We'll have more on that.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON:  So, the opening ceremonies are now underway in Paris for the 2024 Paralympic Games. More than 4,000 athletes are representing 168 
 
 delegations. Eritrea, Kiribati, and Kosovo are making their Paralympic debut. And organizers say for the first time in the history of the Games, 
 
 there will be live television coverage from all 22 sports. They also say more than 2 million in-person tickets have been sold.
 
Our Patrick Snell from CNN World Sport joins us now. You will be following all the action. I have to say, they are just so inspirational as these go 
 
 on, you know, just the stories, the background.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Yes. Paula, you're quite right. Inspiration is the word. Absolutely. And history as well in the making at 
 
 this hour, the opening ceremony, as you said, in progress, and we have been witnessing the aforementioned history, and it's a wonderful, very warm 
 
 evening over there right now in the French capital. Contrast that, of course, with the wet, rainy conditions that we witnessed during the recent 
 
 Summer Games over there in Paris.
 
Now, this is the first time, Paula, a Paralympics opening ceremony has actually taken place outside of a stadium. A short while ago, I was 
 
 watching, in the office, over a hundred dancers and performers taking center stage. And then the parade of athletes beginning about 20, 25 
 
 minutes or so ago, starting at the bottom of the iconic Champs Elysees there, right in the heart of Paris. Then they'll go into the famed Place de 
 
 la Concorde. That's the largest square in the French capital.
 
168 delegations are participating in the celebration in total. As you mentioned, the Games will be featuring more than 4,000 athletes, about 
 
 4,400 athletes in total competing in 22 para sports for nearly 550 medals events over 11 days. It's going to be fascinating watching.
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
Now, Team USA will have 225 athletes competing at the Paralympics, including Oksana Masters, the 35-year-old who was born in Ukraine with 
 
 significant birth defects, believed to be linked to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. We used that word inspiration a short while ago. She absolutely 
 
 defines it when you consider all she's had to overcome. Oksana has now become a multi sports star, winning 17 medals, seven of them gold, right 
 
 across the Summer and Winter Games over the years.
 
And then there's the 25-year-old track star, Hunter Woodhall. He's set to compete in his third Paralympics, and hoping to follow, of course, in the 
 
 footsteps of his wife, Tara Davis-Woodhall, who won gold in the long jump. That was three weeks ago now in Paris.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNTER WOODHALL, THREE-TIME PARALYMPIC MEDALIST:  I think one thing that we've really focused on this year is not having any expectations. I mean, 
 
 this whole year has been incredible. Training has gone really well. I've taken a lot of risk and re-learn so many things, running the best I've ever 
 
 ran. So, I'm just going to go out, have a good time, enjoy the moment, be in the presence of an incredible crowd and Paris 2024 and just do my best, 
 
 and the result will -- it will speak for itself.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL:  Yes, competition getting underway on Thursday. Prepare to be inspired. Paula, back to you.
 
NEWTON:  Absolutely. The crowds, they're always enthusiastic. Patrick Snell for us. Thanks so much. And I want to thank you for watching. Stay with 
 
 CNN. Jim Sciutto is next.
