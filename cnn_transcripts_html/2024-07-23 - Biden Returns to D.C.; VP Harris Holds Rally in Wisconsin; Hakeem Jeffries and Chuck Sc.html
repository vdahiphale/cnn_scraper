PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  It's 6:00 a.m. in Shanghai, 8:00 a.m. in Sydney, and 6:00 p.m. right here in New York. I'm Paula Newton in 
 
 for Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A very warm welcome to "First Move." Here's today's need to know. Campaign kickoff. U.S. President Biden returns to Washington after his bout with 
 
 COVID, while Vice President Kamala Harris holds her first rally as the Democrats presumptive nominee. We'll have the reaction to her performance 
 
 in the key battleground State of Wisconsin.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  So, Wisconsin, I am told as of this morning that we have earned 
 
 the support of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  Standing down, Secret Service Chief Kimberly Cheatle resigns over security failures which led to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.
 
Tesla troubles, profits at the E.V. maker plunge 40 percent in an increasingly competitive market, we'll look at what this means for Elon 
 
 Musk.
 
And are you having a brat summer? How brands and politicians are jumping on trend. That trend started by pop star Charli XCX. What the heck is it? 
 
 We'll explain.
 
But first, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and her first presidential campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Harris says Democrats will win 
 
 again as she looks to build on her momentum. Harris also took on former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators 
 
 who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's 
 
 type.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  You can all get used to hearing that line. Earlier on Tuesday, Democratic congressional leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer 
 
 officially endorsed her. Harris has now secured the endorsement of enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Kayla 
 
 Tausche has more now from the White House.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For Vice President Kamala Harris, it's been a sprint, not a marathon.
 
Her first appearance on the campaign trail as the presumptive nominee coming just hours after securing the backing of key party leaders.
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  Vice President Harris has done a truly impressive job securing the majority of delegates needed to win the 
 
 Democratic Party's nomination to be our next president to the United States.
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  Kamala Harris is a common- sense leader who knows how to deliver real results.
 
TAUSCHE (voice-over):  Harris raking in more than $100 million, mostly from new donors, recruiting 58,000 new volunteers across the country and racking 
 
 up critical endorsements from actor George Clooney after his call for Biden to step aside to prominent voices across the party.
 
GOV. ROY COOPER, (D-NC):  I endorse Kamala Harris 100 percent for this job as president.
 
GOV. JOHN CARNEY (D-DE):  I think we're going to see a whole different thing now. We've got a great person leading the way, our vice president.
 
REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA):  The reason nobody ran against her is because she's superb.
 
TAUSCHE (voice-over):  With the delegates on board, the Democratic Party moving forward to make her official in a process that pledges will be open 
 
 and fair and conclude by August 7th.
 
In Wilmington, Delaware, Harris helming a rebranding of Biden HQ.
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  You know, the name has changed the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn't changed at all. And by the way, I'm not 
 
 going anywhere. I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala.
 
TAUSCHE (voice-over):  For now, Biden preparing for a final six months in office as Harris hits the campaign trail to finish the job.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON:  And we will hear more from Kayla at the White House in a moment, but first, I want to bring in Tara Palmeri. She's a senior political 
 
 correspondent at Puck. I really want to thank you for being with us as we try and catch our breath, right?
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
We've had barely 48 hours for all of this to sink in now. Given your reporting, I mean, give us the state of this race, the new race that Kamala 
 
 Harris has now walked up.
 
TARA PALMERI, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, PUCK:  Yes, it's definitely a reboot, right? We're in a totally different position than we were a few 
 
 weeks ago. There was a sense of desperation fear, anxiety among Democrats. And that's not to say they're not concerned. I think they still know that 
 
 it's going to be a tight race. She's still sort of polling around the same as Biden was before the debate. So, neck and neck with Trump.
 
In 10 days or so, they think they'll be able to see real polling and see how she polls, not just, you know, nationally, but in the swing districts, 
 
 how does her being at the top of the ticket affect down ballot Democrats like members of Congress and some of these swing seats in New York, New 
 
 Jersey, Connecticut, California.
 
And I think the party is just relieved to have, you know, Joe Biden off the top of the ticket. It was a moment of standstill. The donors were not 
 
 giving and then the money just surged. And I think that's a sign. And then you saw grassroots money as well. I mean, $1.1 million unique donors, 
 
 that's a lot.
 
So, yes, there's a lot of excitement. It's a honeymoon. It's kind of incredible because like she doesn't even have a campaign slogan yet, you 
 
 know, there's really not, you know, this type of talking points going around, messaging. It's like, I'm continuing the Biden administration, but 
 
 I'm different, but they really haven't drawn out the contrast yet.
 
So, we're in kind of very weird, unchartered territory strange political water. Like, I see -- I've been talking to even surrogates, and they're not 
 
 really so sure what to say quite yet. There isn't really quite a defined message. But she's certainly the hero to save the Democrats. That's for 
 
 sure.
 
NEWTON:  I think characterizing it, though, as a honeymoon is a very good way to put it. And especially for those who don't play inside ball on 
 
 politics, a good framing for the days going forward. Now, we pivot, though, to the Trump campaign. Do you think they're worried about this change, 
 
 about Kamala Harris and how to take her on?
 
PALMERI:  Oh, yes, absolutely. I mean, they've been preparing to run against one candidate, Joe Biden. They were not preparing to run against 
 
 Kamala Harris. Although, they did have some memos. And they -- you know, they even said last week, they weren't going to agree to -- for J. D. to 
 
 have a debate -- they weren't entirely wrong, right?
 
So, I think last week was kind of -- again, it felt like a victory party at the RNC, but it also felt like this could be the last one. You know, there 
 
 was a sense of anxiety too. You completely, you know, append a race, that impacts Trump. I mean, the polling, the messaging, they thought that they 
 
 were in a good position to beat Biden. He was the weak leader, and Trump was a sign of strength. Now, they have a totally different person to run 
 
 against who's younger, who has her own flaws as well. They're leaning into that. You know, and we'll see how it all works out.
 
I think there's going to be a lot of eyes on Kamala Harris, though, to see her campaigning skills. Because she wasn't great in 2020. Let's not forget 
 
 that. I mean, she was losing to Andrew Yang before she dropped out. But I've been told from her allies who've come on my podcast, somebody's got to 
 
 win. They say, no, she's learned a lot. She's learned how to be president. She will step up into this moment. So, I think everyone wants to see that.
 
I mean, she's meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu in -- tomorrow. So, yes, this is a -- this is her moment to really step in. And you know what, the fact 
 
 that she raised so much money already is a threat to the Trump campaign? Undoubtedly.
 
NEWTON:  Yes, definitely.
 
PALMERI:  Like they were $30 million ahead of Biden.
 
NEWTON:  Exactly. Now, that advantage no longer exists because she gets all the Biden-Harris money as well. Tara will leave it there for now. But I 
 
 guess next up will be the VP pick and we'll see where she goes from there. Tara Palmeri, thanks so much. And I hope to hear from you again. Appreciate 
 
 it.
 
And I will go to Kayla Tausche. She's at the White House. I mean, again, we were just talking about what a breathless 48 hours it's been. And then we 
 
 go to today's split screen, right? Kayla, we've got -- it's historic, a president returning to the White House after convalescing for days with 
 
 COVID, deciding he's not going to run anymore. Then you split to the new presidential candidate hitting the road, tailed by money and enthusiasm. I 
 
 mean, what did you make of the day and what is the Biden administration saying to you now?
 
TAUSCHE (on camera):  Well, President Biden certainly letting the new presumptive Democratic nominee step into the spotlight and really letting 
 
 the news cycle take on a life of its own. The vice president, Kamala Harris, at her rally in Wisconsin, which is a critical battleground state 
 
 for both parties, but especially for the -- to the number of electoral votes that they need.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
She really put a fresh spin on a familiar message from the Biden camp, really trying to lay out what she sees as the case that she plans to 
 
 prosecute against Former President Donald Trump but reiterating some of the same themes, such as bringing up the middle class, and some of the same 
 
 policies like child care and elder care as were inherent to the Biden- Harris campaign before it became rebranded just a couple days ago.
 
But still, the vice president has been deferential to President Biden talking about his legacy and thanking him for what the administration has 
 
 done up until this point and what Biden himself has done over five decades in public service. That's something that's really going to be in focus 
 
 tomorrow when President Biden delivers a prime-time address that is still in the works. I'm told he and his top aides began drafting it while he was 
 
 isolated with COVID-19 at his beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware, but they're thinking about how much to talk about what the next six months 
 
 looks like and how much to think about what his legacy will be.
 
But really, the president has told the American people that he is going to go into detail as to how he made the decision to withdraw from the race. 
 
 Certainly, a personal and a painful decision for the president, and not one that he arrived at easily, and certainly not one that is really difficult 
 
 for him as he sees the infusion of energy that's going into his now successor on the ticket.
 
So, how the president now views that decision in light of what we've seen the Democratic Party do in the wake of his stepping down, I think will be 
 
 very interesting. Paula.
 
NEWTON:  Yes, it'll be a difficult balance, especially since leading up. Really, he had insisted that he was staying in the race because he was the 
 
 one to beat Donald Trump. I want to ask, though, given the fact that we have Benjamin Netanyahu arriving -- well, he's in Washington already. He 
 
 will be addressing Congress tomorrow. In terms of getting that crucial ceasefire in Gaza, is there any indication that we're closer to that? 
 
 Because clearly that would also help the vice-presidential campaign.
 
TAUSCHE:  Well, the entire foreign policy establishment, as well as the foreign policy experts inside the Biden administration, have all said for 
 
 days and weeks that the U.S. is very close to securing that ceasefire deal. The question is just whether it's one that the two parties at heart of this 
 
 deal, Israel and Hamas, can agree to the details of. That's been the elusiveness for the last several months as we've heard that they've been 
 
 close before.
 
Certainly, the language would suggest that they're closer than ever now with the secretary of state saying just last week, that they are inside the 
 
 10-yard line, an American football analogy, that means that they're incredibly close to scoring. But when you talk to members of the 
 
 administration, it is clear that one thing that they believe could be the legacy of this administration is securing not only a peace deal between 
 
 these two parties, but also more stability in the region as a whole.
 
They've been seeking to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel and to further the Abraham Accords that were put in place by the Trump 
 
 administration. They want to solidify and expand the stability in the region, and certainly, that's going to be something that you can expect 
 
 will be a top priority this week and for the next six months.
 
NEWTON:  Yes. And if you know anything about American football, the 10-yard line would actually make you a little bit nervous as opposed to confident. 
 
 Kayla Tausche for us. A big day in Washington tomorrow for sure. Appreciate it.
 
And now, to other breaking news that we've had today, and that's reaction to the resignation of the U.S. Secret Service director, and it's pouring in 
 
 from both sides of the political aisle. Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, who may be tapped for Kamala Harris's campaign to be her 
 
 running mate, says it was the right thing for Kimberly Cheatle to step down. Cheatle resigned a day after being grilled by U.S. lawmakers over the 
 
 deadly shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.
 
Joining me now is Senior U.S. Justice Correspondent Evan Perez. I mean, Evan, I have to ask you, what took so long here? I mean, arguably, she did 
 
 more reputational damage to the Secret Service by not resigning immediately.
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  You know, she -- Paula, she sat at that hearing where she was getting lectured and scolded and yelled 
 
 at by those members of Congress. And she literally said the words that, I think I am the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time. And it 
 
 really sort of gives you a sense that she was perhaps just unaware of just out of depth she was and how her testimony was being received, because as 
 
 you watch that hearing for hours and hours, the frustration from members of Congress was building because she could not and would not answer simple 
 
 questions that really had nothing to do with an investigation.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
You know, keep in mind, the person who carried out this attempted assassination of Donald Trump, he's dead. He's not going to be prosecuted. 
 
 So, there's plenty of things that she could have said to respond to those important questions from members of Congress, the answers that they were 
 
 asking, and she just would not do that.
 
And so, by the end of that hearing, it was very clear that, you know, her departure was going to be very, very imminent. It just -- it happened a lot 
 
 quicker, perhaps, than even people who inside the Homeland Security Department and inside the administration thought it would happen.
 
NEWTON:  Yes. Again, so many questions. We were getting a lot of information from these hearings. And I have to say, what we are getting is 
 
 just absolutely chilling as to the mistakes that were made. Evan Perez, I know you'll continue to stay on this story. Appreciate it.
 
PEREZ:  Thanks.
 
NEWTON:  Straight ahead for us, the latest on a typhoon bearing down on Taiwan. Plus, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, as we were just saying, is 
 
 in Washington meeting with families of Israeli hostages and gearing up for an important address to Congress. Some more on his message to lawmakers.
 
And can Kamala Harris rake in the big bucks from both Hollywood and big tech? The donor tally from Silicon Valley and beyond. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON:  Welcome back. A tepid Tuesday on Wall Street. This is today's "Money Move." U.S. stocks finishing modestly lower ahead of the official 
 
 start of tech earnings season. Package giant UPS tumbling 12 percent after weak earnings and guidance. Shares of Delta Airlines falling once again as 
 
 it struggles to bounce back from Friday's global I.T. outage.
 
Hundreds more Delta flights were cancelled right across the U.S. Tuesday. Thousands of passengers stranded. And look at those unclaimed bags. They've 
 
 been piling up in Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport. Just incredible, the mess with the bags.
 
Investors are pouring over just released earnings from Tesla and Alphabet. First glimpse into how big tech fared in Q2. Tesla shares falling in 
 
 afterhours trading after missing earnings expectations. Profits down more than 40 percent compared to the same time last year. And look at that, 
 
 Tesla shares down 6.5 percent in afterhours trading.
 
Alphabet shares meantime falling too. Despite beating on the top and bottom lines, the company's cloud computing unit seeing operating profits top $1 
 
 billion for the first time.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, joins me now. Dan, always good to see you. Tesla first, sales growth slipping, operating 
 
 profits slipping. I know you're going to tell me those two metrics do not tell the bull case for Tesla, but what did you hear on the conference call, 
 
 if anything, that gave you optimism because your Tesla call is about as bold as your shirt?
 
DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great. Look, I mean, this is a transitional growth story. China's starting to turn. It's clearly been 
 
 a tough six to nine months for electric vehicles across the board, but this is a comeback story. And I think when you look at stabilizing demand then 
 
 this robotaxi day, which is now officially October 10th, Musk talked about he thinks robotaxi rides could start by the end of this year into next 
 
 year. This is an A.I. story, that continues to be front and center.
 
NEWTON:  And what you heard on the conference call, was it -- because they've moved the date, even for the robotaxis. I mean, it doesn't inspire 
 
 confidence.
 
IVES:  Look, I mean, the haters are going to hate on this one, but I believe this is a disruptive tech name where the A.I. story alone could be 
 
 a trillion dollars in terms of the value. China's starting to stabilize. You're not seeing the price cuts like we saw six, nine months ago. I'm not 
 
 saying this is champagne and roses, but this, in my opinion, is the start of a comeback story for Musk and Tesla.
 
NEWTON:  To Alphabet now, the news was better there. What caught your attention, especially given that they will now have to spend on A.I., big 
 
 money on A.I. going forward?
 
IVES:  Yes, the mojo is back at Google. I mean, if you look on the cloud, they're narrowing the gap versus Microsoft. This A.I. revolution front and 
 
 center. I thought these were robust numbers. I think it bodes well for big tech. You look at Netflix now what we saw in Alphabet. I think we're going 
 
 to see more over the coming weeks. This is a transformational time for tech. And I think Google is a positive.
 
NEWTON:  Yes, it's interesting that you say transformational because this may dip a little bit, some of these stocks may. You think it's a good time 
 
 to get back into tech if they've -- if they are dipping a bit?
 
IVES:  In my opinion, we are in the early stages of a tech bull market. And I think, as it all plays out with the A.I. revolution, a lot of money on 
 
 the sidelines, this is an A.I. revolution. It's 9:00 p.m. at the party. That party goes to 4:00 a.m. in our opinion.
 
NEWTON:  Bad for me. I'm usually in bed by 9:00. But I'm going to listen, Dan. I'm going to listen for once. So, we usually don't do this, but it has 
 
 been important. We're going to get into politics and funding the political campaigns.
 
Now, conventional wisdom is that Trump is pro-business, low taxes, right? Low regulation, but the Hollywood Reporter had a really interesting, in 
 
 fact, a fascinating take on big dollar donors in this race, saying Harris, who will remind everyone, hails from L.A. and has a home there, could get a 
 
 boost from Hollywood. Why? Donors who want a so-called take on the tech bros, I want you to listen to this quote from the Hollywood Reporter. 
 
 They're saying there is an S load, I'm not going to swear, of money here in Hollywood, as well as a lot of disdain for these Tech Bros, and I think 
 
 you'll see people putting up a lot of dough just to teach those dudes they can't buy an election.
 
So, Dan, give us your take. You're just on the call with Elon Musk, who is now supporting Trump. Hollywood versus the Valley Tech Bros. Is this real 
 
 or imagined in terms of the Harris-Trump battle?
 
IVES:  No, that's real. I mean, and I see it every day on Wall Street in terms of the debate. Look, I think Harris would be bullish for big tech. I 
 
 think less regulation, especially by what likely happens at FTC and Con. So, Harris would be bullish for big tech and probably more tech M&amp;A.
 
When it comes to Musk, and you talk about Tech Bros in terms of E.V.s, look, Trump's viewed and part of the Trump trade would be negative for 
 
 E.V.s, probably bullish for Musk and Tesla. And that's why this all plays out. This is going to be a battle on both sides, and when it comes to tech, 
 
 tech is kind of front and center in terms of where it plays on one side of the aisle.
 
NEWTON:  And you believe that though tech will be behind Trump more than likely, or in the weeks to come, or no? Do you think they may -- some may 
 
 also move to Harris?
 
IVES:  Yes, I think some big tech money is actually behind Harris. Because I think the view is that in that scenario there will be less regulatory, 
 
 probably a better path for M&amp;A. Trump, there's a lot of front and center focus in terms of what he'll do for M&amp;A regulatory, and I think that's -- 
 
 but this Tech Bros versus Hollywood battle, we're going to continue to see it play out until November.
 
NEWTON:  Interesting. The real thing. Dan Ives, as always, thanks so much. We continue that conversation. Appreciate it.
 
Now, Typhoon Gaemi is fast approaching Taiwan. It's expected to make landfall here on the northern part of the island. You see people that right 
 
 now are trying to secure their fishing boats in time. It's the same area that was hit by a deadly earthquake in April.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
Chad Myers is monitoring the situation and joins me now. What's the main threat from this storm, given the fact that they are used to typhoons, 
 
 obviously, in these areas?
 
CHAR MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, I mean, there are two. So, I can't say main because it will be a super typhoon at landfall, somewhere around 150 
 
 miles per hour, more than 240 kilometers per hour. So, yes, there will be wind damage.
 
But when you look at my radar map, and when you look at how much rain will fall in a wide spread huge area, almost the entire Taiwan island will be 
 
 covered by 250 to 500 millimeters of rain. That's more than 18 inches. And that's going to cause problems. That will cause mudslides.
 
And as you said, the eastern part where the eye is going to make landfall was hit by a 7.4 in April. These buildings are already on really shaky 
 
 foundations. They were never -- they didn't have time to build those things back up. So, now, all of a sudden, you're going to hit those buildings with 
 
 a 240 kilometer per hour wind, that's going to cause an awful lot of damage.
 
Into China, it goes and heavy, heavy rainfall for them as well. The storm will make landfall in probably less than 12 hours, but the effects will be 
 
 somewhere around eight hours from right now. It is not that far away. It is still gaining strength. It gained almost 100 KPH, 60 miles per hour in just 
 
 the past 24 hours.
 
And here's that white area everywhere. Everywhere that's white, that's almost the entire island there of Taiwan. 500 millimeters, 18, 19 inches of 
 
 rainfall just over the next 48 hours. The water is very warm. There's a lot of moisture in the air. The air is very warm. In fact, Sunday was the 
 
 warmest day on record for the globe so far, it could go up still, but 17.09 degrees C. That beat the old record that was set last year on July 6th, not 
 
 by much, 17.08. But we're still setting records every single day and those things aren't good.
 
The world is warm. The biggest warmth in June was really down in the Antarctic, but you can barely find a cool spot on the entire planet 
 
 compared to normal for June. And likely July is going to follow right along. I don't see too many cold spots here in July.
 
NEWTON:  Yes, for so many places there has been so little relief. Chad Myers from the Weather Center, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
 
OK. Still ahead for us, Kamal Harris says, let's take this show on the road. The newly minted U.S. presidential candidate hitting the campaign 
 
 trail in an important swing state. Can she win over the voters? We'll discuss.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
NEWTON:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more international headlines this hour. Protesters in Kenya hoping to seize control of 
 
 Nairobi's main international airport Tuesday were met with a heavy police presence. Authorities used tear gas to disperse demonstrators on roads 
 
 leading to the airport. Activists had called for a total shutdown. As antigovernment protests enter their sixth week.
 
Disgraced Democratic Senator Bob Menendez is to resign from his seat effective August 20th. It comes after the New Jersey senator was convicted 
 
 of 16 counts, including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent. That was during his role in at a 
 
 year's long bribery scheme. Majority Whip Dick Durbin says he doesn't expect to see Menendez again in the Senate.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden has told reporters he feels well. That was during his first public appearance since dropping his re-election bid and 
 
 recovering from COVID. The president was seen with a mask in his hand when he boarded Air Force One in Delaware after receiving the all clear from his 
 
 physician, although his condition will continue to be monitored.
 
Kamala Harris hits the campaign trail Tuesday for the very first political rally of her presidential bid. The U.S. vice president speaking to 
 
 supporters in the key battleground State of Wisconsin, the same state where the Republicans held their national convention last week.
 
Now, the two most powerful Democratic members of Congress, meantime, that's Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem 
 
 Jeffries, formally endorsed her candidacy. That was just a few hours ago. All this as speculation swirls over Harris' running mate. And Republicans, 
 
 yes, they're sharpening their political attacks. One Republican congressman calling Harris a DEI vice president.
 
We're going to decode all of this for you. And for that, we've invited Harry Anton. OK. DEI VP. Translation, diversity, equity, inclusion. Now, 
 
 that label suggests that Harris is not qualified otherwise, which is clearly an attack on her. Could this -- when you look at the numbers, 
 
 right, we're doing math here, could this backfire on the Trump campaign, given they have, in fact, made unprecedented inroads, especially with black 
 
 and Latino men?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  I don't really understand the attack, and part of the reason I don't understand it is Kamala Harris, 
 
 besides just being Joe Biden's vice president, was elected numerous times statewide in the State of California, twice as attorney general, once as 
 
 Senator.
 
And you're right, you bring up the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has been doing historically well among younger voters of color, black voters, 
 
 Hispanic voters. In fact, he's doing better with young black voters by -- at least was against Joe Biden by about 40 points. He shrunk the margin by 
 
 about 40 points compared to where we were back in 2020 at this particular point. And indeed, at this point, Donald Trump looked like he was on the 
 
 road to putting in the best performance among black voters of any Republican since Richard Nixon in 1960.
 
I don't get this attack because it brings race into a campaign in which, in fact, the racial polarization had shrunk significantly and to Donald 
 
 Trump's benefit. And more than that, when you look at the polling, what you actually find is that a majority of Americans are actually in favor of DEI 
 
 programs.
 
So, as a political analyst, this attack just simply put -- in my opinion, it doesn't make sense. Even if it plays to the Republican base, to the 
 
 middle of the country, where this election is going to be won or lost, I think it is a losing message, and a losing message, surprisingly, from a 
 
 campaign, the Donald Trump campaign, that so far, has actually hat its head on right and has actually put forward a campaign that had, in fact, put 
 
 Donald Trump into the lead, at least before Joe Biden got out of the race.
 
NEWTON:  Yes, exactly. And they've been quite clever about their campaign that way, but they realize it, which is likely why the Republican speaker, 
 
 Mike Johnson, tried to walk it back quite quickly. OK. To more numbers now. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll. OK, it, happened Monday and Tuesday. So, really 
 
 recently, when Harris jumped into this race.
 
So, you have her at 44. Donald Trump at 42. This is all within the sampling error of plus or minus 3 percent. So, back to the numbers, back to the 
 
 data, what can you tell us about the numbers we just saw there, but more importantly, about those swing states and how Harris may or may not move 
 
 the needle where it counts?
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
ENTEN:  Yes, you mentioned the swing states, that's where obviously it matters. We'll talk about that national poll first. I should point out that 
 
 Reuters/Ipsos has tended to be one of Donald Trump's actually worst pollsters. So, the fact that even if it's within the margin of error, 
 
 right, no clear leader, the fact that he's trailing by two, that doesn't really mean all that much to me. I think that is well in line with what we 
 
 saw before Joe Biden exited the race when, of course, back then it was just a hypothetical matchup between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
 
But it's a close race nationally. There's no doubt about that. But ultimately, this comes down to the battleground states, a lesson that was 
 
 well learned by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Al Gore in 2000, where they won more votes nationally, but lost the presidential election.
 
What we know is that at least based upon the current coalitions, and of course, this may change given, of course, that Harris just got into the 
 
 race, but traditionally, over the last few cycles, the Democrats have had to win nationally by at least a few percentage points in order to win in 
 
 the Electoral College. We're talking about states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.
 
If Harris wins by two points nationally, let's just say that poll is directly on, I still think Trump would be the slight favorite. Because he 
 
 simply put -- has more voters in those states that kind of line up with how sort of the breakdown has been going down where he can lose by two points 
 
 nationally and still win.
 
But if that poll is exactly right, I honestly am not sure who would necessarily win. And we're just going to have to wait and see, because some 
 
 of that swing state polling had really turned against Joe Biden after that presidential debate. We have limited numbers on Harris. What we do know is 
 
 that she tended to do better, at least in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pennsylvania, of course, probably being the most important swing state than 
 
 Joe Biden did at least before the announcement. And if that two-point lead is right, I wouldn't be surprised that the first swing state polls that 
 
 came out perhaps showed Harris down by a point or two in the states that ultimately matter.
 
But I got news for you, a point or two with still more than 100 days to go until the election, that's game on. That's a race that is way too close to 
 
 call, and one in which on the day of the election, even if we had polls looking like that, it'd be a race that'd be way too close to call. We'd 
 
 have to wait until all the votes were counted to really have any gosh darn idea who was going to win.
 
NEWTON:  Any gosh darn idea. Harry, we're going to continue to do data, we're going to do numbers, we're going to do it all for the next 100 days, 
 
 and we're going to pull you into it, because we're not afraid of math, right? We're not afraid of the data.
 
ENTEN:  We're not afraid of math. I think math is fun.
 
NEWTON:  So, do I. I think we're alone, though, in that tally. But we'll still look at these polling numbers. All good. Harry Enten for us. Thanks 
 
 so much. Appreciate it.
 
ENTEN:  Thank you.
 
NEWTON:  Still to come, dozens killed and thousands displaced as an Israeli offensive ravages the Southern Gazan City of Khan Yunis. We'll have that 
 
 story when we come back.

 <br>[18:40:00]
 
NEWTON:  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on a long-anticipated visit to Washington, but the timing less than ideal. His trip overshadowed 
 
 by an upheaval in U.S. politics after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race.
 
Mr. Netanyahu will address both houses of Congress Wednesday, the same day Mr. Biden speaks to the nation about his decision to drop out of the race. 
 
 Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet President Biden on Thursday and Former President Trump on Friday.
 
Jewish Voices for Peace, a self-proclaimed anti-Zionist group, launched a sit in protest meantime south of the capital calling for a ceasefire in 
 
 Gaza and an end to arms sales to Israel. Images, as you can see there, show people being detained by police. Kylie Atwood has our report.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Paula, there is optimism from U.S. officials in terms of these ongoing negotiations to try 
 
 and reach a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. These efforts have been going on for quite some time now, but late last week, the 
 
 secretary of state said that they are within the 10-yard mark here, but that the last 10 yards can often be the hardest and they're still sticking 
 
 points.
 
We'll watch and see where this goes, particularly this week, when prime minister -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting 
 
 Washington. And the family members of hostages are making their voices quite loudly heard here in Washington this week, many of them traveling to 
 
 the city to make sure that members of Congress and members of the Biden administration who are meeting with Netanyahu are making it very clear that 
 
 they believe that there is a deal to be had now.
 
They're urging, pressuring that there is a deal that should be taken by Netanyahu, and they're making their voices heard while he's here in 
 
 Washington, meeting with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and the president of the United States. Paula.
 
NEWTON:  Our thanks to Kylie Atwood there. Now, meantime, an Israeli official has confirmed to CNN that a delegation will be arriving in Cairo 
 
 on Wednesday for ceasefire negotiations there. The pressure for a ceasefire comes after a fresh ground assault by IDF forces in the southern city of 
 
 Khan Yunis that led to dozens of deaths and thousands being forced to flee yet again. That's according to Gaza authorities.
 
Nada Bashir has more now, but a warning. The report contains images that some viewers may find distressing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Forced to flee once again to yet more uncertainty. Whole families carrying whatever belongings they still 
 
 have. Ordered to evacuate Eastern Khan Younis by the Israeli military.
 
The sound of gunfire sending women and children running for safety, but there is nowhere left to take refuge.
 
It all happened suddenly, Mohammad Abdul-Jawad says. They told us to go to the safe area, but there is nowhere safe left in Gaza. We have to leave all 
 
 our belongings in our tents. Where do we go now?
 
The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas infrastructure in Khan Younis. Claiming its forces have targeted weapons storage facilities, 
 
 observation posts, and underground tunnel routes in the area. As a result, civilians have been warned to move to a readjusted and more restricted 
 
 humanitarian zone in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi.
 
But such humanitarian zones have themselves become targets in the past. And Israel's promise of safety means little to those who have already suffered 
 
 so much.
 
I didn't want to leave, but when the warplanes and tanks started striking us, I was scared for my four children, Um Hazem says. Where should I take 
 
 them now?
 
For some here in Gaza, there is also growing frustration with Hamas.
 
We've had enough. We're exhausted, Riham says. Look at what they're doing to us. We're being destroyed. They're all hiding underground and have left 
 
 us to be destroyed.
 
In Central Gaza, meanwhile, there is only more devastation. Wounded civilians were rushed to the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on Tuesday following 
 
 a deadly strike. A familiar scene of panic and chaos in the overrun hospital as the injured are treated on the ground and the dead are covered 
 
 in makeshift shrouds.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
Since Monday, Gaza's health ministry says more than 100 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes artillery fire. A gut-wrenching figure, 
 
 but only a fraction of the more than 39,000 people killed in just under 10 months of unending horror in Gaza.
 
Nada Bashir, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON:  Now, as negotiators hope to make progress between Israel and Hamas for that ceasefire deal, and of course the hostage deal we were talking 
 
 about, Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, have apparently agreed to end their divisions, and that was during meetings that were held 
 
 in Beijing. From there now, Marc Stewart has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  As we've seen from our post here in Beijing, China is trying to establish itself as an alternative to the west, 
 
 and as it deals with challenges here in Asia, it's also trying to develop a role as a political player in the Middle East.
 
In the case of talks between Hamas and Fatah, we actually saw earlier discussions hosted by Beijing back in April. And if we look back even 
 
 further, since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, China has tried to serve as a leading voice for nations condemning Israel and calling 
 
 for Palestinian statehood.
 
The Middle East is a part of the world where the United States has long been a dominant power, and experts have questioned if China can have the 
 
 same geopolitical clout.
 
Yet, last March, Beijing played a role in helping to establish better relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after diplomatic friction.

NEWTON:  OK. Next for us, how do you keep more than 10 million spectators safe? That's the challenge Paris is facing with the upcoming Summer 
 
 Olympics. We take a close look at security preparations there.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON:  Can you believe it? We are less than three days away now from one of the most high-profile sporting events in the world, the Summer Olympics. 
 
 All eyes, of course, on Paris, and security forces there obviously are not taking any chances as France's terror alert remains at its highest level. 
 
 The opening ceremony will be 45,000 police officers and soldiers. Melissa Bell has our preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Paris is taking no chances. Hopes of a spectacular Olympics stopped by fears of 
 
 the worst.
 
BELL:  Part of the problem for French authorities is the sheer ambition that lies at the heart of these games. For the very first time, an Olympic 
 
 opening ceremony is going to happen not inside a stadium but actually through the very city on its main artery on the Seine River itself.
 <br>[13:50:00]
 
BELL (voice-over):  Despite a terror threat in France that's still at its highest level some 320,000 people are expected to line the banks of the 
 
 river over six kilometers to watch, the biggest crowd ever to attend such an event in person.
 
GEN. ERIC CHASBEOUF, OLYMPIC GAMES MILITARY FORCE:  We'll have more than 10,000 soldiers, more than 35,000 policemen. It will be completely secure.
 
BELL (voice-over):  Street patrols leave regularly from the largest military camp erected in France since the end of World War II. And beyond 
 
 the terror threat, there are also fears linked to crime, social unrest, and cyberattacks.
 
NICOLAS NORMAN, PARIS DEPUTY MAYOR FOR SECURITY (through translator):  There are lots of exercises, crises simulations, sometimes quite 
 
 extraordinary events where everyone during an entire day tries to anticipate and then to manage them. And so today, we're ready and we're 
 
 calm.
 
BELL (voice-over):  The Olympic flame arrived in Paris to welcoming crowds, but nothing compared to what is to come. Officials say that some 10 to 15 
 
 million people are expected, far too many for human eyes only to watch so A.I. has been brought in to help monitor CCTV.
 
MATTHIAS HOUILLIER, CO-FOUNDER, WINTICS:  They need to detect abnormal situations like, for example, when there is intrusion of people on 
 
 railways, when there is unattended item that could be suspicious package, et cetera. We detect them and then the operator gets notified in real-time 
 
 so that he can decide what should be done.
 
BELL (voice-over):  An unprecedented security operation made up of police, military, foreign forces and even A.I. startups that officials hope has 
 
 made Paris ready for anything.
 
Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON:  Now, the Olympic torch is set to be carried by someone who's no stranger to lighting up. U.S. rapper Snoop Dogg will be one of the last 
 
 flame bearers before the torch reaches its final destination at the Eiffel Tower. He will carry it through the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. After 
 
 that, he'll puff, puff, pass it to someone else. I didn't do that very well, did I?
 
The rapper says he grew up watching the Olympics and is already in France. He tweeted a picture of himself with the caption, you ready? Love it.
 
Now, from the summer Olympics to the summer of brat. British pop star Charli XCX breaking the internet this week calling Kamala Harris an 
 
 honorary brat. The name of the singer's recently released album. Now, the Harris campaign quickly jumping on that brat bandwagon, and why wouldn't 
 
 you, turning their X profile colors brat green. As Kamala joins the brat pack, Anna Stewart explains what brat mania is all about.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Last summer, the world went pink.
 
RYAN GOSLING, ACTOR, "BARBIE":  So cool.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Buses, shop fronts, and billboards. This year, pink is out, and lime green is in. From cosmetics retailers, this now TikTok 
 
 famous deli in Charleston, even London Zoo got in on the action. Charli XCX spawned this trend with the launch of her "Brat" album in June. Slime 
 
 green, basic font, it's irreverent.
 
STEWART:  Am I surprised that it's inspired a whole summer trend? A little bit.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
STEWART (voice-over):  You can look to music videos like "360" for inspiration or get the definition from the artist herself.
 
CHARLI XCX, SINGER-SONGWRITER:  But it can also be like so like trashy, just like a pack of cigs and like a Bic lighter.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.
 
CHARLI XCX:  And like a strappy white top with no bra.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.
 
CHARLI XCX:  That's like kind of all you need.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Beyond that, it's hard to really nail down what Brat Girl Summer looks like.
 
STEWART:  Do you know the answer to this question?
 
EDGAR WRIGHT, FILM DIRECTOR:  Charli XCX.
 
STEWART:  Yes. You know, you know -- 
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Stumbling upon film director Edgar Wright was worth further investigation.
 
WRIGHT:  Charli XCX. There we go.
 
STEWART:  Are you Brat Girl Summer?
 
WRIGHT:  Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I hope so. Not today. I don't feel like I am today. But like the boots kind of are.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  SPF and your girlies.
 
STEWART:  What? What does that even mean?
 
STEWART (voice-over):  This is just the latest micro trend. Recent ones include Gorpcore, Coastal Grandma, and last year's Tomato Girl Summer.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it has a bit of that if you know you know angle. Like, if you understand it, you want to buy into it. It doesn't 
 
 guarantee viral success. But it's just very easy to hop on and people will enjoy it.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  With engagement that easy, even politicians are having a Brat Girl Summer. It was a bratty election campaign for the U.K. 
 
 Green Party, and now, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping slime green will appeal. And Charli approves.
 
STEWART:  Go enjoy your Brat Girl Summer.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, my god, thank you. You too. Have a Brat Girl Summer.
 
STEWART:  Have fun. Bye.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bye.
 
STEWART:  I like Brat Girl Summer.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Anna Stewart, CNN London.
 
Do you know what Bra Girl Summer is?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.

NEWTON:  Is there ever any doubt. Now, finally on "First Move," a final word on the Kamala Harris saga. And while life sometimes may imitate art, 
 
 the creator of the political comedy "Veep" had to remind the internet that the TV series, get this people, it's a work of fiction, not in fact, based 
 
 on real-life. Here's a snippet of the show.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm not leaving. Potus is leaving. He's not going to run for a second term. I'm going to run.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I did not see that coming.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  "Veep," which ended in 2019, starred Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a female VP, who eventually becomes president after someone drew comparisons 
 
 now between that and real-life. The creator, Armando Iannucci, reminded us on X, don't forget we made all that up though.
 
We cannot forget. What a great show. And thank you, because that wraps up this show. Thanks for joining us. I'll see you right here tomorrow.
