<br>[14:00:00] 
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Hamas claims a car ramming attack in Tel 
 
 Aviv is a direct response to Israeli Defense Forces raid of Jenin. Then, Russia shoots down drones over Moscow, as Putin takes to the international 
 
 stage for the first time since the insurrection. 
 
And France, quieter after days of riots, but what's next? I'll ask the country's finance minister about the ingrained inequality angering 
 
 protesters. But first tonight, a new round of violence in the Middle East is spilling onto Israeli territory. Authorities say, at least, eight people 
 
 have been injured in Tel Aviv in what they're calling a terror attack. 
 
Surveillance footage captures a moment the attack happened. To the far left, you see a driver ram a truck into a busy sidewalk, barely missing a 
 
 scooter in a bike lane. Well, as this dust settles, customers at a cafe begin to flee. So, that, right there. That's when the assailant exits a 
 
 vehicle and begins stabbing and chasing people. 
 
Part of the attack is blurred, as you can see there. One of the victims injured and alive, limps away and the attacker runs off after other people. 
 
 Well, police say an armed civilian ended the rampage by shooting and killing the assailant. This image shows the person in a motorcycle helmet 
 
 pointing a gun at the person on the ground.
 
This, as Hamas claims responsibility for the attack. The Palestinian militant say the assault is a response to this. Israeli forces launching a 
 
 major operation we've been telling you about in the West Bank centered on Jenin in extensively-populated refugee camp. Palestinian officials say, at 
 
 least, ten people have been killed there. 
 
For the very latest, let's go to CNN's Hadas Gold, who's live for us in this hour in Jerusalem. And Hadas, what more do we know about Tel Aviv, and 
 
 in particular, about this incident in Tel Aviv, in particular about the attacker here? 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, this attack took place in the afternoon hours. We were there, just a few hours ago, and you 
 
 could see just the extent of damage, not only to the truck that was used, you could see in that CCTV video, but also the bus stop that it seemed to 
 
 run into. 
 
And you can see from the CCTV video, that after the attacker rams into the pedestrians, with the people just outside that shopping area, he gets out 
 
 and tries to start stabbing people before he's killed by unarmed civilian. The Israeli police actually telling me that the person who shot him, they 
 
 actually described him as an elderly person shot and killed the attacker. 
 
And as you noted, the military group Hamas has taken credit, saying the person who carried this attack called him one of their fighters, and they 
 
 had been calling for all of their cells, they said, to strike Israel, they said, in any way possible as a result of this ongoing military operation in 
 
 Jenin. And we know from an Israeli defense official, that this attacker had come from the West Bank. 
 
Not from Jenin, from a different part of the West Bank, but had crossed over from the West Bank into Tel Aviv, in order to carry out this attack. 
 
 Now, as we speak right now in Jenin, there are reports of further ongoing, very heavy clashes going on in the occupied West Bank City of Jenin. This -
 
 - I mean, I can't even tell you how many hours we are into this operation as well, but definitely into the second evening of this largest Israeli 
 
 military operation since 2002. 
 
The Israeli military saying that they are trying to essentially dismantle Jenin as a safe haven for militants. And in the process, we are seeing 
 
 heavy clashes, we are seeing the Israeli military using air -- using drone airstrikes, using bulldozers on the streets to tear up the streets. They 
 
 say, to dismantle IEDs. They say they're engaging in heavy fire fights and finding dozens of caches of weapons and explosives. 
 
We're seeing also, though, thousands of residents, we saw some videos there of residents trying to leave the refugee camp with their hands up, to show 
 
 that they are not a threat. Thousands of residents are leaving the camp, not only because of the extent of damage, but also because essential 
 
 services like electricity and water have been damaged as a result. 
 
Now, we are hearing from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was connecting both what was happening in Tel Aviv with what's happening in 
 
 Jenin, saying that they will continue the operation as long as necessary, to uproot terrorism, and they will not allow Jenin to go back to being a 
 
 city of refuge for terrorism. 
 
He also said that whoever thinks that such an attack will deter us from continuing our fight against terrorism is mistaken. So, the Israeli 
 
 military, the Israeli government, giving every indication that while they aren't considering this, you know, sort of a broad, entire West Bank 
 
 operation, they're still very much focusing it on Jenin. 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
They say, they are going to continue for as long as necessary, and that it could continue for another day, perhaps days in the future. In the 
 
 meantime, when we look at the death toll in Jenin, the latest numbers shows 11. When the death toll was at 10, the IDF told me that they believed that 
 
 no non-combatants had been killed as a result, but they did acknowledge that amongst the more than 100 injured, that there are civilians amongst 
 
 those injured. Isa? 
 
SOARES: Hadas, thank you very much. We are roughly 44 hours, Hadas, into this operation already. Thank you very much. And as Hadas mentioned there, 
 
 that operation, the Jenin operation has continued today, and it seemed like Hadas was saying, will continue. And we want to bring you up to speed 
 
 really on what exactly what we know right now. 
 
The Israelis have used aircraft, as well as ground forces, and what's said to be their largest West Bank operation in decades. Now, the military says, 
 
 they are targeting groups like Hamas, as well as Islamic Jihad, and they've destroyed labs as well as explosives. They've also said earlier, no known 
 
 combatants had been killed and the injured have been able to receive assistance. 
 
But the Palestinian Red Crescent had said on Monday, its crews were blocked from reaching the Jenin camp. On that same day, Medecins Sans Frontieres, 
 
 MSF, condemned what it claims is a denial of medical access. Israel, meanwhile, has denied access is being blocked. We'll stay on this story for 
 
 you as soon as there are more developments, of course. 
 
We will bring you up to date. Now, Russia is claiming it shot down five Ukrainian drones near Moscow and called it a terrorist attack, while 
 
 Ukraine did not respond to allegations that it was behind the action. Drones have become an everyday weapon in the attempt to control territory. 
 
 The casualties of shelling by drone or rockets are mostly innocent civilians. 
 
Dozens of people, including 12 children, were injured earlier today in the Kharkiv region. Our Ben Wedeman takes a look at this painful war of 
 
 attrition. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A tiny plume of smoke rises above Moscow, as blood seeps into Ukrainian soil near 
 
 an apartment block. Two people were killed by Russian shelling in the southern city of Kherson Tuesday. Dozens of civilians also injured in an 
 
 attack in the Kharkiv region, with medics wrapping bandages around the heads of those wounded. Wow 
 
"I was lying on the sofa", says this woman. "There was an explosion. The balcony was blown off. Everything was blown apart." The relentless 
 
 targeting of Ukrainian civilian structures by Russia comes as the Kremlin says, it intercepted five drones near civilian buildings in Moscow. 
 
DMITRY PESKOV, SPOKESPERSON, KREMLIN: All these drones were either destroyed or neutralized using the appropriate systems. 
 
WEDEMAN: The Defense Ministry says, there were no casualties or damage. But the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called the attack an act of international 
 
 terrorism. An adviser to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, quick to point out the irony, writing, "a terrorist attack is when you have been deliberately 
 
 firing cruise and ballistic missiles at residential areas and crowded pizzerias for 16 months. Terrorism is the main attribute of Russia today. 
 
President Putin attempting to project a different image, one of strength and stability while addressing his allies for the first time since facing 
 
 an armed insurrection by the Wagner Group. 
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator): The Russian people are consolidated as never before. I would like to thank my colleagues from 
 
 the SCO countries who expressed the support for the actions of the Russian leadership, to protect the constitutional order, the life and security of 
 
 Russian citizens. We highly appreciate it. 
 
WEDEMAN: Putin's gratitude, a sign of his questionable grip on power. His fate being tested as Ukraine makes slow progress on the frontlines. 
 
 Zelenskyy, meanwhile, acknowledging difficulties on the battlefield, but claiming his military is retaking territory. Championing the fight ahead by 
 
 drawing inspiration from Ukraine's strongest backer, the United States, on their independence day. 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE: Only the brave gain independence. And only the best of the brave are able to pass the freedom from generation 
 
 to generation. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES: And our Ben Wedeman joins me now from -- live from eastern Ukraine. And Ben, what more are you hearing this hour about this Russian attack in 
 
 the Kharkiv region? 
 
WEDEMAN: Yes, Isa, it happened in the town of Pervomaisk, which is about 100 kilometers from the Russian border. 
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
Now, it was -- it appears to have been hit by some sort of missile. Ukrainian officials say that 43 people were injured as a result of this 
 
 strike, including in this case, 12 children. Now, keep in mind, it's the middle of the Summer here, it's very warm. There were probably lots of 
 
 people outside when that strike happened. It appears that many of the injuries were a result of shattering glass from the building that got hit. 
 
 Isa.  
 
SOARES: Meantime, of course, as you mentioned in that report there, we saw President Putin, the first time we've seen him, of course, since the 
 
 insurrection. Anything that stood out to you from what we heard from him?  
 
WEDEMAN: Well, certainly, his statement to the effect that the Russian people were behind the government during the Wagner uprising. It does seem 
 
 somewhat interesting, given, in fact, that they didn't seem to be. We didn't see much resistance to the Wagner mercenaries as they took over 
 
 Rostov-on-Don early Saturday morning. 
 
And then, their troops started to move up, reached, I believe, just about 250 kilometers away from Moscow. And when we saw that Yevgeny Prigozhin 
 
 actually left the headquarters of the southern military district in Rostov- on-Don, there seemed to be a very appreciative crowd for him, people were cheering him on, taking selfies with Prigozhin. 
 
So, the words that he spoke today via video link with this -- the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, didn't seem to reflect what we actually 
 
 saw going on inside Russia during his short-lived mutiny. Isa?  
 
SOARES: Yes, and of course, is the first time we're seeing him on the world stage, I should clarify. But no reference. He didn't make any reference 
 
 here, Ben, to this drone -- to these strikes that we've seen in Moscow.  
 
WEDEMAN: No, he did not. He was really focusing on the importance of relations with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization members. He did thank 
 
 Iran for its help. Iran, of course, is supplying Russia with those Shahed, Iranian-made drones that have become an almost nightly weapon used by the 
 
 Russians against Ukraine. Isa? 
 
SOARES: Ben Wedeman for us in eastern Ukraine, thanks very much, Ben, appreciate it. Still to come tonight, the gloves are off for the two tech 
 
 giants days after challenging each other physically. Now, Mark Zuckerberg has a challenge for Elon Musk's Twitter.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
SOARES: Well, the past two nights in France have been relatively quiet compared of course, to the violence we've seen after a police officer 
 
 killed a teenager during a traffic stop just a week ago. The French president now saying he believes the worst is over, but that he'll remain 
 
 cautious in the days as well as the weeks ahead. 
 
Emmanuel Macron hosted more than 200 mayors of cities and towns affected by these riots. Just a short-while ago, among them, a mayor whose home was 
 
 attacked this weekend while his family, of course, as we've told you was asleep. And people started to gather last week after the shooting of a 
 
 seven-year-old boy of North African descent. 
 
But these protests against police violence and systemic racism quickly turned into riots, with one minister saying that some of those arrested 
 
 were as young as 12 years old. Well, the government's main focus right now is to restore order. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire joins me now 
 
 live from Paris. 
 
Minister, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us here on the show. I think it's fair to say that, you know, we've all seen some 
 
 truly remarkable violence in the past week. But it now seems that, that is ebbing. Just give us a sense of the impact this has had on daily life and 
 
 as well as on businesses.  
 
BRUNO LE MAIRE, FINANCE MINISTER, FRANCE: This has no impact on daily lives of the 65 million French citizens. And this will not have a deep impact on 
 
 the French growth and the French economy. Of course, this will have an impact on the 1,000 shops that have been robbed, and we are, of course, 
 
 supporting those shops and supporting the entrepreneurs which have been stolen during the riots.
 
But nevertheless, I want to be very direct. The French economy is solid, growth is solid, and the daily lives of all French citizens is not 
 
 threatened by what happened. And we are coming back to a more quiet situation after four or five days of riots in some parts of the country.  
 
SOARES: Yes, and having said that, what we have seen and we heard from the French Business Federation who has told CNN that the rioting will cost 
 
 France more than $1 billion in damages. And then, of course, you also have the cancellations from tourism. And I'm intrigued, who is going to foot the 
 
 bill at a time, of course, when France is facing one of the largest deficits in the world, sir?  
 
LE MAIRE: I cannot confirm the figure of 1 billion euros. And once again, we should take the measure of what really happened. A young boy of 17 years 
 
 has been killed. This is totally unacceptable. And this is totally unforgivable. Let's be very clear, and the French president made it very 
 
 clear that this kind of situation was something totally unacceptable in the French Republic. 
 
Then came the riots, but I want to tell you that many of the rioters do not care about what happens for this young boy of 17 years. They just wanted to 
 
 steal, they just wanted to rob the shops. They just wanted to burn the shops, city halls or schools. And this is also something that nobody can 
 
 accept. There are rules in the French Republic, we are a state of the rule of law. 
 
Everybody has to abide by the rules, and the rules are rules. But please, don't mix all the issues. Even if we have been facing a difficult situation 
 
 during four or five years, and it has been the case in many other developed countries, has been the case in 2011, in the U.K. It has been the case many 
 
 times in the U.S. It has been the case in many other European countries. 
 
This will -- don't -- this will not have an impact on the French growth or on the French attractiveness or on French tourism.  
 
SOARES: And of course, as we mentioned before we came to you, Mr. Le Maire, that you know, President Macron today was meeting with mayors. In the past 
 
 week though, our teams on the ground in Paris, you know, have been hearing from protesters, young protesters who tell us that they are angry, tell us 
 
 they're not being listened to. 
 
Are government ministers listening to these young men and women, and what they say is troubling them. Is anyone sitting down with them?  
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
LE MAIRE: I think that when you are assessing the situation, and I think that we need time to better understand what really happened. But we are 
 
 dealing with very young people, some of the rioters were 12 or 13 years old. You had also very young women among the rioters. And once again, you 
 
 should make very clear, distinction between what happened for this very young boy of 17 years which -- was killed.
 
And this is something once again, totally unacceptable. And the fact that you have 6 or 7,000 young people who just wanted to burn shops, and we are 
 
 assessing whether there were people supporting them, political forces supporting them for the time being. We are just in the process of assessing 
 
 the situation, drawing the consequences of what happened. 
 
And the key point is to have the situation calming down, to come back to a quiet situation, which is the case now. And I hope that it will be the case 
 
 for the next days and the next weeks.  
 
SOARES: And at the height of these protesters that we were covering here on the show, the U.N., and you must have seen then, this, as well, Finance 
 
 Minister, called on France to address what it called deep issues of racism and discrimination in its police force. So I am really wondering whether 
 
 there is any openness by the government to look at some of the basic grievances of those protesters. In particular, the rules on lethal force by 
 
 police. Is this something the government would consider?  
 
LE MAIRE: I think that we are opened to any kind of questions, any kind of inquiry. But we cannot accept to have the U.N. or any other institutions 
 
 explaining that there is systemic racism in the French police. This is not the case, and this will never be the case. And I think that every French 
 
 citizen feels really hurt by that kind of criticism.
 
Because the fact is that policemen are protecting the people, are protecting very often the poorest people in the French population. And if 
 
 there is, at some point, one citizen which -- is not abiding by the law, and which -- is experiencing some kind of racism, he will be sued, he will 
 
 be prosecuted and he will be condemned. Because we are a state of the rule of law. 
 
And there is no place for any kind of racism, neither in the police nor in any other institution in the French society and in the French state. Let's 
 
 be -- 
 
SOARES: So, then -- 
 
LE MAIRE: Very clear about that, we cannot accept that kind of criticism against the French police.  
 
SOARES: And you said no French citizen would accept that. But here on this show, I spoke to a French award-winning filmmaker and journalist who told 
 
 me this. Have a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROKHAYA DIALLO, WRITER, JOURNALIST &amp; FILMMAKER: I think that there have been many moments like this. Eighteen years ago, two teenagers were chased 
 
 by the police for no reason, and they died after being chased. And they were uprising that lasted over 3 weeks. And it was a turning point to 
 
 acknowledge the fact that, a large part of the population was, you know, not white, but it didn't change the framing and the -- and the -- and the 
 
 institution of the police. 
 
So, it's new because the president actually said that it was unacceptable. But at the same time, I'm afraid that he just makes an example out of that 
 
 single individual, the police officers, and do not acknowledge the fact that the problem is structural. It doesn't -- it's not only one person, but 
 
 it's not one bad apple.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: So Minister, is this then a structural problem? Your thoughts on what you just heard from a French citizen there.  
 
LE MAIRE: You know, in every society, you can have at some point one citizen can be a policeman, he can be any other citizen, which -- is not 
 
 abiding by the rule, and which -- is doing something that he should never do. This can be the case, and this might happen sometimes in the French 
 
 society, like in the American society or in any other society in Europe. 
 
In that case, that citizen will be sued, prosecuted and condemned. But the point on which I totally disagree is that, should draw the consequence from 
 
 one bad behavior. From one single citizen, maybe one single policeman. The consequence that the police in France could have a shattered(ph) problem 
 
 with racism. 
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
This is not the case, and I wouldn't believe you. You know, I've been elected for more than 20 years now. I've been in politics for more than 20 
 
 years. I'm fully aware of the difficulties that some institutions might face vis-a-vis racism. But I cannot accept to put the blame on all the 
 
 French police as an institution. I cannot accept to put the blame on all the French policemen that are doing their job, doing their best to have a 
 
 calm situation in the French society.  
 
SOARES: I understand that. But as you well know, Finance Minister, Nael's death wasn't an isolated incident, we're reporting on this, was a third 
 
 fatal shooting during traffic stops in France so far in 2023. I saw "Reuters" reporting, there were record 13 such shootings -- 
 
LE MAIRE: But this is -- 
 
SOARES: Last year. 
 
LE MAIRE: This is a re-blend, this is totally unacceptable, and I made it very clear -- 
 
SOARES: So is this -- you say it's not a structural problem. It's not a structural problem. It's not a structural problem, but is it a problem? And 
 
 do you fear that this will repeat itself if you're not sitting down with some of these young people who have very important grievances to air.  
 
LE MAIRE: But nobody can accept that during a traffic control, a young boy of 17 years can be shot dead. Of course, and nobody is explaining that this 
 
 is usual, or that we could accept such a tragedy. This is a tragedy. This is a tragedy for all French citizens. And this is why now justice -- the 
 
 French justice is in charge, must explain exactly what happened, must deliver the truth on what really happened during this traffic control and 
 
 draw all the legal consequences of what happened.
 
But I don't want to have this kind of interpretation that because there has been a tragedy in the French society, there would be a structural problem 
 
 with the French police. This is not -- 
 
SOARES: Understood -- 
 
LE MAIRE: The case, and for us, speaking that kind of critics hurt the French citizens and the French population.  
 
SOARES: And finally, as I've got you here, Finance Minister, I'm not sure whether you've seen this. But there's a crowd-funding campaign out there 
 
 that's been started by a far-right TV pundit. The intent is to raise money for the family of the policeman who killed Nael. As you can see there on 
 
 your screen, we have it divided, that policeman has raised -- topped more one more -- $1 million. That outstrips donations to the woman who has lost 
 
 her 17-year-old son. Your reaction.  
 
LE MAIRE: You know, we are in a situation where we need peace, appeasement, and to come back to calm situation. That kind of court funding is not 
 
 intended to put a peaceful situation and to create a peaceful situation. But it would create more tensions in the French society. This is the only 
 
 comment I want to make on that court funding we should avoid. 
 
Any decision or any act that could break the French harmony and the French union, because this is what today is really necessary for the French 
 
 society.  
 
SOARES: French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us this evening. Thank you, sir.  
 
LE MAIRE: Thank you so much. 
 
SOARES: Thank you. 
 
LE MAIRE: Now, turn now to something totally different. In the world of tech, the gloves are off in the tech roll between Elon Musk and Mark 
 
 Zuckerberg -- no, they're not taking to a ring, no, at least, not yet. The two billionaire executives have expressed interest in meeting in the ring, 
 
 of course, for a cage fight. That much, you know. 
 
But a more consequential face-off may soon be in the cards too. Meta is preparing to launch a Twitter competitor called Threads. It's a new app 
 
 offering real-time conversations. Does it sound familiar? Joining us for more is our Anna Stewart. So, Anna, just talk us through, I mean, how would 
 
 it actually differ from Twitter?  
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: That is a good question. It hasn't launched yet, we'll get to see it -- 
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
I can show you some teasers that are -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
STEWART: Up on the app store, and you'll see that the interface, the functionality looks awfully like another social media platform called 
 
 Twitter. Whether it's the fact that you're seeing messages in Threads, or the functionality in terms of the buttons underneath, which are like, re-
 
 post, reply, share. So very much a rival, I would say, to Twitter. This isn't new. This isn't just Meta doing a copycat. All social media platforms 
 
 do this. Instagram Reels copy -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
STEWART: TikTok. Twitter have announced they wanted to have encrypted messages and calls this year. That threat is on WhatsApp. So this is 
 
 nothing new. But this one is quite threatening, I would say. 
 
SOARES: Why? 
 
STEWART: Two reasons. 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
So first of all, this will be linked to Instagram, which already has a user base of over 2 billion monthly active users. So unlike any of the other 
 
 rivals we've seen to Twitter, like Truth Social or Bluesky recently, this already has a user base. 
 
Secondly, Twitter is not having a great time at the moment. They're in the middle of a huge transition; not everyone thinks it's going very well, 
 
 whether it was removing people's blue ticks, whether it was reinstating people who were banned for hate speech and misinformation, whether it was 
 
 just the outage on the weekend, where temporarily, we're told, tweets have been limited for people viewing through. 
 
There are issues. So there might be a few users out there who are ripe for the picking. 
 
SOARES: But Meta and Bluesky have tried it, they didn't get very far. They weren't very successful in trying to copy Twitter. 
 
STEWART: Meta has got more users and deeper pockets. 
 
SOARES: So Twitter is watching this and thinking, what?
 
STEWART: Elon Musk probably isn't at all concerned because very little concerns him at this stage. This battle is interesting. But frankly we all 
 
 want to see if and when the other, the real fight -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: On that, who will win?
 
Who is your money on?
 
STEWART: I would love to see Elon Musk win. He is perhaps not as fit --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Anna, thank you very much. 
 
And this just coming in to CNN, we will bring you an update on our top story, if you've been watching the last 31 minutes or so. 
 
The Israeli military says it is leaving the Jenin camp in the West Bank right now, that's what we're being told, that's after an operation that 
 
 lasted nearly two days, 44 hours, in fact, this operation has lasted. 
 
Palestinian officials say at least 10 people have been killed in the operation, said to be the Israeli military's largest in the West Bank, in 
 
 two decades. Of course, we know that about 10 people have been killed, 100 others have been injured. That is according to Palestinian officials. 
 
We have seen videos obtained by CNN, showing Israeli bulldozers tearing up the streets to disarm which they call potential explosives. We have seen 
 
 Israeli tanks outside the city limits. 
 
This time, roughly yesterday, we did hear from Benjamin Netanyahu who said this would last as long as is necessary. And what we are seeing right now 
 
 is that is now coming to an end. 
 
The Israeli military says it is leaving Jenin. We will stay on top of the story as soon as there is any more reaction. We shall bring that to you. 
 
And still to come this evening, in the U.S., the 4th of July weekend was marred by mass shootings. We will be live in Texas next.

SOARES: Welcome back, everyone. 
 
It was supposed to be a joyful day in the United States, celebrating Independence Day was marred by violence. At least three people were killed 
 
 and eight others were injured overnight in Texas. 
 
In the meantime, in Philadelphia, five people were killed after a gunman opened fire in one neighborhood. When officers arrested the suspect, he was 
 
 armed with an AR-15 style rifle, a handgun and wearing a bulletproof vest stocked with ammunition. 
 
Meanwhile, police in Baltimore are still searching for multiple suspects in a deadly mass shooting in a block party on Saturday night. Two people were 
 
 killed, if you remember, 28 were injured. Joining me now from Ft. Worth, Texas, is Ed Lavandera, CNN senior national correspondent. 
 
Ed, it's good to see you. Look, police are saying that this was a community celebration that ended with gunfire. 
 
What more can you tell us?
 
What are you hearing from neighbors?
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's the polar extremes of what this national holiday has been for members of this community. Moments 
 
 ago where we are there was a 4th of July typical neighborhood parade. Horses going, by old vintage cars going by as well. 
 
And then this is the very spot where that shooting happened. Over my shoulder here, you might see a woman sitting there in a lawn chair 
 
 surrounded by friends. She is the mother of one of the victims who was killed here last night. He was 18, a manager at a local fast food 
 
 restaurant and was planning to join the U.S. Air Force. 
 
So this is the extreme of what these families and residents here are dealing with. This shooting erupted around midnight the night before the 
 
 July 4th festivities. And there were hundreds of people gathered out here last night, celebrating in a chaotic way. There were fireworks going off 
 
 and people were spinning out their cars in the middle of the road. 
 
And that is when the gunfire erupted. Police have not made any arrests but there were 11 people wounded. Three of them were killed. So the magnitude 
 
 of this is really striking. 
 
But investigators say they have not been able to make any arrests yet. Witnesses believe there were multiple people firing their weapons. We have 
 
 not heard that from official investigators here at this point. 
 
But it speaks to the chaotic moments that unfolded here as people were running for their lives from this scene. But there were three people who 
 
 were not able to get away. They were killed in that gunfire last night; eight others being treated in local hospitals. 
 
And that is where we are right now, a day that is supposed to be a national day of celebration. And looking over my shoulder here, you can hear the 
 
 poor mother of this 18 year victim, who is crying helplessly about what she's experiencing and what her family's enduring here today. 
 
SOARES: And Ed, one 18 year old, what more do you know about the other two that were killed?
 
LAVANDERA: We haven't been able to confirm much on those victims. But we are waiting on official word from family members. They were mostly young 
 
 people, who were out here last night in the late night celebration. 
 
You can deduce from there that these stories of the victims that were impacted by this are young lives, either cut violently short by gunfire or 
 
 altered dramatically because of this gun violence. 
 
SOARES: Ed Lavandera for us in Ft. Worth, Texas. Thanks so, much we really appreciate it. 
 
And this just in to CNN. The Israeli military says it is leaving the Jenin camp in the West Bank right now, after an operation that lasted nearly two 
 
 days. It lasted 42 hours or so. Palestinian officials are saying people have been killed in the operation, about 100 or so injured. 
 <br>[14:40:04]
 
It is said to be the Israeli military's largest in the West Bank in two decades. 
 
The aim was this: to strike what Israel called terrorist infrastructure. They were attacking militant command and control. This is what we've been 
 
 hearing from the IDF for the past 40 hours or so. 
 
We've also seen video of Israeli bulldozers, tearing up the streets, disarming IEDs. The White House has been closely monitoring this. We heard 
 
 from Netanyahu, who said this would last as long as is necessary. 
 
And what we're confirming now in the last 15, 20 minutes is that the Israeli military is leaving Jenin. One of the goals of this operation that 
 
 we heard from the IDF was to break what they called safe haven mentality within the camp. 
 
One official calling it a hornet's nest. After 44 hours, Israeli military are leaving Jenin. We will stay on top of this news for you. The densely 
 
 populated refugee camp central to this operation, the background on the confrontation, CNN's Nada Bashir has a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Jenin, now the focal point of deadly confrontations as the Israeli military launches its largest 
 
 operation against suspected terrorist targets inside the Jenin refugee camp since the Second Intifada. 
 
Jenin refugee camp, located in the north of the occupied West Bank, houses some 17,000 Palestinian refugees across an area that is less than half a 
 
 square kilometer in size. 
 
The vast majority, descendants of Palestinians, who were expelled or fled from their homes after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. 
 
 Over the last two decades, Jenin has seen violence. In 2002, Israel launched a major assault targeting suspected militants. 
 
At the time, the operation was framed by the Israeli government as a response to suicide bombing inside Israel. But the scale of the incursion, 
 
 known as the battle of Jenin, was unprecedented. 
 
The camp faced days of sustained missile and sniper fire, with many residents trapped in their homes, unable to escape to safety. Human Rights 
 
 Watch found that attacks by the Israel Defense Forces were indiscriminate and many civilian deaths amounted to unlawful or willful killings by the 
 
 Israeli military. 
 
Some cases documented by the international rights group even amounted to "summary executions," a clear war crime. It left hundreds of family homes 
 
 destroyed, rendering thousands homeless. 
 
The report also said that many deaths could have been avoided if Israel had done more to protect civilians. But Israel said 23 of their own soldiers 
 
 had died in the fiercest urban warfare the military had experienced in decades, attempting to sustain the minimum number of Palestinian 
 
 casualties. 
 
Scenes from these violent days still stand out today. The Jenin refugee camp emerges yet again in the latest wave of violence in the West Bank. 
 
The Israeli military says it is targeting suspected terrorists in the city, with several Palestinian groups known to have a presence in the camp, 
 
 including Islamic Jihad and other fighters operating as part of the Jenin brigades. 
 
At least 10 Palestinians have been killed so far, with some 100 Palestinians injured and thousands of others forced to flee their homes as 
 
 a result of the ongoing violence and infrastructural damage. 
 
With limited access to electricity, water or internet services, aid agencies have also accuse the Israeli forces of constructing access to the 
 
 camp, a claim the IDF has denied. A spokesperson acknowledged on Monday that civilians were among the injured but insisted that the operation is 
 
 targeting terrorists. 
 
Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas has, however, described the large scale military operation as a new war crime with fears growing over 
 
 the potential for another unprecedented escalation in fighting.

SOARES: In the last 20 minutes or so, the Israeli military says it's leaving the Jenin camp in the West Bank. That has happened 20 minutes ago. 
 
 MSF is also known as Doctors without Borders. And it says Israel tear gas fired into Jenin hospital has made it unusable, as it tries to treat the 
 
 wounded. 
 
I am joined by MSF operations coordinator Jovana Arsenijevic. 
 
And thank you very much for joining us. I'm not sure whether you heard what I said, that we have heard in the last 20 minutes or so the Israeli 
 
 military says it is leaving Jenin. 
 
Your reaction?
 
JOVANA ARSENIJEVIC, OPERATIONS COORDINATOR, MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES: No, we cannot confirm at the moment if they're leaving Jenin as we are in the 
 
 ER and the medical team is actually in the (INAUDIBLE).
 
SOARES: Let's talk about what you have seen, because what I heard is that you have seen tear gas inside the hospital. 
 
Can you tell us what happened and when it happened?
 
ARSENIJEVIC: OK. This morning, there have been several instances of tear gas within the hospital. However at (INAUDIBLE) in the afternoon, tear gas 
 
 was fired in the Jenin hospital. 
 
Medical staff from the (INAUDIBLE) MSF staff had to evacuate these emergency units. There was tear gas in both parts of the hospital, the main 
 
 part and the ER. And therefore, the medical staff was treating the wounded (INAUDIBLE) on the floor of the main hall whereas many of the staff (ph) 
 
 including myself, were treating people for tear gas intoxication. 
 
SOARES: We are showing some footage. CNN has been able to geolocate the hospital. Give us a sense, Jovana, what impact this has had on hospital 
 
 operations here. 
 
ARSENIJEVIC: No, I would like to correct you. So in the morning it was (INAUDIBLE); in the afternoon, it was in the hospital. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Let me clarify, they fired inside the hospital?
 
ARSENIJEVIC: There was tear gas, yes, in the hospital. Correct, yes. 
 
SOARES: So you assume that the tear gas entered the hospital which way?
 
ARSENIJEVIC: (INAUDIBLE)?
 
SOARES: I am just trying to understand how the tear gas actually made its way inside the hospital. 
 
You said the first one was a hospital yard, right?
 
ARSENIJEVIC: Yes. We really don't know how it ended up but the tear gas bomb was in the hospital, in the emergency unit. As (INAUDIBLE) we don't 
 
 know what was happening outside. However we just saw the consequences of it, as I explained before. 
 
SOARES: And in terms of operations, surgeries, how are you treating people?
 
ARSENIJEVIC: Excuse me, can you repeat, please --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Of course. of course. 
 
In terms of operations, how are you treating people?
 
Where did you treat people?
 
Did you have to pause?
 
ARSENIJEVIC: No. So we -- as I mentioned, we were treating people in the main hall and mainly on the floors and not the hospital beds or stretchers, 
 
 as we would usually do because we had to completely evacuate the ER. And it took a longer time for the tear gas to get out, as it's a very small space, 
 
 (INAUDIBLE) space, without proper ventilation. 
 
SOARES: (INAUDIBLE) Jovana Arsenijevic, I appreciate you taking the time to speak to us. I understand you're very busy. Thank you very much, Jovana. 
 
ARSENIJEVIC: Thank you very much. 
 
SOARES: Thank you. 
 
We will be back after this.

SOARES: The tennis legend Roger Federer was honored during a ceremony at Wimbledon, where he received a standing ovation for 1.5 minutes from fans, 
 
 including Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge. You can see there she's to his right. He won eight of his 20 Grand Slam titles right there on Centre 
 
 Court.
 
And he retired from professional tennis last year but he's been keeping busy. CNN's Christina Macfarlane sat down with the GOAT. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROGER FEDERER, EIGHT-TIME WIMBLEDON CHAMPION: I think because I show up in completely different random places nowadays, you know, that some people are 
 
 really surprised and very happy and to, all of a sudden, see me. 
 
I mean, I've had a moment when I did the Orient Express when I was in Venice. 
 
And a guy chased me down and he was like, can I please take a picture? 
 
I'm like, yes. 
 
Are you who you think you are? 
 
I'm like, no, I don't know who you think I am. 
 
He was like, you're Nadal. 
 
I'm like, I'm so sorry, I'm not. You know. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
So I kept on walking and the guy looked and he goes, such a pity he's not Nadal. But he kept on looking back, and I thought he was going to maybe 
 
 figure it out, but he didn't, you know. So, that was quite a --
 
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: He missed his moment.
 
FEDERER: He missed his moment. But he clearly didn't want a picture with me. He wanted a picture with Rafa. But anyway, so I have, obviously, 
 
 moments like these. 
 
Or then like yesterday, when I went to the Coldplay concert, you know.
 
MACFARLANE: This kind of came out of nowhere; suddenly you're up on stage fooling --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
FEDERER: Yes.
 
MACFARLANE: How did that come about?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The greatest tennis player of all time, Roger Federer. 
 
FEDERER: On Saturday night, Chris Martin, he writes, and he goes, like, do you want to come and help us with one of the songs. 
 
You know, I'm like, ooh, really? I don't know. 
 
And I was sitting at dinner. And I read the message to my wife, my two daughters and some friends. And they're like, oh, my god, you got to do it. 
 
 And Myla, my daughter, looks at me goes like, Papa, go, you only have once. 
 
And I'm like, really? 
 
Like, I should be at 50,000 people. And I don't even know what I'm going to do. And then I'm like, you know what, Chris, I'll do it. 
 
What do you want me to do?
 
He said all you got to do is do the shaker, you know, give a beat to the song. So I finished my music career on top, because I just retired from 
 
 music as well last night.

SOARES: That does it for me for tonight. Do stay right here, "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS" is up next. Have a wonderful evening, I will see you tomorrow,
