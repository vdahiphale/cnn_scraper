SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  Breaking this morning, the dangerous threat from Hurricane Debby. Seconds ago, it just made landfall, battering Florida with powerful winds and heavy rains and could cause catastrophic flooding in three states. We are tracking that storm.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  And the announcement could come at any minute. We are standing by to find out who Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen as her running mate.
 
And then ten years ago, a dead bear cub was found under a bike in Central Park. Now, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has confessed that he was the one who put it there. We promise the whole thing is even weirder than it sounds.
 
Kate Bolduan is out today. I'm John Berman with Sara Sider and this is CNN News Central.
 
SIDNER:  Just a few seconds ago, Hurricane Debby made landfall. The Category 1 storm is lashing Florida's Big Bend region. Right now, life threatening storm surge and wind gusts as high as 100 miles per hour are the biggest concern as the sun begins to rise.
 
But the rain and what comes next for Georgia and South Carolina are raising even more alarm. This morning, more than a million people are under an extremely rare level four out of four risk for excessive rain, catastrophic flooding expected to last for days.
 
Let's get right to Elisa Raffa, who is in Florida with us. Elisa, it just made landfall just now. Can you give us some sense of what you're experiencing where you are?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  You know, it's incredible Sara because we have been in the center of the eye. So, those winds were whipping when we were in the eye wall and they have calmed down a little bit now that we were in the eye and they're starting to pick up again.
 
We are at the location, Steinhatchee, Florida, where Debby's center just made landfall with 80-mile-per- hour winds. Winds have been howling all night as we dealt with all of the outer bands and part of that eye wall overnight, intense wind and rain. We've had rainfall totals around this area over eight inches. Storm surge from Cedar Key up into the Big Bend we have seen approaching six feet and increasing as the storm continues to push that wind on shore.
 
Where we are got impacted by Idalia last year. A lot of these docks that you see behind me, locals here were telling us they're new, they literally just replaced them because they all got destroyed in Idalia last year. They were also showing us some places that they just gutted and fixed from Idalia's flooding last year. And, again, they were worried about what this storm could do and that could ruin the progress that they've made in the year since.
 
Now, after -- now that Debby has made landfall, it will continue to push inland. But the problem is it slows down significantly to a crawl. You could literally walk faster than the forward speed of the storm as it gets towards Georgia and South Carolina. The problem with that is when you have a tropical system that just sits and spins, it will drop prolific amounts of rain. We're talking historic levels, 20 to 30 inches, over parts of the low country of Georgia and South Carolina could challenge records that were left from Florence in parts of South Carolina, so really worried about catastrophic flooding.
 
On top of that as well, we have the freshwater flooding from the rain that will come down, the heavy rain from the storm. But we also continue to have that onshore flow along those coasts as well. So, when you have that heavy rain coming down, plus the ocean pushing inland, you have nowhere for any of that water to drain. So, incredibly worried about a catastrophic situation unfolding along the Georgia and South Carolina coast, and this lasts through the week. So, we have landfall happening right now, but this will last for days. Really, we'll be tracking it through the entire work week here from the heavy rain and the storm surge impacts.
 
But for now, again, the winds here have been on the calmer side as we're in the center of the storm right now in Steinhatchee, waiting to get the other end of that eye wall where those winds will pick up again. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  You know, it's incredible you and your crew going through that whole situation, where the eye goes over on top of you. Everything is silent and then suddenly those winds whip up again.
 <br>[07:05:00]
 
They have to remind people that just because it goes calm doesn't mean that it's over. And it is the rain, not the wind, in this case, that could be the real danger to people across three states.
 
Elisa Raffa, thank you so much, from Steinhatchee, Florida, there giving us a view of that incredibly powerful wind storm that she's dealing with right now.
 
BERMAN:  I was standing right there one year ago for Idalia as it came in. Obviously, as Elisa said, it's the flooding that's the main concern here with the rain and the storm surge.
 
Let's get right to Derek Van Dam in the Weather Center for the latest on that, Derek.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, John, I'm so glad that this storm is now making landfall because that means it's losing its energy source, which is the warm waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. So it's taking away its opportunity to strengthen the winds. But as you mentioned, it's the rain that is going to be the big factor. When the history books are written and we look back at this storm, that will certainly be the big story because there is a prolific amount of rain, as Elisa just mentioned, coming, and it's already fallen as well.
 
Here's a look at the storm surge. The next couple of hours, we still have to contend with this as we push up the waters from the very shallow Gulf of Mexico, into the Big Bend. We like to call this the catcher's mitt and you can exactly see why, Hurricane Idalia from last year, just a few miles away from where Debby just made landfall. And so we're seeing some of those impressive storm surge totals near Cedar Key, about six feet right now.
 
Now, the eye wall just crossed, 50 percent of that eye wall just crossed near Steinhatchee, where Elisa is located. And that is why the National Hurricane Center called landfall just moments ago. There it is, and that's why she's in that calm part of the storm, but it's the backside of the storm that can catch people off guard.
 
Now, the rainfall and flash flooding threat, this is a major problem. Look at that shade of red, the entire West Coast, the Big Bend there off the Florida Peninsula under flash flood warnings.
 
But this is new this morning as well. We have flood watches that have been extended into Southeast Georgia and portions of South Carolina, because we know what's coming. We have a high risk, a very rare high risk for flash flooding from the Weather Prediction Center. That's a level four of four. Look at Savannah and Charleston right smack dab in the middle of that high risk on Tuesday. That's when we anticipate the heaviest of rain because Debby will reemerge off the coast of the Atlantic. It'll pick up, intensify and use some of that Atlantic Ocean water to help drive in some more moisture to this region, and rainfall totals here will be impressive. The wording of catastrophic and extreme are being used from the National Hurricane Center, and they could, again, rival some of the state records from previous tropical cyclones.
 
And, John and Sara, it was heartbreaking for me to see just what Fort Myers Beach had to deal with yesterday from this nearby storm. Flash flooding and storm surge for them after they were wracked by Hurricane Idalia last year.
 
BERMAN:  All right, Derek Van Dam for us, we're going to keep a close eye on this as it moves inland. Obviously, stay with CNN all morning long for an update on that.
 
Plus, really, any minute, we could learn her Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen to be her running mate.
 
And then stock markets around the world on edge. Japan suffered its biggest one day loss ever. What will happen in the U.S. when the markets open in a little more than two hours?
 
And countries pulling their athletes out of Olympic events because they got sick from swimming in the Seine, or at least after swimming in the Seine. E. Coli, not your friend.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:10:00]
 
BERMAN:  This morning, we were in full-on veepstakes alert. The announcement from Vice President Harris, or more likely the leak, could come any minute now.
 
Let's get right to CNN's Eva McKend for the very latest. Eva, I can't tell for sure, but I imagine you were right on the edge of your seat.
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Oh, you know it, John. We know that there are three top contenders, and we believe we spotted Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's motorcade passing by the vice president's residence yesterday, unclear, after, though, a day of interviews with the finalists, Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, if the vice president has made her final decision, as she's really weighing her choices out of public view.
 
Now, Shapiro, he's an extremely popular governor of a vital swing state the Democrats must win. His supporters in recent days have affectionately described him as Baruch Obama. That's a nod to his Jewish faith, of course, and a demeanor and tone, they say, mirrors former President Barack Obama.
 
But progressives have raised concerns about his support for school vouchers, which they argue undermines public education and his position on the war in Gaza. But he could appeal to moderate Democrats.
 
You also have former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly. He's a senator from the battleground state of Arizona. He brings military experience and he's taken positions to the right of the administration on the border. His wife, the former congresswoman, Gabrielle Gifford, she was shot and gravely wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt, and both of them have really become strong voices on efforts to thwart gun violence.
 
And then lastly, you have Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and he's become sort of a dark horse of sorts in this contest. He's extremely funny, a great speaker, a happy warrior, and a strong surrogate for Harris. Many have described him as the Midwestern dad that America needs.
 <br>[07:15:00]
 
He's good at making progressive policies, like universal free meals in schools, which he advanced in his state, sort of a no brainer for even conservatives that might be resistant to government spending.
 
So, those are the people, John, that she is considering. The former president though, say it doesn't matter who she chooses. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I don't care. Let them do whatever. They still want to have open borders. If she picks Shapiro, she's going to lose the Palestinian vote, and that's fine. Everybody has their liabilities.
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I don't really care who she chooses as a running mate. It's not going to be good for the country. And we're ready, meaning President Trump and I are ready, to take the case to the American people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND:  So, you hear them there sort of trying to dampen the enthusiasm that Democrats are feeling right now.
 
But she will roll out this running mate soon. It could be a matter of hours or tomorrow. And they'll be on the campaign trail, the two of them together, starting in Philly. John?
 
BERMAN:  that's right. I mean, we know we're going to see them together. The question is how much before that moment do we get a sense of who that person standing beside her will be? Even McKend, we'll let you get back to reporting. Keep us posted throughout the morning.
 
All right, breaking overnight, RFK Jr. confesses to leaving a dead bear cub in Central Park. Why he said he did not have the time to skin and eat it.
 
Hurricane Debby just made landfall. We're right in the middle of the storm that could set records before it's done, and it won't be done for days, which is the real problem.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:20:00]
 
SIDNER:  Happening today, President Biden set to meet with his national security team in the Situation Room as tensions are escalating in the Middle East. New overnight, video of Israel's Iron Dome intercepting a barrage of rockets fired near its northern border with Lebanon.
 
CNN Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward is in Tel Aviv for us this morning. Clarissa, what are you learning? There is a great deal of fear of attacks coming both from Iran and from Hezbollah.
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Sara. And we have some new reporting from CNN Contributor Barak Ravid for Axios. He is reporting that Secretary of State Tony Blinken is actually called G7 ministers to warn them that attack, that retaliation that everyone has been anticipating, led by Iran, could take place as soon as today. Here in Israel, the home front command still has not changed the alert status. People are going about their lives as usual. There was however a back and forth between Israel and Hezbollah overnight, Hezbollah claiming that it attacked a military base with attack drones, Israel saying that it intercepted those drones and that it hit several Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon.
 
Also, some rockets, according to the IDF, being fired from Gaza, and operations continuing intensively inside the Gaza Strip, Sara, throughout the weekend, at least two schools, which were being used as shelters, were hit in airstrikes. According to Gaza's civil defense, at least 17 people were killed in those strikes. CNN has reached out to the IDF. The IDF says that there was an attack on a Hamas command and control center.
 
So, certainly, tensions here, Sara, very high as people anticipate what this possible retaliation could look like, whether it will resemble Iran's attack of April, whether it may be more coordinated, more intensive, and whether it could push this region over the brink once and for all, Sara.
 
SIDNER:  As you're there, of course, the war in Gaza is still ongoing. Is there any sense of what is happening with the potential ceasefire? Is that completely at this hour seemingly dead?
 
WARD:  At this hour, it appears to be more or less dead in the water. Now, having said that, there has been a flurry of effort to try to resuscitate it, and part of the problem, obviously, Sara, is that the lead negotiator for Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran. So, that is just one of the issues.
 
We know that Secretary of State Blinken, also President Biden, have been putting massive pressure on Israel privately to get back to the negotiating table. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did send a team of negotiators to Cairo over the weekend. But the impression is that basically it sort of hit a brick wall at this stage. And all the while those strikes, those casualties continuing to mount inside Gaza, the health ministry is saying we are now edging ever closer to 40,000 dead inside Gaza, Sara.
 
SIDNER:  40,000 dead in Gaza and still hostages inside Gaza as well. Thank you so much, Clarissa Ward, for all your reporting there in Tel Aviv.
 
All right, ahead, Hurricane Debby has just made landfall. We'll have the very latest on that dangerous storm.
 
And this morning, world markets take dramatic drops and growing uncertainty as the opening bell on Wall Street is around the corner. That's ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:25:00]
 
BERMAN:  All right. The breaking news just moments ago, Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida and the Big Bend area on the West Coast. This thing is expected to bring catastrophic rain as much, as 30 inches in some places, and it will plague the east all week.
 
With us now is the commissioner for Citrus County in Florida District 1, Jeff Kinnard. Thanks so much for being with us, Commissioner. As I said, this is going to affect the east all week. You get it first. Give us a sense of what it's been like and what you're expecting.
 
JEFF KINNARD, COMMISSIONER, CITRUS COUNTY, FLORIDA DISTRICT 1:  Good morning and thank you. It is -- through the night, it's been an awful lot of rain. We've had about six inches of rain so far. The wind in the last couple hours has really picked up. We're at about 40, 45 mile an hour winds here right now, and, unfortunately, it looks like it's going to be a long day ahead for Crystal River and Citrus County.
 <br>[07:30:01]
 
We're seeing a bit of a repeat of Hurricane Idalia. Thankfully, this one does not appear to be as strong --</pre>
