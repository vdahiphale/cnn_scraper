Bystanders trying to restrain the man suspected of driving an SUV into a group of people standing by. This press conference is beginning now. Let's listen in together.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Greg Mendez and several commissioners here. Chiefs Sauceda will be up here and make a brief statement. And he'll take a couple of questions. Right now, we're going to go ahead and escort the man. And just give us one minute.
 
FELIX SAUCEDA, POLICE CHIEF, BROWNSVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT: Good morning.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you state your name, spell it, and then your title, chief?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'll get that spelling to you guys. OK.
 
SAUCEDA: Well, good morning, and thank each and every one of you all for being here today this morning. We really appreciate your all presence. And I am here as Chief of Police for the Brownsville Police Department. Felix, F E L I X Sauceda, S A U C E D A, Brownsville, Texas. And I am here to deliver a brief on the tragic event that took place within our city yesterday.
 
Since the investigation is ongoing, our objective is to provide you a better understanding about what occurred as we currently understand it. Yesterday morning at 8:29 a.m., we received multiple calls for service in regard to a major crash on the 600 block of Minnesota Road. Upon arrival, officers found multiple casualties and several injured. Officers also found a gray SUV with heavy damage and a driver on scene.
 
Through the investigation, it was found that the SUV ran a red light, lost control, flip on its side and stroke a total of 18 individuals. It was further found that there were six fatalities on-scene and told critically injured. From then and now, fatalities have grown to eight.
 
The investigation also revealed that the driver of the vehicle later identified as George Alvarez, on November 9, 1988, had attempted to flee the scene after impact but was held down by several individuals on scene. Investigation also revealed that the driver of the vehicle -- I'm sorry. George Alvarez is a Brownsville local with an extensive rap sheet. 
 
He has been formally charged and arraigned with eight counts of manslaughter, 10 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He has received bonds totaling $3.6 million and we have his picture and record of various previous arrests as we will display to you all right now.
 
I want to thank men and women serving who have worked and continue to process the scene -- the very tragic scene. I'd also like to thank and acknowledge our Brownsville Fire Department for attending to the critically injured. 
 
Our district attorney, Mr. Saenz, our Federal Bureau of Investigation, Oliver Rich, SAC, San Antonio division, Marcus Joachim, ASAC, San Antonio division, Pedro Skalon, (PH) RD for DPS, and multiple other agencies for their unwavering assistance throughout the tragic event.
 
I'd also like to thank multiple individuals that have reached out and supported us. Starting with our city leaders, City management, County Judge, State reps, Aaron Gomez, Janie Lopez, Senator LaMantia, Senator Cornyn, and Governor Greg Abbott. Brownsville is a proud Resilient City. 
 
We will continue to best serve our community as we mourn and continue our investigation. We will work with our network and support to ensure reunification efforts, and victim assistance is made available to all affected. We have established contact with Venezuelan officials and will continue to work with them. Thank you.
 <br>[11:40:13]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any questions?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are they all from Venezuela?
 
SAUCEDA: From what we know, several we.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was he intoxicated, Chief?
 
SAUCEDA: We are waiting on formal toxicology reports.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there a motive that you can talk about?
 
SAUCEDA: None at this point.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Several other witnesses had said that he was cursing at them and saying that they were invaders.
 
SAUCEDA: We have nothing to validate that at this point.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Someone from this side.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, the city of Brownsville has a lot of migrants walking around sidewalks, and streets right now. What's the city doing to keep them in safe places like the city of McAllen (INAUDIBLE) many years?
 
SAUCEDA: So, we have a process in play for that. But this press conference is for the tragedy that we are still investigating at this point.
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Chief, Nick Valencia with CNN. How were you able to rule out that this was not intentional? It sounds like you're saying he lost control.
 
SAUCEDA: We have not ruled that out, sir. It is an ongoing investigation.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
SAUCEDA: (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief?
 
SAUCEDA: Yes, sir.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Has he been caught?
 
SAUCEDA: Not at this point, sir.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Chief, a few questions just quickly.
 
SAUCEDA: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any additional charges or can you talk about how you would get there?
 
SAUCEDA: So, it is an ongoing investigation. And yes, absolutely, charges can change and charges can be added.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But he was arraigned today for reckless driving.
 
SAUCEDA: That is correct. Yes, ma'am.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I just quickly ask about the victims? Can you talk about the process of IDieng those and have you identified the nationalities beyond just Venezuela, are all of them migrants, and what has the process been like reaching out to family?
 
SAUCEDA: So, it has been a very tiresome process, but one that we are deeply committed to doing and accomplishing. We are working with the Venezuelan government right now. And we have also reached out to other embassies.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go ahead, sir.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where's he being kept right now? And is he in any type of special cell or anything like that?
 
SAUCEDA: Here in our facility so no, no special cell.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sorry.
 
SAUCEDA: Yes, ma'am.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) places where migrants are being processed in this city.
 
SAUCEDA: Once again, this conference is about the tragedy that we continue to investigate.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have two more questions, please. Sir, go ahead.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, two questions.
 
SAUCEDA: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a question to follow up.
 
SAUCEDA: Absolutely.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The extent of the injury, sir, if you can, you know, let us know. Some of the videos in ISOC person, you know that there were missing limbs so on and so forth. That's number one. And the follow-up is how can people help you? If they have videos, how -- what did -- what does the police department need? SAUCEDA: Absolutely. So, there are various very critical injuries. And, of course, there was fatalities sadly there at the scene. And we, unfortunately, continue to have a scaling if you would of fatalities, unfortunately. And for the public, right, any and all videos, any and all statements, any and all -- whatever it is that you know that can help us collaborate and bring this investigation you know, to a -- to an end, please reach out to us. As you all know, we have a very robust social media platform. And so please reach out to us.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Last question -- last question. (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, more about the victims, are they all men, and about Mr. (INAUDIBLE) himself too. He seems sober and what a police officers' encountered when he was there.
 
SAUCEDA: So, at this point, I can confirm that they were all males that we know of. And beyond that, we have to wait for official reports.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you all so much for being here. We have the list of charges right there. That mugshot for you all to take pictures of. I have a contact list there in the back for everybody that is not familiar with us to leave your name and e-mail that we can email you any updates further on with this case.
 
As far as that, please send me an e-mail with all your questions from this point from right now, and I will answer them accordingly. Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you so much.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BOLDUAN: All right. We've been listening in to this update and briefing by the Brownsville Police Department. George Alvarez is the man that is now suspected and will be charged in connection with the tragedy that took place on the streets of Brownsville yesterday. 18 people hit by what they say is the vehicle that he was driving. Eight people dead.
 
They also say that he attempted to flee the scene. Now he's facing multiple counts of manslaughter, multiple counts of assault with a deadly weapon.
 <br>[11:45:06]
 
Key Question is why, and they do not have an answer yet. The police chief saying they're -- saying just now they're still waiting for the toxicology report. They do not have a motive at this time.
 
But when asked about if they have ruled out this was an intentional act, the police chief very specifically said they have not ruled that out as the investigation now continues as tragedy has struck Brownsville, Texas. We'll be right back. Much more to come.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) SIDNER: Closing arguments are underway in E. Jean Carroll's civil battery and defamation trial against Donald Trump. Carroll's attorneys just wrapped up after a brief break.
 <br>[11:50:03]
 
The attorneys for the former president will take their term. The former president did not put on defense and ultimately decided not to testify. Carroll alleges he raped her in a New York City Department Store dressing room in the 1990s and then defamed her when he denied it.
 
Joining us now is CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers. Thank you so much for being here. When you look at this case, if a jury comes back -- obviously it's civil, not criminal, right? So, there's no jail time associated. But if a jury comes back in E. Jean Carroll's favor, does that mean, they believe that the president -- former president raped her in the 1990s and then defamed her as well?
 
JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it means either one or the other, right? She has these two causes of action. So, they believe her on one or the other if they come back in her favor. And they'll come back also with the damages amount too. So, we're looking for that, too.
 
SIDNER: That seems like it could be a very big deal if the jury side with E. Jean Carol.
 
RODGERS: It is. It is, of course. Because she says that he raped her. He denies it. I mean, for them to come back in her favor means that they don't believe him, and that he's a rapist effectively if I find that my account.
 
SIDNER: Let me ask you about when it comes to the fact that he did not show up to this trial. You know, a lot of times defendants don't take the stand. But this is a civil case, so it could be quite different. How much damage did that potentially do to his case?
 
RODGERS: A lot, I think. I mean, first of all, it shows that he's not really putting in the time. He doesn't care enough about it to show up.
 
But his testimony that we saw in the deposition released on Friday was really harmful to him. I mean, his demeanor was terrible. He was arrogant and insensitive and insulting.
 
He doubled down on the Access Hollywood tape effectively saying I'm a star. Stars can assault women, and maybe that's OK. So, I think it was really damaging to him for him to not show up on top of that, and at least try to spin it all another way, doesn't really give the jury anything to hold on to if they want to find for him.
 
SIDNER: And I want to show that now. This is of that deposition you were talking about. And here he is, in his own words.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The only difference between me and other people is I'm honest. She's not my type. I would not, under any circumstances have any interest in you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: He goes on to talk about that moment where he was talking about grabbing women in the private parts and saying that that was sort of just a normal everyday thing that you did as a celebrity. So, like you said, if the jury looks at that -- and also he says that she's not my type. But then he also confused her with his wife, Marla Maples, I think at one point, there's a lot that the jury has been looking at. And there are people who are also taking the stand beside E. Jean Carroll, correct?
 
RODGERS: Yes. So, she had two friends of hers who she told at the time back in the 90s, that this had happened to her. Their testimony was very powerful. And other witnesses too.
 
A psychologist who talked about how rape victims process and why not screaming is not surprising, you know, those sorts of things damage a person who talked about the damage to her career and put it in monetary terms. So, she has a lot of evidence. He doesn't have much. We'll see what the jury does.
 
SIDNER: We'll see what the jury does. Thank you so much, Jennifer Rodgers, appreciate you coming on and being here.
 
RODGERS: Thanks.
 
SIDNER: Yes. Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: It was a royal weekend to remember in the UK. Now, after the whirlwind of celebrations, the royal family is that volunteering today. We're going to take you there. That's coming up
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:57:58]
 
BERMAN: So, after a whirlwind weekend celebrating the coronation of King Charles, royal family members were out volunteering at community events this morning. That includes five-year-old Prince Louis, the youngest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales who took part in his first Royal Engagement. I think his father's having more fun by the way in that picture than he is.
 
CNN's Nada Bashir is in London for us. It was an exciting morning for them, Nada.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (on camera): Yes, it absolutely was. The first world engagement for Prince Louis. This follows a whirlwind weekend essentially. This was a moment of history with some thousands of people taking to the streets in London across the weekend not only to of course witness the coronation on Saturday, but we also saw a concert in Windsor, of course, the beloved home of Queen Elizabeth -- the late Queen Elizabeth II.
 
What we did see was Prince William shear a very special message marking the coronation dedicated of course to his father, the new monarch. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRINCE WILLIAM, PRINCE OF WALES: My father's first words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday, were a pledge of service. It was a pledge to continue to serve. Because for over 50 years, in every corner of the UK across the Commonwealth and around the world, he has dedicated himself to serve others. Pa, we are all so proud of you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: Now, of course, today is the last day of the long coronation weekend. For some, it is a day off. For others of course, as was the wish by the royal family, it is a day of volunteering.
 
Now, it has to be said that while there was a real sense of jubilation, certainly people were in high spirits around the coronation, but we did also see some protests. And now we are learning from the state broadcaster the actual viewing figures for the coronation on state TV was actually lower than the viewing of the Queen's funeral by about 5 million. So, this is a bit of a dip. Of course, people are still in high spirits. It has been a very happy weekend overall, John.
 <br>[12:00:01]
 
BERMAN: Nada Bashir, thank you very much for that report. Viewership down, I wonder if it was all related to King Charles' dancing.
 
BOLDUAN: No.
 
BERMAN: I wonder if they saw him dancing and turn the channel.
 
BOLDUAN: No. you tune in -- 
 
SIDNER: That's not what happened.
 
BOLDUAN: You lean into that. You tune in when you see a king dance like that.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 <br>[12:00:00]
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: Nada Bashir, thank you very much for that report. Viewership down, I wondered if it was all related to King Charles' dancing. I wondered if they saw him dancing and turned the channel immediately.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: You lean into that. You tune in when you see a king dance like that.
 
BERMAN: I mean, you can't be (Inaudible) as you can't be impeached for that kind of dancing.
 
BOLDUAN: But you can be shamed by John Berman apparently.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN HOST: It happens. King Berman, he is angling.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you all so much for joining us. This is CNN News Central. Inside Politics starts down.</pre>
