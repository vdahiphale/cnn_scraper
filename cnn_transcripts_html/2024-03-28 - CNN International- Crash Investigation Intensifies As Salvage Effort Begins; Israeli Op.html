ERICA HILL, HOST, "CNN NEWSROOM": Hello, and welcome to our viewers around the world. I'm Erica Hill. This is CNN Newsroom. 
 
Just ahead, investigators collecting, at this hour, evidence about what may have caused that ship in Baltimore to crash into the Key Bridge. This as two of the bodies of victims have been recovered, found in a submerged vehicle. We have more with the latest from the scene. Plus, former billionaire and crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried set to be sentenced later today for his financial crimes, prosecutors recommending decades behind bars. And you'll hear from Britain's King Charles who just released his Easter message, his first since his daughter-in-law Princess Catherine announced her own cancer diagnosis.
 
We begin today in Baltimore. There are a number of developments overnight in the aftermath of the deadly bridge collapse there, including new video of the moments before the ship collided with the Key Bridge. So, the video you're seeing here is from the traffic camera on the bridge. Traffic, of course, had been stopped, thanks to that mayday call which the ship issued a call that we have heard so many times likely saved lives. You can see the ship moving there just on the right of your screen. The NTSB noting unsteady, dangerous conditions due to the debris on top of and around the ship has actually slowed its evidence collection in this investigation. Those conditions are also forcing divers to suspend efforts to find the bodies of additional victims. Two were recovered on Wednesday, found in the submerged vehicle. 
 
We've also learned there are 56 containers that's -- which amounts to more than 760 tons of hazardous material onboard the ship. Some of those containers, officials say, have been breached. The Head of the NTSB noting a sheen was seen on the water. 
 
For the very latest on the investigation, CNN's Gabe Cohen joins us now live from the scene. Gabe, what more do we know about this investigation, and any further information about what may have actually caused this horrific accident?
 
GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. So, Erica, this morning that recovery effort is becoming a salvage operation sadly, even with those four construction workers still missing in the Patapsco River. Officials say it is just not safe for divers to continue to go into the water with all that debris and that steel. It's dangerous for them. And so, at this point, the focus is turning to -- has turned to getting all that steel, the chunks of the bridge out of the water. They're going to be bringing in massive pieces of equipment, cranes, barges, and the goal is to cut it up and remove it from the water. But, of course, that could take days. And an obstacle there is what you referenced, the hazardous material that's been found, more than 700 tons of it. We are talking about flammables, corrosives, lithium, ion batteries. 
 
The Coast Guard says it is not a public health concern even with some spillage into the river. But, it has created an obstacle for crews that can't really access the bow of the ship where the bridge actually came down. And so, again, all of this could take time, as we are learning more about the NTSB's investigation. They finally did analyze that black box from the ship, and they learned much more, Erica, about the minutes leading up to this catastrophe that a total blackout that was experienced on the ship when the pilot lost power and the ability to steer, calling for tugboats to come in and assist, asking the crew to turn left, but with no success. 
 
They are ultimately sending that mayday call out that reached police. They were able to stop traffic, but it was a matter of seconds, Erica, not minutes, and they just could not reach that construction crew on top of the bridge. Now, the big question still this morning, what caused that power outage, that total blackout? We still don't know, and that is what the NTSB is focused on. They're still interviewing the crew and specifically interviewing the pilots who are walking through what happened and what went wrong. There has been discussion about the possibility of contaminated fuel in the ship, also the possibility of some sort of electrical issue before it had left the port. 
 
But, the NTSB has pushed back and said they are not going to speculate on what could have happened, and they are going to wait for this investigation to play out. We expect a preliminary report maybe in the next couple of weeks. But, Erica, the reality is this could take a couple of years. For the folks on the ground, though, again, the focus is now that salvage operation, getting everything out of the water, and the governor and other officials here have vowed, once the bridge has been removed, once the ship is out of the way, they are sending those divers back into the water because they want to find those four construction workers, and offer closure to their families. Erica.
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
HILL: Yeah. So important. Gabe Cohen, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
Well, when it comes to those victims, the men who lost their lives in the collapse, CNN's Maria Santana has been speaking with some of their families, and she joins me now. What are you hearing, Maria, from their families, from their relatives?
 
MARIA SANTANA, CNN EN ESPANOL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Hi, Erica. Well, for so many of them, this is such a heartbreaking moment. Up until yesterday, I spoke with family members that were just clinging into hope, hoping for a miracle, even after hearing from authorities that their loved ones were presumed dead. Dorlian Castillo Cabrera, 26-year-old from Guatemala, was one of the men have recovered yesterday. He did not have any children. But, we did speak with family members who told us that he had been working for Browner Builders for about three years and he loved his job, and that a part of his dream why he moved to the United States was so that he could help his mother. 
 
Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, a 35-year-old from Mexico, was the other victim. That was recovered from the waters. We do not have that much information about him. Mexican authorities have said that these families, there have been two Mexican nationals that were killed in this incident, but their families have asked for privacy and that they are respecting those wishes. For these families, this might offer a moment of closure, but for four others, just more uncertainty as these recovery efforts have been paused. Miguel Luna is a man from El Salvador. He has three children and three stepchildren, we are told by his family members. He had been living for 19 years in Baltimore, just an integral part of this community. 
 
We also spoke with the brother of Maynor Suazo Sandoval from Honduras, and he told me that his brother was just such a friendly, lovable, joyous person, and that his dream was to continue building businesses. He had already established businesses in Honduras and here in the United States while he worked for this construction company. But, right now, their main focus is the recovery. And this is what he told me about why it is so important for these families to be able to get their loved ones back. Let's listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CARLOS SUAZO SANDOVAL, BROTHER OF MAYNOR SUAZO SANDOVAL, &amp; BROTHER OF BRIDGE COLLAPSE VICTIM (Interpreted): They have found cars, but they have not yet moved any cars because there is a lot of steel framework, and they must be careful because they are human beings. Even if lifeless, we, the family members, need them to rescue the bodies at least to see them and have him handed over to my family, his entire family. He was the breadwinner for his children right now. God is going to provide for us too. So, we can get together as a family and see how we can help each other, because at this moment, his wife is left with his girl and everything.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANTANA: Yeah, Erica. This is what we have been hearing from a lot of family members that these workers were the breadwinners for their families, the ones that held the family together, and not just for family members here in the United States, but also back home in Honduras. So, this is going to be a long, long road for these families, Erica. 
 
HILL: Yeah. It certainly is. Your heart goes out to them. Maria Santana live for us this morning. Thank you. 
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has no choice but to move into Rafah, saying the country's "very existence is on the line." Speaking to U.S. congressional delegation, Netanyahu was also clear he believes victory in Gaza could come soon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETAHYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: We've killed he many senior leaders, including number four in Hamas, number three in Hamas. We'll get number two and number one. That's victory. Victory is within reach. It is a few weeks away.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Those comments coming as Israel presses on with its operation in and around Al-Shifa Hospital, now for the 11th day. The IDF says about 200 "terrorists" have been killed in what it calls precise activities. One family says six children were among those killed in an airstrike near the hospital. 
 
Tensions continue to rise, meantime, on Israel's border with Lebanon. At least 16 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon. Israel warning it will quote, "copy and paste Gaza onto Lebanon if Hezbollah can further escalate tensions." 
 
CNN's Ben Wedeman is tracking all of these developments for us. Ben, let's start first with these operations around Al-Shifa and around that hospital complex. Prime Minister Netanyahu saying there is no choice but to go ahead with that offensive in Rafah. Bring us up to date with where things stand at this hour.
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're now on day 174 of this war. The death toll now exceeds 32,500. The UN believes about 70 percent of those dead are women and children. 
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
And as we're seeing, Israel continues to strike targets across the Gaza Strip. They've been conducting this operation at the Shifa Hospital, which was the largest hospital in Gaza, for 11 days at the Al-Amal Hospital, another hospital. They've been operating for five days. Now, among the dead is six-year-old Mohammed Naeem al-Najar who, according to medical officials, died from hunger. Until now, 30 people, including 24 children, have died as a result of lack of food in the Gaza Strip. The UN says that 1.1 million people in Gaza are in a situation of extreme food insecurity, and the situation doesn't seem to be getting any better now. 
 
People are bracing for this much anticipated Israeli offensive in Rafah, where about 1.5 million people have taken refuge. That town is now crammed with people. And the concern is that if there is a military operation, there will be huge civilian casualties. 
 
Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when meeting with this U.S. congressional delegation, was rather callous about his approach to dealing with all of these civilians if this military operation goes ahead. He told the delegation that the people there can just move out of Rafah, move with their tents. He said there is all of the Gaza Strip north of Gaza, the people moved down, they can move up. He seems to be forgetting the fact that Israeli forces have destroyed much of northern Gaza that many of these people have been forced to move two, three, four or five times, and have no homes to go back to. But, nonetheless, Israel seems determined to go ahead with this operation. Erica. 
 
HILL: All of that as we are seeing this continued escalation between Israel and Lebanon. What is the status there?
 
WEDEMAN: Well, certainly, yesterday, Wednesday, was the bloodiest day so far in the clashes that had been going on along the border between Lebanon and Israel since October 8. 16 people dead on the Lebanese side. That included militants but also medics and civilians on the Israeli side in the town of Kiryat Shmona. One person was killed there. And we heard a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister say that they could -- if Hezbollah continues to target Israeli forces and civilians, that Israel can copy and paste Gaza on to Lebanon. So, we're talking about a possible repeat of what Israel is doing in Gaza, in Lebanon. 
 
Now, the United States, France and other countries have been trying to de-escalate, sort of lessen tensions between Lebanon and Israel. But, it appears that that's not working very well either. Now, it's important to keep in mind that Hezbollah is much better trained, much better armed, more disciplined, and more experienced than Hamas in terms of fighting the Israeli military on the ground. So, a war between Lebanon and Israel would certainly be catastrophic for all parties concerned. Erica.
 
HILL: Yeah. Absolutely. Ben, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
Donald Trump's election subversion case in Georgia is now back on track, the focus once again on that sweeping racketeering indictment. In just under two hours, Trump's attorneys will be in an Atlanta courtroom where they're expected to argue that the charges against the former President should be dismissed because his speech is protected by the First Amendment. This is the first time Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis will be back in court since the judge decided not to disqualify her from that case. 
 
CNN's Zachary Cohen is following all of this, joining me live this morning. So, what are we expecting in court today? They're there to argue some motions which were filed prior to all of this drama that we saw play out in recent weeks with Fani Willis. 
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yeah, Erica. The fact that today's hearing is even happening is really an example of how the case against Trump in Georgia continues to move forward with an appeals court still trying to decide if it wants to take up and review Judge McAfee's decision to allow Fani Willis to remain on the case. But even so, we're going to hear oral arguments today on several pretrial motions that are separate and independent from the disqualification effort that we've seen what play out over the last two months. 
 
These pretrial motions include one filed by Trump's lead attorney Steve Sadow, and he is going to argue that the actions and the charges in the indictment brought by Fani Willis that they can't be charged because the indictment should be thrown out because Donald Trump is protected. All the actions that Donald Trump is accused of are protected under the First Amendment, under political speech protections that are outlined in the First Amendment. 
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
Take a look at what Steve said -- wrote in his motion that was submitted to the court before today's hearing. He said "The First Amendment, in affording the broadest protection to political speech and discussion regarding governmental affairs, not only embraces but encourages exactly the kind of behavior under attack in this Indictment." Now, obviously, Willis and her team fundamentally disagree with that argument, and so has the judge in this case when it was similar arguments is brought by other co-defendants. But, we are going to have to see how Judge McAfee pushes Trump's attorney when they try to argue this First Amendment argument to try to get the indictment thrown out. 
 
But, meanwhile, big picture here, we are looking at this at a time when Fani Willis is trying to shift attention back to Donald Trump, back to the criminal charges that he faces in this indictment. We spent, again, the last two months talking about Fani Willis' personal life and wondering if she would be removed from the case. Take a listen to what Fani Willis told us over the weekend when we caught up with her an event in South Atlanta. We asked her about the state of the case in Georgia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Let's say it for the record, I'm not embarrassed by anything I've done. I guess my greatest crime is I had a relationship with a man, but that's not something that I find embarrassing in any way. And I know that I have not done anything that's illegal. I don't feel like we've been slowed down at all. I do think that there are efforts to slow down this train, but the train is coming.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
Z. COHEN: So, the biggest question that still hangs over this entire case is, when will we see a trial, or when could we see a trial? Fani Willis has asked the judge in this case to set a trial date for August 5, 2024. That would obviously be before the election. But, the judge has not responded. So, I'm told that she might re-up that request in the coming weeks if McAfee does not put a date on the calendar.
 
HILL: All right. We'll be watching for that as well, in addition to the developments coming out of the courthouse today. Zach, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
We are also monitoring Manhattan federal court. That's where former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried will learn pretty soon just how much time he will spend in prison. The FTX founder was convicted in November, of course, on fraud and conspiracy charges for his role in the collapse of the company he founded. If the prosecution gets its way, he could potentially spend the rest of his life in prison. Sentencing set to begin, that hearing rather is set to begin in just over an hour. 
 
CNN's Kara Scannell is live in New York this morning with more. So, prosecutors are asking for 40 to 50 years. We know Sam Bankman-Fried's attorneys clearly do not want to see him behind bars for quite that long. What are we expecting? What is the thinking this morning, Kara?
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. So, a lot at stake, obviously, this morning for Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors are looking for 40 to 50 years in prison. Their reasoning is they say that Bankman-Fried had stolen more than $10 billion from investors and customers of FTX, and from lenders of its sister hedge fund Alameda Research. They also -- he went to trial in the fall, and they also in that trial put forward evidence when he paid more than $150 million in bribes to Chinese officials and made more than $100 million in illegal political campaign donations. They say that he has been motivated by, they said, unmatched greed and hubris, and they say his lack of remorse is galling. 
 
So, they are asking the judge to sentence him to 40 to 50 years, saying he has orchestrated one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history and the biggest ones since Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Now, Bankman-Fried's lawyers are saying they don't think he should serve more than six and a half years in prison, calling the decades-long recommended sentences barbaric, and saying that Bankman-Fried was not out to enrich himself. And they also point to the bankruptcy recovery efforts where one of the bankruptcy officials has said that they expect that investors will get back about 100 cents on the dollar. So, they're saying that people actually didn't lose that much money. Of course, prosecutors can test that. 
 
Big thing to look forward today will be if Bankman-Fried addresses the judge. If he acts contrite, they are going to appeal the conviction. But, what he says to the judge about his motivations or a state of mind will be something the judge will take under consideration. And Bankman-Fried's attorneys have submitted dozens of letters of support from people that have known Bankman-Fried. At the same time, prosecutors have put forward dozens of letters from victims, and it's possible we will hear from at least one victim today who will address the judge. 
 
Certainly, a lot at stake for Bankman-Fried. He has been remanded in federal custody since August when the judge revoked his bail, finding he had engaged in witness tampering while he was out on bail. So, he will not see daylight. It's just a question now of how many years that will be. Erica. 
 
HILL: Yeah, absolutely, Kara. Appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
Still ahead this hour, we're going to take a closer look at Sam Bankman-Fried's sentence and what it could mean for the wider crypto world, including what it means for the FTX victims who said they lost their life savings. Sara Fischer, CNN Media Analyst and Senior Media Reporter for Axios, will join me with more on that. King Charles wants you to remember the importance of care and friendship in times of need. 
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
That's the central message of his Easter message just released in the last hour. It's his first public message since his daughter-in-law Princess Catherine revealed that she too was being treated for cancer. The King, of course, announced his own cancer diagnosis earlier this year. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir joining us now from London. Nada, what else are we hearing in this message from the King?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, typically, King Charles would be in attendance at the service. But, of course, as you mentioned, he is undergoing cancer treatment himself. So, he has sent this audio recording which will be played at the church service. And in this message, he doesn't directly touch on his cancer diagnosis nor that of Catherine, the Princess of Wales. This message was, of course, recorded in mid-March. But, he does touch on the importance of what he says friendship in times of need, and also expressed his gratitude for welfare services and organizations in the country. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOICE OF KING CHARLES: In this country, we are blessed by all the different services that exist for our welfare. But, over and above these organizations and their selfless staff, we need to benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to us, especially in a time of need.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: Now, of course, this is the King's first public address since Catherine, the Princess of Wales, shared her cancer diagnosis last week with the country. It was, of course, a moment of shock for many. And at the time, King Charles III expressed how proud he felt over Princess of Wales' courage in sharing her cancer diagnosis. He hasn't been attending larger gatherings or public engagements himself. He is also, of course, undergoing early-stage cancer treatment, although he is expected to be at the Easter church service over the weekend. It will be a smaller, slimmed down service. We are not, of course, expecting to see the Prince and Princess of Wales, nor their children. They are, of course, taking some time to focus on their family on privacy and, of course, on Kate's recovery during this treatment. But, it is expected to be a slimmed down service in order to ensure that King Charles III can safely attend the service. Erica.
 
HILL: Nada Bashir, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
Still the come, CNN rise along with private security in South Africa. That's a country struggles with a rampant crime wave. The dramatic report is just ahead. Plus, the Biden campaign looking for some additional firepower on the campaign trail. Just how much can two former presidents help with the Biden campaign in 2024? That's just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HILL: 30 years into its young democracy, South Africa is struggling with a crime wave it just can't seem to control, violent brazen attacks and heists which should be handled by the police are now being turned over to private security patrols because police corruption is rampant as well. 
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
CNN's David McKenzie joins us now from Johannesburg with more on this. So, you actually have the opportunity to do a ride-along with a private security group in South Africa. What did you find? 
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, what we found -- Erica, what we found is that in this country they are buckling under the weight of this high crime rate, hijackings and heists. It's almost a daily occurrence. This is what we saw. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Charlie Six Three.
 
ANTON KOEN, CEO, NO JACK: This was a vehicle that was triggered by the license plate recognition system. We need to be on top of the vehicle as soon as we -- well, as fast as we possibly can. 
 
MCKENZIE: So, Anton is chasing a hijacked vehicle. This happens all the time in South Africa. They're in touch with private security groups throughout the eastern part of Johannesburg. And one thing you don't hear anything about is the police. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Direction northeast Quay. Direction northeast Quay.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Police can't cope, underfunded and struggling with corruption. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are shooting. They are shooting. They are shooting.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Dashcam footage shows the criminal gangs, private security are often up against. In South Africa, more than 20,000 vehicles were hijacked last year. Murders are at a 20-year high.
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
Cash and transit heists are now commonplace, armored vehicles targeted in broad daylight by heavily armed gangs, this heist on a major Joburg highway in October. 
 
MCKENZIE: Was it difficult to get a gun? 
 
GLEN, FORMER CASH-IN-TRANSIT CRIMINAL: No, it's not difficult. 
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): We met a cash-in-transit criminal who claims he has gotten out of the game. We agreed to hide his identity, so he would talk freely. GLEN: People who are angry with the level of crime, they will never sleep with their stomach empty. Those are the people who are crying with crime.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): He says around a dozen gang members target the vehicles, often with inside intelligence. They have spotters, drivers and shooters splitting the cash evenly. 
 
MCKENZIE: Did you ever kill anyone?
 
GLEN: Yes. I know it's bad. I feel bad about it. Some of them, you go, and you want to rob and they do not surrender. They want to become heroes.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): But, father of four, TT Ngwenya, says he never wanted to be a hero. He just wanted to put food on the table
 
TT NGWENYA, FORMER CASH-IN-TRANSIT GUARD: Because I needed the money. You must take out that you're going to be killed because you will never wait for your children.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): He always knew they would be hit. And in May 2021, they were. The dashcam video shows the gang working quickly, efficiently even. They made Ngwenya and the other guards lie in the grass. When they blew off the roof, it crushed his legs.
 
NGWENYA: The big thing to me, I am no longer able to stand. I'm no longer walking as the way I was before I joined that job. And now, always feel pain, I'm short with some pills. You see a number further.
 
KOEN: It seems like the value of life has actually means nothing to a lot of people anymore. I think at the moment, our crime is out of control. Our crime is really not in control. We're having a hard time fighting crime.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): South Africa is losing the war against crime, the promise of its democracy hijacked by corruption, desperation and greed. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE: Now, security experts say there are plenty of good cops in this country, both junior and senior levels, but they are overwhelmed by the rate of crime and underwhelmed by the levels of corruption within their ranks. Of course, you have this impact on very real people, like TT Ngwenya, who are impacted by crime, often hidden from view, and what that cash heist gangster says that it's the rich people who worry about crime. Obviously, that's not really true because much of the crime is in the poorer areas of this nation, and this will be a very critical issue as voters go to the polls in an upcoming election. Erica. 
 
HILL: Yeah. A really sobering and important look. David, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
Still to come here, a former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried set to learn his fate in just a short time. He'll be back in court in about an hour for his sentencing hearing in one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history. Plus, campaign cash and lots of it, President Biden hoping to bring in millions during a star-studded fundraiser tonight, one that also includes the help of two old friends. We will explain after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Well, he was once known as the cryptocurrency whiz kid. Today, Sam Bankman-Fried is set to be sentenced for his role in the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried was convicted in November of stealing more than $8 billion, and engaging his employees in a cover- up. He is facing decades in prison. 
 
Sara Fischer is CNN's Media Analyst, and Senior Media Reporter for Axios, and joins us live this morning. Sara, good to see you. So, if we take a step back here, there are a number of things that will be considered at today's sentencing hearing, including the impact that Sam Bankman-Fried had. There are a number of people who say they were defrauded. Walk us through what that will include.
 
SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST, &amp; SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS: Well, the number one thing here, of course, is damages. So, those -- about $10 billion of funds that have gone missing from FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that SBF has been accused of funneling that money in to take some risky bets. Now, the key here, Erica, is thinking about historical comparisons. If you think about Bernie Madoff, that was a $20 billion Ponzi scheme, and he got 150 years in prison. The difference, though, is that a lot of lawyers think that we're going to be able to get that money back, those $10 billion of customer funds to those customers. 
 
And so, that's a big case that the defense is going to make. Yes, this was a very, very exploitive nature, but the people getting their money back might make it not as bad. 
 
Now, the prosecution wants 50, 60 years. Defense is arguing five or six. Obviously, you will expect it to be somewhere in the middle.
 
HILL: Defense is arguing too, look, he is young. He is only 32. They actually called the recommendation from the prosecution "mid-evil", saying that he could ultimately die in jail. What's interesting, though, is oftentimes what will come into play at a sentencing hearing is the defense trying to show, look, my client is actually a good guy. Look at all the good things that he did. The prosecution has definitely been pushing back on that notion, Sara.
 
FISCHER: Well, yeah, because he is a highly educated kid. One of the arguments that the prosecution is making is, sure, he is a 32-year- old, but he is highly educated. He was competent enough to set up this game and he is competent enough to know that it was illegal and to know the consequences of it. And so, I think the age factor is not going to play very well for the defense. 
 
The other issue on the good person front, Erica, is that typically when you are in a situation like this, your pretrial behavior has a huge impact on what happens to you during sentencing. And his pretrial behavior was not great. But, recall, he was doing tons of press, appearing on all these stages, dodging questions. All of those things are things that the prosecution is going to use against him. And so, SBF sort of shot himself in the foot here if you wanted to paint himself as this very innocent bystander in this. 
 
HILL: We could hear from, as I understand, at least one witness. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
Any idea who else may be speaking this morning?
 
FISCHER: No. But, what's curious here too is the people who are in his closest circle, remember, they've been working with prosecution for a long time. Remember his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison. So, these are the types of people who we could hear from, who we know the prosecution has been in touch with, but unclear who we hear from today.
 
HILL: In terms of Caroline Ellison, he also, correct me if I'm wrong here, but Sam Bankman-Fried actually released some of her writings. This is part of that pretrial behavior that has been pointed to as being somewhat questionable.
 
FISCHER: Yes, because you're not supposed to be influencing people who are working on this trial, and that's exactly what that behavior suggested. What he would have been smart to do is not released those writings, not talk to the press, stay home. He has been confined to his parents' house in Palo Alto, California, maybe do some community service. That's not what he did here, Erica, and I think that's going to have an impact on his sentencing today.
 
HILL: How is this being looked at in the broader crypto world?
 
FISCHER: I mean, I think people are relieved to have some sort of answer. Once this guy is actually sentenced, I think the crypto world feels like they can actually move on. The other thing is once these FTX payments are finally brought back to the customers who lost the money, I think they will bring a lot more confidence to the crypto world. The crypto world took a huge hit, all crypto companies, cryptocurrencies took a huge hit in the wake of FTX. They're starting to slowly rebound, Erica, but it's nowhere near what it was at its height. 2021, early 2022. 
 
HILL: Yeah. I do want to shift gears quickly just to get a little bit more information. We're learning the Biden administration is unveiling some new requirements for how federal agencies should use AI technology. Can you walk us through some of those regulations that will actually -- that could impact people at airports?
 
FISCHER: Totally. So, the biggest thing is that they want transparency, Erica. So, if a federal agency is going to start implementing AI, the Biden administration wants you to report what programs are using? What are the safety guards in place? Have you tested for any potential bias? They're requiring that every single agency, including agencies like the FAA, have an AI officer who is going to be in charge of all these things. But, here is the problem, Erica. This is an executive order, which means that a new administration could come in and just wipe their hands clean of it. And so, even though these agencies are expected to have this in place by December 1, if Biden doesn't win reelection, this could very well go away in a month. 
 
And then the other concern, of course, is that talent is really, really sparse. The Biden administration wants to hire at least 100 AI experts. When you have people in AI who can be getting hundreds of thousands of dollars in the private sector, do they want to take a risk jumping to the public sector on an executive order that might go away in the next administration? I think it's going to be hard.
 
HILL: Yeah. It's such a good point. Sara, always appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
FISCHER: Thank you. 
 
HILL: Well, one of the hottest tickets in New York City tonight, for Democrats, U.S. President Joe Biden set to appear at a fundraiser along with former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. The Biden campaign says the event has already raised $25 million. 
 
And as MJ Lee reports, this is perhaps the first step in former President Obama becoming a bit of a fixture on the campaign trail. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Joe Biden.
 
MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Barack Obama jumping into the 2024 election, hoping he can help his former Vice President Joe Biden win a second term at the White House. The former President making clear to associates in recent months that he believes the Biden-Donald Trump rematch in November will be incredibly close, and that he sees the election as an all hands on deck moment, sources tell CNN.
 
OBAMA: As you know, Joe is an extraordinary friend and partner. He was by my side for eight years. 
 
LEE (voice-over): Last Friday, Obama spending several hours in the White House residence, recording videos for the Biden campaign, including about the Affordable Care Act. 
 
OBAMA: There is nothing I'm more proud of than the ACA. 
 
LEE (voice-over): Off camera, Obama telling Biden that the President's State of the Union remarks this month appear to have broken through, and that he believes healthcare will once again be a potent issue in the upcoming election, passage of that landmark healthcare law, one of the hallmark achievements of the Obama presidency. About 14 years later, President Biden is continuing to tout. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I thought it was a big deal at the time. Well, it's even a bigger deal today. 
 
LEE (voice-over): Sources telling CNN that the two presidents who have made much of their friendship and so-called bromance still speak regularly -- 
 
OBAMA: This also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance. 
 
LEE (voice-over): -- and that Obama is also in direct contact with some senior White House officials, including Chief of Staff Jeff Zients. On Thursday, three U.S. presidents, Biden, Obama, and Bill Clinton, set to appear together for a star-studded fundraiser in New York City, moderated by comedian Stephen Colbert. 
 <br>[08:40:00]
 
Tickets to the sold-out evening at Radio City Music Hall ranging from $225 to a whopping half a million dollars, and numerous celebrities expected to be in attendance. Some audience members also getting the chance to have their photo taken with the three presidents by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: And our thanks to MJ Lee for that. 
 
For a closer look at this gathering of the three presidents and some other pretty big names, CNN's Arlette Saenz is live at the White House this morning. As our colleague John Berman pointed out this morning, you get the presidents and the Queen tonight. This is quite an event, the Queen being Queen Latifah, and it's already brought in a lot of cash, Arlette.
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. And really, it marks a unique moment in presidential politics, as you have three Democratic presidents teaming up around the goal of trying to defeat a former President, Donald Trump. Now, the campaign this morning announced that this fundraiser has already brought in more than $25 million for this night alone. That's with the people attending in person as well as online donations. And it comes as you have really seen Biden with his cash advantage against Trump heading into the general election. 
 
If you take a look at Biden's fundraising, he raised $53 million in the month of February alone. This $25 million is nearly half that. And he goes into -- he has come into the month with about $71 million and his campaign coffers is even higher than that when you consider all the Democratic accounts. Compare that to former President Trump, who currently has about $33.5 million. So, really, this fundraiser is just another step in the campaigns as they are trying to build their operations to take on Trump. 
 
Now, as you noted, there are some star-studded attendees who will be there, Queen Latifah, Lizzo, Ben Platt, all among the musical guests expected to perform. Stephen Colbert will moderate the discussion between the three presidents, really giving some insight into how they are viewing this campaign as they're preparing for that matchup against Trump in November.
 
HILL: Arlette Saenz live for us this morning. Thank you. 
 
Still have come here, torture, beheadings, and public executions, just some of the horrific tactics being used by Myanmar's junta to help keep rebel forces under control. A powerful CNN report is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: A word of caution, this next story is incredibly difficult to watch. But, it is also important. It contains graphic video of two men being tortured and burned alive. But again, we think it's important for the world to see and to know what is going on in Myanmar. Three years after the junta took power, it is struggling to keep control of rebels on the battlefield. And CNN's Anna Coren reports. That means it is resorting to increasingly brutal tactics.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Looking through the flat dry scrublands of the Yaw Valley in central Myanmar, a soldier films on his phone. 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
Hey, brother, raise your three fingers, he jokes, mocking the salute symbolic of the country's resistance movement. No more three fingers, yells one of them and laughs. He moves on to another group of pro- junta militia resting in the shade. Revolution, he cries. It's bullshit, they respond. Moments later, the man filming asks a soldier wearing a military junta uniform of a PDF, a reference to the opposition People's Defense Forces. Yes, he replies. This brief exchange caught on camera is about two rebel fighters they had just captured a few hours earlier.
 
Before dawn, on the 7th of November last year, rebels, part of the PDF, staged an attack on the pro-junta militia stronghold in the village of Myauk Khin Yan, Gangaw, in Magway Division. But instead, the rebels were ambushed coming under heavy fire.
 
Platoon Commander Ninja says as they tried to retreat in open fields, several of his fighters were injured while others were cut off from the group, including 21-year-old Phoe Tay and 20-year-old Thar Htaung (ph).
 
NINJA, YDF FIGHTER (Interpreted): The last time I saw them, they were hunkering down about 50 meters away from me.
 
COREN (voice-over): A few hours later, Ninja's Platoon received a message from a villager saying two of their rebel fighters had been caught alive. Video obtained by CNN shows the two young men bound and bloodied, relentlessly taunted by the militia. The revolution must lose. PDFs are dogs, replies Phoe Tay. How many dogs have we killed? Aren't you PDF dogs? We're dogs, repeats Thar Htaung. The video then shows them being dragged on the ground, their arms and legs hogtied in chains.
 
The next clip, too graphic to show in full, reveals the young men hanging in chains from the branch of a large tree over a fire, being burnt alive. Their screams heard over cheers from the militia as the prisoners writhed in agony as flames cede their flesh. An eyewitness to the execution told us the militia had ordered one person from each house to watch.
 
VOICE OF ZAW ZAW, WITNESS (Interpreted): When I got there, they hanged them on the tree and poured gasoline and diesel on their bodies. The rebels were moving and screaming and said they apologized. But the militia replied "apologize in your next life."
 
COREN (voice-over): Cross referencing more than a dozen interviews with witnesses, villagers, resistance fighters, family members, and experts with analysis of the video and pictures from the day using open-source techniques, CNN has found evidence that the military and its allied militia were responsible for the killings. The junta denies the claim, stating the video was fabricated. However, they do admit an attack took place that day and that its troops were stationed in the village.
 
CNN spoke to both fathers who confirmed their sons had been killed. They said they encouraged their boys to join the revolution and fight, but to die like this will haunt them forever.
 
VOICE OF MYINT ZAW, FATHER OF PHOE TAY (Interpreted): I got a chance to watch the video, but I could not finish it. I stopped because I knew it was going to break my heart.
 
COREN (voice-over): The brutality of this execution, however, is not a one-off case. Since the military junta staged a coup in 2021, the level of depravity among its soldiers and aligned militia has increased in response to the mass losses and defections it's suffering on the battlefield. The junta's recent announcement of compulsory conscription, a clear sign it is facing enormous pressure. As fighting engulfs two-thirds of the country, experts believe the military is using fear and intimidation to try and control a defiant population.
 
MATT LAWRENCE, PROJECT DIRECTOR, MYANMAR WITNESS: We've been able to verify over 400 burnt bodies since the coup and we've verified over a dozen instances of individual beheadings. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
 
COREN (voice-over): But, the burnings, beheadings, and indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes are doing anything but stamping out the resistance.
 
Rebel fighter Yaw Lay (ph), who fought alongside Phoe Tay and Thar Htaung that fateful morning, says what happened to his friends has only strengthened their resolve.

HILL: The latest evidence of climate change impact, it's slowing down the Earth's rotation and will eventually cost you a second of your time. That's according to a study in the journal Nature, which found that meltwater is actually draining away from the poles toward the equator, and all that extra mass is basically tapping the brakes on the spin of the Earth, which could force scientists to subtract a leap second in likely the year 2028. Leap seconds are used when atomic clocks and the earth rotation are out of sync by about a second. Some fear that leap seconds could actually wreak havoc on computers. Remember all the concerns over Y2K? Now, while it was a dud with negligible impact, the concern certainly was not. So, we'll continue to watch that. 
 
Meantime, Germany's Kennel Club is warning the future of the dogs and one of the country's most popular dog breeds could be in jeopardy. Maybe you know them as sausage dogs or hot dog dogs here in the U.S. German lawmakers are now considering a bill that would target so- called torture breeding of these pups. 
 
Fred Pleitgen has more from Berlin.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Many Germans are up in arms as one of the most popular dogs here in this country and really a staple of German culture, the sausage dog, they believe could be under threat, and maybe in the future could disappear and not be bred anymore here in this country. Now, all this comes down to a draft law which was put forward by the German Agriculture Ministry, which is in charge of animal protection here in this country, and that law seeks to end what Germans call torture breeding. That in effect means breeding animals with what the Germans call skeletal abnormalities, and some of those abnormalities include very long spines and very short legs, which, of course, tend to be features of the German sausage dog. 
 
Now, the ministry itself, we've gotten in touch with them, they say that they have absolutely no plan to end breeding of sausage dogs here in this country. They say they simply want to protect animals and end what they call torture breeding, which essentially they say means breeding animals in a way that makes their life essentially unlivable because of their bodily features. 
 
Now, the German Kennel Club doesn't buy any of this. They say, well, some of the provisions in this draft law are good, like for instance, combating the illegal puppy trade, they say that some of the rules set out for the breeding could in fact ban breeding of German sausage dogs. We also got in touch with a breeder of German sausage dogs who says that the dogs are not inbred and the vast majority of them are very healthy, and also that German sausage dogs actually live quite long. Their longevity is apparently very good. 
 
Now, the German Kennel Club and the breeder both say that they are very suspicious of this new law. They do believe that it could mean the end of breeding of German sausage dogs, and not just that. 
 <br>[08:55:00]
 
They also fear that it could mean the end of breeding of things like for instance German Shepherds or Schnauzers which are also of course staples of German cultures, and a lot of people here in this country have these types of dogs. So, there is a lot of concern out there. This law, however, is still in the very early stages of being drafted. It would still have to go through various stages in German Parliament to actually become law.
