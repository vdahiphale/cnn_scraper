<br>[15:30:00] 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: The U.S. State Department today announced that more than 1,200 Americans and their family members have safely fled Gaza, but they're still working to get around 900 others out of the enclave as Israel's war with Hamas intensifies. There were massive explosions across Gaza today. CNN crews captured this blast lighting up the sky as night fell. 
 
The Palestinian Red Crescent shared this video showing a dramatic rescue of a husband and wife who were trapped under rubble following a blast in central Gaza. Meantime, urgent aid like food, water, fuel, those are still not getting in in enough quantities according to these organizations. Israeli authorities now say they will use two crossings to help screen aid for Gaza. But they emphasize that no supplies will be entering Gaza from Israel. 
 
Let's discuss these issues and more with CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt and former spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations Hagar Chemali, thank you both for being with us. Alex, first, to you. An Egyptian official said that just 61 trucks carrying humanitarian aid went through the Rafah crossing into Gaza today. That's the smallest number in roughly a week. Israeli authorities are now saying they're got to start screening trucks at the Nitzana and Kerem Shalom crossings. What impact is that going to have? 
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, hopefully it's got to have a really big impact, Boris. The Israelis are saying that it could double the capacity of the number of trucks going into Gaza, which is obviously extremely good news. But it's not just the trucks going in that that's the issue. It's also what they face once they get onto the other side. And those are absolutely chaotic scenes that have been driven by this war. 
 
You have quite a few countries, Egypt, the U.S., Israel and others, plus the aid organizations who are all involved here. It's a very complex puzzle. There's a lot of finger pointing a lot of blame -- blame to go around and a lot of people are playing that blame game. But essentially what's got to happen now is a lot of the shipments that are coming into a port, a place called Al-Arish in Egypt. They're now going to go to the Kerem Shalom crossing for inspections. Israel has a very strict inspections regime before those trucks head
 
 on in into the Gaza Strip. Now, once those trucks go through, as we've seen, the situation is just extraordinarily desperate. There's so many hundreds of thousands of people who are packed into the southern part of the Gaza Strip that a lot of those trucks are getting overwhelmed. People don't have enough water. They don't have enough food. They don't have enough medicine. And then those trucks aren't able to go farther north. Because of the -- because the fighting. They can't get to people who have been displaced from the north. They can't get to the hospitals. 
 
So, what we've been hearing from the U.S. in sort of very soft language towards Israel, is that Israel and the humanitarian organizations need to deconflict, as Secretary, Blinken said, in order to better establish plans and routes and times so that these trucks can go in and better distribute that aid. It is a very complicated situation, but no doubt, Boris, this is good news that this Kerem Shalom crossing is going to be open, not to get aid in, but to inspect more aid -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Right, Hagar, Alex just walked us through some of the challenges. What do you see as the biggest barrier to getting more aid in? 
 
HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER SPOKESWOMAN, U.S. MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS: We have a lot of issues here. So as Alex highlighted, you have situations where you've got trucks coming in and they're kind of being overtaken, right? You have mobs apparently coming at them because people are desperate and they're hungry. And you also have the difficulty of just being able physically when you've got rubble and you have destruction and you have fighting, it's just physically difficult. 
 
But the thing that that's so important here coming from the U.S. government when they're asking Israel to deconflict. The thing is, this is not new in war, and Israel should be able to do that. They should be able to work with the United Nations to ensure that there are safe humanitarian zones and that that's where the aid goes. But I will say that one of the biggest challenges I foresee is not only that Hamas might try to get in the way and try to take that aid for themselves or to try and take it and then sell it to their people, but that Hamas would also try to use those humanitarian zones to launch, you know, to launch missiles and so on. Because they would know that those are supposed to be safe from -- from being targeted by the Israeli Government. And so that's where I see this difficulty. 
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
However, I really want to stress that it's not uncommon in war and it can be achievable to find ways to send humanitarian aid in by a large amount in areas that aren't being targeted. 
 
SANCHEZ: Alex, the United Nations is set to resume its emergency session on the war in Gaza tomorrow. The U.S. over the weekend, vetoing that resolution calling for a ceasefire. We have heard from U.S. officials, though, that Israel needs to do more to ensure civilian safety. What's the latest that you've heard from officials about getting aid in? 
 
MARQUARDT: Well, Boris, clearly the U.S. is in a unique spot where it is increasingly lonely on the world stage in that it is the lone defender on the UN Security Council vetoing that resolution for an immediate ceasefire. But at the same time, it's really the only country in the world that can have any -- that can impose any kind of real pressure on Israel. So, you are hearing increasing alarm from the United States, perhaps not as much criticism as many would like. But you're certainly hearing the U.S. putting this pressure on Israel to both increase the amount of aid coming into Gaza -- and we saw the Israelis budge a couple of days ago, they started allowing more fuel in. 
 
But also, in terms of the fighting. And we heard Secretary Blinken over the weekend saying there is still what they're calling a gap between Israel's intent to keep civilians safe and what is actually happening on the ground. Clearly, the U.S. is upset by the number of civilians who are still being killed. And so, there is a lot of pressure coming from the U.S. behind the scenes. And there really is a hope in Washington that this phase of the war, this heavy phase of the war, only lasts a couple more weeks. Beyond that, I can imagine that you, we might imagine that American patience is going to start running out pretty quickly -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Hagar, there's new reporting out there that I want to get your thoughts on it. Details this arrangement that was endorsed by Prime Minister Netanyahu. It helped fund Hamas for years, going back to 2018. Qataris would essentially deliver between $15 million and $30 million in suitcases to Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu defended the program previously, saying that it would help prevent humanitarian disaster. But now his critics are incensed, saying they think that these payments actually made Hamas stronger, that it made October 7th more brutal. Is the criticism of Netanyahu here valid in your eyes? 
 
CHEMALI: Yes, to answer your quick your answer your question quickly, the answer is yes. We've known about these payments for a while and the fact is there's no doubt that they would have helped support Hamas because money is fungible. Whatever money -- and let's say they're not spending on mass humanitarian aid to their people. But some of that aid is going to fuel. And so, if Hamas is not spending its budget on fuel and energy, then that frees up money for them to spend on military capabilities. 
 
And again, the Hamas has a number of ways it finances itself. Iran finances them, they get charitable donations. They have investment funds in countries like the UAE, Sudan, Algeria, and Turkey that grow billions -- millions of dollars -- sorry. And so, they have other ways of growing their assets. But that is a significant way -- the part that's so ugly about this is that it is a policy directly endorsed by the Netanyahu government, by Prime Minister Netanyahu specifically, where he said that it may allow Israel to ensure that the aid goes for humanitarian purposes. 
 
But allegedly he also added that it would allow Hamas to remain strong in order to divide Palestinians, to pit Hamas against the Palestinian Authority, in order to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and that is critical here. I do think that this is one of several of Netanyahu's policies that created the opportunity for Hamas to pursue the horrific terrorist attack on October 7th. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, a Palestinian state or a two-state solution that the U.S. has been pushing for as the long-term way to create viable peace in the region. Hagar Chemali, Alex Marquardt, thanks so much for the discussion. 
 
CHEMALI: Thanks. 
 
SANCHEZ: So, he was due to appear in court today, but the imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is now missing and the State Department and the White House are both deeply concerned for his well- being. The latest on this story coming up. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:43:43]
 
PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: An alarming situation right now and Russia, the chief opposition leader to Vladimir Putin, Alexei Navalny has reportedly gone missing. Navalny has been in prison since 2021, serving a more than 30-year sentence. But his legal team says they haven't been able to locate him for six days now, and there is growing concern among supporters that Navalny may be in poor health. Joining us now is CNN national security analyst, former CIA chief of Russia operations Steve Hall. So, Steve, do you think this is just a case of Navalny being moved to a different place or could something else be going on here? What do you think? 
 
STEVE HALL, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Yes, we just don't know Pam at this point, because of course it's so difficult to get reliable information outside of Russia about what's going on inside of Russia. Especially if it has to do with anything associated with either Navalny or just their legal process in general. 
 
So, I mean, one theory is, is that there was rumor that he was going to be moved to a higher security prison reserved for people who had committed crimes after being released and who were potentially very violent types of prisoners. So, he could be in, in process of going to that new location in Russia. Typically, if we moved from one prison to another, it's not a flight, even though it's a long distance. They'll put you on a train. So, he might be in, you know, in movement to a new location. 
 <br>[15:45:00]
 
Or because of concerns about his health, we have to -- we can't rule out the possibility that he's either completely incapacitated or perhaps dead and the Russians just don't want to raise that at this point. 
 
BROWN: Yes, I was got to follow up asking about the illness. What -- how that could factor in. So, you mentioned it's so hard to get information from there. The State Department saying today that it is deeply concerned about this situation. Is there a way for the U.S. or other countries to gain intelligence about, you know, where he could be? You mentioned if he's being moved from one place to another, he could be on a train and so forth. I mean, is there any way to for the U.S. to track that? 
 
HALL: Yes, it's really, really tough, Pam. I mean, there's obviously ways that we can that we can try to do it. And of course, the people on Navalny's team are got to continue to try to get information out of there. So, we'll have to see whether anybody can actually locate him. But again, it's so difficult. And you have to remember that the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin would like nothing more than for Navalny simply to disappear, not only off Russian -- the Russian stage, but also the international stage. Because he remains a significant threat, I think to Vladimir Putin, as long as he's alive and as long as he's, you know, publicly out there and able to somehow communicate with the outside world. 
 
BROWN: Do you make anything of the timing of this? You know, do you think it's just a coincidence that this is happening as we learn Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is coming to Washington. What do you think? 
 
Can you hear me, Steve? Oh, I think we lost Steve. Lost the connection there. All right, that was Steve Hall talking about the fact that Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader to Vladimir Putin in Russia, hasn't been seen in six days, according to his team. 
 
Well, it is one of the richest contracts in professional sports, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. How the LA Dodgers won the race to sign baseball's biggest star, up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:51:16]
 
SANCHEZ: The speculation is over. It's official. Two-time American League MVP Shohei Ohtani is crossing those LA streets and turning Dodger blue. The former Los Angeles Angel of Anaheim, who both pitches and bats as a designated hitter, shared the news with fans on Instagram. His deal is making a lot of headlines to 10 years, 700 million bucks. That is a Major League record. Pretty much a record in any league. Joining us now, CNN World Sport -- the anchor of CNN World Sport, Don Riddell. Don, great to see you. A lot of Angels fans feeling blue right about now. 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, WORLD SPORT: Yes, I think that's a $700 million understatement there, Boris. But look, it didn't work out with them, did it? He never even won a playoff game in his career up until this point. But clearly Shohei Ohtani is hoping that he's got to be more successful with the Dodgers. And he's now playing on a fabulous team with Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts. So, they're got to be really, really exciting to watch. 
 
I agree with you, the number really is the story here. $700 million is just eye watering. You think about Patrick Mahomes, he's on 450 million playing for the Chiefs in the NFL. You've got Mike Trout on 425-ish. That was the previous MLB record. So this is absolutely shattered all of that. 
 
The other thing that's really interesting here is that he's not got to get all of that money straight away. In fact, it's not even 700 divided by the 10 years, 70 million. A lot of it is got to be deferred. And that is so that the Dodgers can invest that money in building a team because he really does want to win the big prizes. And he hasn't been particularly successful in that regard in his career so far. So that's what it's all about. You know, it's all about the money for us. For Ohtani, it's almost less about the money. He just wants to get out there and play on a good team and win some titles. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, totally. Speaking of winning titles, a big weekend for LeBron James. He was named the MVP of the Inaugural in Season NBA Tournament, and his son Bronny, making a big debut for USC. At times looking a bit like the old man. 
 
RIDDELL: Yes, and you know, this was, I suppose, the perfect weekend for LeBron James. He would be the first to say that this new In Season Tournament, the NBA Cup, isn't the most important thing this season. Of course. It's always nice to win trophies and have more accolades on the resume. But hey, his team played well, they wanted to win. As you say, LeBron was the MVP. But I think probably the most important thing this weekend was seeing his son Bronny play his first ever college game. I think the parents among us who have kids who play sports can relate to just how special this would be. 
 
But of course, it's not just that. Remember, Bronny had the cardiac arrest, what, five months ago, when he was during, you know, in a sort of a preseason workout with his team. And there was so much concern around that time. And to see him bounce back from that, play his first game, have his dad court side must have just been so special for the family. And he has taken one step closer towards the James Dream of LeBron and Bronny one day playing on the same team in the NBA. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, just watching that block by Bronny feel like somewhere Andre Iguodala is shedding a tear. Don Riddell, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
Still ahead, he's the CNN hero of the year, a dedicated veterinarian that gives free medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness. We have details when we come back.

BROWN: Ten worthy candidates took to the stage with the chance to be the CNN Hero of the Year last night in New York, but in the end, Kwane Stewart was the winner. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, Stewart is a veterinarian whose nonprofit Project Street Vet provides much needed medical care to the beloved pets of people that are experiencing homelessness. While accepting the award he talked about. How he drew inspiration from a homeless man who had not eaten in two days. Watch this.

DR. KWANE STEWART, CNN HERO OF THE YEAR: I return with a sandwich for myself and for him. He tore off -- it was a Sub sandwich. He tore off a corner of it. Really, just a piece of bread. He ate it and he gave the rest to his dog. And they've taught me a lot too. 
 <br>[16:00:00]
 
I'll close by saying this. An act of kindness can change your day. Change someone's day and act or gesture of kindness can change somebody's life. Thank you.
