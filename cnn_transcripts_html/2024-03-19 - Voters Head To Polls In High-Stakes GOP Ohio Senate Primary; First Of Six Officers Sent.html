WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny is joining us now from a polling place in Ohio's capital city of Columbus. What are you hearing over there, Jeff?
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, of course, this is going to be one of the marquee Senate races in the fall, Senator Sherrod Brown seeking a fourth term. But that's only part of the story. The other half of the story is playing out here today, that is which Republican will be nominated to challenge him in the fall.
 
And it has been a divisive heated campaign. A three-way contest, as you said. Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running as well as State Senator Matt Dolan, and Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno.
 
Former President Donald Trump has weighed in aggressively in this race. He is backing Bernie Moreno. But the governor of the state, Mike DeWine, he is backing Matt Dolan. Of course, their styles are different. Their substance is different.
 
We caught up with Senator Dolan last night. He had this to say about the importance of this race.

MATT DOLAN, OHIO REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE: I have fought and gotten results. Because if you're not getting results, you're just shouting. And we've had too much shouting in our country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENY: Too much shouting in our country. So, a bit of a not-so-veiled reference, perhaps to former President Donald Trump, who was here in Ohio over the weekend campaigning for Bernie Moreno. He was aggressively going after Matt Dolan, whose family happens to own the Cleveland Guardians, of course, the longtime baseball franchise. Trump was criticizing them for changing the name from the Cleveland Indians.
 
So, that, of course, has nothing to do with this Senate race. But, Wolf, if it just gives you a sense of how expensive and how acrimonious this race has been. Some $40 million was spent in TV ads alone on this.
 
The reason it matters is of course, Sherrod Brown is one of two incumbent Democratic senators, the other being John Tester in Montana, that really are running in red states, in states that Trump won significantly. So, Sherrod Brown for him to win a fourth term, he clearly needs to win over some Trump voters as well. We talked with him yesterday.
 
He said he has run against presidents of both parties. He is a representative of the people. So, this will be a test of his strength. No doubt, Wolf.
 
But first things first, this primary tonight will show who Sherrod Brown is running against, and if Republicans believe they have a strong chance to beat him in November, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: We shall see. All right. Jeff Zeleny, thank you very much for that update.
 
Meanwhile, Trump is taking direct aim at the American Jewish community -- members of the American Jewish community who may vote for Democrats. Coming up -- listen to what Trump said. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Any Jewish person that votes the Democrats hates their religion, they hate everything about Israel, and they should be ashamed of themselves because Israel will be destroyed.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER: These remarks come after Trump's former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly recently disclosed that Trump told him in the White House that he thought Hitler "did some good things." Hitler "did some good things."
 
Joining us now is the CEO of the American Jewish Committee, Ted Deutch. He's also a former Democratic congressman from Florida. Ted, thanks very much for joining us. Let me get your quick reaction, first of all, to these latest Trump comments.
 
TED DEUTCH, CEO, AMERICAN JEWISH COMMUNITY: Look. At this moment when the Jewish community feels so very much at risk, it is -- it is dangerous and it's divisive to bring the Jewish community in to a debate in a way that tells them what they believe, how they behave as Jews, how they feel about Israel. This is a moment again, where in every part of the country and all around the world, the Jewish community is really facing dramatically increasing antisemitism, and where Israel is fighting for its survival. As this political season moves forward, I hope that both President Trump and President Biden and every political candidate running for office will understand that the Jewish community should not be used in some political purpose.
 
And that in fact, Wolf, the last thing I'll say here is when you suggest that the Jewish people only -- to have felt a certain way about Israel, there are so many unfortunately right now who are at the same time invoking dual loyalty and old antisemitic trope. This is what we're battling. So, let's try to focus on the issues at hand.
 
Let's try to think of ways to actually bring the Jewish community together. That's what -- that's what we do. That's the way we need to focus. And political comments like this make it increasingly more difficult that they're dangerous, and we shouldn't hear them any further.
 
BLITZER: Why aren't Republicans publicly and strongly condemning Trump's hateful comments?
 
DEUTCH: Wolf, I so proudly run a nonpartisan organization now. And in that role, I don't -- I don't guess what people are doing politically. I comment on the actual things that are -- that are happening.
 <br>[11:35:03]
 
And what we're seeing happening is that on the far left and on the far right in America and around the world, Jews are being put at risk. And we need to call that out wherever we see it and whatever party we're in. We have to call it out on the left, even Democrats need to do that. We need to call it on the right even Republicans need to do that. This is the -- in the best interest not only of the Jewish community but of the world.
 
And, Wolf, I just have to say that one of the most important things we can do here is to remember that this is taking place in the context of a war in Israel that so often the media forgets was started by Hamas when they slaughtered 1200 people when they used sexual violence as a tool of war when they continued on by taking hundreds of hostages, and when they still hold 134 hostages including Americans. Now, more than 160 days since they were taken into captivity. The president was right yesterday. Jake Sullivan talked about this.
 
The Hamas has blood on their hands, including the blood of Americans. And the best thing we can do is to rally behind our ally Israel, as they seek to defeat Hamas not only for the good of the Israeli people but for the good of the entire region. Ridding the region of this terror threat will benefit everyone including and especially the Palestinians, who have been put at risk by Hamas's dangerous, vile, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel actions.
 
BLITZER: You make important points. So, let me get back to what Trump said. He said American Jews who vote for Democrats -- and you're a former Democratic congressman, hate their religion and hate Israel. I want -- specifically -- he's really attacking you -- 
 
DEUTCH: Yes.
 
BLITZER: And all the Democrats out there who are American Jews who will vote for Democrats. And what do you say to that?
 
DEUTCH: The Jewish community has a range of opinions. I mean, Wolf, you know -- you know the old phrase, two Jews, three opinions. We have lots of different opinions in politics. That's true as well. And we know heading into an election when people feel so passionately about the need to defend the Jewish community and about the need to ensure that Israel wins its war against Hamas and that the world understands what Israel is facing. And that the truth about Israel's delivery of now close to 10,000 trucks of humanitarian aid is actually told. And we don't let Hamas drive the narrative coming out of what happens.
 
At this moment, let's respect differences. We shouldn't have presidential candidates or candidates for any office telling the Jewish community what it thinks, how it should feel, let alone what it says -- what their views say about them and their view of their own religion and their view of Israel, which is so dear to the vast majority of the Jewish community.
 
BLITZER: Yes. I know you love Israel. I know you love your religion. And it's pretty outrageous what the former president of the United States, a current Republican presidential -- presumptive presidential candidate is saying about the American Jewish community. Ted Deutch, thanks very much for the important work you're doing at the American Jewish Committee. We appreciate your joining us.
 
DEUTCH: Thank you, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: And there's breaking news just coming into CNN right now. The first officer among the so-called Goon Squad in Mississippi has just been sentenced in a case where two black men were tortured. We're live outside the courthouse. We'll update you. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:43:18]
 
BLITZER: We're following breaking news right now out of Mississippi. The first of six white police officers who belong to a self-proclaimed Goon Squad has just been sentenced. Former Jackson County Sheriff's deputy Hunter Elward was given 20 years in prison after pleading guilty in a case where two black men were tortured last year in their home.
 
CNN's Ryan Young is in Jackson, Mississippi for us. So, Ryan, explain what happened in court. You watch it all unfold.
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Wolf, we did watch it all unfold even following this case for over a year. We actually learned about a third victim in this case as well. But the two victims, the two black men were in court, and they got their first chance to stare a Hunter Elward as he came into court. He was dressed in all blue. And in fact, to protect his identity while he's in jail, they actually had the back of his smock that he was wearing blacked out.
 
He, at one point, turned to the victims to apologize. He said there's never a time where he closes his eyes, and he doesn't see those two men on a nightly basis. With all that going on, Eddie Parker stood up and actually said, I forgive you. It was a moment in court. I don't think anybody will forget for quite some time as people were in tears as -- (AUDIO GAP) during this court proceeding. The mother of Michael Jenkins also stood up and said I am not just a black woman. I am a mother who cares about my child.
 
And this broke me because, for months, she did not know where -- what would happen. No one believed them for quite some time. Wolf, there have been people who have been digging on this story for quite some time to figure out exactly what happened that night.
 
And we learned that the men showed up to the home, kicked open the door, and just started attacking women over and over. Tried to sexually assault them, waterboard them, and tase them over and over. In fact, at one time, they had a hot potato where they tried to see whose taser was more effective at creating pain.
 <br>[11:45:15]
 
And after this was all over, Hunter Elward's parents were walking out the door. I got a chance to speak with them. It's the first time that we're hearing from that side in terms of what actually happened here. Take a listen, Wolf.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
YOUNG: That was going on inside that Sheriff's Department for quite some time and that he was taught that. Do you believe that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do. Absolutely.
 
YOUNG: What do you believe taught with you? Because most people couldn't hear it because it's obviously in court. But do you believe there was someone teaching these practices to -- (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely. They -- as soon as he started seven years ago, Brett McAlpin, the only way they could get overtime was to work with those guys. In the new recruits, the younger guys that are coming in, that need overtime to get the little babies and stuff. That's how they bring him in. You know that's the only way you get overtime is to work with the Goon guys.
 
YOUNG: Do you believe that the sheriff and that department deserve some responsibility besides your son?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely. Absolutely.
 
YOUNG: Ok. Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.
 
YOUNG: Anything you want to say about your son having to serve all that time? Because you -- he has a whole family. I'll leave it on that. Anything you'd like to say?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just can't. I don't know.
 
YOUNG: I understand.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's -- 
 
YOUNG: Thank you. Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.
 
YOUNG: Thank you.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
YOUNG: This is the first time we're hearing from that family in court, they apologize to the victims. They apologize to the victim's family as well.
 
This is federal court. So, obviously, we can't have our cameras on the inside. But I do believe, and this was the first time that the victims, Eddie Parker, Michael Jenkins, had a chance to hear from the family and also Hunter himself.
 
And when he turned around and looked directly at him, he actually asked the judge for permission to do this. The entire court stopped. And you can see the tears flowing from their faces.
 
When the victim impact statements were read, and it talked about how they were brutalized over and over, no one could believe some of the things that were read, especially in 2023, to think that not only did they plan this out, they actually had a text message stream that they would coordinate with each other. They showed up to the house, they made sure there were no cameras that would see them, and then they broke into the home and tortured these men for over two hours. And after this was all done and after the gun was placed in the mouth of Mr. Jenkins, and the shot was fired and his tongue was severed, they cleaned everything up, Wolf, to make sure there will be no evidence left behind.
 
And one of the things that we wanted to play in that soundbite, and we didn't get all of it to you was I asked his father, why did he want his son to tell the truth? He looked me in the eye. He said the reason why he wanted his son to tell the truth is there's no way there could be healing, not only for their family, but for the victim's family, and all of Rankin County unless someone stepped forward and told the truth.
 
So, it seems like the family's indicating that it was Elward who helped give the government evidence in all this case. The government, for its part, pointed out very clearly that they believe these are sort of tears of fiction at this point. Because at every step of the way, they went to show a cover-up and to show that these men intended to put harm on these two men for dating a white woman. And they told him to go back across the river to Jackson. These are words that were said in open court.
 
Let's not forget there are more sentencing that's coming ahead. We have five more men who will face charges. And the other victim did come forward and put a victim statement, something that will continue to follow, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: We'll stay in close touch with you. Ryan Young, excellent report. Thank you very, very much. And we'll be right back with more news.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:53:23]
 
BLITZER: As gang violence intensifies big time in Haiti right now, the State Department now says up to one thousand American citizens inside the country are asking desperately for help. CNN National Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood is here with me. We're watching all of this unfold. Kylie, one plane of American evacuees from Haiti arrived Sunday in Florida. Do we know if the State Department has more planes on the way to help get these Americans out?
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's a good question. State Department's saying right now that they're not talking about any imminent plans for another evacuation flight. But as you said, on Sunday, they had their first evacuation flight. More than 30 Americans were on that flight that went from the northern part of Haiti to Miami.
 
And as you said this morning, we heard from State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel who said that the number of Americans who have filled out a crisis intake form for Haiti is approaching a thousand. But it's important to note, that doesn't mean that there are a thousand Americans who want to get out of the country. It means that there are a thousand Americans potentially around that number who have reached out to the State Department to be in touch with them about the security situation. Listen to how the DoD described that outreach.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VEDANT PATEL, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: But you have to remember that that is a population that includes individuals who yes, maybe interested in ready in departing Haiti, but also individuals who might just be interested in staying in touch with the embassy, staying in touch to receive more information, staying in touch to learn about what opportunities for departure might exist.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ATWOOD: Now, the State Department has also said that they are looking at options for evacuation plans out of Port-au-Prince, which is obviously the capital where much of this violence is still happening. They are in touch with Americans who are in the country. And they will continue to provide assistance to those Americans, so long as one, the security situation on the ground allows them to do that. And so long as two, there aren't commercial options to get out of the country right now.
 <br>[11:55:18]
 
And that is the real problem for these Americans who want to leave. But we should note that there are many Haitians, for whom it is also incredibly challenging to get out of the country, even if they wanted to give in just how terrible the situation is. The gang violence has really overtaken.
 
BLITZER: Yes, it's a horrible, horrible situation, indeed. Kylie, thank you very much for that report. Kylie Atwood reporting for us.
 
And to our viewers, thanks very much for joining me in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. I'll be back later tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern in "THE SITUATION ROOM." Right here tomorrow morning, 11:00 a.m. Eastern.
 
Stay with CNN. "INSIDE POLITICS" with Dana Bash starts after a short break.
