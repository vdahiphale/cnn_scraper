ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Look at that, Brainy Smurf.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: That's Brainy Smurf. 
 
Welcome back to CNN's "Thanksgiving in America." 
 
Brainy Smurf making his way through Philadelphia.
 
HILL: Right, Brainy Smurf was actually Papa Smurf's apprentice. Did you know that? 
 
BERMAN: I didn't know that. 
 
HILL: I just learned that. 
 
BERMAN: Does that - I mean I didn't think Papa Smurf played favorites. I think he really taught all the Smurfs how to grow. 
 
HILL: You may be right. You may be right. 
 
Hey, how about this, Spider-man debuting in the parade. The new Spidey. Very exciting. First Spidey, of course, I think was back in - was that '87, '97? But here he is. This is - I heard people saying, I see Spider-man. I see Spider-man. People behind us. We've been waiting for this moment. 
 
BERMAN: Yes. Spider-man going down Central Park West. He passed us just a second ago. And I have to say, the guy looked jacked. I mean, Spider-man does not skip a leg day. Look at that. Look at the definition there. 
 
HILL: True. 
 
BERMAN: He does -
 
HILL: Let that be your inspiration.
 
BERMAN: He does squats like every day. Balloon squats every day. 
 
HILL: The balloon squat. It's sweeping the nation. What did we learn from Harry? He was talking to all the balloon folks.
 
 That the noise when Spider-man shoots the web, it's called a twhip (ph). 
 <br>[09:35:03]
 
BERMAN: That is good information right there. We did not hear the twhip as it went by -
 
HILL: No.
 
BERMAN: Because the music and the joy, just so loud. 
 
HILL: It's true. It's true. It overshadowed it. 
 
We are moments away from Houston's big Thanksgiving Day Parade getting underway. And that is where we find our good friend, Rosa Flores.
 
Rosa, Olympic great Carl Lewis is the grand marshal. But I would say next year I think your pick - you're my pick. You look fabulous.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to the Huston Thanksgiving Day Parade, where everything is bigger in Houston. Let me tell you, you can look around. There's already a lot of people here lining the streets. About 20 blocks. And you can see that they're already waving goodbye.
 
But, Erica and John, I have a task for you because I want you to get up and I want you to do the turkey dance with me because I can show you. I can guide you. Don't worry. Don't be nervous. We can do this together. If you're at home, you can do this too. All you need to do is you need to spread your wings. And then go round and round. Anybody up here willing to do it with me? You spread your wings. She's going to do it with me. There you go. You spread your wings and then you go round and round. 
 
Give me five! That's - there you go. 
 
We've been here all morning doing the turkey dance with a few people here in Houston. Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLORES: Ready?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And they - and they - and they all say gobble, gobble.
 
FLORES: Oh, gobble, gobble. OK. So, we'll do, I'm a turkey, I'm a turkey, and then gobble, gobble, OK? OK. 
 
Three, two, and one.
 
FLORES AND UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a turkey. I'm a turkey. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.
 
CROWD: Yay!
 
FLORES: Three, two and one. 
 
Flap your wings, and show your feathers. 
 
(INAUDIBLE).
 
FLORES: Yay! High five! That's so funny. High five. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLORES: And, Erica and John, do you know why turkeys dance in Texas? Well, our survivability rate is really high because, let's be honest, in Texas, a lot of people are not having turkey. They're going to be having barbecue. So, our survivability is really high. 
 
And, John, I have a question for you. Are you wearing a cowboy hat, my friend? 
 
BERMAN: I am. I am wearing my CNN Fourth of July in America cowboy hat.
 
FLORES: Are you trying to steal my thunder?
 
BERMAN: I - can I tell you something, Rosa? 
 
FLORES: Are you trying to steal my thunder here from Texas?
 
BERMAN: There's no way I could steal your thunder.
 
HILL: Uh-uh.
 
BERMAN: After what you just did, it's over. It's like game over. Like, drop the mic.
 
HILL: Rosa wins. 
 
BERMAN: Rosa wins completely.
 
HILL: We adore you. We will see more of you and your turkey dancing just ahead.
 
Meantime, back here in New York, deep in the parade trenches is where we find Omar Jimenez. 
 
Good luck following that.
 
BERMAN: He's dancing on the inside.
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Look, I couldn't see it, but I could hear a lot going on. I can do a lot of things. I cant' do whatever was just happening a few minutes ago. 
 
I'm just here watching some of the parades and the floats going by. We've been watching a lot of the balloons. But what I've also been watching, it's been great people watching, too. I mean people have been hunkered down throughout all of this. They're still cheering, still exciting. 
 
I think we thought the rain was going to let up a little bit, but it's only just gotten more and more tough as we've been here. Everybody's waving. What's up, guys? What's up?
 
We've been chatting with a few of them. And as these floats have come by, it feels like it's waves of excitement even through the rain. Let's talk with some of them here. 
 
Hey, what's going on? How are you guys feeling right now? You feeling good? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
JIMENEZ: Yes. Where are you guys from? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Rhode Island. 
 
JIMENEZ: Rhode Island. Did you think it was going to be as rainy and wet as it is now? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought it was going to be worse. This is completely doable. We're having a great time. 
 
JIMENEZ: See, that's the positivity we're here for. They thought it was going to be worse. It's even better than they imagined. 
 
Have you come to this before? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, we were here last year.
 
JIMENEZ: What's your favorite part about being here at the parade?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, the chanting, the excitement, the thankfulness. We love it. 
 
JIMENEZ: Thankfulness. These are your kids here?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
JIMENEZ: All right. Who - how are you feeling right now? Are you dry? Are you wet? Where are you?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wet.
 
JIMENEZ: What's your favorite parade float that you're looking for today?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Minnie.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Minnie.
 
JIMENEZ: Oh, OK. All right. We've got a - all right, what about you?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Uh - 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Macy's (ph).
 
JIMENEZ: Oh, all right, Macy's - Macy. I heard a Macy's in the back there.
 
Look, everyone's optimistic. They're excited. And, we've got still the parade route going by. 
 
We're in the final stretch here for when - for receiving these balloons as they come. So, we're going to keep an eye on things, but I'm going to send it back to you guys. I know - I know you know. It's raining.
 <br>[09:40:04]
 
HILL: A little bit. Just a little bit. 
 
BERMAN: But I - I love that - you're from Connecticut. I love the Rhode Island people. Like, this isn't rain. 
 
HILL: Yes. It's not bad at all. 
 
BERMAN: It's not bad weather. We get bad weather up there. 
 
HILL: Hardy New Englanders. That's what I like.
 
BERMAN: Yes, exactly.
 
HILL: So much more to come here live from New York. Our special coverage  "Thanksgiving in America" continues up next here. Celebrity home builder, one half of the "Property Brothers," Drew Scott, joins our Stephanie Elam to talk about helping those in need build up their lives.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:45:25]
 
BERMAN: All right, this is CNN "Thanksgiving in America." You just heard "The Star-Spangled Banner" from Houston. The parade there about to kick off. We would have been standing to rise for the national anthem, but we're in such tight quarters here -
 
HILL: We can't move. 
 
BERMAN: We can't move at all, which is why we didn't dance with Rosa Flores moments ago when she was doing the turkey dance. 
 
HILL: We were dancing inside. Dancing in spirit.
 
BERMAN: We were dancing inside.
 
HILL: Yes. 
 
BERMAN: So, while you're all excited to eat a big meal today, maybe put up your Christmas tree. Others - others may not be as fortunate. That's where A Sense of Home is helping out. The organization helps create first ever homes for youths aging out of foster care with a little help from property brothers Drew Scott.
 
Stephanie Elam shares this surprise of a lifetime for one young mother.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In just about 90 minutes, this empty apartment will be full of furniture and love. For 23-year-old Anahi Rodriguez -
 
ANAHI RODRIGUEZ, A SENSE OF HOME RECIPIENT: I've been house to house ever since I was like ten. 
 
ELAM (voice over): This also marks a turning point for her and her three-year-old daughter. 
 
RODRIGUEZ: And thank you to everybody. And thank you for doing this.
 
ELAM (voice over): Anahi entered foster care after her mother and then her aunt were deported. For the college student and soccer player, this is the first place she's had on her own. 
 
GEORGIE SMITH, FOUNDER AND CEO, A SENSE OF HOME: The home creation is a vehicle for connecting someone who has been not connected to love or community, to become connected to love and community. 
 
ELAM (voice over): Georgie Smith launched nonprofit A Sense of Home nine years ago. 
 
SMITH: We should put the bed here. 
 
ELAM (voice over): Transforming places to live into warm, inviting homes for people who have aged out of foster care. 
 
SMITH: They were never adopted and they never had a home of their own. This is completely life-changing.
 
ELAM (voice over): In 2016, she was named a top ten CNN Hero for her work.
 
SMITH: In the U.S. there is around 500,000 every year in the system. And then there's between 10 percent to 20 percent aging out. The actual homeless population, 50 percent, spent time in foster care. So, there is a completely direct link. 
 
ELAM (voice over): All of the furniture, rugs, even the artwork is donated to A Sense of Home from individuals and brand partners. 
 
SMITH: Home defines everything. It defines our health, our mental health, our well-being, our happiness, our connection to attachment and belonging. It all begins in home. Everything begins in homes. 
 
ELAM (voice over): These strangers are working together, united in their goal to make Anahi's apartment a home. 
 
DREW SCOTT, "PROPERTY BROTHERS": And I had to get over here to help out. 
 
How are you?
 
ELAM: That's allowed. 
 
ELAM (voice over): With the help of a "Property Brother," Drew Scott.
 
SCOTT: Just hold this here.
 
ELAM: How do you decide what goes where? How do you decide? 
 
SCOTT: Just old this here. 
 
ELAM: Oh, just keep -
 
SCOTT: Well, I just like to - I like to look at everything. Just hold this here. Can I - no, OK.
 
I would call this lazy design because A Sense of Home has such a great team. Their design team is amazing. They do all the heavy lifting. I think this big one is going to be perfect above the sofa. I wanted to make sure it feels like christmas, so I brought one of our Christmas trees and some ornaments and we just kind of get that set up too once we figure out our art and the rest of the pieces. So, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. 
 
ELAM (voice over): While Anahi waits outside, along with Oso (ph), the dog she rescued from the street, the work continues inside. 
 
NAHANI LOMELI, CASE MANAGER, HOPE STREET FAMILY CENTER: This is a moment a moment for her to really like sit there and think about how blessed she really is. 
 
ELAM: OK, so how do you feel?
 
RODRIGUEZ: Nervous.
 
ELAM: You're nervous?
 
RODRIGUEZ: Yes.
 
SCOTT: Anahi looks nervous. She looks a bit nervous. 
 
Are you nervous, Anahi? 
 
Tunnel of love.
 
Welcome home.
 
RODRIGUEZ: Oh, my. It look so nice.
 
SCOTT: Does it feel like home?
 
And then the bedrooms.
 
RODRIGUEZ: Oh. Finally, a bed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want to check out the couch? 
 
SCOTT: I can't wait to see your daughter come in here. Let's go (INAUDIBLE).
 
You've been on a big journey, and it really means a lot to be a part of helping your family feel at home. So, I hope you're happy. 
 
RODRIGUEZ: Oh, very. 
 
SCOTT: She's worked hard. She now has a sense of community. With an organization like A Sense of Home, she's set up for success. 
 
I'm also excited for her daughter. She's three years old. I have - my son's two and a half. I tear up when I think about it. 
 
RODRIGUEZ: So, I'm very grateful for everybody. And I haven't felt this in a really long time. And I want to thank you guys.
 
ELAM (voice over): For Anahi, her new place is like a dream compared to what it felt like before.
 
RODRIGUEZ: It felt empty. It felt like just a space that I had to sleep in and like I had to eat. 
 <br>[09:50:01]
 
I didn't like the feeling of it, honestly. And I wanted my daughter to have, like, you know, a sense of home. You get me? And now she has it thanks to everybody. 
 
LOMELI: She's an amazing mom. She really is. 
 
ELAM (voice over): While her most pressing goal is to be there for her daughter, who is autistic and nonverbal -
 
RODRIGUEZ: I want to see her interact. I want to see her talk to me.
 
ELAM (voice over): Anahi says she now has the foundation to pursue the future she sees for herself, playing soccer for a four-year institution and hopefully going pro. 
 
RODRIGUEZ: I feel important. I feel special. Something that I really don't feel at all. So, I will forever be grateful to A Sense of Home and to everybody that came here today to support me. So, I'm very excited for the holidays now.
 
ELAM (voice over): Stephanie Elam, CNN, Los Angeles.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: That's a great story and a great organization. 
 
BERMAN: That was just amazing to see. 
 
HILL: Yes. BERMAN: Look, our thanks to Stephanie Elam for that.
 
And a reminder, you can watch Drew and his brother Jonathan on "Property Brothers" anytime streaming on Max.
 
All right, chef and restaurateur Erin French of The Lost Kitchen is back with us again this Thanksgiving morning. Earlier, she taught us how to make her delicious crispy onion and potato holiday pie. But now, for the moment of truth. Oh, I see you're there with your husband too. 
 
How did it turn out?
 
ERIN FRENCH, CHEF, OWNER OF THE LOST KITCHEN, AND HOST OF "GETTING LOST WITH ERIN FRENCH": I know. He showed up. You can tell the scents are good because the husband starts showing up. So, here we go.
 
MICHAEL DUTTON, HUSBAND OF ERIN FRENCH: It's true. I'm not going to lie.
 
FRENCH: All right, so there it is, in all its glory. You got all that flavor. The potato. There's a little bit of butter in there. The grapes. The crispy shallots. So, I put the crispy shallots on like five minutes before I took it out of the oven. And they just got nice and toastier. 
 
And then the last thing is just to sprinkle a bit of fresh thyme over the top because it tastes good and it looks really pretty. 
 
And then you just dig in and you enjoy. And, like I said, you could make this tomorrow if you have leftovers. You can use cranberry sauce. You can throw turkey in there. You serve it with a big salad. And it never tastes boring. 
 
So, we'll give it to our taste tester here who will let us know the truth about this. But, I love this pie. It's got like a little bit of everything and it tastes just enough different, but it's comforting at the same time. 
 
Yes, that's going to be a good one. 
 
HILL: It looks incredible. 
 
FRENCH: That one's for you, Michael. 
 
HILL: Next year I think we should maybe be at Erin's for Thanksgiving, John.
 
DUTTON: Yes, you guys should come up for -
 
BERMAN: What happens to the grapes? I - when you were putting the grapes in -
 
FRENCH: Don't come to my house. I'm never - I never throw a Thanksgiving - Yes, the grapes. I just gave him them a quick saute, because you want them to still, like, pop. You don't want it to be like jammy. You want to have a little bit of freshness with that because we've been eating a lot of pureed stuff. 
 
So, I don't know. What do you think? What do you think?
 
DUTTON: Mmm. 
 
FRENCH: It's good, right?
 
DUTTON: So the grapes, they hold their shape. They hold their firmness. They hold their sweetness.
 
FRENCH: Sweet.
 
DUTTON: But they're warm. 
 
FRENCH: And you get the crunchy too. The crunchy with all the shallots on top too. Like, creamy, sweet, crunchy, savory. It's like everything you want to eat on Thanksgiving or any day.
 
DUTTON: Amazing. 
 
HILL: It's a perfect combination. 
 
DUTTON: We're taking this down to our Friendsgiving.
 
HILL: There's some big things happening in The Lost Kitchen starting Friday, I think, right, Erin.
 
FRENCH: Yes, our market opens tomorrow. So here at the mill we open the whole place up, which is kind of a big deal because it's pretty hard to get into the restaurant. But it's fun to open the whole mill. Our online shop is open. So we're at findthelostkitchen.com. We have so many beautiful gifts. If you know someone who loves the kitchen, buy them a gift there because all of your friends should be foodies. So, it's the place to go this season. So, we're really excited. Our team's jazzed and there will be lots of good food around here too. 
 
DUTTON: Yes.
 
HILL: That's great.
 
FRENCH: That's definitely more (INAUDIBLE).
 
BERMAN: So good. Our thanks to you. 
 
DUTTON: It's so good.
 
BERMAN: All right, Erin French, thank you so much to you. 
 
FRENCH: Thanks, guys. Happy Thanksgiving.
 
BERMAN: Thanks to Michael for testing things out. Happy Thanksgiving to you all. Have fun where you're going. They're going to love that dish you just made for all of us. 
 
DUTTON: Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys. Come see us (INAUDIBLE).
 
BERMAN: All right, for more info on Erin's holiday market, visit findthelostkitchen.com.
 
HILL: So, just ahead, we have a lot more coming your way. A little train there coming at you from Philadelphia. The train going (INAUDIBLE) the All-American Express Train Float pulling three more cars behind it. 
 
BERMAN: And a whole lot of Amex points. 
 
HILL: A whole lot of Amex points. Boy, are you cashing those in for quite a ride on this Thanksgiving morning. 
 
BERMAN: That's right. That's right. 
 
HILL: Also ahead, we're going to take you down - back down to Houston. We'll see if Rosa Flores can - can do a little more turkey dancing for us. The parade ready to kick off there. Our coverage of "Thanksgiving in America" all around the country continues here. 
 
Also, a little slice of home for folks who are stationed overseas. Here's a look at how some of our military service members are celebrating Thanksgiving.
