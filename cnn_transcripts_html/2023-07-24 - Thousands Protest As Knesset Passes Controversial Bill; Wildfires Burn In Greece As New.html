LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello. I'm Lynda Kincaid live from Atlanta in for my colleague Becky Anderson. And this is CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
 Good to have you with us.
 
Coming up this hour, Israel passes the first part of its controversial judicial overhaul amid mass protests.
 
Tourist flee wildfires in Greece. Ukraine claims it carried out a drone attack on Moscow.
 
And football star Mbappe could be headed to Saudi Arabia.
 
What Israelis have been out protesting for the last six months gets it stay in Parliament. At least the first part of it. And so far, it's going as 
 
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had hoped. The Israeli Knesset has passed the controversial reasonableness bill by vote of 64 to zero. It would strip 
 
 the Supreme Court have the power to declare government actions unreasonable. This is the first bill of Mr. Netanyahu's judicial overhaul 
 
 plan to get this far in the legislative process. 
 
But protesters and not letting up. They took to the streets across the country to show their opposition to the bill. And surrounding the Knesset 
 
 locking arms and blocking roads around the building. Police set up fences and barbed wire and hit some people with water cannons. At least 19 people 
 
 have been arrested so far. And over the weekend, a group of military veterans said that 10,000 volunteer reservists will refuse to serve if the 
 
 legislation went ahead.
 
But the disapproval isn't just coming from the Israelis. It has been increasingly urgent please from Washington, Israel's most important ally, 
 
 to rethink this legislation. For the second time in a week, President Joe Biden warned Israel's government against moving ahead with the judicial 
 
 overhaul. Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing government has caused his relationship with the White House to become increasingly challenged.
 
CNN's Hadas Gold was in the thick of the protests earlier and spoke to my colleague Elenio Giokos. Take listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: The opposition walked out off the floor of the parliament in protest during the third final for this 
 
 legislation. We're actually standing just outside of the Supreme Court. Of course, the institution who this legislation will immediately turn.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: I think we have a slight issue with that. But we do have a guest to discuss this further. I'm joined now from Tel Aviv by Lieutenant Colonel 
 
 Peter Lerner. He is the Director General of International Relations at Histadrut. Israel's largest trade union organization. He's been pushing for 
 
 a compromise in Israel's parliament. That hasn't happened today. I appreciate you joining us. Give us a sense of your response to this vote 
 
 going through today.
 
PETER LERNER, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, HISTADRUT: So, it's a tragedy. What we've seen today is a result of political whims on 
 
 both sides of the political arena that have basically ended the mediation efforts that were taking place. And because of narrow ego, interests and 
 
 considerations, basically, putting those small, narrow interests over the good and the interests of the Israeli society and on Israeli general 
 
 interest.
 
So, I would say what -- what's actually happened today is a combination of the last seven months. The government ignoring all of what the people had 
 
 to say. And I would actually say that Netanyahu today, he didn't achieve what he put out. But he actually missed a historic opportunity to bring the 
 
 country back together. Histadrut, our general federation of labor. The chairman just announced that he will be convening all of our senior bodies within the next few days.
 
And we are declaring a labor dispute. And this actually means that either we will see progress with a broad agreement, or there will be serious 
 
 consequences on the ground. We won't allow this country to go into deeper division or polarization and the people need a new route.
 
KINKADE: And of course, you're a union leader which represents some 800,000 workers which is about a quarter of Israel's workforce. Your union members 
 
 as well as business leaders, military reservists have been among the thousands of people we've seen taking to the streets to protest this.
 <br>[10:05:08]
 
And now that the legislation has passed has passed, the at least the first bill is passed, talk to us about the preparations that come next. How soon 
 
 could we see a general strike?
 
LERNER: So Lynda, the process that we're going through currently, after we declare a labor dispute, if that is actually declared in the next coming 
 
 days will mean that there will probably be a minimum of 15 days of due process. There are legal bindings for a general strike. But there are many 
 
 things that we can do between then and now. So I would say that we have the next couple of days where we will be conducting our activities, rallying 
 
 our members, you know, we have to keep in mind that our members are like Israeli society, across the political spectrum.
 
Not everybody will be happy with a general strike, but we need to be accountable to them. We need to be accountable to Israeli society. And that 
 
 is why we are gathering and this is why the chairman now, Chairman Arnon Bar-David has got decided to conduct this step. Because over the last four 
 
 or five days, the Histadrut has been at the center of the mediation efforts. We put down together with the business organization.
 
We put down a proposal that what we found and this is why we never went into a strike beforehand. We found that there is barely any daylight 
 
 between --in the positions on the issue of the bill. So why need to go through in such a very strong manner in a way which undermines society, 
 
 undermines our democracy. And just makes people feel left out. This is why we will be moving forward. We will be beginning our process in the next 
 
 coming days.
 
And it could eventually leave to -- lead to a general strike. But in the meantime, there will probably be steps on the grounds that we will see 
 
 slowdowns and stoppages, perhaps walkouts, and so on. There are many independent unions that have already declared there will be going on 
 
 strike. I saw on the T.V. footage, one of our affiliates, the social workers union out there already on the frontlines.
 
So of course, our members are expecting us to be active, but active not in a way just to fight but also to bring that middle Israel point of view 
 
 because we do represent everybody.
 
KINKADE: And I want to get some perspective from you on the economic impact because Moody's Investors Service has warned that these judicial reforms 
 
 will not only weaken institutions, but negatively impact Israel's sovereign credit profile. Talk to us more broadly about the economic concerns.
 
LERNER: So, Israel's economy is suffering because of this, as you pointed out. Moody's, but it's not only Moody's, it's across the board. Everybody 
 
 is showing concern, everybody except the government who think that they're living in a different planet. So we need them to realize that, you know, 
 
 there are so many red flags. People demonstrating and protesting for now 29 weeks on the streets.
 
The labor union saying get together, find mutual and common ground. The global economy, the local economy, it's all struggling and it's all 
 
 pointing to a very clear, red flag that the government should be listening to. We have the concerns of our workers. If the economy goes down, pay 
 
 rises, paychecks, the stability of the economy, workplaces could potentially close. That would be bad for the working men and women of 
 
 Israel.
 
And just quickly, what does this traditional form mean for U.S.-Israeli relations, because we -- I did hear from two former U.S. ambassadors at the 
 
 Israel who have called on the White House to rethink the $3.8 billion which annually goes to military assistance for Israel.
 
LERNER: So, we were just in last May, we visited the U.S. and we met with congressmen and people from the State Department and the president's office 
 
 to show -- to share our position of the need for support on one hand, but an understanding a clear demand that Israel needs to be managed because we 
 
 have mutual and shared values. So we have to keep in mind that those values need to be a guiding -- that lighthouse of action for Israel in Israeli 
 
 society.
 
We are dependent. We appreciate American support. And I think we need to be welcoming and listen to our friends. I think that is our message. We came 
 
 when we were in in in May in the U.S. We came with a message of we are grateful for your support and solidarity. When we met with the AFL, CIO and 
 
 the different unions in the U.S. That was a message we also received and also from the Jewish community leaders that we met with -- when we were 
 
 there.
 <br>[10:10:01]
 
So, America is important to Israel and Israel is important to America and that needs to be mutual respect. So, if America is telling the Israeli 
 
 government, listen to what we have to say, Israel should, you know, just to be polite, they should be listening. You know, on defense issues in my 
 
 former role as a spokesperson for the -- for the IDF and I'm a retired lieutenant colonel or actually, I'm in reserve, and I'm actually 
 
 considering, do I maintain that status? I'm well over the age.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KINKADE: -- some many others have threatened to do.
 
LERNER: Or do I resign? It's a very serious internal that I have today. I would say I'm still not certain. We'll see what the Supreme Court says 
 
 about this process.
 
KINKADE: We appreciate your time though. Lieutenant Colonel, we'll have to leave it there for now. But we appreciate your perspective. Thanks so much 
 
 for your time.
 
LERNER: Thank you, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Well, CNN's Hadas Gold has been in the thick of the protests all day and joins us now live from Jerusalem. Hadas, you've been out there in 
 
 the heat with thousands of protesters. Just give us a sense of the reaction you've seen as these votes played out.
 
GOLD: Yes. Organizers have set up large screens. We're right at the side Supreme Court's large screens outside the Supreme Court all the way down to 
 
 the Israeli parliament for protesters to watch the proceedings on the floor of Parliament. And when that vote was announced that 64 to zero vote, zero 
 
 because all the opposition lawmakers walked off in protest, people started chanting. They started booing. They started saying things like shame.
 
And they have started marching towards the stage behind me where it various speakers have come up and encouraging the crowd chanting things like, we 
 
 will not leave, we will stay in the streets until things get better. Some of them I've been putting to use the language like this is war, the war has 
 
 just begun. And protests as we know are also starting to take to the streets in places like Tel Aviv as well.
 
You can hear the anger in the voices, you can see the anger on their faces over the how this -- how this -- how this all happened. And they say that 
 
 they will not be leaving the streets. Now, some of the fallout we're seeing. We've already seen the first legal challenges to this. Legal 
 
 challenge is seeking an injunction from the Supreme Court to stop this legislation from happening.
 
Now, that legal process could lead to a very interesting political. You could call it constitutional crisis here because it could be the supreme 
 
 court ruling whether the bill taking away their ability to do something unreasonable is unreasonable in and of itself. Now, that's a few steps 
 
 ahead. Also, what we're seeing is the stock market falling around two percent last time I checked.
 
The Israeli shekels also falling against the dollar about one percent. So obviously, there's economic impacts, you were just talking about a 
 
 potential labor strike that could really shut down the country. That's what shut down the country back in March. That's what really caused the 
 
 legislation to be frozen back then. And then the big question also is, of course, about the military reservists.
 
There's thousands of military reservists who have already said that they will not serve, they will not heed the call to serve if they're -- to duty. 
 
 If this legislation passes, the legislation has passed. Now the question will be, of course, there's a major conflict and they're needed. These are 
 
 people including the elite Air Force pilots who have said they will not serve. They would be needed in a major conflict.
 
So, will they not serve? And also, what will be the consequences for them? Will they be arrested? What kind of legal consequences could they face? A 
 
 lot of unknowns. And I also think it'll be interesting to see what happens on the streets in the next few hours because the protesters are angry. The 
 
 heat is starting to die down a little bit. So people started to get their energy back.
 
And the protesters are not giving any indication that they're going to be going home anytime soon. Lynda?
 
KINKADE: Wow. Hadas Gold, good to have you on the story for us. Appreciate your time. We'll be speaking to you again soon. No doubt. Thank you. Hadas 
 
 Gold there.
 
All this legal vernacular may be a bit confusing. The so-called reasonableness doctrine, however, is not unique to Israel as we've 
 
 discussed. It has been used in a number of other countries, including the U.K., Canada and Australia. But it helped me get your head wrapped around 
 
 all the judicial changes and what could come next to the Israeli and those opposing this move. You can go to CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East 
 
 Newsletter.
 
It's got a robust wrap up for you. Just head to cnn.com/mideastnewsletter. Still to come, wildfires in Greece continue burning as new ones break out. 
 
 We'll take stock of the damage when we return.
 
And CNN tours a cathedral severely damaged and a Russian missile strike. What Ukraine apparently did today in retaliation.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:16:42]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. Firefighters in the Greek Isles are stretched thin trying to tamp down those wildfires on several fronts. The worst in roads 
 
 continues to burn out of control leaving eerie ash and scenes like this. Two more fires broke out Sunday on the islands of Evia and Corfu forcing 
 
 further evacuations from both. And it's very destructive and it's disrupting what is generally the high season for Greek tourism.
 
Our Sam Kiley reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): It's a regular visitor wildfire, and no one knows where or when it will strike. 
 
 This is tourism in the 21st century. The latest Maelstrom in southern Europe roads an island of ancient ruins facing a modern apocalypse. Intense 
 
 heat waves of turn forest into desiccated tinder yearning for a spark to roar into flame.
 
And anything that fails to flee the inferno has little chance of survival. Greek authorities have evacuated tens of thousands from popular resorts at 
 
 peak season. And the government says it's the largest such operation in the country's history.
 
KEVIN SALES, BRITISH TOURIST: All our money, passports, clothing. We have to lend a woman some of my wife's clothes because she had nothing to wear. 
 
 It was terrible.
 
KILEY (voiceover): British tour operators are flying empty planes here to bring desperate tourists home.
 
KILEY: Powerful winds have paid live just about unbearable for people on these islands living through this heatwave, but those selfsame winds of 
 
 fanning the flames of these infernos.
 
KILEY (voiceover): And the problem is spreading. The latest overnight the island of Corfu where thousands have now been evacuated and police are 
 
 bolstering their ranks in anticipation of more to come. The Greek government has been battling wildfires across the country for a week during 
 
 what's expected to be the longest heatwave this country has ever seen. As temperature records are shattered across Europe and the world, every day 
 
 our planet has become slightly more unlivable.
 
POPE FRANCIS, HEAD, CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): We are experiencing here and, in many countries, extreme climatic events, please I 
 
 renew my appeal to the leaders of the nations to do something more concrete to limit polluting emissions. It is an urgent challenge and cannot be put 
 
 off. It concerns everyone. Let us protect our common home.
 
KILEY: As heat waves and fires are escalating yearly in southern Europe. The threat is now even perhaps to the pontiff's own home.
 
Sam Kiley, CNN in Leros.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Elinda Labropoulou joins us now just outside of Athens. Just some of the scenes we've been seeing of those fires out of control are just 
 
 unbelievable. I understand many countries are offering help are on the scene. Just take us through the conditions, the status of those fires right 
 
 now.
 
ELINDA LABROPOULOU, JOURNALIST: Well, at the moment the news is not good. Unfortunately, we've had rekindling in this big fire in roads.
 <br>[10:20:01]
 
We understand that it is -- has been burning homes in just these last few hours. And we have news that another large fire on the island of Evian 
 
 Island that burned down heavily two years ago is again a big fire rekindling there. The island of Corfu looks a little bit better at the 
 
 moment, but there are strong winds blowing across Greece. And we don't have too many hours of daylight left.
 
So as a result, as you understand conditions are becoming more difficult than we know temperatures are expected to rise again, as of tomorrow, as 
 
 Greece is about to go into a third heatwave -- a third heatwave in just three weeks. So, the country is very much like a tinderbox at the moment. 
 
 You know, there's new fires erupting. Every few hours, it seems, of course, most of them are put out quickly.
 
But also, you know, authorities and fire services are stretched. Help, it has been coming in from other countries. Greece has requested assistance. A 
 
 number of E.U. countries and others have come to its help. But conditions are difficult to the evacuations that are underway, particularly on the 
 
 island of roads are the biggest in Greece's history. Such over 20,000 people have been evacuated and thousands of people are trying to get 
 
 flights back home.
 
As you understand this really is the busiest time of the year in these big tourist destinations. And the logistics are extremely complicated trying to 
 
 get these people home, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Yes. I want to get a some more perspective from you on that because we have heard a lot of anger from people. Tourists were flying in 
 
 with no idea completely unaware that their hotels they booked were already evacuated. Just give us a sense of the overall impact on the tourism 
 
 industry right now.
 
LABROPOULOU: Well, I think a lot of things have been happening very quickly. So the -- a number of airlines, a number of tour operators, and 
 
 we're talking about, you know, big numbers of people trying to fly in and out of the islands at the same time. So, it's only fair to assume that not 
 
 everybody has been informed or informed to the degree that they should be. What we do get from the Greek side, however, is that authorities have 
 
 really been trying their best to get everyone out.
 
There have been no casualties, there have been no injuries. A very few people have been taken to the hospitals with any kind of respiratory 
 
 problems. So, the side that you get in this country is that, you know, despite all these difficulties, operations are underway to try and get 
 
 everyone home safely. At the same time, what the Greek authorities are pointing out is that especially the fire in roads is only affecting 10 to 
 
 20 percent of the island.
 
So, the rest of the island is safe that a number of the tourists have been moved to other resorts to other destinations as well. But as you can 
 
 understand, the impact is very heavy on the industry. This is a peak tourist season. And this is a time that people are expecting to make their 
 
 money. This is, you know, through a Greek financial crisis, COVID. So much has happened in these last years.
 
And now, they're -- so, especially for the island of Rhodes, which is a big destination. We expect to have it. The impact will be severe, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Yes. And it certainly sounds like from what the Greek Prime Minister said a short time ago. There'll be difficult days ahead. Elinda 
 
 Labropoulou, good to have you on the story. Thank you.
 
Well, in Algeria, at least 15 people were killed. 26 injured following large wildfires there. The country's interior ministry says 97 fires broke 
 
 out overnight across 16 states, affecting forests and agricultural crops. Some 1500 people were evacuated. Thousands of firefighters have working to 
 
 control the blaze.
 
In a rare admission, an official from Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Arm tells CNN Ukraine launched a drone attack on Moscow earlier today. The 
 
 Russian Defense Ministry says two drones were "Suppressed by electronic warfare means without causing injuries or serious damage. The strikes come 
 
 a day after Russian missile severely damaged a historic Cathedral in Odesa.
 
Alex Marquardt is in Odesa and surveyed the site a short time ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, we did hear President Zelenskyy say that the Russians would feel the retaliation 
 
 for all these strikes in Odesa. Now it appears that this response is -- at least these two drones that are hitting Moscow, a very brazen attack. The 
 
 kind of attack that Ukraine rarely claims responsibility, but they are very clearly today after almost a week of these very intense strikes on Odesa, 
 
 particularly here in the historic city center.
 
This is a UNESCO heritage site. We are inside the Transfiguration Cathedral. Church officials have asked us to put these helmets on because 
 
 they are doing a lot of work around here. There is a lot of debris but I do want to show you around. This is the corner that was most damaged of the 
 
 church. You can see that the ceiling has been completely opened up. This is where we believe the missile or the rocket came in, completely destroying 
 
 this corner.
 
It is amazing to see this much daylight in here just speaks to the fact that this part of the church no longer has any roofing.
 <br>[10:25:06]
 
As we come around here and my cameraman Scott McWhinney is showing you the dome up there. The gorgeous dome of this cathedral. All of those windows 
 
 have been blown out. The frescoes have come down just moments ago, a huge section of this ceiling came crashing down. This altar here to the right is 
 
 only standing upright because it's leaning against that wall. All of those pillars are now -- have now been knocked over.
 
This is a cathedral that has -- that was destroyed back in 1936 and then rebuilt during Ukrainian independence. And it is this kind of strike on 
 
 civilian infrastructure -- on buildings that have nothing to do with the war that has President Zelenskyy saying that what Ukraine needs now is more 
 
 air defenses. What he calls a full-fledged sky shield. Poppy? Erica?
 
ERIC HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Wow. So, look at this, I know you sat down with Ukraine's defense minister. He talks about this onslaught of strikes on 
 
 Odesa. What more did you learn from him?
 
MARQUARDT: We had a really interesting conversation with the defense minister Oleksii Reznikov. Wide ranging, we talked about Ukraine becoming a 
 
 member of NATO. We talked about the ongoing counteroffensive. But I started off by asking him about what's going on here in Odesa. And whether he has 
 
 been surprised at the ferocity of these Russian strikes. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLEKSII REZNIKOV, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE MINISTER: Honestly, not because after the February of last year, it's very difficult to surprise me.
 
MARQUARDT: But it was night after night of drones and missiles, all kinds of different targets. 
 
 They say it was in response to the attack on the Kerch Bridge.
 
REZNIKOV: They every time trying to find the reason for the behavior. The reason how to explain the massive attacks. They try to explain that it's a 
 
 response for some explosions in their territories, but they fighting with the civilians. That's why I call them looters, rapists and murderers.
 
MARQUARDT: You have also issued a threat saying that you will turn other Russian ships into the Moskva which was the flagship of the Black Sea 
 
 Fleet, which you famously sank last April. Are you planning to escalate attacks against Russian ships in the Black Sea?
 
REZNIKOV: We have capacity. We have weaponry as we did with the cruiser Moskva. And if they will, threatening us in the Black Sea, we'll have to 
 
 response.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: And I also asked Reznikov about recent attacks on the Kerch Bridge which connects Russia with Russian-occupied Crimea. As well as 
 
 attacks on the Crimean Peninsula which in the past, Ukrainian officials have been rather coy about not claiming responsibility, but we have seen 
 
 quite a few attacks on both the bridge and on the peninsula lately. Reznikov indicating those will continue.
 
He's making no excuses for the fact that those are vital supply lines. Vital logistical nodes for the Russian occupation and its efforts in 
 
 Ukraine. He says the attacks on those Russian forces on the bridge and in Crimea will continue.

KINKADE: Our thanks to Alex Marquardt there reporting from Odesa. You are watching CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
Still ahead, temperatures soar across the Middle East, forcing people to get creative to give themselves and their animals call. How they're beating 
 
 the heat when we return.
 
And later, excessive heat warnings across the U.S. We'll take a look at what millions of people can expect in the coming week.

 <br>[10:31:31]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade in Atlanta. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. Good to have you with us. Here are your headlines this 
 
 hour. Israel's parliament has approved a controversial bill that would weaken the power of the Supreme Court. The 64 to zero vote happened not to 
 
 opposition members walked out of the chamber. The legislation strips the Supreme Court of the power to declare government actions unreasonable. It's 
 
 facing an immediate court challenge.
 
New wildfires are raging and Greece as the first and most destructive on the island of Rhodes continues to burn out of control. And it's all 
 
 resulting in tens of thousands of evacuations, as visitors are sent packing. Loss tourism revenue on top of mounting property damage.
 
Ukrainian defense official tells CNN that Ukraine launched a drone attack on Moscow earlier today. The Russian Defense Ministry says two drones were 
 
 "suppressed by electronic warfare means" without causing injuries or serious damage. It comes a day after a Russian missile attack severely 
 
 damaged a historic Cathedral in Odessa.
 
People across the Middle East and North Africa are finding it hard to cool off amid a scorching heatwave sweeping the region. Some have figured out 
 
 ways to lessen the impact of the soaring temperatures. But many are finding the heat too much too bad.
 
My colleague Michael Holmes reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): On any given day holding sacks of wheat in Syria is back breaking work. But some workers 
 
 say the oppressive heat makes the loads feel that much heavier.
 
MOHAMMAD AL-AHMED, SYRIAN WORKER (through translator): We're suffering from the high temperatures but we're forced to be here. We have to feed our 
 
 families. We cannot survive if we don't work.
 
HOLMES (voiceover): Getting enough drinking water in this town in the northeast of the country is also hard work. Even before the heatwave, aid 
 
 agencies reported that many households had insufficient access to water. These women line up to fill their containers from a local tank, they to 
 
 complain that it's just too hot.
 
HAYAT HAMOUD, HASAKAH, SYRIA RESIDENT (through translator): The temperature is exceeding 42 degrees Celsius. We're dying from the heat. Moreover, we're 
 
 transporting water in the heat at 60 years old.
 
HOLMES (voiceover): Across the Middle East July and August are normally the hottest months of the calendar in some countries in during long stretches 
 
 of extreme temperatures. But this year, not even halfway through the summer peak period. Forecasters say they are already seeing red flags. According 
 
 to the National Weather Service, one airport in Iran recorded a heat index of nearly 68 degrees Celsius on Sunday or 154 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
Experts say that's so high it would be difficult for human bodies to properly function. For years, Iraq has been paralyzed by high summer 
 
 temperatures. The sizzling heat striking again in Baghdad. Temperatures hovering near or above 47 degrees Celsius over the last few days. Air 
 
 conditioners and misting fans helped to cool people down but power cuts in the city make it hard to run them around the clock without a generator.
 
The heat wave extending to Egypt to with temperatures in Cairo expected to top 40 degrees Celsius through midweek. City trains and metro lines are 
 
 operating at reduced speeds to avoid any problems from the high heat. There have been power cuts here too, those some residents have found simpler ways 
 
 to chill out.
 <br>[10:35:03]
 
AHMED HASSAN, CAIRO, EGYPT RESIDENT (through translator): The heat wave this year is stronger than any other year. We tried to stay in the shade 
 
 more, drink more water and eat more iced food drinks and ice cream.
 
HOLMES (voiceover): Many people preferring to stay off the streets in other cities. In Doha, this delivery driver, one of the few to braved the heat. 
 
 He says he's grateful his company allows him to use a car during the hottest parts of the day. Qatar banned the use of motorcycles for 
 
 deliveries last year, during certain hours to protect drivers from the torrid temperatures.
 
In nearby Dubai, some beaches have opened at night so people can take a dip when it's cool enough to enjoy it. A welcome break from the sun's glare 
 
 that in so many places right now is just too hot to handle. Michael Holmes, CNN.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Well, the summer heat wave continues to millions across the United States. Take a look at the triple digit temperatures in the desert 
 
 southwest and there are heat advisories and excessive heat warnings in the West, the Plains and South Florida. Over 35 million people are impacted by 
 
 the heat warnings.
 
Joining us now is CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. And Derek, more record temperatures were smashed over the weekend in several major cities. But now 
 
 this heatwave is set to expand.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. You know what it's like, right? We live in Atlanta. This is -- this is hot, very, very hot place. But it gets 
 
 hotter than this, believe it or not. We have had over 5000 heat records over the past month across the United States. So that really kind of puts 
 
 it into perspective. Going forward, we've got 150 possible heat records. That includes high temperatures for the day, but record high minimum 
 
 temperatures as well.
 
That's one of the problems, one of the concerns is that overnight lows are not dropping down into their usual low temperature. So, we're not getting 
 
 the opportunity to cool ourselves down. Let me take you to Phoenix because this is another scorching area, this area has seen the environment scorch 
 
 so much. The earth is literally being baked on the asphalt and people who touch or come in contact with the asphalt or going to the hospital with 
 
 second and third-degree burns. That's how hot it is.
 
And we're breaking records there. 24 consecutive days, temperatures above 43 degrees Celsius. And this is shocking. I mean, I have to highlight this 
 
 because it's just so incredible. There were six consecutive days when the temperature reached 46 or higher. That streak came to an end yesterday. 
 
 That tied its longest record for four consecutive days at that temperature. Just incredible.
 
So if you're looking for some relief, if you're in Phoenix, for instance, you got to wait until next week. And that's when the mercury in the 
 
 thermometer only reached 42 degrees for change. Right? Incredible. 35 million Americans under some sort of heat advisory. That's a dry heat up 
 
 the southwest. This is completely different in South Florida. You know, excessive heat warnings. This has only happened a handful of times in 
 
 Miami.
 
Today is one of those days. 43 consecutive days where the mercury thermometer climbed above 38 degrees. That's the heat in the sea when you 
 
 combine the humidity and the actual temperature. Very muggy across the deep South. And look at this, as long as the heat dome continues to expand it, 
 
 we'll move eastward. We're going to see these temperatures go up and up and up for places like Minneapolis, Chicago, D.C., New York, Boston, your next 
 
 heatwave continues to move east. Lynda?
 
KINKADE: Stay indoors. Stay hydrated, Derek Van Dam. Good to have you.
 
VAN DAM: (INAUDIBLE) I can give you. All right.
 
KINKADE: Thanks. Well, another record Saudi author for another world beating football star. Will Kylian Mbappe head for the goal? We're going to 
 
 talk it over with World Sport next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade. It is the end of an era and the death of an icon. Twitter has begun a radical rebranding replacing their 
 
 iconic bird logo with an X. Owner Elon Musk has shared a picture of the company's headquarters lit up with the new logo since Musk took over in 
 
 October. The social media giant has faced steep losses in ad revenue, mass layoffs. And according to Musk has teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.
 
Well as Saudi Arabia continues pushing to make its mark in football, it's pitching a new staff fpr playing in the Gulf. French striker Killian Mbappe 
 
 may never suit up for his hometown of Paris Saint Germain again. And that means the race to secure his talents is on.
 
Well, Saudi Club Al Hilal is making an astounding bid. Our Amanda Davies is here to explain and this is an eye-watering some, Amanda.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes. From eye-watering temperatures that we've been talking about across the network over the last few days. This is 
 
 very much an eye-watering sum of money. We are talking about 300 million euros or just over $330 million. That is almost 100 million euros more than 
 
 the current world record transfer bid in football. And, you know, Saudi Arabia, you remember back in January really made a slash, an impact, didn't 
 
 they? A splash signing Cristiano Ronaldo.
 
More and more players have been moving to Saudi Arabia. But this is next level. This is the France captain. This is Killian Mbappe. A 24-year-old 
 
 superstar in his prime. Is he going to go? Is it just a play to see if they can kick somebody else into action? Let's wait and see. Plenty to talk 
 
 about. And that's what we're doing in a couple of minutes.
 
KINKADE: Imagine it'd be hard to turn that down. Amanda Davies, good to have you with us. Thanks so much. We will see you after the break for more 
 
 World Sport. And I'll be back at the top of the hour with much more news.
