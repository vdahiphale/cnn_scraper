COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What`s up, lovely people. Rise up, pump to be back with you after a Georgia winter break. And welcome to CNN 10, the best 10 
 
 minutes in news because of you. 
 
It`s motivation Monday, so here`s a thought, life presents choices. Then we make decisions. Those decisions influence our destiny. Let`s start this 
 
 week strong, shall we, with some historic news from space. The Odysseus lunar lander nickname "Odie" or the IM-1, became the first U.S. made 
 
 spacecraft to land on the moon in 50 years. It was a bit of a nail biter though. According to the craft developer intuitive machines, which says 
 
 engineers had to overcome navigation issues in order to make the landing possible. 
 
The spacecraft position became a concern when flight controller said they were getting weak signals from the vehicle after a tense weight, intuitive 
 
 machines eventually confirmed that the lander was upright and able to send data back to mission control. 
 
The purpose of this mission is to assess the environment of the moon`s south pole as NASA is planning to send astronauts there towards the end of 
 
 2026. This landing comes after a different us company, boarded its landing attempt last month. 
 
Now, at the same time, the U.S. is accomplishing this feat. Other countries are looking to make their giant leaps to the moon as well. Our Space and 
 
 Defense Correspondent, Kristin Fisher has more.

KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Humans landed on the moon for the first time over 50 years ago. Back then it was really only the 
 
 U.S. and Russia that were in the space race. Now, the European Space Agency says there are over 100 lunar missions planned for the moon before 2030, 
 
 and they`re made up of countries and companies all over the world. 
 
So why is everyone racing to the moon again? Well, the main reasons are resources, exploration, and politics. 
 
The moon is home to many resources like rare earth minerals and elements like the isotope helium three that could prove useful to mine. Helium three 
 
 is hard to find on earth, but it can be found all over the moon and is theoretically vital towards nuclear fusion of possibly game changing, clean 
 
 energy source.
 
Studies have theorized that water in ice form may be available in large quantities on the moon and mining could provide water and oxygen. The 
 
 critical elements needed to make rocket fuel and allow further exploration. 
 
The U.S., Russia, and China all have plans to establish permanent bases on the moon, offering a jumping off point to explore Mars and go even deeper 
 
 into outer space. 
 
But how legal is all of this potential activity on the moon? The 1960, `70 United Nations Outer Space treaty is signed by most countries when it comes 
 
 to lunar laws. But experts say that it needs some updating. It outlines that the moon should be the province of all mankind and should be used 
 
 exclusively for peaceful purposes. So military bases, nuclear weapons and weapons testing are forbidden. 
 
The treaty also stresses cooperation, but critics say that it lacks any means of enforcement, which could prove diplomatically dangerous if it`s 
 
 exploited. 
 
Now, in recent years, the United States has engaged in the new round of space diplomacy called the Artemis Accords. So far, there are more than 30 
 
 signatory nations, but notably China and Russia have not participated. 
 
Many scientists are concerned that mining and development could affect experiments and scientific projects that are already in place. So although 
 
 there is this renewed rush to get to the moon, the future of diplomacy on the moon is a critical question.

WIRE: Pop quiz, hot shot. 
 
What was the name of the first modern credit card? 
 
The Diner`s Club, Mastercard, Visa, or American Express. 
 
If you said The Diner`s Club, put your hands up. The card was put into use in 1950, initially used only in local restaurants before expanding to 
 
 include retailers. One year later, The Diner`s Club had 42,000 members spanning major cities across the U.S. 
 
Now, here`s a wild statistic for you. The total amount of Americans credit card debt surge passed a trillion dollars in 2023, but some economists say 
 
 it`s not necessarily a bad thing citing that the U.S. job market remains solid and wage growth is beating inflation. 
 
Some economists are also saying that Americans are currently better positioned to pay down their debts. And in some cases they`re making enough 
 
 money to also stash some money away in their savings accounts. 
 
Now, having conversations about your money can be tough. Like if a group of friends is headed out, maybe to get a bite to eat and we just don`t have 
 
 the dough to go. It can be tough to say I`m on a budget, bruh. 
 
Well, a new TikTok trend created by comedian Lukas Battle aims at taking the shame out of being frugal, saving money. He uses a term called "Loud 
 
 Budgeting." And our Vanessa Yurkevich met with him to learn more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): In an online world where opulence is king. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was sad, so I went shopping.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): This was a joke.
 
LUKAS BATTLE, COMEDIAN AND WRITER: "Loud Budgeting" is a new concept I`m introducing for 2024. It`s the opposite of quiet luxury. If your friend 
 
 texts you, I want to hang out. You say, I don`t want to spend gas money on coming to you to hear you talk about your ex for three hours.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Comedian and Gen Zer Lukas Battle, inadvertently started a new financial trend.
 
YURKEVICH: What is "Loud Budgeting?"
 
BATTLE: "Loud Budgeting" is kind of new terminology for people to use when they don`t want to spend money. And I think it`s a term people can use that 
 
 doesn`t make talking about money awkward.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): The joke took off with his more than 600,000 TikTok followers, financial influencers, and even himself.
 
YURKEVICH: Were you surprised by how many people have related to it?
 
BATTLE: Yes, only because, and I would love to say I`m a genius, brilliant economist, but this is like a concept that`s been around. And I really do 
 
 think the loud part in front of it is what people are kind of drawn to.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Gen Z and millennials especially feel the burden of inflation, expensive housing, and student loan payments. Budgeting has been 
 
 around since the beginning of time, but in just the four weeks since Battle came up with "Loud Budgeting," more and more people are feeling they now 
 
 have permission to talk about it.
 
YURKEVICH: What do you think about that, being transparent about the fact that you`re on a budget?
 
JAMES SAMPSON JR. SOCIAL WORKER: I think more so it should be normalized about budgeting and saving.
 
YURKEVICH: Why do you think so many people are resonating with it?
 
VIVIAN TU, FOUNDER, YOU RICH BFF: Because for so long we have been shamed into silence. "Loud Budgeting" is amazing because instead of having to hide 
 
 and like be ashamed about the fact that you have debt or need a budget or want to save for certain things in your life, you can proudly say them and 
 
 share them with your friends.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Gen Z and millennials, social media`s most active users, were either entering the job market or working when the pandemic 
 
 hit.
 
Despite having the lowest financial literacy of any generation, recent economic uncertainty has made them the hungriest for information. 
 
TU: With the social edification of society, keeping up with the Joneses is no longer the Joneses. We`re keeping up with the Kardashians. So we`re 
 
 starting to get visualizations of wealth that most regular people will never, ever see in their lives.
 
And so if I`m a young person and I`m in an environment where I feel like it`s going to be challenging for me to succeed, I want to arm myself with 
 
 as much information as I possibly can to give myself that leg up.

WIRE: For today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, we have two stories about two trailblazers as we celebrate the final week of black history month. The 
 
 first person who`s made a lasting impact is 
 
Jane Bolin born in 1908. She was super focused and dedicated as a kid graduating high school at just 15 years old, persevering the challenges of 
 
 growing up as a black girl in that era, she`d go on to become the first black woman to graduate from Yale Law School. First to join the New York 
 
 City bar Association and the first black woman in the U.S. to become a judge. 
 
She served on the bench for 40 years where she ended segregated childcare facilities and race-based assignments of probation officers. She said she 
 
 wasn`t concerned about being first, second, or even last because her primary concern was her work.
 
Next up, Max Robinson, who in 1978 became the first black person to anchor a nightly network news show on ABC`s World News Tonight.

WIRE: Robinson started his career nearly two decades earlier at a local news station in Virginia but his face was hidden behind a graphic. He later 
 
 moved to Washington and became the first black anchor in a major us city. Robinson became an outspoken critic of racism and of the way African 
 
 Americans were portrayed in the media. He`d go on to become one of the founders of the National Association of Black Journalists. Difference 
 
 makers leading the way. 
 
All right, it`s time to show some love now. We`re heading all the way up north to the Aleutians Islands in Akutan, Alaska. The Akutan School. We see 
 
 you, Falcons. 
 
And let`s keep flying high with more feathery friends. This shout out goes to The Eagles at Kennedy Middle School in Aiken, South Carolina. Thank you. 
 
 And thanks to all of you, who`ve subscribed and commented on our CNN 10 YouTube channel for your shoutout request way to start this week strong.
