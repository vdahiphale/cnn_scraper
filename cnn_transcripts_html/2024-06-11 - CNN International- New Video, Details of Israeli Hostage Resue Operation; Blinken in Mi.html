MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us here, our top stories today.
 
Former President Donald Trump completed his pre-sentencing interview with the New York Probation Office following his hush money trial conviction. Trump's sentencing is set for July the 11th. 
 
The jury in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial will resume deliberations today. The U.S. President's son faces three felony charges related to a gun purchase. Prosecutors say he was using illegal drugs and lied about it on a federal form. 
 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will soon depart Tel Aviv for the Gaza Humanitarian Assistance Conference in Jordan. In Israel, Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed the urgency in reaching a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. 
 
Now to a renewed push for that ceasefire in Gaza as the United Nations holds a key vote on a plan to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas. The U.N. Security Council on Monday adopted a U.S. drafted resolution which endorses a proposal for a permanent ceasefire and the release of the hostages held by Hamas. The resolution calls on both parties to implement the terms, quote, without delay and without condition. Hamas said it welcomed the resolution and is ready to engage with mediators. But whether Israel and Hamas will move forward remains unclear.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Colleagues, today this council sent a clear message to Hamas. Accept the ceasefire deal on the table. Israel has already agreed to this deal and the fighting could stop today if Hamas would do the same.

FOSTER: We are learning more about that Israeli military operation that rescued four hostages held in Gaza. This new video gives us a sense of what that raid looked like on the ground. CNN's Kylie Atwood has more. [04:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the view from the helmets of the Israel Defense Forces as they unleashed heavy gunfire, searching for Israeli hostages held by Hamas. 
 
A daring daytime raid that freed four of those kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th and held captive ever since. It was an operation that took weeks to plan after receiving intelligence that the hostages were being held in apartment buildings inside the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the way out from Gaza, our forces rescued our hostages. Israeli forces have been preparing for this rescue mission for weeks.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): An Israeli Air Force pilot involved in the mission told the Jerusalem Post that as one of the hostages, Noa Argamani, got into his helicopter, his unit's, quote, mantle of composure melted away. The magnitude of the moment struck. Then he, quote, immediately reported that the diamond is with us and in good health.
 
Some of the special forces were disguised as displaced Palestinians and members of Hamas's military wing, eyewitnesses told CNN. And there were also reports of large gunfire after the hostages were rescued.
 
At least 274 Palestinians were killed in the operation and hundreds injured. That's according to the Gaza authorities, who do not distinguish between civilian and military casualties. The Israel Defense Forces dispute that number, saying the death toll was under 100.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to say thank you. Thank God.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): In Israel, the families of the hostages express their overwhelming joy at having their loved ones returned safely after eight months in captivity. 
 
ORIT MEIR, MOTHER OF RESCUED HOSTAGE: I haven't stopped smiling since my Almog was returned to me. 
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): Now, as work continues for a ceasefire and hostage deal with 120 hostages still held by Hamas, there are some fears that this raid could be a setback.
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: It's a legitimate question. It's hard for me to put myself in the mindset of a Hamas terrorist. We don't know exactly what it is that they're going to do.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): As Secretary of State Antony Blinken travels to the Middle East to continue ratcheting up pressure on Hamas to take the deal, he also isn't sure what Hamas will do. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I can't put myself, none of us can put ourselves in the minds of Hamas or its leaders. So we don't know what the answer will be.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): But while in Egypt, Blinken also said that his Egyptian counterparts had been in touch with Hamas quite recently.
 
BLINKEN: I can't go into the details of our conversations today except to say that our Egyptian counterparts were in communication with Hamas as early, as recently as a few hours ago.
 
ATWOOD: Now, during his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that the United States and other world leaders stand by that comprehensive proposal that President Biden laid out 10 days ago. And they say that Israel has put on the table for Hamas to accept. 
 
But so long as this period of uncertainty is extended, as the U.S. and other countries are waiting for Hamas to respond to that proposal, the United States is concerned about the possibility of Netanyahu changing his mind and deciding to reject that proposal, even though he signed off on it before it initially went to Hamas.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Joining me, Nada is back with more on what Blinken was saying in the last few minutes.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We know that Blinken has been holding intensive discussions with his counterparts in the Middle East, including, of course, in Israel, with regards to this ongoing ceasefire negotiation. But he also spoke about, of course, American families of hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza. Saying that they were hopeful, of course, given the rescue of four hostages over the course of what was, unfortunately, a deadly raid in Gaza over the weekend. Take a listen to what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLINKEN: I just met with the families of the American hostages in Gaza. I've had the opportunity to meet with them many times now on every trip here to the region when they visited Washington. And as always, it's an incredibly powerful thing.
 
It's hard for any of us to put ourselves in their shoes to feel what they've been feeling these many, many long months. They were elated at the rescue of four hostages just a couple of days ago, but they continue to feel deeply, powerfully this enduring separation from their loved ones. Men and women, civilian and soldier, alive and deceased.
 
But for me, all of the hostages, but especially our eight American families who have loved ones in Gaza, we are determined to bring them home. The proposal that President Biden put forward is the best way to do that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
BASHIR: Now, with regards to that peace proposal put forward by the United States, we also heard from Blinken just then going on to say that he had met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that he had reaffirmed his support for this peace proposal, which the United States has framed as an Israeli proposal. We haven't yet heard a direct and public show of support from the Israeli government for this peace proposal.
 
In fact, yesterday we have been hearing some mixed messages at the U.N. Security Council. We heard from Israel's representative to the U.N. saying that Israel would not engage in meaningless, endless negotiations with Hamas. The objectives of the Israeli government and military remain the same, that they want to see the full destruction of Hamas and the full return of all hostages held captive in Gaza.
 
Of course, in this three-phase peace proposal laid out by the United States at the U.N. Security Council, there are the parameters, the provisions for the full release of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza in exchange of Palestinian prisoners. But it also calls for the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, for the return of Palestinian civilians to all parts of the Gaza Strip. 
 
And, of course, what Hamas wants to see ensured in this ceasefire agreement is the territorial integrity of the Gaza Strip and, of course, no demographic shifts, crucially, within the Gaza Strip.
 
Now, what we have heard so far from Hamas is a statement yesterday off the back of that resolution vote saying that they welcome the deal. As you mentioned, they want to carry on with discussions with mediators, that they are open to those ongoing discussions. It remains to be seen whether they issue a full and firm agreement to this deal.
 
But we also haven't seen that full and firm agreement by the Israeli government. The U.S. continues to reiterate that they believe that the Israeli government will back this deal. But, of course, we've been hearing different messages from those far-right elements of Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition who do not want to see this deal being signed.
 
FOSTER: Nada, thank you. 
 
Authorities in Malawi are searching for a missing military aircraft which was carrying the country's vice president and nine other people. The plane left Malawi's capital shortly after 9 a.m. local time Monday, but never arrived at its destination, and authorities have failed to make contact. Here's Larry Madowo following this from Nairobi. And, apparently, weather may be a factor here, Larry.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That is the big thing here. There was bad weather yesterday, according to President Lazarus Chakwera, and that continues today. We now know that the search and rescue operation has entered day two. It's an air and ground operation. In the last hour, the Malawi Defense Force has given an update on what's going on. They say their search and rescue is getting hampered by this uninhabited area where they believe this plane could have crashed.
 
It's a rough and thick terrain in the Chikangawa Forest. They're also saying that this morning they had, again, bad weather conditions. The area was foggy. Access has been difficult. But they have 200 soldiers actively searching for this plane carrying Malawi's vice president and nine others. They also have the Malawi police, civil aviation authorities, and some forestry service officers all actively involved in this operation.
 
They're using aircraft, fixed-wing and rotor aircraft, as well as some drones to try and locate this aircraft. This should have been an hour- long flight from Lilongwe, the Malawian capital, to Mzuzu, the northern region. But what happened next?
 
Here's President Lazarus Chakwera overnight explaining.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAZARUS CHAKWERA, MALAWIAN PRESIDENT: However, upon arrival in Mzuzu, the pilot was unable to land the plane due to poor visibility, occasioned by bad weather. And aviation authorities advised the aircraft to return to Lilongwe. But the authorities soon lost contact with the aircraft.
 
But I want to assure you that I am sparing no available resource to find that plane. And I am holding on to every fiber of hope that we will find survivors.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: It's been more than 24 hours now. So, sadly, those chances of finding survivors are looking increasingly slim. Malawi has reached out to neighboring countries for assistance and also to the U.S., to the U.K., to Norway and to Israel. And so far, the U.S. Embassy in Malawi says it has offered all its support, including a C-12 military aircraft, to help in this search-and-rescue operation. But the Malawi Defense Force is also saying one of the other problems is so much misinformation around social media around this accident -- Max.
 
FOSTER: Yes, absolutely. Larry in Nairobi, thank you. 
 
The port of Baltimore's shipping channel is now fully reopened more than two months after that cargo ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The accident killed six construction workers and cut off access to the crucial waterway. Crews had to remove about 50,000 tons of wreckage from the river. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
The container ship was stuck in the channel until it was hauled away on May the 20th. Insurance experts estimate replacing the bridge could cost more than $1.2 billion. Still to come, a woman in Texas, recounts her struggle to get routine
 
 care after what she called a horrifically painful miscarriage due to the state's strict abortion laws.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Our new figures show violent crime is on the decline across the U.S. and could be heading for its largest annual decline ever. The FBI reports violent crime from January to March dropped more than 15 percent compared to the same period last year. Murders fell more than 26 percent and rapes decreased by more than 25 percent.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
The U.S. murder rate has been dropping since 2020, where the COVID-19 pandemic brought a surge in homicides of nearly 30 percent across the country. Criminal justice experts say it's surprising that we're only now starting to see the level of gun violence going back to pre- pandemic levels.
 
Now this month marks two years since Roe v. Wade was overturned, changing the landscape of abortion access in the U.S. It also affected access to miscarriage care. In states with abortion bans, such as Texas, many lower-cost clinics have closed down.
 
CNN's Meg Tirrell speaks with a mother who suffered a miscarriage but struggled to find affordable options for care due to the strict abortion laws in Texas.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Two years ago, you were able to get into this clinic.
 
MARLENA STELL, HAD MISCARRIAGE AT HOME: Yes, and now I can't believe it's closed.
 
TIRRELL (voice-over): Marlena Stell came to this abortion clinic in Houston in the fall of 2021 after a miscarriage at 9 1/2 weeks pregnant. She needed a DNC, a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue, the same procedure used for surgical abortions. But because Texas had just passed a law banning most abortions after six weeks, she said doctors refused to provide the procedure at her hospital, possibly fearing being sued, a story she shared two years ago with CNN.
 
STELL: I get so angry that I was treated this way. 
 
Again. One, two, three.
 
TIRRELL (voice-over): In May of this year, Estelle lost another pregnancy.
 
STELL: Because we knew we were having a boy. And so it's a little fuzzy outfit. So that's what hurt even more because that's what we wanted, is a boy. TIRRELL (voice-over): Doctors say Texas law is clear that DNC procedures are legal in cases like Stell's, and she hoped to have one to treat this miscarriage. But as she hadn't planned to get pregnant again, she didn't have insurance that covered it.
 
STELL: Like, I wanted to have that DNC. I didn't want to have to go through it at home knowing that it was going to be horrifying.
 
TIRRELL: You thought that you'd be able to schedule this at your local hospital up the road, and then you checked the estimate they sent you.
 
STELL: Yes. I was shocked at how high it was. It's, to be exact, $14,368, and that's with a discount if I pay out of pocket.
 
And that's when it hit me like a brick, like, OK, this isn't happening for me here. 
 
TIRRELL: So your doctor then said, look at a clinic. 
 
STELL: Yes, she actually said, you know, go to Planned Parenthood. It'll be much less expensive. That's your best option. And then I started Google searching abortion clinics in the area, and I was looking for the clinic I went to last time.
 
TIRRELL: Then having that loss and searching for care, you looked here again thinking you'd at least go back. 
 
STELL: And then I had no idea it was closed.
 
TIRRELL: What's it like for you seeing it boarded up like this?
 
STELL: It's sad. It makes me a little angry.
 
TIRRELL (voice-over): That clinic was one of 22 brick-and-mortar abortion clinics operating in Texas in 2021, within a year after Roe v. Wade was overturned. Only 12 were still in operation, providing other services than abortions.
 
So Marlena started looking outside of Texas. She ultimately booked flights to Los Angeles and an appointment at an abortion clinic there that's able to perform D&amp;C procedures at a lower cost than hospitals. All of it, including the travel, she estimates, for a quarter of the cost at her local hospital in Houston.
 
But before she left, she started bleeding and feeling extreme pain at home. That meant she couldn't travel, prompting fear over what she would then endure.
 
STELL: This is the changing table we had for my daughter that we kind of saved. And then in the end, not only not getting it, but going through something so horrifically painful and so traumatizing, like I will, for the rest of my life, have to live with that image of what I saw when I miscarried at home.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: Now a man some described as one of the most impactful social justice leaders of the 20th century has died. Reverend James Lawson Jr. was a civil rights icon who trained activists in nonviolent protest. He died on Sunday in Los Angeles at the age of 95.
 
Lawson was imprisoned in 1951 after refusing to register for the draft. After his release, he travelled to India, where he studied Mahatma Gandhi's use of nonviolence, which he later taught to students and activists in the southern United States. Lawson served as pastor of Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles from 1974 to 1999.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden held an early Juneteenth celebration at the White House on Monday, telling the crowd Black history is American history. Juneteenth is a federal holiday marking the end of slavery in America. Mr. Biden invited Gladys Knight, Patti LaBelle, and others to perform in a star-studded concert ahead of the actual holiday on June 19th. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
Vice President Kamala Harris also spoke, saying this year's Juneteenth would be a day of action for voting rights. Biden signed a bipartisan bill into law in 2021, making it an official federal holiday.
