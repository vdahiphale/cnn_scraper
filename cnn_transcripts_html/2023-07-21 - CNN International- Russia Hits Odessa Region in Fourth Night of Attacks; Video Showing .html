(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to CNN "Newsroom". I'm Christina Macfarlane live in London in for Max Foster today. Just ahead, Russia destroys tons of Ukrainian crops in a fourth straight night of strikes on the key port of Odessa. Then the Women's World Cup is heating up as defending champions the United States prepared to take on rivals Vietnam.
 
And the movie showdown we've all been waiting for is here, Barbie and Oppenheimer finally hit the big scream today, the latest on Barbenheimer just ahead. Air raid sirens rang out in the Ukrainian poor City of Odessa as the country's southern region came under intense Russian attack for the fourth night in a row.
 
An official in Odessa says grain infrastructure was hit with 100 tons of peas and 20 tons of barley destroyed. Meanwhile, America's CIA Chief says he believes Vladimir Putin is now trying to buy time, but he suspects the Russian President will ultimately take revenge against Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.
 
CNN's Scott McLean is here and joining me now. Also significant comments overnight from the U.S. National Security Council and the CIA were comments saying that Russia may attempt a false flag operation against civilian boats in the Black Sea.
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So this sounds a lot like what we've heard about claimed by both sides, frankly, about the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, that one would hit the plant to try to blame it on the other. But this is originating from the United States.
 
They say that they have intelligence that indicates that they this may be the case that the Russians would look to hit some kind of a boat in the Black Sea, some kind of a ship in the Black Sea, either Ukrainian or otherwise, and then blame the Ukrainian. So this originated with the White House National Security Council, but this was repeated yesterday by the CIA Chief Bill Burns yesterday. Here's what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BURNS, CIA DIRECTOR: We see some very concerning signs of the Russians considering the kind of false flag of operations that you know we highlighted in the run up to the war as well in other words, looking at ways in which you know, they might make it to -- shipping in the Black Sea and then blaming it or trying to blame it on the Ukrainian.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCLEAN: So why Russia would want to do this is not really clear the Russians themselves are calling this idea pure fabrication, but it comes at a time when tension is obviously high on the Black Sea, the Grain Deal that had been agreed. Since the early months of war between the Russians and the Ukrainians has now expired.
 
It doesn't seem like it's coming back anytime soon. The Russians have now taken away all security guarantees. In fact, they said that ships entering Ukrainian ports are headed in that direction are fair game for Russian strikes. And they also said that whoever's flag is on those ships could also be considered a party to the conflict on the side of Ukraine.
 
Ukrainians have also warned though that Russian ships heading into their own ports could also be fair game, both sides saying that look, they could be carrying weapons. Ultimately, the Kremlin called this statement dangerous and acknowledged that there is a potential threat.
 
All the while you have Odessa's port being targeted. You have foodstuffs, grain barley things like that being destroyed. But that's sort of a drop in the bucket in the global food market. The bigger threat obviously, is Ukraine's ability to actually use its ports.
 
Since yes, it can move food grain in other ways. It can move it by rail, it can move it by truck, things like that, but it cannot do it in the same volume. And so that's where we're going to see a real disruption to global food prices.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, and continue targeting of Odessa as well, as we've seen again overnight. Scott, thank you. Now the U.S. confirms Ukrainian troops have begun using American provided cluster munitions in combat, and the U.S. National Security Council says they're already having an impact on the battlefield.
 
Earlier this month, Washington announced it would be sending Kyiv the controversial munitions that are outlawed in more than 100 countries CNN's, Natasha Bertrand joining me now live at the Pentagon. And Natasha, U.S. officials confirming that cluster munitions is now being used.
 
It's been I think, what two weeks since some it's much controversy, the U.S. agreed to send these. So what impact do we know if any they are actually having on the battlefield?
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Christina, this happened very quickly. Just two weeks ago, the Biden administration announced that they would be sending these cluster munitions to Ukraine. About a week later, the Ukrainians told my colleague Alex Marquardt that they had in fact received those cluster munitions.
 
And now we are learning from U.S. officials as well as Ukrainians briefed on the matter that they have begun actually firing those munitions on the battlefield.
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
Now, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, John Kirby he did say to reporters yesterday that these munitions have been having an impact on the battle. And he said the Ukrainians have been using them effectively and appropriately. And that last part there appropriately is very, key because there had been concerns.
 
Of course, that these munitions could pose a risk to civilians if they were used in densely populated areas, as the Russians have used them since the war in Ukraine began. But according to the National Security Council, as well as military officials, the Ukrainians, of course, have not been using them in pop areas that are densely populated with civilians.
 
And have instead been using them in kind of open fields and against Russian targets. Now, it remains unclear just how effective these have actually been. We have not gotten many details from the White House, or the Pentagon about whether these munitions have actually allowed Ukraine to break through those Russian defensive lines and make more significant progress than they were able to before they received the munitions.
 
But the key part of these munitions being useful to the Ukrainians is going to in the end, be about those ammunition shortages that they had been facing. The U.S. provided these munitions because they were so concerned that Ukraine might not have enough artillery ammunition to last it through its counter offensive.
 
Particularly because the counter offensive has dragged on and not made as much progress as the West had initially believed. So that's really where these munitions are going to be key, but of course, the Ukrainians are really going to have to figure out how to de-mine these areas and make sure that these munitions don't pose a long term risk to civilians, Christina.
 
MACFARLANE: All right, Natasha there at the Pentagon, thanks very much, Natasha. Now in India, a shocking and graphic video has emerged showing two women being sexually assaulted. Protesters protests broke out after the video was played on social media. CNN has decided not to air the video out of respect for the survivors of the brutal attack.
 
An indigenous group says the assault happened in early May in the northeastern suburb of Manipur. The video shows the terrified women being forced to walk naked through the crowd of fully clothed men and women when then allegedly taken to a field to be gang raped, an allegation, which is now under investigation.
 
Our CNN's Vedika Sud has the latest for us and joins us from New Delhi and Vedika we were saying there, it's understood this video, or this incident took place in early May and only came to light because this video was circulating on social media. What has the response there been to this nationwide? And why has it taken the government so long to have a reaction or response to this?
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: Christina, I wonder what would have happened if this video wouldn't have surfaced on social media. Because all the reactions all the action on the ground by the establishment by the government by the administration is only happening after this video has gone viral.
 
Of course, there's contamination across political lines from the opposition parties in Parliament and outside there have been massive protests. All the opposition parties want a discussion, a detailed discussion on the violence, ongoing violence in Manipur. And on this video of the sexual assault experienced and witnessed by two women that you see in the 26 second long clip.
 
It's a horrifying clip. It's deeply disturbing. It's costly. And a lot of people like I said, I've condemned what has happened to those two women, more than three dozen men was surrounding these two women, they were absolutely naked, they were forced down the road and then take into a field where they were allegedly gang raped.
 
They cried out for help. They tried to cover their body with their bare hands. But there was no help that came their way. And we do know that a complaint was filed. And this incident took place on the fourth of May a complaint had been filed. But it's taken more than two months for action on the ground.
 
And that's the question we've asked the police in Manipur, they've had no concrete answer. The Chief Minister of the state has said that four people have been arrested. We have talked about four of more than three dozen people who are on the ground when the women were being sexually harassed.
 
It's taken more than 2.5 months to arrest this four people from the three dozen people that we can support in that video. Now, the Indian Prime Minister had not spoken until Thursday, on the violence in Manipur, the violence is due to ethnic clashes between two communities.
 
Both these communities want access to government benefits. And that's the key reason for the violence in Manipur that's just been escalating and going on for a while. Over 100 people have died since May and could tens of thousands have been displaced. But here's what the Indian Prime Minister had to say about this video on Thursday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NARENDRA MODI, INDIAN PRIME MINISTER: And I want to assure the countrymen that no culprit will be spared. The law with all its might and strictness will take steps one by one.
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
Whatever has happened with the daughters of Manipur will never be forgiven.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUD: But the opposition lawmakers want more inside parliament and outside they want a detailed discussion on the ongoing violence in Manipur. They want a detailed statement from the Indian Prime Minister, but a lot of questions as well that the establishment must answer. While there's so much national outrage across India over this incident.
 
People want to know why it's taken over 70 days for this action. And if there was a case filed initially in May itself, why has this issue only surface now and like I said, only four arrests of the three dozen men who sexually assaulted groped and harassed those two young women, back to you.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, well, let's hope that this clamor for action does result in justice for these women. Vedika Sud, appreciate reporting. Thank you. Turning now to the American soldier who dashed into North Korea, the Pentagon says private Travis King is officially AWOL or absent without leave.
 
Adding that it doesn't think he would have any intelligence that North Korea would find valuable. The Pentagon also said there was no indication King's crossing was planned in coordination with the North. South Korean court documents show King had been accused of the assault in the past.
 
And U.S. officials say at some point he had spent 50 days in a detention facility. The army says had he returned to the U.S. he absolutely would have faced additional consequences. We heard from his mother earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLAUDINE GATES, TRAVIS KING'S MOTHER: I just want my son back. I just want my son back. Get my son home. Get my son home. And pray -- comes back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Were moments ago we just heard from John Kirby the spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Adviser. He said the U.S. is reaching out to find out about private King but has had no luck with the North Koreans. OK, Turning now to the Women's World Cup.
 
The two time defending champions from the U.S. will kick off their title defense later today. They will be heavy favorites in the first match against Vietnam. But the Americans are a bit banged up several star players have been hurt including the 2019 World Cup top scorer and Meghan Rapinoe, who plans to retire later this year.
 
CNN's Carolyn Manno joining us here live, and Carolyn, all eyes on the U.S. Women's National Team trying for a third consecutive crown this month, but what can you tell us about Megan Rapinoe and some of these injuries we've just been reporting. CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Christina, it's great to be with you. I mean, there's a reason why that would be a historic feat. That's three feet because it's so challenging to do. And Megan Rapinoe has said you know that she's already accomplished a lot in this sport and even if she's not 100 percent.
 
It's just great to be there and try for it. I mean, you have to think about this roster and the way that it's made up 14 of the 23 women on the United States roster in this opening match are going to have this pressure and intensity that they'll be feeling for the first time because they haven't been here before.
 
I mean, more than half the players on the U.S. roster are making their World Cup debut. But the expectation for this team is always to win no matter what injuries decide. That is something that is deeply ingrained in the program's culture. That's something that's been handed down for decades.
 
Think about me a hand and so many wonderful players that have come before them on the U.S. side. For the nine women including Megan Rapinoe on the roster who did win the title back in 2019. They know what this moment means they are directly connected to this sort of vibrant, competitive set and expanded tournament with so many debutantes because they helped to create it.
 
I mean, you know, their first opponent in Vietnam, will be there for the first time. So many of these other countries have built this competitive infrastructure, this culture this fandom, this frenzy that we're seeing with record crowds in New Zealand, in large measure as a result of the U.S. women and the previous success that they've had.
 
So it's a great point of pride for a player like Megan Rapinoe, even if she's not 100 percent, who is said, as you mentioned, to retire after this, she's now just one cap away from hitting 200. So if she does appear in this first game, she'll become the 14th player to accomplish that feat in U.S. Women's National Team history. Even though her health is still a question mark for her just being able to do that is still a thrill.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MEGAN RAPINOE, 2- TIME WORLD CUP WINNER: The nerves are still kind of there and the excitement. There's nothing quite like that and only comes every four years. So it's a nice little treat every time.
 
LINDSEY HORAN, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM CAPTAIN: And this is why World Cups are so cool. You get to travel around the world and play in some amazing places. So I think one this is amazing for New Zealand and Australia. I think we're all so happy to be here. It's a little more difficult for family and friends to get here but we're making it possible.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MANNO: And Christina, it would obviously be a shocking upset if they couldn't manage their way past Vietnam who's here for the first time but you think about how difficult the tournament is. This is going to be a real test and Netherlands on top the 2019 final opponent. So it should be really interesting to watch but everybody here stateside is excited.
 
MACFARLANE: There I bet they are and I wouldn't really want to be in Vietnam shoes come Saturday morning.
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
But wait and see Carolyn Manno, great to speak to you, thank you. And we'll have more on the action of the Women's Football World Cup on "World Sport" coming up in about 15 minutes. Now still to come an explosion of pink as Barbie and Oppenheimer, head to the cinemas and who better to talk to us than a nuclear engineering student who just so happens to be Miss America. That's coming up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Cinema lovers of all stripes have been counting down to today as Christopher Nolan's atomic biopic Oppenheimer opens in theaters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Running a race against the Nazis and I know what it means if the Nazis have a bomb.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: And it clashes directly with Greta Gerwig's much awaited plastic fantastic take on Barbie.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Barbie, can I come to your house tonight?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sure. I don't have anything they plan just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies and plant choreography and a bespoke song. You should stop by.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So cool.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: It's the biggest box office face off in years and some fans can't decide which ones are going to see. So they aren't many today are going to see both films back to back in a craze known only as Barbenheimer. And we should note Barbie is a film which Warner Brothers which is owned by our parent company Warner Brothers Discovery is running.
 
And joining me now is a film fan with some unique insights into both films. Grace Stanke is a nuclear engineering student who also is the reigning Miss America. Grace, as I can see on your head right now. I'm so glad you chose to wear the crown, welcome.
 
GRACE STANKE, MISS AMERICA 2023: It's always a win wearing the crown. It really is.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, I can see that. Now listen, people are calling you, Barbenheimer personified. I mean, how do you feel about that?
 
STANKE: I mean it's really unusual it's not something I expected, because I'm equally excited about both of these movies. Oppenheimer is showing the birthplace of my entire industry, right? But the nuclear field has evolved beyond what weaponry is. It has created clean energy for 10 percent of the globe.
 
It continues to produce medicinal isotopes that help save lives. My dad is a two time cancer survivor because of nuclear medicine technology. Additionally, Barbie is all about women's empowerment. It's I believe, at least I haven't seen it yet. But it's about showing that women can really do anything they set their minds to.
 
And that's part of my mission as Miss America is to show that yes, I can be Miss America and a nuclear engineer. I can be the woman who can't write and that's something that I'm so excited about movies.
 
MACFARLANE: And your two worlds could not be further apart. And I know you have been traveling the country of trying to dispel myths about nuclear energy and what is traditionally considered to be a beauty pageant, let's be honest.
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
How difficult has it been to kind of bust those stereotypes on both sides of the aisle?
 
STANKE: There is always going to be stereotypes for both of those things. I think that's something that will always be combating, especially as Miss America because it has 100 year old history of being a beauty competition. And now we've moved beyond that I was not judged on my physical, external appearance.
 
It's more about who you are, what are you doing to be a leader? What are you doing to bring change to your community in a positive way? And that is something that I'm so excited and honored to represent. Additionally, when it comes to nuclear, people are actually very open- minded to learn more about it.
 
It's about providing the opportunity so people can ask questions that help a lot and it's been wonderful. Most people are so excited to learn. They're excited to see more about what the nuclear industry can do.
 
MACFARLANE: Well, I think I heard that you are in obviously intending to see both movies. The question there was, which one will come first?
 
STANKE: I think I'm going to go see Oppenheimer first. I just feel like as a nuclear engineer, I have to, you know,
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, I hear you. And actually, even though I'm wearing pink today, I too am going to see Oppenheimer first this evening. But listen, Grace, it's an inspirational story. Thank you so much for speaking to us and enjoy your moment. This is your day, essentially.
 
STANKE: Well, thank you so much. I appreciate it, Christina.
 
MACFARLANE: All right, Grace Stanke there. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break, Miss America.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back. A unique new strategy aims to restore the dwindling population of an endangered seahorse in Australian waters. Hundreds of ABC seahorses have been released into what scientists are calling hotels place beneath the surface of Sydney's harbor, Isa Soares explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This may look like divers simply releasing seahorses into the ocean. The divers like to think of it this way, seahorses checking in to a new hotel room. The room is a structure made from biodegradable metal, a construction of the Sydney Seahorse Project working to conserve the endangered white seahorse species.
 
MITCHELL BRENNAN, PROJECT MANAGER AT SYDNEY SEAHORSE PROJECT: The essentially what we're trying to do is to give the seahorses habitats so the reason that these species is endangered is through habitat loss, so the loss of things that seahorses and soft corals.
 
So the seahorse hotels, we place out into the wild and then over time, they will accumulate lots of natural growth, including sponges and algae and become a suitable habitat for all the seahorses replacing that habitat that's been lost or degraded in the past.
 
SOARES (voice over): Seahorses are actually fish. The white seahorse, also known as the Sydney Seahorse is one of two seahorse species in the world to be classified as endangered.
 
BRENNAN: This is largely due to human impacts, including the effects that we have on their habitats. We've seen dramatic population losses which mean that we need to act now in order to help these guys persist into the future.
 
SOARES (voice over): About above sea level, several 100 seahorses are bred at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science Aquarium.
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
In 2020, 90 of them were released from this facility into the wild.
 
BRENNAN: After one year 20 percent of the seahorses were still found on the seahorse hotels. So it's a really positive first sign. As well, 9 seahorses were observed to be pregnant within the wild, which is really positive for the reproductive success of them after they're released.
 
SOARES (voice over): This month, they release more than 350 seahorses, hoping to save them from extinction and conserve the ecosystem. Isa Soares, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE: And finally, hundreds of Golden Retrievers from all over the world gathered in Scotland recently. The dogs and their owners made the pilgrimage to the breed's ancestral home in the Scottish Highlands. The Gathering marked 155 years since the first litter was raised by a Scottish Lord in the 19th century.
 
The five day event was filled with contests and fun activities. And needless to say the guest of honor had a wait for it for some time. That is a lot of good boys in one place, isn't there? The question I have though is how do you find your particular dog? When they're all grouped together like that at the end of it?
 
We look how many there are. There's hundreds. Anyway, this is the best possible way to end a Friday show for me. Thank you for joining us here on CNN "Newsroom". I'm Christina Macfarlane in London. "World Sport" with Amanda Davis is up next.
