THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey there, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I`m Coy Wire.
 
We have a special edition of CNN 10 today. We`ll end with our typical 10 out of 10 story, but we`re going to start with a feature piece on the 
 
 future, specifically of travel.
 
Planes, trains and automobiles those are typically the modes of transportation we think about when we travel today, but some folks are 
 
 reimagining a future where the new modes of transportation are so efficient and so fast. It could break the speed of sound. That would make the entire 
 
 world more accessible. Instead of going to a friend`s house across town for dinner, someday we might be talking about zipping over to a friend`s house 
 
 across an ocean.
 
One of the potential new forms of travel in CNN`s "The Next Frontier": kind of reminds me of a scene from that blockbuster movie "Elf".

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Through the sea of swirly, twirly gum drops.

WIRE:  That`s right. Being shot through a tube super-fast.
 
CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon has more about "The Next Frontier".
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Whether through the air, along the track or on the road, modern day transportation has transformed the way 
 
 we travel on a global scale, allowing mobility like never before. But as growing populations and densely packed cities stress these systems, 
 
 innovators around the world are imaginating faster more sustainable ways to get from A to B.
 
From supersonic planes to hyperloop pods, what may seem like a pipe dream today could be the future of transit as early as three decades from now.
 
To envision the future of travel, you should first look to the past. To a city that heralded modern day transportation, innovation.
 
ALISYN MALEK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NEWLAB DETROIT:  Detroit is the Motor City it`s known the world over. We put the world on wheels. It was here that 
 
 Henry Ford pioneered the production lines that allowed us to more quickly produce vehicles in a way that improved quality and allowed more people to 
 
 be able to afford cars.
 
I`m Alisyn Malek and I`m the managing director of Newlab Detroit. I`m working to help bring a better, more prosperous vision of mobility for 
 
 everyone around the world.
 
When I think about urban mobility, some of the key pillars that are really critical for that to be successful are accessibility, how easy are the 
 
 mobility solutions to get to how frequent are the services running, what areas are covered. As we look towards 2050, we`re going to be getting up 
 
 close to 9 billion people.
 
From a transportation perspective, it`s really about options and making sure that everybody has at least two if not more of how they can get 
 
 around.
 
A lot of the systems that we`re using were great. They are still great, but we actually need to think about what other solutions can we put out that 
 
 are useful and also create a great user experience.
 
SOLOMON:  One solution that`s certainly gotten a lot of hype over the last decade is the hyperloop. The proposed train in a tube is looking to upend 
 
 the way we travel, with speeds up to a thousand kilometers per hour it could zoom across an entire continent and just a few hours.
 
Netherlands-based Hardt Hyperloop is aiming to bring this high-speed technology to life.
 
MARS GEUZE, CO-FOUNDER, HARDT HYPERLOOP:  Our vision is to create a world where distance doesn`t matter, where it`s possible for you to be much more 
 
 free in where you live, work and how you travel, to really shrink the world for people to live in.
 
To me, the next frontier is to realize sustainable, high-speed and convenient transport of passengers and goods.
 
SOLOMON:  This future forward concept is actually built on the backbone of a 19th century idea where compressed air propelled rail cars through a 
 
 network of pipes. Today, hyperloop technology is based on two key mechanisms, removing aerodynamic drag through vacuum-like tubes and 
 
 removing friction through magnetic levitation or maglev, which makes the pods float and move forward. Together, these systems allow hyperloop to 
 
 achieve ultra-fast speeds.
 
GEUZE:  Now, we`re in the first integrated test track that we`ve built. We`ve tested a 4,000 kilo or 8,000 pounds vehicle to really show the normal 
 
 loads that you would have on a tube and that you can still have your levitation system carry that weight.
 
MALEK:  Hyperloop as a technology is very interesting. It does work. You`re cutting down on things like drag and friction.
 
High level from a basic physics perspective, that`s really interesting.
 
SOLOMON:  And according to Geuze, those properties of physics are what make hyperloop better for the environment.
 
GEUZE:  In a hyperloop, because you remove the aerodynamic resistance, you reduce the energy consumption and therefore you become a much more 
 
 sustainable solution.
 
SOLOMON:  Companies across the globe are racing to make their own hyperloop, but Geuze says it`s more collaborative than competitive with a 
 
 collective goal to make the world more connected.
 
GEUZE:  There`s already a lot of work being done on setting up a regulatory framework to ensure that we finally converge to a single interoperable 
 
 hyperloop network.
 
SOLOMON:  Seven pioneering hyperloop companies have announced they are joining forces to launch the first global hyperloop association. It 
 
 includes companies like Transpod, Hyperloop One and Zeleros.
 
This newly formed pact aims to help grow this emerging transportation market as well as work with government and regulatory agencies on policy 
 
 making.
 
As we look to the future for hyperloop, Malek says the technology is there it`ll come down to how it performs against current options.
 
MALEK:  How does the capability of hyperloop match up against competitive technologies, and does it have a reason to win? We`re still seeing really 
 
 great performance out of technologies like maglev trains, which are being used in Asia quite a bit already.
 
GEUZE:  I think is realistic that in 2015, you could have a global hyperloop network up and running. What motivates me the most is that if we 
 
 can get this done, it will have a massive impact in bringing sustainability to our mobility patterns.

WIRE:  All right. Continuing with our news on travel, we`ll take a look at the original form of travel and that`s by foot. And sometimes when you 
 
 travel, you want to travel in style. Well, what say you about these kicks that took New York fashion week by storm? The aptly named Big Red Boot make 
 
 you look like you walked right out of a Super Mario game. Would you rock `em? I don`t know if I would.
 
CNN`s Jeanne Moos has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  These boots are made for flaunting fashion influencers are styling them.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s a goofy shoe. I give them a 10 out of 10.
 
MOOS:  Even influencers of the grandpa generation. Wrestler Seth Rollins pretends stomped his opponent wearing big red boots.
 
Ever since they went on sale for 350 bucks and sold out in minutes, fashionistas can`t shut up about the Big Red Boots created by the art 
 
 collective MSCHF.
 
They do make you want to touch them.
 
STEVE NATTO, TIKTOK/@STEVENATTO24:  Yeah, yeah.
 
MOOS:  YouTube sneakerhead Steve Natto found that out when he wore them to sneaker con.
 
NATTO:  And some people asked to touch the shoot.
 
MOOS:  How do they feel?
 
Well, the top part --  
 
NATTO:  Its flexible but the bottom part is definitely not.
 
MOOS:  Steve says they`re comfy. He wore them all day without pain.
 
Their creator describes them as cartoonish. Some refer to them as Astro Boy boots.
 
And though they`re easy to put on, getting them off can get you stuck if you`re not wearing your perfect size.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My foot got stuck so I had to do -- I have to do what I had to do, man.
 
MOOS:  Now they`re showing up on everyone from puss in big red boots to the character boots from Dora the Explorer to Tony Soprano paired with a 
 
 bathrobe.
 
People wanted to buy them right off Steve`s feet offering --  
 
NATTO:  I got like 800, 900, a thousand. I think I got like 1,300 or 1,400. They just kind of kept going up.

WIRE:  All right. All you boot-tiful people, thanks for spending part of your day with us. Today is February 28th, National Pancake Day. So happy 
 
 stacking if that`s your speeding and try them with peanut butter if you`re feeling frisky.
 
Shout out to Schroeder Middle School today in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Go Raiders! Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube 
 
 channel.
 
What is within influences what happens without. So, let`s get our minds right today.
