PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR:  In just hours, Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz will sit for their first interview of the campaign with our very own Dana Bash. And ahead of that, I think it's fair to say, Georgia's on their minds. They're continuing their bus tour of the Peach State today, and Harris is getting some promising new numbers there. A new Fox News poll shows Harris at 50 to Trump's 48.
 
While there's still no clear leader, it is a tangible difference from the deficit President Biden faced there just a few months ago. But Harris very clearly doesn't appear to be taking any momentum for granted.

KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Everyone vote actually matters, and we have to remind people of that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That is hard work.
 
HARRIS:  Don't listen to anybody who is suggesting otherwise. You never want to take yourself out of the game, right?

Joining me now, Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. And Parker Short, he's the president of the Young Democrats of Georgia. You may recognize him also from a, now very famous, viral video of dance moves and pretty impressive encyclopedic knowledge of "Not Like Us." In terms of the actual song itself, Kendrick Lamar's song itself.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
Tia, I want to start with you. What do you -- what's your sense in your reporting of the driving strategy of this bus tour?
 
TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION:  I think the drive -- the driving strategy of the bus tour is to reach every potential Democratic voter. It's clear from day one that they are going after their base that resides in rural Georgia. So, these are black voters, Democratic voters. And I think they want to just kind of give those voters an in-person touch to drum up support and drum up turnout knowing that it's going to be close in Georgia.
 
MARTIN:  Parker, to be clear, I know you're more than a viral video. I do regret to inform you that we'll follow you for the rest of your life, but there are worse things. Can I ask, you know, one of the questions that I've had as I've watched you both, not just there, but also, some of the stuff you were doing at the convention, polling still shows Trump with leads in younger voters generally, at least better numbers with younger voters overall and leads with younger voters in Georgia.
 
What's your sense right now in terms of what the campaign, the Harris campaign needs to do to change that down the home stretch in Georgia?
 
PARKER SHORT, PRESIDENT, YOUNG DEMOCRATS OF GEORGIA:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me. It's an honor to be here with Tia Mitchell, one of the best reporters in the State of Georgia. But they are doing pretty much everything they should be doing.
 
As the president of the Young Democrats of Georgia, you know, I've been involved in this work for a long time. I know how to reach out to young voters. And you know what is happening right now, all of our students across the State of Georgia are returning to college campuses. In 2022, the State of Georgia reelected Reverend Raphael Warnock. Well, since then, 200,000 more young people have registered to vote in the state.
 
So, this weekend at Georgia Tech, the Young Democrats are hosting a convention with all of our folks back in school at the AUC Morehouse, Spelman and Georgia Tech and Emory and, you know, across the metro area and we're engaging young folks. I know the Harris campaign is reaching out, and I think the truth of it is that the Georgians know that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have attacked their rights.
 
You know, my friends, my peers, my partner are all scared to be pregnant in the State of Georgia because it really is dangerous because we don't have laws that care for the health and the safety of our people. So, I think young people know what's at stake. I think young people want a safer climate and a better Georgia, and I know we're going to turn out. Polling is one thing, but I feel the energy on the ground, and I'm excited to have all these young voters on our college campuses show up and make the difference on November 5th.
 
MATTINGLY:  You know, it's an interesting point. It's a very clear-cut strategy, and I think one that has paid off in the past, perhaps through different platforms and mechanisms. But what's been interesting in looking at kind of the polling over the course of the better part of the last year, the Trump campaign has a very clear advantage with younger men in particular, college campuses in particular, their outreach has been very tailored to them. What media they do is very tailored to them. They think that they can turn them out in large numbers to their advantage. Do you think that's wrong?
 
SHORT:  I think that the Trump campaign is using tactics of fear to reach out to young men. You know, we are seeing something among young men where they're more disaffected, where they're going to college at lower rates. But you know, I have a wonderful little brother in Atlanta and he is probably what the Trump campaign would think they would be able to reach out to. You know, he works in the service industry. He never went to college.
 
But him and I sat and watched even the Biden-Trump debates, and he just said, God, Trump is a bad man and Biden's got a good heart. I think young people know what's at stake. Young people know that we need a safer climate. When Trump is out here attacking women, attacking our climate, attacking our future, attacking our education, I really think young people will see that.
 
And I am making a call to young men. We need to be responsible. We need to be self -- we need to not be selfish in this moment. And we need to understand that, you know, what it means to be a real man, what it means to be masculine is not to cower and hide in this, you know, old idea of masculinity. It's to care about people, to be a good neighbor, to be a good person, to help somebody change their tire, not to be hateful and continue this rhetoric of, you know, what Donald Trump is elevating men should be.
 
MATTINGLY:  Tia, I feel like we've talked about this probably a million times over the course of the last several years. Governor Brian Kemp and the former president, they've gone through some things. It's been a journey. And yet, Kemp's going to attend the Trump fundraiser today in Atlanta. Obviously, we know about their relationship. It has been rough to say the least. Here's what he told Fox News this morning. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  Well, look, there was a little distraction, obviously, on their side when it came to Georgia. But to me, that's in the past. I've been saying that, guys, literally for over a year now, that I was going to support our nominee, that we had to win Georgia. The road to the White House runs through Georgia. And I still believe today, we cannot afford four more years of Kamala Harris.

 <br>[10:40:00]
 
MATTINGLY:  Tia, I think the part I chuckle at is this has never been Kemp's problem. He's never been picking the fight.
 
MITCHELL:  Right.
 
MATTINGLY:  He's never been egging it on. This is a Trump thing. Is this going to be durable in terms of them, apparently Kumbaya-ing?
 
MITCHELL:  And that's the thing. So, it's completely up to Trump whether this is sustainable because Trump has always been the one starting the drama, thus far, kemp has always been the one to take the high road and quite frankly, being willing to bury the hatchet afterwards. You know, whether it was after the stop the steal efforts and all, Trump really attacked Kemp directly in 2020. Then he attacked Kemp and his wife, I think, which was a lot more -- even more problematic for a lot of people earlier this month.
 
But again, Kemp has always been willing to bury the hatchet, A, for the future of the party, but, B, Kemp also has future aspirations, and it behooves him to stay in the good graces of the party. At the end of the day, Trump is the leader of the party.
 
MATTINGLY:  Yes.
 
MITCHELL:  But the question is, how often can this cycle happen? Rinse and repeat? I think Trump has been told play nice. Leave Kemp and his wife alone. We'll see if he's able to adhere to that for the next, you know, roughly 70 days until the election.
 
MATTINGLY:  Yes, I mean, he hasn't been told, he's been begged repeatedly by everybody who knows Kemp's organization and popularity in Georgia. Tia Mitchell, Parker Short, appreciate you guys very much. Thanks.
 
MITCHELL:  Thank you.
 
MATTINGLY:  And coming up, you may want to double check your deli meat in the fridge. The warning this morning from the CDC as more deaths are linked to recalled boar's head. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
MATTINGLY:  So, if you're a fan of sliced deli meat, you may want to check your refrigerator. The CDC is reminding the public to avoid eating recalled boar's head deli meats that have been tied to a deadly listeria outbreak. CNN's Jacqueline Howard joins us now. Jacqueline, in terms of scale, how big has this outbreak gotten?
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER:  Oh, Phil, this outbreak is the largest listeria outbreak that we've seen since 2011. And so, far we know of 57 people who have gotten sick as part of this outbreak. They were all hospitalized. This is across 18 different states. And sadly, nine people have died and those deaths have been reported in New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina, and Illinois.
 
And Phil, the CDC has been investigating this outbreak since last month. That's when Boris had recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli meat. To many of the people who've gotten sick reported having liverwurst or ready to eat a Turkey deli meat. And with listeria, it is a bacteria and symptoms include fever, muscle aches, stiff neck, or even seizure in some cases.
 
And to look for these recalled products, they come with the established number 12612. And that number, you'll find it inside the USDA mark of inspection. And those are the products that have been recalled. But, Phil, think about it. We're at back-to-school time. Many people might have these deli meats and their refrigerators for their kids' school lunches, for instance. So, make sure to check products. And if you do have a recalled product, throw it out, Phil.
 
MATTINGLY:  Yes, important notes all around. Jacqueline Howard, thanks so much. And Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more on health issues you care about in this week's Chasing Life.

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's Chasing Life podcast.
 
Mesopause might be an inevitable part of life, but weight gain for women going through it does not have to be. Research shows that women in their 40s and 50s typically gain about a pound and a half per year. And it's true that changing hormones play a part here. But it's worth noting this, aging by itself is also associated with weight gain.
 
Experts say much of the added weight during menopause is probably due to lifestyle shifts like becoming sedentary. So, one of the best ways to rev up your metabolism in those years is with weighted resistance exercise. Two to three times a week, muscle burns fat. But around age 30, we begin to lose about 1 percent of our muscle mass per year. So, weighted exercise can help us build back that muscle while also burning calories.
 
Focus on activities that work major muscle groups. That can mean lifting weights, but also activities like Pilates, aerobics, yoga, even walking are considered weight bearing as well. Whatever workout keeps you moving, that's going to be the right workout for you.
 
And you can hear more about how to optimize your health and chase life, wherever you get your podcasts.

MATTINGLY:  Competition is underway at the Paris Paralympic Games. The opening ceremony kicked off last night in spectacular fashion, you see it there, and featured the 168 delegations participating in this year's Games. Team USA well represented with over 200 athletes going for gold. CNN Sports Anchor Andy Scholes joins us now. Andy, what are we expecting on this first day of competition?
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Well, Phil, you got 22 gold medals up for grabs on this very first day, and 15 of them are going to come in the pool in the pair of swimming competitions, which are going to get started shortly. Team USA has got 225 athletes competing in the games, and they all had a grand time in the historic opening ceremony down the Champs Elysees yesterday.
 
This was the first ever Paralympics opening ceremony to take place outside of a stadium, and unlike the wet and rainy Olympic opening ceremony on the River Seine, they had beautiful weather yesterday. There were 500 performers that just put on an amazing show. Now, the game's getting underway earlier this morning. One of the most fun events at every Paralympic Games is wheelchair rugby, also known as murder ball. It has that name because of the aggressive nature and collisions that you see during the games. Now, Team USA getting a win this morning over Canada, 51 to 48. The U.S. got silver in Tokyo. So, hoping to turn that into gold this time around.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
Now, the next Paralympic Games, like the Olympics, will be in L.A. in 2028, and there was no gold handed out last night in L.A, but had there been, it would have gone to Shohei Ohtani dog Decoy. Ohtani bringing Decoy to the ballpark last night because it was their bobblehead night. And you got to see the massive lines to get into Dodger Stadium to try to secure that bobblehead. All the fans trying to make sure they were one of the first 40,000 through those gates.
 
Come game time though, it was Decoy's turn to shine. He brought the ball from the mound to Ohtani for the first pitch. Then he gives Ohtani a high five with both paws. I mean, what a dog there. Then Ohtani put on a show as well. Hit his 42nd home run of the season in the first inning. He would also steal two bases to get him to 42 steals for the season.
 
Ohtani looking to become the first player ever to hit 50 homers and steal 50 bases in a season. Dodgers beat the Orioles six to four in that one. And, Phil, in case you're wondering that bobblehead, you can get it on eBay for 180 bucks.
 
MATTINGLY:  We should -- like it's probably better than waiting in line for 12 hours. I just want to note, Andy, that like, Shohei Ohtani also having a perfect dog who is technically sound from a baseball perspective. It's a little much, but it's a very good boy.
 
SCHOLES:  Right. Hit, power, he could pitch eventually, got the most best dog ever. And what doesn't this guy have?
 
MATTINGLY:  What does he not do? Andy Scholes, as always, my friend, thanks so much.
 
SCHOLES:  All right.
 
MATTINGLY:  We'll be right back.
