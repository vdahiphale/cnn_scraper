PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR:  Well, embattled Boeing has a new CEO this morning. Kelly Ortberg is taking over starting next week. The aircraft giant lost $1.4 billion in the second quarter, and that's more than triple of what they lost last year.
 
And we're also getting an unprecedented first look at the door plug that blew off a Boeing plane in January. This is the same flight plan all that was blown off during that horrifying Alaska Airlines mid- flight.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This wasn't even the emergency door. We're at the end of the plane. So, the emergency door is right there. It was a just a piece of plank.
 
OK. So, there was no one seated there. There was thankfully no one --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN:  Joining us now to discuss CNN's Pete Muntean and CNN Aerospace Analyst Miles O'Brien. Pete, you were there when NTSB investigators unveiled the Boeing door plug. What was that like? Did anything surprise you?
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  Kind of surreal. Well, because I was in the room and this is something I've been talking about for so long and reporting on for so long. The first time that reporters have been able to see the door plug since it shot off the Boeing 737 MAX 9 back on January 5th.
 
Remember, the incident left this gaping hole in the side of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which sparked these really big questions about Boeing's quality control. To see it, I was taken inside the NTSB's materials lab. That's where investigators have been analyzing this door over the course of months. This is the single biggest piece of evidence in this case. And reporters were actually kept behind this perimeter of blue tape on the floor because this investigation is still going on. They don't want to disturb the evidence. What was visible, were the chafing marks at the top of the door. You could see them there. Those are what investigators call witness marks, and the NTSB used marks like this to say preliminarily that this door was loosely shimmying against the fuselage, the frame of that 737 for months.
 
Also, you could see the damaged metal at the bottom of the door. Now, this is where the door plug cleared large hinges when it shot away from the plane like a shotgun. Now, what was not visible were the four key bolts that would have kept the door solidly on those hinges. Those should have been installed in each corner of the door. The NTSB says those bolts were removed at Boeing's factory and Renton, Washington and simply not reinstalled, a huge oversight here, which has put Boeing under the microscope.
 
BROWN:  Right? So, how rare is it, Miles, for the NTSB to get access like this? What do you make of the fact they gave this access?
 
MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST:  Well, the NTSB at its core has a very strong ethos of sharing information with the public. It is a small agency which uses its megaphone as a way of changing things and improving safety generally. So, it's kind of built into their DNA at the NTSB to share what they know with the public whenever possible.
 
Interestingly, this comes on the heels of a Boeing executive, and I think Pete might have been there for the briefing, a Boeing executive sharing information with the public which they weren't supposed to. The NTSB likes to share with the public, but they don't like it when anybody else on the investigative team does.
 
So, this is an opportunity to show the public what's going on and explain, you know, in a succinct and quite visual way what we're talking about here.
 
BROWN:  Yes, transparency is very important. This investigation, we should note, is ongoing, Pete. So, where do things stand with that?
 
MUNTEAN:  Well, right now, this investigation is still going on and the NTSB is sort of putting out this information ahead of this huge public hearing and investigative hearing. These are very rare. That will happen over the course of two days next week. So, we're about to find out so much more about the status of this investigation and what investigators have found.
 
Also, there will be parties to this investigation, like Boeing. What's really interesting is that the NTSB actually has subpoena power to subpoena these witnesses to come in front of them to testify. So, there is about to be a lot of fireworks here, and we're about to see just a lot more detail and information come forward in this case.
 
BROWN:  Yes, and this is all happening, of course, as Boeing is replacing its CEO. You have the Boeing executives returning to Capitol Hill for another major hearing on flight safety, as you mentioned. And, you know, as we all remember, the last time they were there, it got pretty tense. Let's listen to that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVE CALHOUN, OUTGOING BOEING CEO:  I'm proud of having taken the job. I'm proud of our proud of the safety record, and I am very proud of our Boeing people.
 
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  You're proud of this safety record?
 
CALHOUN:  I am proud of every action we have taken.
 
HAWLEY:  Every action you've taken?
 
CALHOUN:  Yes, sir.
 
HAWLEY:  Wow. Wow.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BROWN:  That is the outgoing Boeing CEO. We should note. So, what do you expect to see when this hearing actually happens, Miles? Do you think it's going to be similar?
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
O'BRIEN:  Yes. Well, you know, I think that was a universally panned hearing. There's no question. And Dave Calhoun is on his way out. The new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, on paper looks like he might be a good choice. He is -- he has engineering roots. That's important. He is an outsider to Boeing. That's probably important if you want to talk about changing the culture of a corporation. And yet, he is an aviation insider through and through, having run a main supplier of the avionics systems in many aircraft, Rockwell Collins, which became Collins Aerospace as it was acquired.
 
So, he understands aviation. He understands how to manage big programs. He guided through several acquisitions while he was at Rockwell Collins, a seasoned hand in the aviation business. But I will say this, Pamela, trying to change the culture in any organization is a difficult thing. An organization as big and unwieldy as Boeing, he's got a really steep learning curve ahead of him.
 
BROWN:  Yes, his work cut out for sure. Pete Muntean, Miles O'Brien, thank you.
 
Well, a decision is expected soon from the Harris campaign on who her VP could be. Still ahead, how her team is testing out top contenders.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
BROWN:  Well, the veepstakes are in full swing, and we're just days away from finding out who Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate will be. The campaign is expected to announce the pick next Tuesday, followed by an immediate battleground state blitz by Harris and her new running mate. A team led by former Attorney General Eric Holder is vetting the top contenders. This is a list that includes Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.
 
CNN contributor and senior Brookings Institution fellow Elaine Kamarck joins us now. So, Elaine, thanks for your time today. Tell us your thoughts on the shortlist.
 
ELAINE KAMARCK, CNN CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION:  You're welcome.
 
BROWN:  We know that Vice President Harris is doing discussions, meeting with some of these contenders virtually this week. What more can you tell us?
 
KAMARCK:  Well, I can tell you that it's a very complicated decision process for any presidential candidate because you're thinking about two things at the same time. You're thinking about who can help you win, and then you're thinking about who can help you govern. And the two go together, right? I mean, you've got to think about both at the same time, because after all, you're connected to this person for four years.
 
And the other thing that's going on is there is some chemistry there, right? Do you like each other? Do you trust each other? Do you think you could, you know, govern together through thick and through thin? And I think that all three of the people being mentioned have definitely have the qualifications to govern. And they're experienced politicians. They've proved themselves in battleground states. So, that's been -- that's good, particularly Kelly and Shapiro, Arizona and Pennsylvania. So, they've proved themselves. They're ready to campaign.
 
And it's really going to come down to, you know, Kamala Harris' part. You know, what does she think? Does she want to spend the next four years with this person? It's almost like picking a marriage partner.
 
BROWN:  That's true. I mean, you really are in the trenches together for four years. So, bring us into what the vetting process is like. I mean, she's doing these virtual interviews, I'm told. And her team is doing research. But kind of bring us into what this week must be like for Harris and her team as she makes this huge decision.
 
KAMARCK:  Well, I can tell you for sure that there's a lot of lawyers working very, very late hours this week. Because the vetting process is composed of groups of attorneys, many of whom have done this for previous candidates over the years, and they are looking at everything. They're looking at social media. They're looking at all their finances, all their tax breaks -- tax filings. They're looking at everything that may come back to haunt the presidential candidate and the vice-presidential candidate.
 
And we've got a lot of examples through the years where the vetting process didn't reveal something that needed to be revealed. And in one extreme case, in 1972, the vice-presidential candidate was dropped from the ticket. So, it's very complicated and Harris is having to do this in a really shortened period of time.
 
BROWN:  Yes. And sources I've been speaking to said that, you know, the stakes were already high and they're also watching across the aisle what's going on with J. D. Vance, Donald Trump's V.P. pick, and all the scrutiny he's under now for past comments that Trump is having to defend. She doesn't want to have to do that, obviously.
 
KAMARCK:  That's right.
 
BROWN:  Your V.P. pick should do no harm. Are there any potential weak spots that you see in these candidates?
 
KAMARCK:  Well, I'm not in the vetting process. So, we don't really know. I think on each one brings a specific kind of strength. As I said, both Kelly and Shapiro would probably be very helpful in bringing their key states. Even though the history of that is not great, it -- vice presidential candidates are not particularly good at bringing along their state. But this is -- this election is so close that it may be different here.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
Waltz has been particularly good at communications. He's the guy that came up with this concept of the J. D. Vance and Trump being weird, which is really caught on because a lot of people think that's what best describes the Republican ticket. So, they all have their strengths. And at this point, I really couldn't make a guess.
 
BROWN:  Right. It seems like Waltz's star is certainly rising, but, you know, she is still doing the interviews and still trying to figure out who should be her pick at last check. So, we'll continue to watch this. Elaine, thank you so much.
 
KAMARCK:  Well, thanks for having me. Take care.
 
BROWN:  And up next, the U.S. women's gymnastics team brought the heat to Paris and then took the gold. CNN Sports Anchor Coy Wire. It joins us live from Paris.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  You're right, Pamela. They did turn up the heat. No wonder it was the hottest day of the year in Paris yesterday. We'll talk about their team gold in the competition last night. We'll also talk about the preview the greatest swimmer of all time. Katie Ledecky getting ready for her final coming up later tonight.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
BROWN:  We'll take a look at the latest Olympic medal count. Team USA is leading the pack with the most overall medals. 27 in total. But when it comes to the most gold medals, China has that title right now with eight.
 
And one of the gold medals the U.S. -- in the U.S. was picked up by the women's gymnastics team. Team USA gymnasts put up a stunning performance after stunning performance to clinch that top spot in the team competition. But now, the focus turns to the women's individual all-around event.
 
CNN Sports Anchor Coy Wire is in Paris. Coy, this really has been a redemption tour so far for the U.S. women's gymnastics team.
 
WIRE:  That's exactly what the team called it. And you mentioned that all-around competition, Pamela. Suni Lee and Simone Biles will be making history. It'll be the first time the two former Olympic all- around chance will be going toe to toe in this final. But all eyes will be on Simone Biles as she looks to add to her history medal count. Her 38 medals at world and Olympics. They're more than any gymnast ever, male or female.
 
She's so good, Pamela, she has five moves named after her, the Biles 2, for example, which is the Yurchenko double pike on the vault there. Back hand spring onto the table. Then you have to be powerful enough to propel yourself into the air in a double pike. If something goes awry, Pamela, you're in danger of landing on your head or neck. It's something hardly any women even try because it's so difficult due to the amount of power it takes to pull off. She's already landed it here at the Olympic stage for the first time, and we will see her competing again, as you mentioned tomorrow in those individual finals.
 
Now, after three straight days of cancellation and postponement of swim practice and competition due to unsafe levels of E. coli in the River Seine, the Olympic triathlon finally happened this morning. France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Great Britain's Alex Yee took the golds.
 
Now, open water swimming and mixed triathlons are still to come, but it already rained once here today, Pamela, and more rains in the forecast. We'll wait to see if there are more problems again for the River Seine moving forward.
 
And one of the most dominant swimmers the world has ever seen, 27- year-old Katie Ledecky is back in the pool for the finals of an event she owns tonight. World and Olympic record holder in the 1500-meter freestyle. Hasn't lost a race in this event, Pamela, in more than 14 years. I spoke to her yesterday in the tunnel after a qualifier where she won, by the way, by almost 18 seconds. And she said, I was just setting myself up for the final.
 
Earlier this week, I also asked her, what's tougher, the climb to the top of the mountain or staying there? Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KATIE LEDECKY, SEVEN-TIME OLYMPICS GOLD MEDALIST:  It's always hard to maintain that position and just going through the process and trying to get better each year, trying to get better each quad, never being satisfied, always continuing to look ahead. I think those have been the keys to maintaining this level, continuing to make it back to the Olympics.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Now, Pamela, there might not be a bigger favorite in any sport at these games. She has 19 of the top 20 fastest times ever in the event. It's almost like an Olympic tradition now, seeing Katie Ledecky finish the race and no one else is even on the screen.
 
BROWN:  Amazing. Oh, my goodness. So, much to look forward to, right? Coy Wire, you just set it up for us. Live for us in Paris, thanks so much, Coy.
 
WIRE:  You got it.
 
BROWN:  And on full display at the women's gymnastics finals, the villages behind each of these athletes' nerves and then elation for the parents of the gymnast, witnessing all the sacrifices and hours of practice paying off right there.
 
Simone Biles' husband, Jonathan Owens, had negotiated time off of NFL preseason practices so he could be there in Paris. Rocking a shirt with her face on it. He was even taking notes, marking down scores during the events. How cute is that?
 
And look at this pure joy as the gymnasts watch their teammates dominate on the world stage. And this was back at the home gym of Biles and Jordan. You can see the next generation of gymnasts following along to the floor routine right there. They all know it by heart. They've seen it before. Look at that. All of that support leading to this, the U.S. women's gymnastics team, the best in the world, no doubt. And we're looking forward to the individual all- around coming up soon.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
And coming up right here on this show, from the West Wing to white dudes for Harris. Bradley Whitford joins us to discuss his new role backing Kamala Harris for president.
