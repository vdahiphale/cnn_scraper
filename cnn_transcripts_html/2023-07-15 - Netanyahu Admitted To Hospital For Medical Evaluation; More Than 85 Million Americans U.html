FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.
 
And we begin this hour with breaking news. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been admitted to the hospital. And just moments ago, his office provided an update on the prime minister's tests.
 
CNN's Hadas Gold is joining us live from Jerusalem. Hadas, what are you learning about his condition?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN POLITICS, MEDIA AND BUSINESS REPORTER: We are just getting a statement from his office. They saying that the prime minister spent hot hours in the Sea of Galilee yesterday, which was actually under a -- currently under a heat advisory.
 
We are going through a heatwave right now in this region. They say that today, the prime minister complained of mild dizziness, and on the recommendation of his personal doctor arrived at the Sheba Medical Center emergency room.
 
Sheba Medical Center is located in a suburb of Tel Aviv. And see, the initial tests came out normal and no findings were found. The initial assessment they say is dehydration. That he is continuing to undergo additional routine tests.
 
We know that in the last few hours, he was brought to the emergency room, is really media reporting that he was fully conscious. He walked in on his own volition.
 
And the first day, we received from the Prime Minister's Office simply said he was brought to the emergency room and that he was undergoing medical evaluation, but that he was in good condition.
 
Now, it has been very hot here. The prime minister, he is a 73-year- old man, and this is actually not the first time he's been brought to hospital out of concerns for his health, within the past year or so.
 
Actually, in October of last year, during the Yom Kippur holiday. This is the Jewish holiday when observant Jews fast during the day. He felt unwell while at synagogue and was also brought to the emergency room where he was kept for overnight tests.
 
So, as far as we understand he is still in pretty good condition. We have no information though yet on when and how and whether he will be released.
 
What we know so far is that they are saying that it is most likely dehydration, and all of his initial tests are showing that there seems to be nothing of concern, just as of yet, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Keep us posted, Hadas Gold. Thanks so much.
 
All right, so more on the extreme heat which is gripping the world. And here in the U.S. right now, more than 85 million people are under heat alerts from Florida to California.
 
In the West, a suffocating heat dome is intensifying, leading to record breaking hot temperatures in so many areas.
 
Phoenix is in the midst of a likely record streak of days topping a dangerous 110 degrees.
 
Meanwhile, Death Valley, California already one of the hottest places on earth could see temperatures reach a scorching 130 degrees this weekend.
 
CNN's Mike Valerio is in Valencia, California. And CNN is Rafael Romo is in Las Vegas.
 
Rafael, we're going to begin with you. I mean, on the strip there, always hot for a variety of reasons. But now, literally very hot and it's dangerous. How are people trying to stay cool?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR: Yes. That's right, Fred. And most people are trying to stay indoors with the exception of tourists who hop from one casino to another and those who, of course, must work outside.
 
Sometimes people dismiss this kind of weather saying that it is to be expected because we're in the middle of July, after all. But the National Weather Service says that, that kind of it's the desert, of course, it's hot, approach, is a dangerous mindset to be in.
 
Neurologist say that this heatwave is not typical desert heat due to its long duration, extreme daytime, temperatures, and warm nights.
 
They also say that everyone needs to take this heat seriously, including those who live in the desert. Also, the National Weather Service office here in Las Vegas is taking a close look at the climbing temperatures because there is a possibility the city's official all-time record of 117 degrees could be tied sometime this weekend or Monday. [12:05:02]
 
Of course, Fred, Las Vegas is not the only city under an extreme heat warning. More than 85 million people are under heat alerts from the National Weather Service in at least 15 states from Florida to California.
 
Phoenix has topped 110 degrees for more than two weeks now. And a city official has a warning for people who live not only in the state of Arizona, but also others going through this heatwave.
 
Let's take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID HONDULA, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF HEAT RESPONSE AND MITIGATION, CITY OF PHOENIX: Unfortunately, in our region, and many 1000s more all across the United States heat is fatal. It is something that the public needs to take seriously and it can impact everybody. Nobody is immune.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And Fred, just one more piece of information from the National Weather Service, Las Vegas may see three consecutive days with a high of 115 degrees or higher, and a low of 90 or higher, adding that this has only happened once before and that was in 2005. Fred back to you. It is
 
WHITFIELD: It is brutal. All right. Thank you so much.
 
Mike, to you in Southern California. What are the conditions like there?
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, you know, we are waiting for temperatures to reach 106 degrees here in Valencia in Southern California. But you know, we're in the Santa Clarita Valley, about 30 miles away from the beach.
 
So, if you can't make it to the coastline, this is certainly a wonderful alternative. Our tableau right here, Six Flags Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor.
 
And Fred, the difference between the last time we saw you about an hour ago and now, is just listen to our background. That is the sweet sound of relief, the water beginning to flow. The park opening to the public in about an hour and a half.
 
But I want to still look over my shoulder to our left.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: As long as there's now like that water right now.
 
VALERIO: Yes, you know -- so, right, if you walk down this path, that's towards one of two first aid stations that staffed by about a dozen EMT medical first responder personnel between both parks here. The roller coaster park, and the water park.
 
More than 20 lifeguards who will be spread throughout the waterpark as well, one ambulance. And there is also shade that is built into the equation we spoke with a Six Flags Park representative just before we came on the air. And Fred, she told us that building shade as summers get hotter and hotter has become certainly a policy and objective of Six Flags to keep everybody cool and having a good time.
 
Listen to what we heard before the broadcast.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEX FRENCH, PARK SPOKESPERSON, SIX FLAGS MAGIC MOUNTAIN AND HURRICANE HARBOR: We've added different shade structures. We have tons of umbrellas and tables for people to go around, keep cool, and just take a break from, you know, the direct sunlight. Take a break from their day, enjoy something to eat, enjoy something to drink. And just keep on going. That way, they don't have any issues throughout the rest of the day.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALERIO: So, that's keeping people safe from heat related illnesses, and we're also watching potential fire danger. About 90 miles south east from here, Riverside County, Southern California, we had three wildfires breakout yesterday.
 
The good news though, Fred, all evacuation orders have been lifted. About 5,000 acres burned, but far away from big population centers.
 
So, we're going to be watching that and staying here keeping cool in the meantime, throughout the day, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Keeping a close eye and keeping cool. All right. Mike Valerio, thanks so much.
 
Rafael Romo, stay in cool there in Vegas as well. Thank you.
 
All right. Let's bring in CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. He is cool in the weather center.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BRANDON MILLER, CNN METEOROLOGIST: That's exactly right.
 
WHITFIELD: But, oh, my gosh, it's brutal out there everywhere. Is there any good news on the horizon?
 
MILLER: Oh, unfortunately, no. The good news is that I am here in the air conditioning. You lead with the good news. But no, I don't have much good news here, unless you are a fan of the heat, which there are some.
 
You'll be amazed that the number of people that will be flocking to Death Valley this weekend to try to say they were there if we hit that 130, 131 sort of one of the hottest and in modern times. It's like being at LeBron James when he hits a big milestone, say you were at that game. There are those people out there.
 
But like we said, 114 degrees today in Las Vegas. 117 tomorrow would match the all-time, the hottest it's ever been.
 
But look at these low temperatures. 90, 90, 89. That's really where he becomes deadly. When your body cannot cool off at night, The reason this heat dome that's just been meandering, we've been talking about this for weeks sort of goes from Texas, over to Arizona.
 
Right now, it's centered right here over the Four Corners region, bringing up hot desert air into it. And that's why we're seeing all across the southwest from Texas, all the way up to the Pacific Northwest. Even by the time this weekend is over, over 100 record high temperatures. Those are max highs and also record highs for the lows, which I just said are the more dangerous of the two quite honestly.
 
And you know, you ask when are these temperatures going to break? Unfortunately, no time soon. This is the projections from the National Weather Service going six to 10 days out.
 
So, this is looking really at next weekend. And of the work week, and to next weekend.
 <br>[12:10:02]
 
And it looks a lot the same that jet stream stuck way up here. The heat dome centered here. So, the Southwest, you're going to be above average again.
 
And keep in mind, this is above average for the hottest time of the year. July and the desert southwest and you're still 5, 10, even 15 degrees above the average.
 
So, it is a long duration heatwave. And the question that I sort of always get, you know, is, is this climate change? And you know, the short answer, it's obviously complicated. But the short answer is yes. And heat waves are the most attributable thing to climate change that we have.
 
We know heat waves, Fredricka are really increasing in intensity. They're also increasing in duration, and that's what we've seen with this one. It's been going for weeks and it has weeks more to go, unfortunately.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Yes, weeks more ultimately. All right, hot July.
 
All right. Brandon Miller, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
 
All right, the U.S. isn't the only place dealing with extreme heat right now. In Greece, temperatures today could reach 111 degrees.
 
Officials closed the Acropolis for the afternoon yesterday because of the extreme temperatures.
 
And in Croatia, 100-degree heat is being blamed for contributing to a wildfire that destroyed cars and homes.
 
And then, in Italy, health officials have issued and extreme health risk warning for 16 cities, including Rome and Florence.
 
CNNs Barbie Latza Nadeau is joining us from Rome right now.
 
Yes, so this heatwave is everywhere. It seems seemingly inescapable, Barbie. So, people living in the Mediterranean are accustomed to pretty high temperatures in the summer, but this seems like a whole another level.
 
BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, no, it really is a whole another level. It is really, really hot. And it's going to get hotter.
 
Today is extremely in excruciating. Tomorrow is going to be worse, and it's just going to keep climbing.
 
Now, this is a height of tourist season here. So, you've got lots of tourists who aren't used to the heat, even if the Italians and other Mediterranean people are.
 
There are so many people that are on piazza, as like the one I'm standing in right now, out in the sun, just trying to deal with it.
 
And we talked to a couple of them. Let's listen to what they had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLO HORAVARD, NORWEGIAN TOURIST: The heat is very intense. And there's a lot of people I hope -- hopefully, no one will suffer any illness. But it was very intensive. So, I think -- yes, the sun is very strong right now. It would be dangerous.
 
SOHA PANDORA: The heat, it's hard, but we're going to push through it, and you know, I don't know if I will ever be back. So, I have to take advantage of the day.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
PANDORA: Yes. So, I will stay hydrated, wear a hat, and take breaks where you can.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NADEAU: And, you know, that's what people are doing. You know, fountain behind me, people are dipping into this fountain all day long, just trying to keep cool.
 
One of the things the Italians do is they named their heat waves. And the one starting tomorrow -- we just finished one. The one starting tomorrow is Caronte, which is a Greek mythical figure who is the ferryman for the gates of hell carrying out all the bodies of those who perished. The Italians are very creative with that.
 
But we're seeing no end in sight. And everybody is looking forward to a break from this when it finally happens, Fredricka.
 
WHITFIELD: Wow, what an artistic parallel. All right. Barbie Latza Nadeau there in Rome. Thank you so much.
 
All right. Well, temperatures like these can be especially dangerous for those not accustomed to dealing with this kind of heat.
 
CNN's Jacqueline Howard shows us how to stay safe as the temperatures continue to rise everywhere.
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: High temperatures kill hundreds of people every year. Here in the United States, the CDC says more than 700 people die from extreme heat annually.
 
And high heat can make you seriously ill if your body is unable to cool itself. This happens in high humidity when sweat can't evaporate off of your body as quickly and your age, obesity, alcohol use and other factors, all can play a role in raising risks of heat related illness.
 
Heat related illnesses include heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, sunburn, and heat rash. And for heat stroke, especially, symptoms to look out for include having a body temperature at or higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheit, having a fast, strong pulse, or feeling dizzy, headache, or nauseous.
 
But here are ways to stay safe when it's extremely hot outside.
 
Make sure you drink more water than usual to stay hydrated. Use your air conditioning if you can. Do not rely on a fan as your main cooling device. Take cool showers or baths and wear loose lightweight clothing.
 
And remember to check on your friends, neighbors. And even if you think they'll be OK, never leave children or pets in cars during this hot weather.
 
Back to you.
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
WHITFIELD: All great advice. Jacqueline Howard, thanks so much.
 
All right. Still ahead, the manhunt is intensifying for a Pennsylvania inmate who has been on the run now for over a week. Police just released new evidence that they say is a confirmed sighting of the armed and dangerous escapee.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right, police have released doorbell video that they say shows an escaped prisoner who has been on the run in Pennsylvania for more than a week now.
 
They also say that he is becoming more desperate as he tries to evade capture. CNNs Brian Todd is in Warren Pennsylvania.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: Check the area around their homes.
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A compelling new piece of evidence tonight in the manhunt for escaped inmate Michael Burham in northern Pennsylvania.
 
Pennsylvania State Police released this doorbell camera video, saying this is Burham walking past a home in an area just south of the city of Warren.
 
BIVENS: We consider this to be a confirmed sighting for a variety of reasons.
 
TODD: Police say this video was recorded in the last few days just after 5:00 a.m.
 <br>[12:20:03]
 
BIVENS: He is no doubt becoming more desperate and will attempt to acquire the things he needs to survive.
 
TODD: Police now say they believe Burham has an injury to an ankle or a leg. They say the video indicates he is probably limping.
 
BIVENS: We believe that he did potentially have an injury during the escape.
 
TODD: This comes one day after police showed us this photo, saying they're confident this bag and tarp full of clothes, food, and other items belong to Burham. They said it was found in the general area of the city of Warren in the woods.
 
Police also called on Burham to turn himself in.
 
BIVENS: Don't do anything foolish that gets anyone else hurt. Don't get yourself hurt. We are going to capture you.
 
TODD: Burham is considered armed and dangerous and is wanted in several alleged cases, including the shooting death of a 34- year-old woman, a carjacking, and kidnapping of an elderly couple, and setting his ex's car on fire.
 
Police say he escaped Warren County Prison last Thursday night through a hole in the cage surrounding the prison's rooftop gym, repelling down using bedsheets tied together.
 
Burham eluded law enforcement earlier this year before his arrest when it took two weeks to capture him. This dash camera video shows when law enforcement caught him back in May in South Carolina. As for this manhunt, Warren residents say they're taking every precaution necessary to remain safe. JAN GARRETT, RESIDENT, WARREN, PENNSYLVANIA: Until he is captured, I'm going to be sitting here armed, because I have the right to bear arms and my wife and I both have permits.
 
TIM RYAN: As we're big hikers -- 
 
TODD: And Tim Ryan (PH), who hikes these mountains often, told us about the forbidding terrain that Burham and his pursuers are up against.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: if you get off trail, it's very severe. It's very rocky. It can be very steep in places.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
TODD:(on camera): Even though Michael Burham is considered armed, dangerous, and as police say, desperate, Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police says he's not recommending that the many hikers and campers in this area cancel their planned outdoor activities in the coming days.
 
While Burham is a survivalist. Lieutenant Colonel Bevin, says he's gotten members of his own search teams who themselves specialize in surviving in and navigating remote wilderness areas.
 
Brian Todd, CNN, Warren, Pennsylvania.
 
WHITFIELD: And an investigation is underway after a North Dakota police officer was killed during a shooting at an intersection in Fargo.
 
Two other officers are in critical condition and two civilians were injured. Authorities say the suspect in the shooting died after sustaining serious injuries.
 
Police and first responders began a procession outside the emergency room and made their way along an interstate highway to pay their respects to the fallen officer.
 
Fargo police will hold a press conference later on today with more details on the incident.
 
All right. Still ahead, GOP presidential hopefuls are flocking to Iowa this weekend, hoping to impress voters who kick off the GOP nominating process.
 
But former President Trump's gift a major event there. We'll discuss straight ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:27:10]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Iowa is once again ground zero for GOP presidential candidates, aiming to position themselves as the party's top alternative to a former President Trump. On Friday, six of the top contenders appeared at the Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines. The event is a major gathering for evangelicals, a crucial voting bloc for Republicans in the state, and several of the candidates use the gathering to criticize Trump's decision to skip the event.
 
With me now is Jonah Goldberg. He is a CNN political commentator and the co-founder and editor for The Dispatch.
 
Jonah, great to see you.
 
JONAH GOLDBERG CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Good to be here.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. So, Trump decided not to attend this big event. And this week, he came under fire for criticizing Iowa's popular Republican governor after she appeared at a Ron DeSantis event.
 
So, do you think there's a chance that Trump could be opening the door to his challengers in his absence?
 
GOLDBERG: I don't know. I mean, I think one of the reasons Trump can get away with this stuff is when you're -- when you're in -- when you're ahead by 20, 30 points. And you've seen how you've sort of made the GOP kind of a subservient organization to the -- to your own cult of personality.
 
Feeling like you have to obey the rules of everybody else seems kind of trivial. And he has enough support right now that I think you can get away with all of this stuff.
 
It's never good to insult an audience until -- and essentially tell an audience, particularly, the Iowa caucus audience that you don't care enough to show up.
 
But he can lose five, 10 points and still be the runaway front runner right now. And so, they're kind of cocky.
 
WHITFIELD: Ron DeSantis. I mean, he continues to lag, you know, behind Trump in the polls. This week his campaign urge patients, you know, more is coming. Saying the Florida governor, you know, doesn't need to drastically, you know, change course.
 
They say, DeSantis is targeting next month's debate to alter the trajectory, you know, of his campaign.
 
So, what do you make of this strategy that, you know, the best is yet to come?
 
GOLDBERG: Yes. I mean, they are changing their strategy. And the smartest thing that DeSantis is -- the DeSantis team has done is decide that they're going to start doing non sort of base conservative media, and start doing mainstream media interviews.
 
I don't know why they didn't start doing this from the beginning. The -- one of the main reasons why Ron DeSantis was popular as governor, you know, for the last five years, on the right, is that they felt he was being unfairly attacked by the New York Times and CBS and "60 Minutes" and all that.
 
And in that kind of climate, who your enemies are almost more important than your friends are. And so, just going to base, you know, just playing Fox and OAN and those kinds of things, hasn't served him very well.
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
But beyond that, I think, you know, there's a real panic going on, because, you know, I -- he is just not -- he doesn't have the charisma with the voters. People aren't excited about him after they meet him. And that's a worrisome thing for someone like Ron DeSantis who have this sort of air of inevitability.
 
WHITFIELD: And the panic among particularly like the wealthy donors who are behind DeSantis that, you know, maybe they're not seeing the charisma, they're not seeing the pay off.
 
GOLDBERG: Yes, I mean, look, I mean, he's been out for a couple of months now. He spent tens of millions of dollars. And I think he's gained about three points in the national polls, something like that, or lost three points. I mean, it's plus or minus stuff. And, you know, you had, you know, and so you have a lot of donors who back then because they thought he was the guy, whether they liked him or not.
 
And now you're seeing people kick the tires on someone like Tim Scott, who is just immensely popular behind the scenes among donors, among the GOP rank and file. He's sort of like the Ferris Bueller of Capitol Hill, everyone just likes the guy. And so if you feel like your money is not getting a payoff with DeSantis, why not take a second look at Tim Scott.
 
WHITFIELD: How much of a difference might make potentially for Tim Scott?
 
GOLDBERG: That's the question. I mean, he's got enough -- he's got a good amount of money right now, this is one of these things that I think a lot of people in the media put too much focus on. Yes, you need a certain amount of money to be competitive. But it's -- once you hit sort of the necessary amount, every additional dollar doesn't help you that much. And so he still -- he needs to get, you know, people to be excited about him, he needs to get go up in the polls.
 
He's saturating the airways in lots of places with ads already. So, you know, for him, the money is important to get his name I.D. up. But I'm not sure he doesn't have enough money to do that right now. It's a real problem for all these guys, is that Donald Trump is just soaking up the oxygen.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, so now for the incumbent, the Democratic incumbent that the new fundraising numbers for the presidential candidates, you know, came out. And it shows in the second quarter that President Biden far surpassed the totals of the GOP candidates, Biden raising $72 million, which is more than double that of former President Trump brought in and more than tripled the $20 million that Ron DeSantis raised. So does this allay the fears among some Democrats who are worried about, you know, Biden's popularity?
 
GOLDBERG: No. Biden's got real popularity problem.
 
WHITFIELD: So money isn't the answer, in your view?
 
GOLDBERG: Yes, he's got great -- he's got -- he had great economic numbers this week. But American public opinion on the economy is bad and getting worse, despite those numbers. He is this, you know, we're prepared in this country, we are on course, in this country to repeat the mistake in 2016, where we have both parties re -- nominate the two most unpopular major candidates possible, so unpopular, they have a chance of losing to each other. And I think that's sort of a disaster.
 
There are real concerns among Democrats who, you know, you go to CNN green rooms, and you'll talk to prominent Democrats who will share them freely away from the cameras. But this is good news for Joe Biden, it's better to be able to raise a lot of money. And remember, he doesn't have to spend a lot of money in the primaries, you know, against like Robert F. Kennedy. So he's building up a big war chest for the general election. And that's nothing but good for him.
 
But I just don't know that money alone is going to solve his problems with lack of enthusiasm among base Democrat voters. Democrats under 30 don't want him to run again. I mean, this has been a consistent thing in the polls for a while. And I'm not sure that spending a lot on T.V. ads, which don't reach those constituencies anyway is going to change that.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. Bottom line remains up, voters have to turn out, right?
 
GOLDBERG: Yes. It's really simple when they get already complicated. Want to get some wins.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Jonah Goldberg, thank you so much.
 
GOLDBERG: Thank you.
 <br>[12:34:08]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, coming up, actors are vowing to strike as long as it takes until a deal is reached with streaming platforms and studios. That's creating massive consequences for the T.V. and film industries and your favorite shows.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right, right now no lights camera or action in Hollywood or beyond. After the union representing about 160,000 actors voted to strike this week, the actors joined more than 10,000 screenwriters on the picket lines. It's the first time both unions have been on strike simultaneously since 1960. The union representing actors and the studios are feuding over two major issues compensation and the use of artificial intelligence in productions.
 
The T.V. and film studios say they offered the highest pay increase in 35 years and a proposal to limit the impact of AI. But the union argues rapid changes in the industry along with the rise in streaming services have made it impossible for its members of SAG-AFTRA to earn a living as actors.
 
So like Burbank, which is just outside of Los Angeles, joining me right now is the mayor of Burbank Konstantine Anthony. He is also a member of the union that represents actors. I'm talking about SAG- AFTRA. Mayor, good to see you. So this is a very interesting position that you're in as a member of SAG-AFTRA. You know, you can see it from the actors, the artists point of view at the same time. As the mayor, you're thinking about commerce and the economy of your city all the time. So what kind of impact is this having this strike having on your economy and on your residents?
 <br>[12:40:02]
 
MAYOR KONSTANTINE ANTHONY (D), BURBANK, CA: Yes. It's really tough it's been, you know, 74 days has been a very long, 74 days with the writers' strike and now it's officially day two of the actor strike. We're trying to make it through the economy has been hit locally. And just for reference, I am a SAG-AFTRA member and when I campaigned to run for this seat, I knock doors and there were so many SAG, WGA, DGA, IATSE, people who worked in the entertainment industry that supported me to get into this position.
 
I feel bad for the studios who are trying to negotiate and they're facing a mayor who's a SAG member who's not really taking their position at all. You know, we have to remember that if we pay the workers well, the writers, the actors, the crew, all the folks who work on the industry, if they do well, then their money comes back to the local economy, they spend money at restaurants, they spend money at the dry cleaners, they spend money at local daycare.
 
But if the money goes up to the top 1 percent, the CEOs, the executives, they don't spend the money here, they go back to where they come from, and the money leaves town. So for me, the economics is very simple, keep that money local, pay local workers.
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, that's interesting, because the movie studios right there in Burbank, they would ordinarily look to you for support, but they're not going to get this time. Because you're, you know, SAG- AFTRA member. And, you know --
 
ANTHONY: It's tough, both Warner Brothers and Disney are celebrating the 100th anniversary, and they keep calling me and they say, hey, when are you going to show up to cut some ribbons? And I'm like, when are you going to sign a deal and pay your writers and actors?
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, are you saying that to them directly?
 
ANTHONY: I have not taken a meeting with any of the studio executives for 74 days. That is probably the longest they've ever had radio silence from the mayor of Burbank.
 
WHITFIELD: Interesting. So what kind of leverage do you think that helps impose for you -- for your, you know, fellow members of SAG- AFTRA?
 
ANTHONY: Well, look, the city has the permits, the city, green lights construction. So if they don't play ball with the city, you know, the city has a lot of power. I'm asking all the other mayors and city council members and county supervisors across the country that have studios in their backyard, take a stand, take a position with the working people who vote for you. Because remember, studios don't vote, it's the people who vote. So that's who you are -- your constituents are.
 
WHITFIELD: So I guess what is pulling at your heart the most? You know, is it or maybe it's all of it, you know, the compensation. I mean, a lot of the actors are saying, I'm you know, not everybody's making them multimillion dollar, you know, contracts that some of the, you know, A-listers that people are familiar with are bringing home, so they're working multiple jobs.
 
And so you hear the advocacy of pay increases, and at the same time, the real concerns about AI, you know, being replaced, you know, their images being used, being paid once, but their images being used multiple times? Go ahead.
 
ANTHONY: Yes, I will say that AI has the ability to take away the ability to pay residuals, that is a huge component, where your likeness can be used in perpetuity, and you don't have any control over that. But at the immediate point of it is the pay and they're refusing to pay. It's a very small portion that we're asking for, for their profits to go to the workers.
 
And yet these studios are more than willing to shut down an entire economy, simply to keep, you know, fractions of a percent for themselves. And it doesn't just hurt the writers. I know we've heard a lot about how they want to make the writer suffer. They want to get the actors to start losing their houses. This hurts every mom and pop nearby that gets residual spending from the local economy. The fact that people aren't --
 
WHITFIELD: The restaurants or dry cleaners, your coffee shops, gas stations.
 
ANTHONY: All of that. All of that. And these studios are more than willing to do that and it's devastating. We know that we saw what happened in '07 and '08. I've been a SAG member since 2006. So I was at the last strike. We know that the local economy suffers and they have absolutely no sympathy and so then I have no sympathy for them.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Burbank Mayor we'll have you back. Konstantine Anthony, thank you so much.
 
ANTHONY: Thank you.
 <br>[12:44:26]
 
WHITFIELD: All the best. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WHITFIELD: There's a new development in the fallout from the rebellion in Russia fighters for the mercenary Wagner Group have arrived in Belarus that's according to Ukraine's state border agency, which borders Belarus. Following the rebellion, Belarus said it brokered a deal that would allow Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and his troops to be exiled in Belarus. CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Dnipro, Ukraine. And an Alex, you've been reporting on those troops in Belarus this week. What more can you tell us? What kind of evidence is there about their arrival and training?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fredericka, this is further confirmation that at least some of these Wagner fighters are now in Belarus crossing the border from Russia. This comes after the Belarusian Ministry of Defense said the same on Friday, in fact, state T.V. released video of Wagner fighters training Belarusian fighters and there were some quotes from local Belarusian fighters saying that these guys were extremely experienced and that they appreciated the training.
 
Now the state border guard is saying that they are tracking the movements and the number of these Wagner troops but they did not say how many of them there are. Previously, Belarusian authorities had shown CNN a camp where some of these Wagner fighters might end up as you mentioned, that was part of the deal that was brokered between Wagner and Vladimir Putin by the President of Belarus.
 <br>[12:50:20]
 
But Fredricka for the time being at least according to the Pentagon, the majority of those Wagner fighters who took part in that aborted insurrection actually are back here in Ukraine and Russia unhealed parts of Ukraine. The Pentagon said late this week, that they are mainly back in their barracks in Ukraine, but not taking part in the operations, the Russian operation, the Russian fighting against Ukraine, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: And we also heard from Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, right, you know, when he called into question, the legal existence of the Wagner group, and what exactly what's his message?
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, some really fascinating comments from the Russian president who appears to be trying to weaken Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner to try to split him from his men. He said that Wagner does not exist. And what it appears that he's saying is that mercenary groups are legally not allowed to exist. That's a Russian law. But also that Wagner as we've known it in Ukraine, is no longer in existence.
 
I want to read you part of what he told the Kommersant newspaper in Russia, this is a quote, we do not have a law for private military organizations. It simply does not exist, the group exists, but legally, it does not exist. So that is rather confusing. Fredricka, he also detailed a fascinating meeting that was held five days after this mutiny at the Kremlin on June 29th, in which 35 Wagner commanders were invited to sit with Putin. And Putin said you can keep fighting we'd like you to keep fighting. In fact, you can do so under your current commander, a guy whose nickname is Sedoy, it means gray hair. He's a respected, retired colonel. And according to Putin, these commanders nodded in affirmation, saying, essentially saying that they would like to. But then Prigozhin spoke up and said, no, the guys do not agree. So open defiance by Prigozhin there of Putin. It's not clear what happened after that meeting.
 
But it certainly does look, Fred, like Vladimir Putin is trying to drive a wedge between Prigozhin and his men. Fredricka?
 
WHITFIELD: OK. And then meantime, senior Ukrainian officials say that counter offensive has been pretty tough so far. So how is it being viewed inside the country or even the what's next.
 
MARQUARDT: Universally, Fredricka, I would say that it is being viewed as a slow, very tough campaign. We can see the maps, we can see where they're making progress, some progress has been made on the Eastern Front. We were down to the southern front today. And the soldiers there tell us that they have also made progress there. But it is extremely slow going. We heard from a presidential adviser Andrii Yermak, who said that it is hard work, he said it's not going that fast, it is slow. That's exactly the same thing that we're told by the general who's in charge of the section of the southern front, where we are, and it's what the men are saying as well.
 
Their morale is still high. They still believe that they can punch through that Russian line, and that this offensive will be successful. But the Russians have had months to prepare for this Ukrainian counter offensive, which was telegraphed well, before it was officially launched. And so they had time to lay mile upon mile of mines throughout the southern front.
 
And so it's extremely tough going. Even though these Ukrainian fighters have new weapons from the west, new armored vehicles from the west, new training from the United States, it is very, very tough to cross those minefields. And as they try to cross, they're coming under ferocious Russian fire. So some very modest success, but it's extremely slow going it's a really tough fight, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: It's still more U.S. backed arms to come. Alex Marquardt in Dnipro, Ukraine. Thanks so much.
 <br>[12:54:04]
 
All right, a sweeping defense bill now heads to the U.S. Senate after a contentious debate in the U.S. House and a series of divisive social and culture amendments added on. What will the Democratic controlled Senate do now? We'll discuss stay with us.
