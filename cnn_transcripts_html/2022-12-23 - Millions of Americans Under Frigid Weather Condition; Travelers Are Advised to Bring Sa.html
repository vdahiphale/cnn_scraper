(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. 
 
Coming up this hour, a bomb of cyclone is brewing and more than half of everyone in the U.S. will feel dangerous bitter cold temperatures today. Your holiday forecast is just ahead. 
 
Plus, the January 6th committee's final report is out and says Donald Trump is to blame for the violence on Capitol Hill. We'll have the details. 
 
And for the first time, Vladimir Putin uses the word war to describe his invasion of Ukraine. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Live from London, this is CNN Newsroom with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo. 
 
FOSTER:  We begin this hour with a huge winter storm bearing down right now across much of the United States. More than half the U.S. population, about 170 million people are under wind chill and winter weather alerts across the country. Dangerous frigid conditions, bitterly cold winds, snowy ice making the treacherous travel conditions ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend. 
 
In South Dakota, more than 500 miles of two interstate highways are closed because of high winds and blizzard light conditions. Air travel is becoming even more chaotic as more than 2,700 flights scheduled for today have already been canceled.
 
Airlines are giving weather waiver -- weather waivers so travelers can change flights without penalties. And here's a couple of travelers and what they had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  They canceled the flight as everyone like got boarded because the wings froze, is what they said. 
 
UNKNOWN:  It was a little crazy in midway. Everybody was trying to get out before the storm.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Here's where things stand right now. Several governors have declared a state of emergency. While more than a dozen states have started implementing emergency measures. People across nearly every state are under some kind of weather, winter weather alert including for wind chill, ice, and snow. 
 
Amtrak has been forced to delay or cancel passenger services for some lines in the Midwest and northeast. And U.S. President Joe Biden is urging Americans to take the storm extremely seriously. 
 
The storm could leave many people stuck in their homes or stuck on roads for several long hours, and some have been stocking up on food and other necessary supplies as the storm gets closer.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  I have my milk and my eggs. Some reading. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Triple A says 102 million people are expected to travel by road over the holidays, and they are advising drivers to pack emergency supplies. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAULA TWIDALE, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRAVEL, AAA:  And make sure your vehicle, if you are going, is equipped. Check your battery, check your emissions, check your tires. Make sure if the roads are not, you know, dry, that you're not using cruise control, that you're abiding by speed limit, even going lower if you have to. And really equip your vehicle with extra -- in extra things. You know, water, snacks, blankets, coats, flares, emergency kits. Be prepared for anything. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  A blizzard warning will go into effect soon for the Buffalo, New York area. Feet of snow and 70-mile-an-hour wind gusts are expected this morning. The bomb cyclone combined with heavy lake effects snow and high winds will lead to dangerous and worsening conditions.
 
Let's go to CNN meteorologist Britley Ritz. Britley? 
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, Max. We are dealing with already below zero temperatures, Fahrenheit that is, across the northern plains and into the Ohio Valley. But what matters is when we factor in the wind, the feels like temperature or the wind chill, if you will. Des Moines, it feels like 36 below. And we have winds gusting over 30 miles per hour. Indianapolis, 41-mile-per-hour wind gusts right now with sustained
 
 winds of 25 miles per hour. Hence, the windshield warnings that are in effect from the northern plains to Texas back through the Ohio Valley and into the mid-Atlantic.
 
Jackson, Mississippi, temperatures are expected to be below freezing for over 80 hours. That's the case now we're dealing with the possibility of frozen pipes. So, a few things you can do is keep your house at 65 degrees and make sure you open up the cabinet doors, let some of that warmer air circulate around the pipes and lift that faucet and let it drip. Make sure that water is moving as well. 
 <br>[03:04:53]
 
Another thing to keep in mind, we get winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour with temperatures below zero. It feels like 35 to 45 below, and now we're talking about frostbite dangerous in that exposure time. You can get frostbite within five to 10 minutes. 
 
We have wind chills that are going to be below zero for at least three days across the plains and back through the Ohio Valley. Look at Chicago, 28 below. That's what it's going to feel like for your Friday. Not only that, but we are also dealing with the snow. Many of us, it doesn't take much dealing with the stronger winds with that snow. 
 
Blizzard warnings are in effect from the northern plains to the Great Lakes up into parts of New York now along the lakes where visibilities are going to drop down to a quarter of a mile or less. Keep that in mind. Now, the heaviest snowfall expected to be up around the Great Lakes as the winds, that cold wind moves over the warmer waters, and we could pick up roughly two feet of snow, especially up toward Buffalo and Watertown. 
 
So, watch that closely as we're moving through the holiday. Current snowfall moving through the Ohio Valley, heavier bands expected through parts of Columbus on up into Cleveland as we're getting that transition now, not only through the Ohio Valley, but right on up into the Great Lakes, as we talked about with that lake enhanced snowfall, which of course causes big travel issues, not only on the roadways.
 
So, if you can stay indoors, that's the best advice I can give you, but also up in the air, especially into some of these heavier populated areas. Some of our bigger airports like Boston and New York back into Chicago. Max.
 
FOSTER:  Britley, thank you very much indeed. We'll be watching it very closely. 
 
And whilst millions of Americans are bracing for the worst weather still to come, people in in the plains and Midwest are already feeling the frigid impact.
 
CNN's Lucy Kafanov has the latest from Denver, Colorado.
 
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Millions of people experiencing the peak of what the weather service is calling a once in a generation type event. Others still bracing. The bomb cyclone producing ice and snow is impacting more than 105 million people across the country. 
 
Winter alerts from coast to coast for snow and icy conditions. The dangerous cold has over 150 million people or nearly half the U.S. population under windchill alerts with below zero wind chills as far south as Texas. In the Midwest, more than a foot of snow and possible blizzard conditions expected. 
 
South Dakota's famous Sioux Falls frozen. In some parts of Kansas, the National Weather Service reporting wind chills below negative 30. There, and in the plains the cold expected to stick around for Christmas weekend. Likely making it the coldest Christmas there in roughly 40 years. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Your nose hairs literally freeze. 
 
KAFANOV:  Even those used to the cold in Wyoming are feeling the arctic blast. 
 
UNKNOWN:  I mean, it's cold, but when it's negative 20 it's just another level. 
 
KAFANOV:  Slick ice and snow making driving conditions, dangerous, abandoned vehicles, stranded drivers.
 
UNKNOWN:  I want people to have things in their vehicles. kits ready to. Deployed if they get stuck in their vehicle somewhere. 
 
KAFANOV:  Weather hazards causing road closures in various parts of the country. Zero visibility making it hard for emergency workers to respond. 
 
UNKNOWN:  There's hand warmers, some socks of beanie. and like some hygiene products and then some water and a blanket.
 
KAFANOV:  In Colorado, outreach workers trying to provide help and keep people warm, they said it's going to be cold, so I see get off the streets. If it's a real extreme emergency, they really be right on them.
 
KAFANOV:  Buses of people seeking shelter at the Denver Coliseum to stay out of the freezing cold. And it may look like things are getting back to normal. The sun is out here in Denver finally, but looks can be deceiving. It still feels incredibly cold. 
 
In fact, the city of Denver is opening up new warming centers. There is some relief on the horizon. We are expecting temperatures to go back up slowly, but surely on Friday and by Christmas day, we could be seeing highs of 50 degrees. Of course, there is less relief in sight for the rest of the country. 
 
Lucy Kafanov, CNN, Denver. 
 
FOSTER:  In just a few minutes we'll be taking a close look at the flight cancellations that are growing by the minute really. Do stay with us for that. 
 
The House committee investigating January 6th has released its final report without specifically mentioning Donald Trump. The panel concludes that anyone responsible for an insurrection should be barred from holding public office. 
 
The report goes on to detail a concerted effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. Chapter titles include the big lie and a coup in search of a legal theory. the committee outlines a scheme to submit fake electors from states Trump lost, and at least 200 attempts by Trump and his inner circle to pressure state election officials.
 
The report includes testimony that Trump wanted to walk from the White House to the capitol on January the sixth, and it says The White House should have canceled Trump's rally of the ellipse because of the risk of violence. 
 <br>[03:10:05]
 
More now from CNN's justice correspondent Jessica Schneider.
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Nearly two years after the January 6th attack on the Capitol the committee tasked with investigating all aspects of that attack has finally released its report. It comes nearly two days after the committee expected to release it all because of typographical errors and printing issues.
 
But it is nearly 900 pages with a comprehensive narrative of what occurred before, during, and immediately after January 6th. Most importantly here, it also lays out 11 specific recommendations from the committee about how various agencies and even Congress can move forward. 
 
And key among those recommendations is the committee is pointing to a section of the Constitution, the 14th amendment section three that clearly states that anyone who is engaged in an insurrection can be disqualified from holding office. The committee says that that constitutional provision should be enforced, and while they don't say it directly, the takeaway here is that they believe that Donald Trump should be barred from holding office again, especially because he has now announced his plan to run in 2024. 
 
The committee separately is also pushing for passage of the Presidential Election Reform Act. That would make clear that vice presidents do not have the power to overturn elections, of course, as Trump pressured Pence to do. And the committee is also recommending that federal intelligence and security agencies really take a much closer look at the dangers of violent extremism, especially since members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were at the forefront of the Capitol attack.
 
Plus, there's a host of new details in this 800-plus page report, including about how John Eastman first contacted Donald Trump at the White House on December 23rd, 2020, almost exactly two years ago, to fill Trump in on his plan to get Pence to overturn the election. Of course, Pence refused to do that, and also how a little-known attorney named Kenneth Chesebro allegedly came up with that plot to appoint fake electors in battleground states to try to claim that Trump had actually won in those states. 
 
And crucially here, that fake elector plot is exactly what is now being investigated by state prosecutors, including in Georgia. Also, federal prosecutors from the special counsel's office. And those prosecutors from the special counsel's office they have even served subpoenas to election officials in several battleground states as part of its ramped-up investigation. 
 
So, the committee wrapping up its report, but still potentially a long way to go on the criminal side. 
 
Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.
 
FOSTER:  Areva Martin is a civil rights attorney and CNN legal analyst. She joins me now from Los Angeles. 
 
Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
Obviously, no legal -- 
 
AREVA MARTIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Hi, Max.
 
FOSTER:  -- there are no legal guilt here, is there at the moment, we should make that clear. But the report does make it very clear that the, you know, the riot would not have happened without Trump. 
 
MARTIN:  No doubt about it, Max. This 800 plus page report makes it very clear that there is one person responsible for the January 6th insurrection, and that one person is Donald Trump, and they make that very clear without ever really mentioning his name. 
 
And they provide four, you know, referrals to the Department of Justice, four criminal charges to be filed against Donald Trump. And in fact, they lay out a roadmap for federal prosecutors, giving just insurmountable amounts of evidence that leads to the conclusion that Donald Trump incited the riot that we saw take place, the insurrection that we saw on January 6th, that he refused to accept the reality that was told to him over and over again by his closest aides.
 
The reality that he had lost the election and that there wasn't any widespread voter fraud. And what we know now is that he, despite that information, just kept plowing ahead, trying to overturn the will of the people.
 
FOSTER:  And because he engaged in the insurrection or, and in individual engages in an insurrection, under the Constitution they can be barred from office. So that's how they're trying to have an impact here. 
 
MARTIN:  Absolutely. You know, Donald Trump has already announced that he is running for president again, and this report makes it very clear that anyone engaged in the kind of insurrection that he was engaged in, that incited an insurrection in the way that he did under the 14th amendment, that they should be barred from running for office.
 
The issue is, in this case, these recommendations, many of them have to be passed by the Congress and we know that there is majority Republican on, you know, Republicans control the House of Representatives, so not likely that they are going to take up the rep -- the recommendations of the committee. 
 <br>[03:14:54]
 
But nonetheless, this report is stunning in how it lays out very methodically the premeditated insurrection that occurred on January 6th and how Donald Trump was at the center of that premeditated insurrection. 
 
FOSTER:  You followed, Donald Trump very closely over the years. You followed these hearings as well very closely, but was there anything ultimately in the report that really surprised you, something you didn't know? 
 
MARTIN:  I think the level of detail, Max, in the report, is stunning. We -- some of the main conclusions were a part of the executive summary that was released a couple of days ago, but particularly as it relates to Cassidy Hutchinson, this 26-year-old staffer for Mark Meadows really acting in such a brave and courageous way pushing back on an attorney that was hired for her by the Trump team, an attorney that basically asked her to commit perjury without saying those words out loud, but encouraged her not to give truthful answers to the committee. 
 
And she, basically firing this attorney and moving forward, giving accurate and honest testimony to this committee. She is to be commended for her bravery for standing up to Donald Trump and his team. And a lot of the details in this report, we wouldn't know if she had decided to capitulate and to follow the unethical, and perhaps even illegal advice given to her by an attorney hired by the Trump team. 
 
FOSTER:  So, if Donald Trump or his team have done something illegal, it's the Justice Department that would start that process. Right? So, how does it move forward from here? 
 
MARTIN:  Well, you're right. The committee doesn't have the power to indict Donald Trump. It has made referrals to the Department of Justice and it has laid out a roadmap for the Department of Justice to follow. 
 
We know there's a special counsel that's been appointed by the Department of Justice and by every indication they are moving forward, forward with grand jury investigation of Donald Trump's actions as it relates to the January 6th insurrection. 
 
We also know that Georgia continues in its investigation, its criminal investigation of Donald Trump and his efforts to pressure, election officials in that state. So, by some estimations, by March or April of next year, early next year, we may see a former president of the United States actually being criminally indicted. FOSTER:  It's a huge story. Areva Martin, thank you very much indeed for joining us and giving us your insight and analysis on that. 
 
Now, Russia's president makes a big statement by saying a three-letter word. He calls the war in Ukraine what it is, a war. We'll explain why that could make a big difference in Russia.
 
After years of harsh lockdowns, China is seeing a new and deadly wave of COVID-19, and that could have been trouble for the rest of the world.
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
FOSTER:  We have this just into CNN. South Korea is reporting that North Korea has fired at least one ballistic missile. Military officials in Seoul said the projectile landed in the waters between the Korean peninsula and Japan. This marks the 36th day this year that North Korea has conducted a missile launch.
 
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says he's delivering the goods after his visit to Washington. We are waiting for a confirmation that he's back home. Following a trip that involved and addressed to the U.S. Congress, he also secured a new batch of U.S. military aid, including the advanced Patriot missile defense system.
 
And as will Ripley reports, those weapons will be put to use by Ukrainian troops on the front lines. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Ukrainians remain defiant in Bakhmut as heavy fighting continues on the outskirts. Russian forces still pounding the city as they've been doing for months now, driving most of its 70,000 residents away. These days it's eerily quiet here. Silence broken only by rushing soldiers and Russia's deadly bombardments. 
 
Only a handful have stayed braving the Russian artillery roulette. They gather in underground shelters, power, water, heating, only available in aid stations like this. There's Wi-Fi too, a chance to call family and get a warm drink. 
 
For Dennis it's this that keeps him going. "We're holding on, surviving," he says. His father stayed behind and so did he, betting on Ukraine. "We hope our soldiers will defend Bakhmut," he says.
 
To make sure they're able to do so President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled all the way to Washington.
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE:  To ensure Bakhmut is not just a stronghold that holds back the Russian army. But for the Russian army to completely pull out more canons and shells are needed. 
 
RIPLEY:  The Ukrainian president also thanking the U.S. for its support and the decision to supply more advanced anti-aircraft missiles. 
 
ZELENSKYY:  If your Patriots stop the Russian terror against our cities, it'll let Ukrainian patriots war to the full to defend our freedom.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
RIPLEY:  A predictably less enthusiastic response from Russia. Moscow saying, providing Patriots will only prolong the war. "This is a rather old system." Russian President Vladimir Putin said. Those who are doing this are doing it in vain. 
 
Putin's P.R. machine firing back. The Russian Defense Ministry releasing this video of what it says is a visit by Minister Sergei Shoigu, reassuring frontline troops in Ukraine. "Don't fuss. Keep calm. Everything is fine. He says everything is fine. Keep calm.
 
Back in Europe, Zelenskyy seemingly ending the year on a high with more military aid on a pipeline, but on the frontline. No break. Still no cause for celebration.
 
Will Ripley, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine.

 <br>[03:24:59]
 
FOSTER:  In Moscow, Vladimir Putin did something that critics can say, land average Russians actually in jail. On Thursday, the Russian president called his invasion of Ukraine what it really is, and that is a war. It's the first time that we know of that he's used that word in public.
 
For more, Nada joins us. And there's a bit of a debate here about whether it was a slip of the tongue. But then this is someone who doesn't make slips of the tongue. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Absolutely, Max. I mean, President Putin is somebody who chooses his words extremely carefully. We've seen that throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They have consistently referred to this as a military operation, a special military operation, rather than a war.
 
And as he laid out there, this is something that could land ordinary Russians in jail. We saw a censorship, a censorship law being signed in by President Putin back in March, essentially making it illegal to refer to this invasion as a war. But of course, now President Putin appears to have done just that.
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Our goal is not to spin the flywheel of military conflict, but on the contrary to end this war, we have been and will continue to strive for this. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR:  Look, an early U.S. assessment of this is that it may well have been a slip of the tongue. That's according to one U.S. official, so it may well have been an accident, but of course officials will be watching to see whether perhaps this was an accident or whether we will see a shift in rhetoric from President Putin and the Kremlin over the coming days and weeks. 
 
But of course, this is a concern because this comes just off the back of that landmark meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Biden, where they did sign that deal, essentially providing Ukraine with those long sought-after missile defense system and Patriot missile defense system.
 
President Putin has said that this is in vain. However, this is a significant development. It's something that President Zelenskyy has been pushing for some time now. And as we heard from the Kremlin, they say that this will go no way towards bringing about a resolution to the war, but rather they say will increase the suffering of the Ukrainian people.
 
FOSTER:  It's a complete change in mindset, isn't it, for a lot of Russians who have been sort of indoctrinated to think of it as a military operation, which is different from a war. 
 
BASHIR:  Yes, absolutely. I mean, President Putin has been very careful about that. This is a huge P.R. operation as well. We have to remember that. And the Russian people have had their media censored. We've seen foreign news agencies being censored extremely over the last couple of months. 
 
So, this is a bit of a shift now. The question is whether this was a slip of the tongue or whether we may see President Putin now using that terminology going forward. Whether the Kremlin now begins to characterize this as a war and whether that translates to a shift in their tactics. 
 
FOSTER:  OK, Nada, thank you. 
 
Now, still ahead airports are slammed as travelers try to beat the bomb cyclone. The number of delayed and cancelled flights is already in the thousands, and it's climbing. 
 
These are live images of Chicago right now where the current wind chill factor is minus 33 degrees.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[03:30:00] 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  An unprecedented winter storm is moving across much of the U.S. right now. More than half the U.S. population, about 170 million people are under wind chill and winter weather alerts across the country. Dangerous frigid temperatures, bitterly cold winds, and snow and ice making for treacherous travel conditions ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend. 
 
The southern border with Mexico officials are warning migrants about the dangers of plunging temperatures. The Department of Homeland Security posted a message on social media warning that the U.S. border are not open and advising migrants not to put their lives at risk.
 
A few minutes ago, we said more than 2,700 flights in the U.S. were canceled today. Now that number tops 2,800 flights, leaving many travelers stranded or with few options during one of the busiest times of the year. 
 
CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean has the details. 
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  The delays and cancellations here at Chicago O'Hare International Airport keep piling up. Look at the cancellation board. More and more flights just keep getting out. Buffalo, big into New York, L.A., San Francisco. 
 
The numbers are in the thousands and will continue on Friday. About a quarter of all flights have been canceled here at Chicago O'Hare, which is a crucial airport for connections. It is a major hub for American airlines. It is the biggest hub for United Airlines. 
 
I got to go behind the scenes with United Airlines network operations center. It is working around the clock meeting every hour with meteorologists to try and make it so that passengers make their connections, putting them on different flights to different connecting airports.
 
I want you to listen now to some of the passengers who heeded the advice of airlines to try and change their trips to earlier departures.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNKNOWN:  Leave like extra time, you know, because there's so much, the lines are huge. So, you know, leave a lot of time.
 
UNKNOWN:  Be patient, plan ahead. They're doing the best they can. Honestly, so far so good for us. We came early enough to hopefully make it and hopefully our plane will take off today before and we'll get out and, get to Orlando to see our family. 
 
MUNTEAN:  Did you change your plans at all? 
 
UNKNOWN:  We pushed our flight up a little bit and we left the house at least an hour earlier than usual.
 
MUNTEAN:  Airline's best advice is to download their app. That is the best way to get up to the minute information about whether their flight is delayed or canceled, and how to get on a new flight. 
 
Pete Muntean, CNN, Chicago. FOSTER:  The final report from the House committee investigating
 
 January 6th concludes that Donald Trump or anyone inciting an insurrection should be disqualified from public office. The panel released its final report late on Thursday. It outlines a coordinated effort by Trump and his allies to pressure state election officials submit fake -- fake electors to Congress and overturn the 2020 vote. 
 
It also says the former President pedaled false claims that the election was rigged to raise more than $250 million.
 
Let's bring in Richard Johnson. He's a senior lecturer in U.S. politics at Queen Mary University of London. Thank you for joining us, Richard. 
 
I mean, there was a lot to take in, wasn't there, from this report, but what's the headline for you? 
 
RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER, QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON:  Well, we're still digesting it, but I think big headline is that Donald Trump is squarely the protagonist in this story. You know, this isn't a story about people around Trump that, you know, going rogue, going off peace, doing things without the president's knowledge and so on. 
 <br>[03:34:51]
 
You know, Trump is the one who's driving this entire story. He wants, in a sense, to overturn the election because he's embarrassed that he lost that seems to come out from it, and that people around him, there are some who are ginning him along. But there are also quite a few of them who know that what he's saying. is wrong. What they he's doing is wrong, but they're trying to placate him. 
 
So, in a sense, this is the most valuable outcome of this is to put the finger squarely at Donald Trump.
 
FOSTER:  But that, you know, according his supporters wouldn't be surprising, would it? It plays his narrative in a way that the establishment is out to get him until he is actually found guilty of something. He can always use this, can't he as part of his campaigning? 
 
JOHNSON:  Well, certainly in the context of this highly partisan political culture in the United States that that would be a likely response from the Trump side. 
 
I think from the perspective of this report, you know, the House has done what it can do in the context of that highly partisan environment. It was an achievement to get even two Republicans onto that committee to cooperate. 
 
But you are right that the next step really whether or not there are criminal prosecution steps to criminally prosecute Trump are taken, that is trickier and that is going to be more politically fraught for the Justice Department. And they have to tread more carefully, I think than this House committee was able to. FOSTER:  I mean, the committee effectively says the, you know, the
 
 January 6th wouldn't have happened without Donald Trump. That's very difficult to prove, isn't it in the court of law when he wasn't actually there. 
 
JOHNSON:  That's right. And the standard, of course, in the court of law is beyond a reasonable doubt, and that's a higher standard that, than this committee which is about the weight of evidence that they have heard. 
 
I mean, the -- this is an extremely impressive report. This is a report that I think will go, if not quite to the level, but getting close to the level of the Warren Commission or the 9/11 commission reports, you know, over a thousand interviews, you know, extremely extensive inquiry.
 
But at the end of the day, this is not, this is -- this is, you know, this is almost from the perspective of prosecutors. This is kind of a symbolic set of evidence. You know, this is not the case that a prosecutor can just put out. And prosecutors will have to hold their cards a bit closer to their chest as time goes on.
 
But of course, the timing is out of sync here because, you know, they needed to, the House needed to move on this because the Democrats were about to lose control of the House and the committee would be almost certainly wound up if they tried to press on until next month. 
 
FOSTER:  And what about the idea that he could be barred from office because he broke the Constitution by prompting effectively an insurrection, is, you know, that's not a legal decision, is it? That's something that politicians will decide. 
 
JOHNSON:  That's right. And therefore, I think it's going to be rather unlikely given the Republican control of the House of Representatives. I think any kind of statutory response to this is very unlikely, you know, it's, I suppose that you could possibly see a world where, you know, maybe a decade or two ago, a few Republicans might have killed off and you could have got something through. 
 
But I think now given the sharp part -- partisanship in the House, you know, the Republicans are going to be calling the shots there for the next two years, and they're not going to want to try to do anything to destabilized Donald Trump.
 
FOSTER:  In terms of all the legal challenges facing him right now, which do you think is his most threatening? 
 
JOHNSON:  Well, I mean, I think some of the -- some of the stuff that's going up on in New York, some of his tax stuff, some of his business dealings, we had his tax returns released this week. All of that is embarrassing for him, and I think he takes some of that quite personally because he is, you know, he's sensitive about the idea that perhaps his business success has not quite on the level that he wants it to be.
 
On the other hand, and so some of that will also cost him money, which, you know, I think is going to, you know, could be damaging for him. In terms of the -- where the political ramifications go on this, I think in, you know, as with him standing as a candidate, it is going to make things harder for the federal prosecution, for the Justice Department, for the special counsel, Jack Smith to really be too heavy hitting with him while we're in the context of this presidential election.
 
And so, if nothing else, his candidacy at the moment is a temporary insurance option that I thought he was almost certainly going to pursue. And it turns out he has.

FOSTER:  OK. Richard Johnson, thank you. 
 
The U.S. senators passed a massive $1.7 trillion government spending bill averting a shutdown. For now, it includes about 45 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine and NATO allies, plus another 38 billion to respond to natural disasters within the United States. It also overhauls the Electoral Counts Act of 1887 and bans TikTok on federally issued electronic devices. 
 
Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hailed the bipartisan progress.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  Most of what we did was bipartisan, and I believe that's going to continue. I believe that's where the Republicans want to be, to try and work with us where they can.
 
That doesn't mean we'll always agree with them or get everything we want, but I think you're going to find bipartisanship continuing in the next Congress more than people -- more than the prognosticators believe. 
 
I think you're going to be surprised at how much pull there's going to be on McCarthy once he's elected, to move to the middle rather than to the hard right.
 
UNKNOWN:  Do you think that the folks --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SCHUMER:  And if he's a smart politician he'll know that's the right place to go.

FOSTER:  The House still has to sign off on the bill before government funding runs out at the end of the day today. Republican leader Kevin McCarthy could delay a vote on the spending bill, but the measure is expected to pass.
 
An unprecedented wave of COVID is spreading across China with people filling hospitals and crematoriums overwhelmed by bodies. What experts warn this could mean new trouble for the U.S. and the rest of the world.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
FOSTER:  After nearly three years of stringent COVID lockdown, China relaxes its zero COVID strategy and health experts warn the rest of the world should brace for the arrival of new variants that could prove more dangerous than previous ones. 
 <br>[03:44:58]
 
Live now to Hong Kong and CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. Kristie, how is China dealing with this latest spike?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You know, it's just been scenes of chaos. It's trying to unwind from years of its zero COVID policy and now concern is rising over the true toll, the true scale of COVID- 19 infection across the country. Because official figures in China are unreliable for a number of reasons.
 
One of them is that China is carrying out less testing as before as it takes this U-turn of its zero COVID strategy. But also, it recently narrowed a definition of what constitutes a COVID related death. 
 
You know, for this month so far, China has officially reported only eight COVID related deaths. That's it. It's a remarkably low number, especially given the mounting evidence of surging cases and surging deaths across the country. 
 
In Beijing, you have scenes like this. The hospitals are being overwhelmed with patients, but also you have our team in Beijing has filmed evidence of an of a cramped and very crowded crematorium there.
 
They witnessed those billowing plumes of smoke, just billowing nonstop over the furnaces. They also filmed and witnessed piles upon piles of yellow body bags in metal containers there. Hospitals in Beijing are overwhelmed. 
 
There are reports that medical professionals from across the country are now going to Beijing to help out. Medicines are running out of supply and in residents they're concerned and scared. 
 
One resident -- here's a statement shared her concerns with us. Her name is Fairy Zang. And she said this. In the past five days I've had many symptoms. I couldn't buy any medication to treat sore throat, coughing, fever, none of the medicines are available, she tells CNN. 
 
The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is now calling on China and other countries to provide information about COVID-19 outbreaks. He says he has a number of concerns, economic concerns, public health concerns, but also deeply concerned about the possibility of a new variant emerging. 
 
This is what America's top diplomat said. He said this, quote, "anytime the virus is spreading or moving around, there is a possibility that a new variant develops. That variant spreads even further, and it comes and hits us or other countries around the world." Unquote.
 
Now Secretary Blinken, he also spoke to the foreign minister of China, Wang Yi, over the phone about the COVID-19 outbreak in China, as well as other issues. And we just got a statement back from China's ministry of foreign affairs. They said this. China has always shared relevant information with the international community and will continue to do so. 
 
Back to you, Max. 
 
FOSTER:  Is there a sense that this was almost inevitable? You have such a widespread lockdown when it eases, you know, you are going to have the spread of viruses, aren't you? 
 
LU STOUT:  Yes. And China was not ready for this. Look at the reasons why it held on to the Zero COVID policy for so long. Its medical infrastructure. The capacity simply wasn't there, especially in rural parts of the country. 
 
In addition to that, relatively low vaccination rates, especially among vulnerable portions of the population like the elderly, and if they were vaccinated, they were vaccinated with China's homegrown vaccines, which do have a measure of efficacy but they are not targeted to deal with the Omicron variant, and nor are the messenger RNA vaccines. 
 
I should also add that, you know, we know that Pfizer BioNTech, they have shipped over a batch of Pfizer vaccines to China but those are intended only for the German expatriate population there.
 
Back to you, Max. 
 
FOSTER:  Now do people talk about the fear of lockdown coming back and going back to how it was?
 
LU STOUT:  There is a measure of people being happy for the opening is taking place and looking forward to 2023 to traveling again to see, you know, revenge spending that the world has never seen before. But in the meantime, we're going through this very difficult period. We also should keep in mind the temperatures in Northern Hemisphere, China, especially in the north, very, very cold right now. 
 
People are prone to respiratory diseases, and respiratory diseases are prone to spread. This is a very vulnerable season for the zero COVID policies to suddenly be let loose. A huge population not properly vaccinated. They don't have the booster shots that they need to write up this wave of infection that is spreading throughout the country, Max. 
 
FOSTER:  OK. Kristie Lu Stout, thank you as ever for joining us. 
 
LU STOUT:  Thank you. 
 
FOSTER:  Now, imagine technology that does all the thinking for you. Just ahead, a look at the next generation of artificial intelligence and some of the pros and cons. Do stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
FOSTER:  Planned strikes in Europe will make holiday travel this weekend, I'm sorry, more hectic. Border force employees in the U.K. start their eight-day strike on Friday. The government plans to bring in trained military personnel to act as fill-ins, but warns delays at airports and seaports are still likely.
 
Now the next generation of artificial intelligence is here it's called ChatGPT. It is a chatbot that can provide human-like if sometimes inaccurate responses to questions. It already has more than a million users after debuting just a few weeks ago. 
 
Tom Foreman has been taking a look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Allowing cars to drive themselves, composing songs that mimic popular artists, and producing this digital painting that took the top award at a Colorado art show. This is all the work of artificial intelligence, computers that don't just do what they're told, but in a sense, think, learn, and create. 
 
And right now, ChatGPT is rattling the A.I. world. Turning out stunningly humanoid writing. Just ask Douglas Rushkoff, a renowned author and professor of media culture. 
 
DOUGLAS RUSKOFF, MEDIA THEORIST:  It is writing better than most of my students write at this point, you know, the college freshman. So, yes, I am impressed with that. 
 
FOREMAN:  How does it work? ChatGPT has been filled in a sense with a massive amount of information. Imagine the biggest library you can then program and trained by humans to process and spit it out in conversational phrases.
 <br>[03:54:57]
 
So, ask for 1,000 words on the early days of automobiles, and in seconds it responds. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, automobiles were relatively primitive by today's standards and were primarily used by wealthy individuals or businesses. Ask it to write a sonnet in the style of Jerry Seinfeld. I'm just a standup comic telling jokes on stage. I make them laugh and that's all I do, but sometimes life is a joke. It hits me low, and then I take the mic and say, who knew? 
 
It's not perfect, but it can debate, compose essays, solve math problems. 
 
RUSKOFF:  Well, that looks right.
 
FOREMAN:  Write computer code, answer follow up questions, even admit mistakes. And all that means ChatGPT or more advanced A.I. like it could replace people in all sorts of positions. 
 
RUSKOFF:  This could potentially save time and resources, but it could also lead to a loss of personal connections and a decline in the quality of these types of interactions. 
 
FOREMAN:  We know that because everything Rushkoff said just there was written by ChatGPT when asked about potential problems with itself.
 
RUSKOFF:  The answer it gave me about the dangers of GPT, that sounded like a pretty good television guest to me. 
 
FOREMAN:  Sometimes it makes mistakes and just gets things wrong, and its knowledge so far only goes up to 2021. So, if you ask it something from six months ago, it has no idea what you're talking about. But as it continues to update and improve, this is very likely to change our world in a very dramatic way.
