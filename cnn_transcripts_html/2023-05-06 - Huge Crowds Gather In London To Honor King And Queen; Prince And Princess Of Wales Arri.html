FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST (on camera): Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.
 
History unfolding before our very eyes today in London. For the first time in 70 years, a new British monarch has been crowned.
 
The nearly 400-year-old St. Edward's Crown was officially placed on the head of King Charles III today at Westminster Abbey.
 
The sacred coronation ceremony was filled with tradition and pageantry, a culmination of a seven-decade journey from being heir to the throne to becoming the monarch.

JUSTIN WELBY, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY: God save The King.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God save The King.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God save The King.

WHITFIELD: The king's wife, Camilla, also receiving her crown during the ceremony. Officially making her Britain's new queen.
 
10s of 1000s lined the streets of London to greet the royal family. A royal reception to honor their new king and queen, and then, a royal salute from 4,000 British troops.

ANDREW STOKES, GARRISON SERGEANT MAJOR, BRITISH ARMY: Cheers for His Majesty, the King. And Her Majesty, the Queen! Hip! Hip!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hooray!
 
STOKES: Hip! Hip!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hooray!
 
STOKES: Hip!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: And in a moment, many had camped out for days to see King Charles Queen Camilla and the Royal Family stepping onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace to greet the crowds of adoring royalists lining them all. A moment no one in attendance will ever forget.
 
Here are more of the remarkable moments from this historic day.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WELBY: I here present unto you, King Charles, you're undoubted King: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?
 
Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the peoples of the United Kingdom, of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, your other realms and the territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?
 
KING CHARLES III, KING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: I solemnly promise so to do.
 
WELBY: Receive this orb, set under the cross.
 
God Save The King!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God save The King.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God save The King.
 
PRINCE WILLIAM, PRINCE OF WALES: I, William, Prince of Wales, pledged my loyalty to you, and faith and truth I will bear unto you.
 
WELBY: I now invite those who wish to offer their support to do so, with a moment of private reflection, by joining in saying, God save King Charles, at the end, or, for those with the words before them, to recite them in full.
 
May thy servants Camilla, who wears this crown, be filled by thine abundant grace.
 <br>[12:05:02]
 
WHITFIELD: Amazing moments, one after the other. 1000s in the crowd, braving the rainy weather there to see the newly crowned monarch and his queen.
 
CNN's Scott McLean and Salma Abdelaziz, are joining me right now -- still in the rain, sorry, guys, from London.
 
So, Scott, you first, you know, imagine this as a celebratory mood, still, what's it like on this side of the coronation now?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, still very much a party atmosphere, still very much affect a festive atmosphere.
 
In fact, Fredricka, It wasn't long ago that the King and -- I could see from the window, Prince William as well came out in cars with a -- with an entourage and there was a crowd there to snap some pictures and to cheer as they -- as they waved.
 
You know, what really strikes me here is that you don't often see outward displays of British patriotism. This is not necessarily a nation of flag fliers on a day-to-day basis. But you sure do on days like today, and you're reminded about how the royal family and the monarchy can really be a unifying force for this country.
 
But certainly not everyone was happy. There were anti monarchy protesters as well, out, making their voices heard. Some of them chanting, not my king, and controversially, some of them were also arrested by the London Metropolitan Police for what seems like very little -- 
 
Police put out a statement, later, explaining that there was a conspiracy to cause public nuisance. In other words, they had planned to disrupt things, planned to attach themselves to buildings or the road.
 
And this will be very controversial because the police were only recently, this past week, given new powers under new legislation to arrest otherwise peaceful protesters.
 
Now, as you saw there, the ceremony went off virtually without a hit -- without any kind of a hitch, say for perhaps one very small hiccup.
 
And that Prince Charles arrived at Westminster Abbey slightly before his son, Prince William and his family who seemed to be running late.
 
And so, William and Kate actually proceeded into the Abbey after the king, which was not the way that it was supposed to be done, but probably a lot of people watching at home wouldn't have noticed or certainly would not have cared either.
 
And one other thing to mention is that things have been so, so orderly. Obviously, a lot of planning has gone into this. But even I've been struck by the crowds who came -- who had lined the mall, were then invited to come down here to Buckingham Palace to witness the fly past, and, of course, the famous wave from the balcony that we saw. And things were just incredibly orderly.
 
And on the balcony, controversially -- perhaps, controversially, Prince Harry was not included in that. Obviously, he's here for the coronation.
 
And I asked some people about that afterwards. And most everyone seemed to acknowledge how difficult the decision Prince Charles had and whether or not to include him or not. And it seemed to be sort of a no-win situation, whatever he decided. Fredricka?
 
WHITFIELD: Wow. Yes, that was very awkward on the absence, with, you know, with striking. And as for the tardiness, the lateness, hey, anyone with small kids understands, oh, what Prince William and Princess Kate must be dealing.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
MCLEAN: Yes, me too.
 
WHITFIELD: Right. You too. I mean, it's so hard to be on time when you got small kids. A lot of things to keep up with.
 
All right. Salma, to you, also, in the rain there. But you are still among a throng2s of people there. What are you hearing from folks who represent so many generations?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Fredricka, what's amazing is that people are still making their way down here.
 
I'm just at the gates of Buckingham Palace here. And you can see people literally just clinging to those gates, trying to take pictures. Many of them were unable. As you can imagine, there were crowd limitations. So, they were unable to make it to the mall for the actual coronation process. So, they're here now to soak up the atmosphere.
 
And you might say, well, what atmosphere? It's raining. But this is very British weather for, of course, a very British occasion.
 
Well, what might strike you, just looking around, if you walk with me here, besides the umbrellas everyone has on, its families, Fredricka. And that's really been a theme here.
 
It's really been an intergenerational occasion, if you will, I have spoken to grandmothers who thought it was important to bring their grandkids, who care -- it's the parents who say they want their children to remember this once in a lifetime moment, this once in a lifetime event.
 
And there's really a solemn sense, especially outside the palace here. My team and I were standing here at that moment, that very iconic balcony moment.
 
I'm just going to pass through these crowds. Again, I want to give you a sense of this atmosphere. If you -- if you just keep following me along here, just all along. Because you have to remember, this area was cordoned off for nearly two days.
 
It was cordoned off, of course, because of the events, because of the proceedings, and now it's opened up. So, you have this huge public space that people are walking through.
 
They're taking a moment to reflect. They're taking a moment to ponder. They're taking an opportunity to really digest, if you will, the events of the day. [12:10:02]
 
And you can just see the smiles everywhere, right? It's a hugely historic moment, but also an emotional one.
 
We saw people again at that iconic moment in the balcony, they were just tearing up. They felt it was such a privilege, Fredricka to just be here, to be present for that moment.
 
Oh, it's incredible. I mean to watch and, of course, to be there. I mean, that's admirable. And I think, like a lot of folks, I mean, I've been to Buckingham Palace just on a regular occasion outside with tourists.
 
And you look because you're hoping someone might peek out the window. So, something tells me a lot of people who continue to stay and they're just hoping, maybe they'll get a quick peek of a member of the royal family that just happens to be looking out the window.
 
All right. We'll check back with you, Salma Abdelaziz and Scott McLean. Thank you so much from London.
 
All right. Joining me now to talk more about today's historic coronation of King Charles III is Royal commentator, Hilary Fordwich.
 
Also joining us is Emily Nash, she is a CNN royal commentator, and the Royal editor for HELLO! Magazine. Good to see both of you, ladies.
 
So, Emily, you first, you know, you've covered multiple royal weddings, births over the years. But this is the first king coronation in 86 years. So, put it into perspective for everybody just how historic today's crowning was.
 
EMILY NASH, CNN ROYAL COMMENTATOR (on camera): Well, it really was an extraordinary moment and the likes of which most of us have never seen before.
 
You know, it's been 70 years since we've lost in anything on this scale. And these rituals, which have been carried out for more than 1,000 years in this country, being shown in this day and age is really something very unusual to see, and something most people are going to remember for the rest of their lives.
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, indeed. And it was full of tradition, you know, and a spirituality as well, Hilary. But did today's -- I guess, pomp and circumstances ceremony, did it live up to? What the expectations might be or even perhaps surpass them?
 
HILARY FORDWICH, ROYAL COMMENTATOR: Oh, Fredricka, pleasure to be back with you -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
NASH: I think it -- 
 
Sorry about that. Hillary. FORDWICH: You know, I'm pleasure to be back with you, Fredericka. And actually, when you said the word, surpass, I thought that was a very good term, because we've always previously, actually, in a 1,000-year history, of course, it's always been not just -- been broadly ecumenical, which it was.
 
It was a mosaic of mankind in terms of not only the attendance, those outside. Inside, we saw a meritocracy on display, not just an aristocracy.
 
And the actual service, it was a cross face. There was an imam there was a rabbi. And, by the way, Prince Charles was friends many years ago, when he was still Prince Charles, with a rabbi, and he now came the head rabbi, he was invited to stay at Clarence House last night, and King Charles had him as his personal guests there. Why?
 
So, that on the Jewish Sabbath, he could walk over to Westminster Abbey. What a special touch and you saw completely different faiths represented. Yes, it surpassed other previous coronations in that regard.
 
WHITFIELD: So, Emily, you had a thought on that question as well.
 
No, absolutely. I think, you know, most of us were expecting a spectacle. But be -- I mean, I was lucky enough to be inside the Abbey today. And I think I hadn't expected to be quite so moved by what we saw and what we heard.
 
You know, these very intimate moments, the anointing, for example, which we didn't see in full, but were just remarkable to witness.
 
Yes. I mean, that was quite the moment too with, you know, Prince William, you know, pledging loyalty, you know, to his dad.
 
And I wonder, too, you know, Emily, I mean, King Charles, he has big shoes to fill. You know? After the long reign of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, who was beloved and established a lasting legacy, but he has been waiting a long time, or maybe we should say he's been groomed for a very long time.
 
So, with that, people must feel like they do know him. There is a relationship. They've watched him, you know, since birth. Do you think that this will, ultimately be, an easy transition for him to make his own mark and legacy because he's been in the wings, you know, as the queen son, all this time?
 
NASH: I mean, absolutely. He has been the longest serving heir in waiting in British history. We know him. We know his interests, his passions, we know, you know, his weaknesses we've seen over the years.
 
But he -- I think, is now, you know, an elder statesman, if you like. He is well respected, not just in the U.K., but around the world. And this is really filled past for the British people today, it's formalized that role for him.
 
WHITFIELD: And Hilary, how about Queen Camilla? People have to get used to referring to her as Queen Camilla. You know, being crowned with a similar -- looking bejeweled headpiece. Really kind of sealed it in the public's eye, right? I mean, there is the moment.
 
She's queen. She has been known to be very devoted to Charles for a very long time, as we all know, you know that they're about their romance.
 <br>[12:15:02]
 
But how will she continue to try to endear herself to the world? Because she will still have a lot of work to do, won't she?
 
FORDWICH: Yes. You're absolutely right, Fredricka. But she will continue to do as she's been doing. She's by her man, she serves, and she's there to make sure that also he stays rather calm. It's known that he can once in a while have a little bit of a temper. Of course, we saw that with his fountain pen, initially.
 
But she is a very calming influence on him. She is dedicated to him. And her dedication to duty, everybody who's ever met her and I've met her, she's very charming in person. She's very down to earth. And she has done what the British public -- and I think people universally, like, dedication to duty and dedication to service.
 
She's always there serving other people. That's what she's done to move the needle, shall we say.
 
WHITFIELD: Well, that's interesting. You said, in-person. You know, very charming in person. I don't know, if a whole lot of people and the public you get to see the charm that you speak up. So, does that mean she's got work to do?
 
FORDWICH: Oh, yes. And I think actually this side of the Atlantic, over in the U.S. here, I'm in New York, as you can see at the moment.
 
I don't think that we see anything really unless it's a high-profile event or wedding or a funeral or coronation, or the scandals we don't tend to see. And it's understandable. It's not necessarily thrilling the day-to-day duty of what the monarch does, what the royal family does, what the senior royals do every single day, and that's why King Charles swore not to be served but to serve. They are going out and they're cutting ribbons at, you know, people's home and go into hospitals. And they're doing walkabout across the British Isles, actually, and across the Commonwealth.
 
The queen touched, are you ready? One-third of the British public had actually seen her as the die. Why? Because she was out serving the public.
 
WHITFIELD: Emily, I mean, this is representative of opulence in every way. I mean, perhaps you can help us understand the distinctions of the king and queen crowns, why they look very similar? They're obviously not. Yes, you know, the kings adorned with something like more than 400 gemstones and was created, you know, in 1661, right?
 
What can you tell us about these two crowns, the meaning and then, perhaps the capes because I find those fascinating too.
 
NASH: I'm so sorry, Fredricka. I just lost the last -- the question.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, the distinction. The distinction of these crowns. I mean, you know, they're very similar, but then, obviously, the kings is a lot more ornate. And I wonder, too, if you can tell us a bit more about the capes as well.
 
NASH: Yes. So, the queen's crown was less ornate, deliberately, I suppose. It been altered specially for this moment. That had -- that she'd had to, if the arches removed.
 
She'd had some jewels that are personal parts of the late queen's collection incorporated into that crown. So, there was that led very touching nod to her late mother-in-law there as well.
 
The kings crown, obviously, is going to be the main item of regalia that you see on the day as the -- as the reigning monarch.
 
So, that, you know, while she is crown, she is not in the spotlight quite in the same way that he is, and the crowds reflect that.
 
WHITFIELD: Wow, I can't -- I can't imagine the idea of actually removing some jewels. But I guess that was in keeping to with what we saw from, you know, Princess Kate, who had a more simplified kind of version with her, you know, floral -- you know, with, I guess silver made from -- you know, silver of her floral crown as opposed to going for, you know, the jewels.
 
So, that was in step, I guess, with the message that they are trying to send.
 
Thanks so much to both of you. Appreciate it. Hilary Fordwich, Emily Nash. Appreciate it. And we have so much more on the coronation coverage straight ahead. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:23:17]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. We continue our coverage of the coronation of King Charles III, in the 70 years since the crowning of Queen Elizabeth. Much has changed in the monarchy, which raises questions about its relevance.
 
CNN's Bianca Nobilo takes a closer look at how it fits into modern day Britain.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And happy indeed by the revelers who welcome Britain's coronation here in Piccadilly.
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The longest interlude between two coronations in British history.
 
Decades of demographic, religious, and societal change, raising questions about the relevance of the monarchy today.
 
1953 was full of postwar post war joie de vivre and excitement about a new young queen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They come to seek work in Britain.
 
NOBILO: Despite waves of historic migration, Britain in the 1950s was overwhelmingly White, Christian, and divided along class lines, in society and the halls of power.
 
Today, three of the four great offices of state, including the prime minister, are from minority backgrounds. 20 percent of the population today are from ethnic minority backgrounds too and rising. Many from countries subject to exploitation in the former British empire.
 
BIDISHA MAMATA, COLUMNIST: The monarchy itself has to find a respectful and humble place for itself without pretending that it doesn't have all of its privilege, all of its history and all of its baggage.
 
NOBILO: But crumbling slowly after the second world war, Britain was still stratified along class lines in the 1950s.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The (INAUDIBLE) did not rank (PH). A duchess for example wears four rows.
 
NOBILO (on camera): Modern Britain is in many ways allergic to the idea of inherited privilege. Society at least strives to be egalitarian.
 <br>[12:25:02]
 
But a recent poll commissioned by the BBC -- Britain's national broadcaster, suggests that King Charles might have a problem appealing to young people.
 
38 percent of whom said that they would support an elected head of state. And indifference might be a problem too. 78 percent said that they weren't interested in the royal family.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's definitely time to rethink and I know a lot of people who loved Queen Elizabeth and I don't think that that same fondness is there for King Charles.
 
NOBILO: The monarch since the 16th century is also titular head of the Church of England.
 
In 1953, the majority of the country was Christian.
 
Today, it is half that with a number of nonreligious and non-Christian faiths rising each year, with multifaith leaders playing a role in the coronation for the first time. King Charles who has declared himself to be defender of all faiths was honored here at Britain's largest mosque ahead of the coronation. So, could this be an opportunity for all the communities in Britain to come together?
 
SABAH AHMEDI, IMAM: With Islam, we're taught a part of your faith is lauded to a nation and we also know, the coronation is a part history of this nation. And our citizens will respect that history.
 
NOBILO (voice-over): The coronation is a litmus test to how King Charles will be received by 2023 Britain and whether enthusiasm, apathy or opposition to the monarchy will shape his reign.
 
Bianca Nobilo, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: And we'll have more coronation coverage straight ahead. Stay with us.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whoa! (INAUDIBLE).
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:51]
 
WHITFIELD: It was a moment 70 years in the making. Today, King Charles III was officially crowned the King of Britain. The Monarch was anointed during a sacred coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey, his wife Queen Camilla also receiving her crown during the proceedings.
 
Throngs of well-wishers lined the streets of London to cheer on the royal family as they returned to Buckingham Palace. And it was their members of the British military gave their king a royal salute. And then the moment many have been waiting for this picture right here the King and Queen alongside selected members of the royal family a greeting the masses from the balcony at Buckingham Palace, and then a military flyover streaming Britain's National colors into the sky.
 
And there has been mixed reaction among Britain's former colonies in Africa about the coronation of King Charles III. CNN's Stephanie Busari is in Lagos, Nigeria with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR AFRICA EDITOR (on camera): It was a day of pomp and pageantry across the U.K. as King Charles was coronated. But for many across the continent in Africa, it was a day just like any other, and celebrations were muted, or just didn't happen at all.
 
Many African heads of states attended a coronation. But there were no street parties of bunting hanging in countries such as Nigeria, an only true diehard Royals would have celebrated and mostly in private.
 
Many here were simply too focused on a myriad problems they face in their daily lives. Africa has the youngest population in the world was 70 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa under the age of 30. And there's a growing sense, particularly among this demographic, that a British monarchy is not relevant to their lives.
 
The palace may not like to hear it, but if anything, many of them say they relate more to Harry and Meghan, as a fresher, more modern face of monarchy.
 
King Charles has, of course, visited Nigeria, but four times over the years when he was Prince. And he also created last year, the international arm of his pretty strong foundation, which gives opportunities to young people, and Nigeria is also a member of the Commonwealth.
 
But beyond political and diplomatic ties, there's a growing disconnect among the everyday citizens. Of course, Commonwealth is also rooted in the British Empire. And there are people here who simply cannot relate to the atrocities of the Empire such as slavery, and what the elders suffered at the hands of former British colonial powers. Stephanie Busari, CNN, Lagos.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: Right. And while there was no official U.S. delegation at the Royal coronation, First Lady Jill Biden attended the ceremony at Westminster Abbey with her granddaughter Finnegan as her plus one. Other notable Americans in attendance popstars, Lionel Richie and Katy Perry, both of whom will perform at tomorrow's coronation concert.
 
Let's go now to CNN's Gloria Pazmino live for us in New York, in the West Village, where there are celebrations stateside in honor of King Charles is that's what's going on right now in the streets.
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly right, Fred. You know, New Yorkers never shy away from a party and coronation day is no different. You could take a look here at the British traditional dancing that is happening here in the West Village. We are right outside Sympathy.
 
This is a very old establishment here in the city nearly 30 years since -- if you want to show you around, there's quite a big crowd here today more than 200 restaurants a day people come in and celebrate. And here they are. They're having those biscuits, that tea, champagne and they have been watching replays of the coronation. This is where you come if you want to do it.
 
The right now I have been talking to customers who wanted to come in mark the occasion. They got up early -- preservation.
 <br>[12:35:03]
 
They got their name on the list, and they made sure they had here in the West Village to take it all in today. So the party has really been happening all morning. And I want to introduce you to -- this is Millie. And I just want you to take a look at what she is wearing. Here she has this beautiful coat with the Union Jack and I was just learning earlier today that you can't just cut up the Union Jack and make it into a dress. Tell me about it?
 
MILLIE GIBBONS, BRITISH ACTRESS IN NYC: So this coat doesn't actually belong to me. This belongs to Nikki, the owner and her husband Sean made it especially for her. But yes, I heard I learned this as well today that if you can't cut up the flag in a certain way. So apparently, Shawn had it done correctly. It was greatly made for her. And yes, and it's gorgeous.
 
PAZMINO: Talk to me about what it's like to be here today as a Britain celebrating the coronation. What does it mean to you being away from home, but being able to be here to celebrate it and take it all in?
 
GIBBONS: I mean, it's fantastic to be seen simply it's like such a great place to come together and celebrate, you know, this is a day full of celebration. We have the more sponsors, we have the food, we have the raffle going on. So it's just a great -- it's a great way for everyone to come together and celebrate.
 
PAZMINO: What was it like as a Briton to watch the coordination from a distance? You know, this is a moment 70 years in the making it really the beginning of a new era. You've only known one queen, as a young Britain. What was that moment like for you?
 
GIBBONS: I mean, it was different. It was very refreshing. I mean, Charles represents like a lot more of like a modern take on the monarchy. So I'm looking forward to seeing his reign and, you know, being a part of something so historic, you know, 70 years. That's a long, long time. So yes, it's definitely a day to celebrate, and, and have fun.
 
PAZMINO: Perfect. Thank you so much, Millie. So as you can see Fred, you know, tradition. You can see it in how that dress that -- how that coat that Millie is wearing has to be taken into account. There's tradition that goes into everything the pomp and circumstance, also present here in New York City, where New Yorkers are coming here to this restaurant to celebrate to have a proper cup of tea. And to just take in the moment even being away from home.
 
There are many people here who are from Britain. And this is a place where they can come to be to celebrate to be with their compatriots. And celebrate this moment, which as we have been saying all morning, really a big moment in history, the beginning of a new era. And here in New York people getting together to take it all in and celebrate it. Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, festive celebrations there in a sunny New York City across the pond. All right, thank you so much, Gloria Pazmino, appreciate that. We'll check back with you.
 
And of course, we'll have more from London in a moment, including some of the sweetest and funniest moments during the coronation, thanks to Prince Louis. And we're also keeping a close eye today on the war in Ukraine, where for the first time the country says it used a U.S. made Patriot air defense system to intercept a Russian missile. We'll talk about that, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:42:21]
 
WHITFIELD: Russian authorities have detained a man they say may have been involved in an explosion that blew up the car of a of a Russian pro-war military blogger. Russian state media reports the blogger survived the blast but his driver was killed. The explosion took place in an area east of Moscow.
 
Just last month, another pro-war Russian blogger was killed in an explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 
And now to Ukraine where for the first time Ukrainian officials say they've shot down a Russian hypersonic missile using the U.S. made Patriot air defense system. Both the U.S. and Germany have supplied the air defense systems to Ukraine. Ukraine previously was unable to intercept more modern Russian missiles such as the hypersonic missile. And this comes as the mercenary Wagner Group says it will pull out of the city of Bakhmut. CNN's Nic Robertson is following all of these developments. Nic, the fighting is now intensifying in Bakhmut.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, that's what Ukrainian military officials in the east of the country are telling us. They're saying that actually last night there was a big uptick in the amount of shelling 25,000 shells fired. Normally this is about 20,000 a day.
 
The understanding that we have from the Ukrainian military is their interpretation now of what Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary boss said yesterday about running out of ammunition and pulling his troops out of the town in a few days if they're -- if the Russian forces didn't give him more ammunition.
 
Ukrainian military are saying hey, now this is looking a lot more like a bluff that Prigozhin and the Russians actually had the ammunition because they really up the fight last night. That's what we -- that's what we're being told.
 
And also we saw overnight that the Ukrainian special forces released drone video from the -- from Bakhmut showing areas of the city that looked like they were had been hit by some kind of incendiary device. Unclear what but a lot of that part of the city on fire so the fight there, they're saying intensify the saying Ukrainian forces continue to hold on to their pipe.
 
But interesting in the past couple of hours, Prigozhin has been talking to Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen military warlord, leader of -- Chechen leader who's saying that he's going to bring his forces into Bakhmut in the next couple of days. They're working out between all of them and the Russian forces, how to supply them. Prigozhin will pull out as he threatened to (INAUDIBLE) off will move his forces in.
 
Right now, I don't think Ukrainian officials are taking anything they hear from this pair or the Kremlin at face value.
 <br>[12:45:02]
 
They are giving us the indication. They'll judge the situation as it develops on the ground and last night it developed badly.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Nic Robertson, keep us posted. Thank you so much.
 
All right. Still ahead, we'll take you back to London. Some of the highlights of the coronation had nothing to do with King Charles, but instead his grandchildren.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right, welcome back to our continuing coverage of the coronation of King Charles III. Today, thousands of loyal watchers braved rainy weather in London to celebrate the crowning of the King and Queen.
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
Back with me to talk more about today's pomp and circumstances royal watcher, Hilary Fordwich and Emily Nash. She is a CNN royal commentator and the Royal editor for Hello magazine. Hello to you both. Thanks for rejoining me.
 
All right, so Emily, you first, you know, King Charles was center stage. But today the younger generation of the royal children and the grandchildren were really in the spotlight as well, talk about how they helped to represent the next generation of royals and the continuing interest in them.
 
NASH: Well, the Prince and Princess of Wales's children did a fantastic job representing the family today. They were impeccably behaved even if Prince Louis had a couple of yawns during the service. You know, he's only five years old. And he managed to last quite a long time only taking a brief pause in proceedings to go and have a little timeout in another room.
 
WHITFIELD: They are fun to watch. I mean, because they really are just being themselves. They're very relaxed and comfortable with who they are and the positions they're in, it seems Hilary. I mean, they did play a pretty sizable role in today's coronation, you know, trailing their parents and also seem to be assigned kind of front and center. So what does this tell you about perhaps their emerging roles?
 
FORDWICH: When absolutely, totally, if you know about --
 
WHITFIELD: Hilary, go ahead.
 
FORDWICH: That's right. But I thought that I totally can go with you, though, that Prince Louis absolutely behaved impeccably, for a five- year-old child. But interestingly, as we've seen previously, Princess Charlotte, and she's only just 8, she actually was there, she just had an eighth birthday holding his hand courting him in. And she was wearing a same the Queen dress that her mother was actually it had thistles from Scotland, and it had the daffodils from Wales and the roses from England, the Shamrock from Ireland.
 
So yes, this is a symbolic, visual depiction of what we can expect in the future well behaved children, and they are there to serve as well. Think about what they have been coached to do. They were there to not only observe, but to be a demonstration of wonderful behavior.
 
We also did see, by the way, when we saw Prince George carrying holding his grandfather's robe. Right next to him on his left hand side was Major Johnny Thompson. He's actually one of the guards. He was actually security that was with the Queen Mother and the Queen. Very interesting there just in case anything went wrong. But Prince George carry that robe with aplomb and should also be praised.
 
WHITFIELD: I know, they were very impressive. Emily, you're going to chime in on that too.
 
NASH: Well, absolutely, I think, you know, going towards what Hilary says that George himself is going to have some form of correlation in the future. And I think it's hard to imagine what was going through his mind as he took part in his grandpa Wales's huge event today. I think it's going to be very interesting to see how this impacts on them in the years to come.
 
WHITFIELD: Is that what they call him? Grandpa Wales?
 
NASH: They do call him grandpa Wales. Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. That's cute and clever. OK, so I mean, what while we talk about the inclusion, I mean, the absence is also, I mean, quite striking. Harry was not on the balcony with the family. So I got to ask you, too, about that.
 
And, and apparently, this was the wish, right? This was the wish of King Charles. He's the one who made decisions about who's included the placement of people, et cetera. But also striking to me, I mean, I think everyone's glad that Harry was there. 
 
But there was a moment where he was kind of standing in the rain outside, you know, watching the carriages go by while the live cameras were, you know, fixed on the carriage of the king and the queen and you know, William and Kate and their families and there he was in the rain, oh boy.
 
So Emily, what might he be feeling? I mean, he voluntarily separated himself from the royal duties. But it also says something that he is there and there he is leaving kind of alone in a car there. What do you suppose might be going through his mind? Or what's the experience experiencing?
 
NASH: I think, very, I think very mixed feelings, no doubt. You know, this has been such a big part of his life. His upbringing has been absolutely rooted in this, as you say, pomp and pageantry in these traditions. I think it's fantastic that he was there on the day, but it did seem to jar slightly with proceedings that he was, as you said, on his own for these key moments, as the rest of the family departed.
 
But I do understand on the other hand, why the king made the decision he did, you know, he had to have just the senior working Royals, on the balcony, in the carriages in the procession. I think the he has to make a distinction between family and the firm.
 
WHITFIELD: And Hilary, can you quickly punctuate that as well, your thoughts?
 
FORDWICH: Absolutely amazed totally and utterly right.
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
And think about this. He was offered a lovely olive branch from the royal family. They did invite him to the luncheon at Buckingham Palace but of course he had to get back to Montecito. But everybody has children has torn and, you know, his wife, Meghan has said that she said in the Oprah Winfrey that the most important title to her is mother.
 
And so this is what's important to her. And he had to be back with his family. But I do think that it was good that he was there and united front. And one last interesting point though. Somebody else that was in attendance was Andrew Parker Bowles.
 
WHITFIELD: Great.
 
FORDWICH: Camilla's husband because they've raised their children together. So there was a lot of uniting families there from the past.
 
WHITFIELD: I know. I guess that would that -- that's very gracious. But boy, that was a little odd too, just saying. All right. Hilary Fordwich, Emily Nash, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.
 
All right, still to come. Kentucky Derby favorite Forte has been scratched from today's race. We'll have more on why officials said he has not allowed to participate.
