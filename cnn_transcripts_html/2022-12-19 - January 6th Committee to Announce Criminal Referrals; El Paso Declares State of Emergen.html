THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS: It was 89 and 0 before yesterday. But hey, Christine, Bucs at 6 and 8 but they're still in first place, because the NFC South division is the worst in all of football. 
 <br>[06:00:13]
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: I mean, yesterday for sports, what a day for sports. 
 
SCHOLES: Just incredible.
 
ROMANS: I mean, the blunder in the NFL, just the World Cup game. I mean, yesterday was just heaven. I'm going to be honest. It was heaven. 
 
SCHOLES: Yes.
 
ROMANS: Thank you. Nice to see you, Andy. 
 
SCHOLES: All right.
 
ROMANS: All right. Thanks for joining us. I'm Christine Romans. CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): As a former prosecutor I think there's sufficient evidence to charge the president. The evidence seems pretty plain to me. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: Well, good morning, everyone from Washington, D.C. It's so good to have you here. Poppy is off today. Welcome to our special coverage of the January 6th Committee's final meeting. I hope you had a good trip in. 
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Back in my hometown. 
 
LEMON: Back in your hometown. She's all -- she's glowing this morning. 
 
Yes, but we're here for some very serious stuff. In just hours, a committee will take up criminal referrals against Donald Trump. What's at stake and who in his orbit should be worried. Also, Elon Musk is asking his 122 million Twitter followers if he
 
 should step down as CEO following a chaotic 48 hours for the social media site. 
 
Plus this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
LEMON: Goal. That's Argentina. It won the World Cup, beating out France on penalties in an epic finale. Lionel Messi proving why he truly is the GOAT. We're going to have much, much more on that.
 
We're going to begin with the reason that we're here in D.C. today. The January 6th Committee set to hold its final public hearing this afternoon. They plan to announce highly-anticipated criminal referrals against former president, Donald Trump.                               
 
Sources are telling CNN that the panel is considering multiple alleged crimes, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to defraud the federal -- federal rgovernment. 
 
We want to turn now, straight away, to CNN's Paula Reid. She joins us this morning. Good morning, Paula. There's a lot to -- lot to deal with today. Today is the culmination of big events. 
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Exactly. It's a historic day on Capitol Hill. This is, as you noted, a culmination of over a year and a half of work. 
 
Now, investigators are expected to release most of their findings today. But what is expected to make the most news is this list of who they are going to recommend for possible criminal charges.
 
And CNN has learned that former President Trump is expected to be at the top of that list. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
REID (voice-over): The January 6th committee will hold its last public meeting today -- 
 
ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): This is crunch time for the committee. 
 
REID (voice-over): -- to roll out the results of its nearly two years' long investigation into the Capitol attack. During the meeting lawmakers are expected to vote to approve their final report. 
 
SCHIFF: If the evidence is there that Donald Trump committed criminal offenses in connection with his efforts to overturn the election, there's sufficient evidence to charge the president. 
 
REID (voice-over): Lawmakers are also expected to announce they will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Trump, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source tells CNN. 
 
SCHIFF: This is someone who tried to interfere with a joint session, even inciting a mob to attack the Capitol. If that's not criminal, then -- then I don't know what is. 
 
REID (voice-over): Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson also told CNN the panel is looking at different types of referrals. In addition to referrals to the Justice Department for potential criminal prosecution. 
 
They're also considering referrals to state bars for possible disciplinary action, to the Federal Election Commission for any campaign finance violations, and to the House Ethics Committee. 
 
Today's meeting is expected to not only name people being referred but also lay out a legal basis for those decisions. Among those who could face referrals: a handful of Trump's former aides and advisers. 
 
MARK MEADOWS, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOSE CHIEF OF STAFF: This is about Donald Trump. 
 
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP: They cheated with the machines.
 
JOHN EASTMAN, FORMER LEGAL ADVISOR TO DONALD TRUMP: The state election officials ignored or violated the state law. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Clark, how are you? Good morning. The fight with DOJ. 
 
REID (voice-over): Including former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; lawyer John Eastman; former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark; and former Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani. 
 
Also on the table: possible action against fellow members of Congress who stonewalled the committee's work. 
 
SCHIFF: We have weighed what is -- what is the remedy for members of Congress? Is it a criminal referral to another branch of government or is it better that the Congress police its own?
 
REID (voice-over): As the committee is rushing to tie up nearly two years' worth of evidence gathering. 
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): We want to make sure no one slips through the cracks. We want to make sure that the -- the key organizers and movers of this attack don't escape the scrutiny of the justice system.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
REID (on camera): But these referrals are largely symbolic. For special counsel Jack Smith is already investigating the former president and his associates for their roles in January 6th, and he will make the final charging decisions. Now, also, if you're wondering why they would release all of this
 
 critical information on this week, a holiday week, when a lot of people aren't paying attention, of course, the committee is under a deadline here. They're trying to release what they know to the public before Republicans take over the chamber next year, when they're expected to dissolve this committee. 
 
LEMON: Before the changing of the guard. Thank you very much, Paula Reid. We appreciate that.
 
Let's bring in now CNN legal analyst and former deputy assistant attorney general, Elliott Williams; and CNN law enforcement analyst Michael Fanone, who was injured at the Capitol on January 6th. 
 
Good -- so good to see both of you. Thank you for joining. Good morning. So what -- the significance of these criminal referrals? 
 
ELLIOTT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: OK. So No. 1, they don't really matter for the purpose of whether the Justice Department moves forward with the prosecution. 
 
But they're significant in that it's Congress, which investigated over the course of a year and spoke to witnesses and issued subpoenas and so on. It's Congress making a statement that they believe that, if not the former president, people around him committed crimes. And on behalf of the American people, which is sort of, you know, what their role is, that itself is significant. It's symbolically significant.
 
LEMON: But no teeth. This doesn't have any teeth at all. 
 
WILLIAMS: Well, it has teeth insofar as it's Congress making a bi statement. People can draw from that what they wish. But does the Justice Department have to rely on that step? No, legally, in court it's not going to hold up. 
 
COLLINS: What do you want to see happen today, though? Because you have such a different, you know, first-hand account of what happened on January 6th. So I wonder what you want to see the committee do today to send a message, essentially? 
 
MICHAEL FANONE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: I don't want them to do anything other than, you know, make recommendations based off of what the facts of the investigation were. 
 
I mean, I understand the fact that Congress is a legislative body and that they're supposed to be looking for a legislative solution to January 6th. But in reality, what they are is a group of Americans who are using whatever tools are at their disposal to try to put a stop to a criminal president and the threat that he poses to our democracy, at great personal cost, both professionally and within their personal lives. 
 
LEMON: As Kaitlan just said, you have such a different experience, right? I mean, you were up close and personal with -- with these guys. You were assaulted on January 6th. What would you like to see come from this? Because he's saying, essentially, the statement. Basically, it's a statement from Congress. It's not -- you know, they
 
 don't have to act. The Justice Department doesn't have to act on this. What would you like to see happen, Michael? 
 
FANONE: I mean, what I would like to see happen is I would like to see the Department of Justice indict the former president and those with whom their investigation determined that criminal statutes were violated. 
 
I would like to see those individuals put on trial. And then again, as I've said many times as Americans, we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time. 
 
COLLINS: Speaking of that, you know, and the significance of what these referrals looks like, because it doesn't mean the Justice Department has to act. They decide that. That will be up to Jack Smith, the special counsel. 
 
But does it have any impact on Trump's campaign? Because he is running for president, and that is a factor now, that he's a 2024 candidate now. 
 
WILLIAMS: Well, so I guess it's two different questions. One, that depends on Republican primary voters, how they choose to respond to it. 
 
Now, the question of can you still charge a candidate with a crime? Of course you can. Now, in the months immediately before election day, if there were a primary or the 2024 election, the Justice Department would not move forward with arresting somebody or putting them to trial or something like that.
 
But they can still investigate him up until that point and indict or charge him with a crime at any point between now and then. 
 
So, you know, this idea that some folks have that being a candidate somehow immunizes you from ever going to jail or -- 
 
LEMON: He has that idea. He thinks it's going to protect him somehow that, you know -- if he runs for president. That's why he did it so early. 
 
WILLIAMS: Look, I prosecuted people before who had all kinds of ideas about what their guilt ought to have been or not been, but that's --
 
FANONE: Every criminal suspect that I ever participated in investigating ever. So Donald Trump thinks a lot of things, and most of them are not true. 
 
LEMON: Are you holding out any hope, do you think? Because you've been through, you know, the trials. You did the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers. What's your -- what do you think? 
 <br>[06:10:05]
 
FANONE: I mean, listen, I see momentum building in that direction. But again, I don't know. I don't know what's in Merrick Garland's mind. 
 
And yes, I'm -- I am hopeful that the Department of Justice does the right thing and seeks an indictment against Donald Trump. 
 
LEMON: I'm sorry, Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, right? You have these groups with these names on them. And many of them were members of law enforcement. 
 
What -- as a member of law enforcement, you should have some experience with this. What possesses someone who join any group like this with the name Oath Keepers or Proud Boys on it? Because they're, you know -- 
 
FANONE: And we had this conversation before the show, and you're going to make me say things that are going to get me in trouble on CNN. But, no, I mean, I -- listen, these -- if you look into the interviews that were conducted with many of these guys, you know, they are, for lack of a better term, pathetic morons. People who were susceptible to the type of manipulation that Donald Trump and -- and many of his allies utilized. 
 
Many of them are, you know, not well-educated. They are of not -- you know, not of means. And -- and then a lot of them harbor sexist, racist ideology. And that's kind of what binds them together in those particular groups, as well as harboring some pretty extreme anti- government sentiment. 
 
COLLINS: Yes. And that jury selection gets under way for the Proud Boys trial today. 
 
The other aspect that I'm going to be watching today is what happens with the Republican lawmakers who defied subpoenas from the January 6th Committee. Obviously, there's -- there's several of them. 
 
And I wonder what both of you think of this. Because I know you've said, you know, if you defy a subpoena, a regular person would be arrested. And what -- how they're being treated, versus how a regular person would be arrested.
 
Also, these Republicans at large. And this is what Adam Kinzinger, who's on the committee, who obviously is a Republican, who is leaving Congress, had to say about his party as a whole. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL): The once great party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan has turned its back on the ideals of liberty and self- governance; instead, it has embraced lies and deceit. We shelter the ignorant, the racist, who only stoke anger and hatred to those who are different than us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WILLIAMS: So you know, there are a couple things going on here. Now on the one hand, they don't -- the Congress doesn't have a ton of time if they really wanted to go after them with contempt and lock them up in jail and so on before January 3rd when the next Congress comes in. 
 
There's an argument to be made for just letting them walk, and let next year come. And then when Republicans want to start issuing subpoenas to Democrats, just don't show up for them. 
 
It gives the Democrats in Congress now an opportunity to not comply with the next Congress. So play by their own game. That's what I, as an attorney on the Hill, would advise my boss to do. 
 
LEMON: I thought you said defy. I thought you meant defy their party. They were talking about Kinzinger and Cheney, who did defy their party. 
 
But I mean, it's going to be interesting to watch. You have what's happening, you know, with the Proud Boys, what's happening with the Oath Keepers. And then you have this on Capitol Hill. I know you're going to be watching it very closely, and you are, as well. We appreciate both of you joining us.
 
COLLINS: Yes. Thank you.
 
LEMON: Thank you so much. Good to see you. Good to see you, Mike.
 
COLLINS: There's another major Trump investigation that's wrapping up. Sources tell CNN the special grand jury that's investigating efforts by Trump and allies to overturn the election results in Georgia has largely finished hearing from witnesses and is now working on writing its final report. 
 
That's a sign that prosecutors might decide pretty soon whether or not to seek criminal charges. 
 
Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis has been digging into Trump and his associates since early 2021, soon after this phone call became public. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via phone): All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes. Which is one more than we have.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
COLLINS: That was Trump pressuring Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in what Trump still claims was a perfect call and has insisted he did not do anything wrong. 
 
The investigation has been big. It's included false election fraud claims made to state lawmakers in the fake elector scheme. It's already -- and Fani Willis has already informed the 16 Republican fake electors that they are targets of her probe along with Rudy Giuliani. 
 
A long list of Trump allies have testified, despite some of them trying very hard not to, including Senator Lindsey Graham, Rudy Giuliani, and Trump's former national security advisor, Michael Flynn. In Georgia, special grand juries, we should note, do not have the
 
 authority to issue indictments, but they do make recommendations. So then it will be up to Willis and a new grand jury to decide whether or not they're going to move forward on criminal charges.
 <br>[06:15:04] 
 
Some legal experts have said that case would not be a slam dunk; far from it, actually. But it is still a significant step. 
 
Listen to what former U.S. attorney -- the former U.S. attorney in Georgia told CNN just yesterday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL J. MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA: I think it's likely that you'll see a recommendation come out from the special grand jury to pursue, or at least to recommend criminal charges against people involved. And I think you'll likely see Trump in that, because he's -- you know, he's essentially given a confession on tape. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: Well, new this morning, the Democratic mayor of El Paso declaring a state of emergency, migrants are setting up camp at the border, waiting for an official end to Title 42. That is a Trump-era pandemic policy that has allowed border agents to expel migrants at the border. 
 
Now Republicans and Democrats alike are bracing for an expected huge wave of people. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott says, if Title 42 is lifted, there will be total chaos. And Senator Joe Manchin adding his voice to a bipartisan push for intervention. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): The president needs to use every bit of power he has as an executive to find a way or ask for an extension. The president can basically, I think, ask for that extension. I think  his administration is doing that, or will do that. I sure hope they do. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: Straight now to CNN's Ed Lavandera. He's live for us in El Paso. Ed, good morning to you. What are you seeing and how are officials preparing? 
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Don, all across the U.S. Southern border, communities are bracing for what could very well be a logistical nightmare in transportation, feeding migrants, and shelter. 
 
All of this happening -- expected to happen in two days'         time, in hopes of avoiding a humanitarian catastrophe. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One more, sir.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One more, yes? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, sir. Sit at the front (ph).
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  El Paso's mayor says he's bracing for as many as 4,000 to 6,000 migrants to be released into the city per day, if Title 42 is lifted on Wednesday. 
 
MAYOR OSCAR LEESER (D), EL PASO, TEXAS: And I really believe that today          our asylum seekers are not safe as we have hundreds and hundreds on the streets, and that's not the way we want to treat people. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): City officials have started moving hundreds of migrants who were camping out around downtown area bus stations into hotels or newly-opened shelter space. 
 
LEESER: We want to make sure that everyone is safe. And we know that the influx on Wednesday will be incredible. It will be huge. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on in, guys.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): In the last week, we're told more than 1,000 migrants have found refuge inside the Family Center shelter in downtown El Paso.
 
LAVANDERA: This is Sara. She came from Ecuador with her husband. They've been traveling for 30 days.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  She says the journey was brutal. Sara Romero, like almost every migrant we've spoken with, says they were kidnapped and held for days in Mexico until they paid their way out. 
 
But they arrived at an uncertain time, and the chance of winning asylum in the U.S. is far from guaranteed. 
 
LAVANDERA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Are you worried that you're going to be deported? 
 
SARA ROMERO, FROM ECUADOR: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): She said they're looking for anything. They would like to either request asylum or a humanitarian visa, just something that would let them be able to work and -- and earn some sort of living. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  Romero is one of the thousands who entered El Paso in the days leading up to the expected end of the public health policy known as Title 42, which allowed U.S. border officials to expel migrants nearly 2.5 million times since 2020. 
 
LAVANDERA: So here on the edge of the Rio Grande, in Juarez, Mexico, not everyone is trying to cross over. The people you see kind of standing behind me, they don't want to cross just yet. They're waiting for Title 42 to be lifted. 
 
Because they're worried if they cross now, they will be deported. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Some are sleeping under the cover of this car wash. And many are in barren shelters like this one, called the Hope Center, where more than a hundred people sleep on these floors every night. 
 
Kelly Perez and her husband have waited here two months, waiting to decide when to cross into the U.S. 
 
LAVANDERA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE): Why are you waiting to cross? 
 
KELLY PEREZ, FROM VENEZUELA: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
LAVANDERA: They're waiting to cross, because they've heard so many other Venezuelans who have been deported. And they don't want -- they don't want that to happen. 
 
So they're waiting for Title 42 to get lifted to see how things play out. And then they'll decide whether or not they're going to try to enter the United States. 
 
JUDGE RICARDO SAMANIEGO, EL PASO COUNTY: They're called it the EEL (ph), the asylum (ph) of the Southwest. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): But El Paso officials know that spirit of compassion will be put to the test this week. County Judge Ricardo Samaniego says this area has never experienced a moment like this. 
 
LAVANDERA: When and if Title 42 gets lifted on Wednesday, what is it going to look like here? 
 
SAMANIEGO: Everybody agrees that it's not sustainable. That there's nothing that we're doing right now that's sustainable. Everything is addressing and reacting to the situation. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[06:20:08]
 
LAVANDERA (on camera): And, Don, here in El Paso this morning where we've seen so many migrants camping out on the streets around the bus stations in downtown, after that state of emergency declaration this weekend, many of these people have been cleared off the streets and moved into other type of shelters or hotel rooms.
 
So a dramatic change here in the streets of El Paso this morning. 
 
LEMON: Ed Lavandera in El Paso, thank you very much. 
 
And now this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These scenes will live forever as Lionel Messi and Argentina have won the World Cup. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: It was a World Cup final for the ages. Argentina celebrating its extraordinary win against France in one of the most epic finals in World Cup history in what he said would be his last World Cup game. 
 
Argentina's Lionel Messi ended up hoisting the World Cup trophy as he and his teammates celebrated their victory. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes! 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: I don't know how, but if you missed it, Argentina scored two goals in the first half. Then in the space of just two minutes in the second half, France scored back-to-back goals and tied the game. 
 
Each team scored in extra time, and finally in a shootout, Argentina won on penalties. 
 
So let's go to where all of this happened. CNN's Don Riddell is live in Doha. Don, I mean, this was insane. I can't even imagine what the reaction on the ground was, given what it was on my train yesterday as people were all watching it. And I know people -- Poppy said she was flying to Cabo (ph), and everyone on her flight was watching the game. It was just amazing. 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it was amazing. You know, when I was handed this yesterday, the World Cup final ticket, I was pinching myself. It's obviously a great sporting occasion, but World Cup finals are rarely great matches. 
 
However, I now think this really is a collector's items, because I think I've probably witnessed the greatest football game ever played. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIDDELL (voice-over): This is the moment that Lionel Messi fulfilled what many had considered to be his destiny. 
 
But during an extraordinary World Cup final in Qatar on Sunday, the trophy was well within his grasp and then it almost slipped through his fingers. 
 
In soccer-obsessed Argentina, tears of joy, celebrations spilling into the streets. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Messi scores! 
 
RIDDELL (voice-over): Messi put Argentina ahead against France with a first half penalty. And shortly afterward, it was 2-nil, as Argentina swept forward with a stunning move, Angel Di Maria providing the final touch. France were being played off the park and seemed to be out of it until
 
 they won a penalty 10 minutes from time. French superstar Kylian Mbappe scoring from the spot and, within barely a minute and a half, he had equalized with a stunning volley. 
 
The defending world champions had picked themselves up off the floor, and now, it was game on. 
 
In extra time, Messi scored again, putting Argentina 3-2 ahead. And they came within two minutes of victory, until France were rewarded for their spirited performance with another penalty, dispatched by Mbappe for his hat trick. 
 
Both teams had given it everything, but the game had to be settled by penalties, and that's when France came unstuck. They missed two spot kicks, Aurelien Tchouameni's proving decisive, before Gonzalo Montiel settled it for Argentina. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Champion of the word!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no words.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Messi. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's beyond words. 
 
RIDDELL (voice-over): This is Argentina's third world title, and it comes in the first World Cup after Diego Maradona died in 2020. 
 
And now that Messi has matched his great compatriot by standing on top of the world, he will be considered one of the all-time greats. 
 
Messi sharing his feelings on Instagram, saying, "Champions of the world. So many times I've dreamed of it. I wanted it so much, but it's still sinking in. I can't believe it."
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
COLLINS: So epic that Don got to be there for that. 
 
LEMON: That was Don Riddell reporting. 
 
COLLINS: Awesome game.
 
LEMON: All right.
 
COLLINS: All right. The one and only Andres Cantor is going to be joining us to talk about that epic game and his reaction, of course, which I think we have an indication of what it was. 
 
LEMON: And then this. That's how I feel about this next story. Screaming. Survey says Elon Musk tweets a poll saying that he'll step down if Twitter users say so. The poll just closed. The results next. 
 
COLLINS: Plus, severe turbulence overnight. More than 30 people were injured on this flight to Hawaii, some hospitalized. We'll tell you what happened, ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:28:36]
 
COLLINS: All right. Just moments ago, we got the results of Elon Musk's poll that says -- well, he says will determine whether or not he remains CEO of the social media site that he bought for 44 billion. 
 
Last night, he asked his 122 million followers whether or not he should step down from running the company following an especially chaotic 48 hours for the site. 
 
You see there, it says the majority of them say yes, 57 percent. 
 
Of course, he says he will abide by that. We'll wait to see whether or not he does. 
 
Musk faced serious backlash after he abruptly suspended several journalists, including CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, claiming that he doxed him by posting links to an account that shared flight data for his private jet. 
 
Then Twitter implemented a new policy to prevent users from sharing links and users' names from other social platforms, like Facebook, Instagram, the competitor, Mastodon. 
 
Overnight, an about-face again from Twitter, as they deleted that policy less than 24 hours later. 
 
Before he asked his Twitter followers to decide his fate that he says he'll abide by, Musk was spotted at the World Cup with Jared Kushner, as you see here. 
 
So here to talk about all this is the editor-in-chief of "Semaphore" and former "New York Times" media columnist, Ben Smith. 
 
Ben, I know Don has his doubts about what's going to happen here. He definitely wants to ask you about that. 
 
I think sometimes it seems that Elon Musk has already made a decision when he posts something like this. What is -- 
 
LEMON: Can you -- I'm sorry. Ben, can you hear us? We lost Ben Smith. 
 
COLLINS: I think we lost Ben Smith.
 
LEMON: We'll get back to Ben Smith. We'll see if we can do it.
 
But you -- Look, I know how you feel. You use Twitter a lot more than I do.
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
LEMON: I'm not taking away from the seriousness of Twitter. 
 <br>[06:30:00]</pre>
