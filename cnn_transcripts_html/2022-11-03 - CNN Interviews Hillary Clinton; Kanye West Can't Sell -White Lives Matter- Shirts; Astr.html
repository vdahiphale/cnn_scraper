THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[08:30:00]
 
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  And I hope that, you know, we'll do that starting Tuesday.
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  I think that we are hearing now what you will be saying on the campaign trail here in New York with Governor Kathy Hochul, Letitia James, and the vice president of the United States.
 
Thank you, Secretary Clinton. We appreciate your time. Thanks for joining us early in the morning.
 
CLINTON:  Thank you. thanks to all of you.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  Thank you, secretary. Nice to be able to talk to her about so many issues. We also have other news ahead. This certainly making headlines this morning. Kanye West cannot sell that "white lives matter" shirt that he wore at a fashion show that (INAUDIBLE) controversy. We're going to tell you why and the two men blocking him from doing it.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  We are also getting new details this morning about what you heard Secretary Clinton talking about there, the man who attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer. We'll have those details for you right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COLLINS:  After this just in to CNN. Immigration officials say that Dave DePape, the man charged with using a hammer to attack 82-year-old Paul Pelosi, was in the United States illegally.
 <br>[08:35:03]
 
He may face deportation, according to the Department of Homeland Security. ICE officials have lodged an immigration detainer on DePape who is a Canadian national on Tuesday. That detainer, though, is not likely to affect his case since deportation often happen after criminal cases are resolved. And according to federal records, DePaPe entered the country in early March at the San Isidro port of entry along the California-Mexico border as a temporary visitor.
 
HARLOW:  All right, so this, clothes and sneakers designed by Kanye West used to fly off the shelves, you know this, in minutes. When his decision to wear that "white lives matter" t-shirt and a string of antisemitic remarks forced apparel companies to, finally after waiting too long, some of them pulled his (INAUDIBLE), a pair of radio hosts are stepping in to prevent Kanye West from ever making a sent off dear stain (ph) by what is viewed as a racist response, obviously, to "black lives matter."
 
CNN national correspondent Brynn Gingras has more. So, there are two people that have done something, copyright, copyright to "white lives matter?"
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, this is such an interesting story because they actually were not the original owners. We will get into that in just a minute. But the copyright right now belongs to two Black men, Ramses Ja and Quinton Ward. Now, they host a racial justice radio show called Civic Cipher. They say they became the legal owners of the trademark to the phrase "white lives matter" for its use on clothing last month in order to prevent West or anyone else from profiting from that slogan. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
Q. WARD, CO-HOST, CIVIC CIPHER:  As you've seen, even though he says some really hurtful, divisive and sometimes crazy things, he has a bit of a zealot following. Every time he released something, it sells out, right? So, he is still, in the face of offending all these people, stood to gain, you know, a significant amount financially by putting this term on shirts and calling it fashion. So, if there was something that we could do to stand in the way of that, then absolutely let's sign up for it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GINGRAS:  Good for them. Okay, so what's super interesting here is that the hosts, again, weren't the original owners of the copyright. It was actually one of their listeners who filed for the trademark rights the same day Ye wore that shirt at a Paris fashion show, clearly having the sense that this could become major issue. A person who does want to remain anonymous then ultimately handed it over to Civic Cipher. So, I find it so interesting when people have the wherewithal to just think ahead like that.
 
HARLOW:  Talk about actually doing something. I mean, how did Ja and Ward feel about holding the copyright to the phrase that (INAUDIBLE). The Anti-Defamation League has categorized it as a hate slogan. Clearly, what matters is the intent. Why they did it?
 
GINGRAS:  Absolutely.
 
HARLOW:  For what purpose?
 
GINGRAS:  Yeah. They have a huge responsibility here, right? They know that if that is in the wrong hands and they know that Ye was able to go with it, it could be in a lot of the wrong hands.
 
HARLOW:  Yes. GINGRAS:  So, they say they took that -- made that decision not lightly, they thought about it for quite a while, and then they just said, we have a responsibility here to make sure it doesn't end up in the wrong hands.
 
HARLOW:  Fascinating. Thank you.
 
GINGRAS:  Taking real action.
 
LEMON:  -- say to this Ye.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
GINGRAS:  How long have you been waiting for that one?
 
LEMON:  I don't know. It just came to mind. Okay, so, in 119 years of Major League Baseball, there had only been one no-hitter in the World Series until last night. How the Astros pulled it off, next. 
 
COLLINS:  With pictures of the entire game?
 
LEMON:  No. Is this what we're talking to Anderson about?
 
HARLOW:  No.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COLLINS:  All right, in 1956, Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" was topping the charts, Eisenhower was in office, and the World Series last saw its no-hitter until now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  The Astros have a World Series no-hitter!
 
COLLINS:  Last night, the Houston Astros throwing just the second no- hitter ever in the World Series, beating the Phillies 5-0 to even the series at two games.
 
Let us bring in CNN's Carolyn Manno.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLIN:  No hit has got to hurt for the Phillies.
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, yeah, no doubt. Don, you remember that game in 1956 --
 
COLLINS:  No, he doesn't. No, he doesn't. 
 
LEMON:  I was in high school.
 
MANNO:  What it was like?
 
COLLINS:  I never made this joke earlier. Don made this joke. I just want everyone to know that.
 
MANNO:  That was an impressive feat back in the 50s. But it hasn't happened in so many games in the nearly 700 games. It shows you just how hard it is to do. Combined effort for Houston that made history last night.
 
I will tell you what, Starter Cristian Javier is the story of this game. The 25-year-old's fastball is a thing of beauty, and he is one of baseball's most underappreciated stars, undrafted from the Dominican Republic. His parents flew in before the game to see him pitch and told him, God willing, you'll throw a no-hitter, and that is exactly what he and his teammates did.
 
Javier striking out nine over six innings, including five in a row. At one point, he turned it over to the pulpit, and then from there, it was Bryan Abreu in the seventh, Rafael Montero in the eight, and Ryan Pressly just slammed that door shut in the ninth. This is the Astro's second no-hitter of the season and the other one also started by Javier. That was back in June as Houston evens the series up at two. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEX BREGMAN, HOUSTON ASTROS THIRD BASEMAN:  We grew up watching World Series. We know that baseball has been going on for a long, long time. So, to be a part of -- to just be a teammate on a team that did that and what Javier and all the guys did was -- is really special. It was a moment that we'll all cherish forever.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MANNO:  So, it is down to the best of three-game fight tonight at Philly, the Eagles and Texans also playing in Houston tonight. So, this is double dip for Philly and Houston fans who have just been thrilled over what has happened over the course of the series. 
 
LEMON:  Baseball can be a little slow, but I wish I watched that game. Sometimes --
 
MANNO:  Yeah, and I was thinking about the players who grew up watching these World Series games and just thinking maybe that could be me one day and then you have a kid like this who has made history is very special
 
COLLINS:  I feel bad. The first lady, Jill Biden, obviously, is a huge Phillies fan. She was there last night.
 
LEMON:  I wasn't there on '56.
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
But as a kid, I watched the Astros at the astrodome in Houston.
 
MANNO:  We won't tell anybody. 
 
HARLOW:  Thank you, Carolyn. Also, this morning in the world of sports, the owner of the Washington Commanders may be selling his NFL franchise. Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, she has been running the team, say they have hired Bank of America to secure potential transactions. The news comes months after Snyder was forced to hand over control of the franchise's daily operations to his wife.
 
And also, the House Oversight Committee accused of fostering a toxic workplace and using a shadow investigation to influence the internal NFL reviews. Snyder has denied this accusation.
 
Let's go to our senior data reporter Harry Enten with this warning. This is like been a long time coming. Even fellow NFL owners are saying, all right, it is time to sell the team.
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  Yeah, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts basically said it is time to go adios amigos. I just want to give you an idea here of -- but, you know, Dan Snyder might be forced to sell the team, but he's going to make bank, he's going to make bank which is -- look at this. Look how much the team is worth now. It's worth $5.6 billion -- billion dollars! When he and the group bought the team back in 1999, it was only worth $750 million.
 
I mean -- so, you know, he might have the embarrassment of having to sell it, but he's going to make bank.
 
And I want to give you an idea that the reason why he's basically being forced to sell the team at this particular point is not because necessarily the scandal, yes, that's part of it, but it also because there's a ton of fan pressure to get rid of the team, because look at the percentage of games his team won over the course of his ownership, only  43% of the games that they won.
 
But I think the question might be then, okay, the team stunk, he's in scandal, why is the team worth so much money? Well here's the reason why. The reason why is pretty simple, and that is Snyder benefits from an addicted public. I will admit I'm addicted to football. I watch my Buffalo Bills every single Sunday.
 
And if you look at the viewership of the last Super Bowl, get this, 112 million people watched this past year's Super Bowl. It was the most viewed program of anything by far and the most viewed non-NFL program in 2021 had just 32 million viewers. Look at that difference, 112 versus 32 million viewers. The public loves football.
 
Of course, there's also another scandal that I think we should talk about here. The NBA Phoenix Suns are also worth a ton. Owner Robert Sarver is selling because of scandal as well, racist remarks, et cetera. He at this particular point, $2.7 billion. He's also going to make bank. That is up from $401 million when he bought the team back in 2004. You have all these owners who have embarrassment but they're going to make a lot of money.
 
HARLOW:  I remember when a billion was a lot with Steve Ballmer coming in. Remember that, after the Donald Sterling controversy. Now, $2 billion, $5 billion.
 
COLLINS:  How may (INAUDIBLE) is that?
 
HARLOW:  Not enough to -- Don has a ticket, so he wins.
 
LEMON:  Thank you, Harry.
 
COLLINS:  He thinks he's going to win. Thank you, Harry.
 
ENTEN:  Thank you.
 
HARLOW:  We appreciate it. 
 
LEMON:  So, it's that time of year again. CNN Heroes is back, and we're going to unveil the top 10 heroes of the year. We have a new barista, by the way, Anderson Cooper. Anderson, I'll have a latte.
