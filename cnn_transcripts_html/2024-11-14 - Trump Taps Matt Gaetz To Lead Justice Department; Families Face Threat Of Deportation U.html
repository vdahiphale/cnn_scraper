ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): You could literally hear the jaws dropping to the floor.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH: Shock, outrage, and confusion on Capitol Hill after Donald Trump taps Matt Gaetz to become his attorney general. President-elect Trump appears intent on keeping his campaign promise of mass deportations. We will hear from two families with mixed legal status about what that could mean for them.
 
And a suspected suicide attack outside Brazil's Supreme Court coming just days before the country hosts global leaders at the G20 Summit.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton calls it the worst cabinet pick in American history. Donald Trump has selected Matt Gaetz to be his Attorney General. The Florida Republican resigned from Congress late Wednesday, just days before the potential release of a House Ethics Committee report. Gaetz has repeatedly denied accusations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and obstructing investigations.
 
Here he is, last year, outlining a scorched earth policy for the U.S. federal government.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT GAETZ, THEN-U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: We either get this government back on our side, or we defund and get rid of, abolish the FBI, CDC, ATF, DOJ, every last one of them, if they do not come to heel.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH: Trump's pick sent shockwaves through the halls of Congress. While some Republicans supported the choice, others were less enthusiastic.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Well, it's an interesting pick. Highly loyal to President Trump. again, I don't know enough about him in terms of his ethnic charges, and that's why I say it's a somewhat interesting pick. We'll have to see how that all unfolds.
 
REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): If you want to clean out the Department of Justice, this is who you want.
 
SEN. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R-WV): The President has the prerogative to nominate who he wishes.
 
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): I was shocked that he has been nominated.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: The other pick getting a lot of attention is former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard who -- to be the Director of National Intelligence. Now a Republican, Gabbard was or has met with Syrian President Bashar al Assad back in 2017 saying he's not an enemy of the United States. She's also blamed the Biden administration for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
 
Well, Donald Trump says he and President Joe Biden discussed Ukraine Wednesday during his return to the White House. The meeting was awkward after the venom of their campaigns, but the U.S. president and his successor spoke politely to one another in front of the cameras.
 
CNN's Arlette Saenz has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, Mr. President-Elect and former president -- 
 
DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much, Joe.
 
BIDEN: Donald, congratulations. 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two former competitors face to face, setting the course for a presidential transition unlike any other in American history.
 
TRUMP: A transition that's so smooth, it'll be as smooth as it can get.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): President-elect Trump returning to Washington and the White House for the first time since his election victory, meeting President Biden for nearly two hours in the Oval Office. 
 
TRUMP: Politics is tough and it's -- in many cases, not a very nice world but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate it very much.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): The White House describing the sit down, which included their chiefs of staff, as cordial and substantive.
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The President-elect, again, was gracious. Came with a detailed set of questions.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): Trump telling the New York Post they, "got to know each other again" and spoke about Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks, Trump said, and he gave them to me. The meeting restored a tradition last seen in 2016 when President Obama hosted the newly elected Trump at the White House.
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We now are going to -- want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): Trump shunned the protocol in 2020. Four years ago today, he publicly mused about who would occupy the White House, despite Biden winning the race.
 <br>[02:05:02]
 
TRUMP: I hope whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): Trump ultimately refused to concede watched as his supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6th and skipped Biden swearing in. Today is meeting a full circle moment for the two men who fiercely brawled in the 2024 race. 
 
BIDEN: Most importantly and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this nation.
 
TRUMP: He's a low I.Q. individual. Take his I.Q. I guarantee you it's in the low 50s or 60s.
 
SAENZ: With a historic handshake, Biden promising a peaceful transfer of power to his predecessor and now successor.
 
BIDEN: And looking forward to having a, like we said, smooth transition -- do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need. And we're going to get a chance to talk about some of that today. So --
 
TRUMP: Good.
 
BIDEN: -- welcome. Welcome back. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAENZ: One person who did not come to the White House today was former First Lady Melania Trump. First Lady Jill Biden had extended an invitation for her to meet here at the White House the same day that President elect Donald Trump came. But ultimately, the former first lady decided not to come. Sources had cited previous scheduling issues for the reason why she did not attend.
 
But first lady Jill Biden did present President-elect Trump with a handwritten note congratulating Melania Trump and saying that her team stands ready to help in the transition in any way. But this This decision not to travel to the White House for this customary meeting just highlights another example of the unconventional approach that Melania Trump has often taken to this role of first lady.
 
Sources say that she's unlikely to move to the White House full time in her husband's second term in office.
 
Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House.
 
CHURCH: Tim Naftali is a CNN presidential historian and the former director of the Nixon Presidential Library. And he joins me now from New York. Appreciate you being with us. 
 
TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Pleasure, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: So, let's start with the shock and awe of President-elect Donald Trump selecting Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general, to head up the very department that investigated both of them. Even some Republicans are horrified. So, what impact could Gaetz potentially have on the DOJ if he is confirmed?
 
NAFTALI: Well, he could have an enormous impact. But I want to step back and remind viewers that Donald Trump promised that he would do this, not that he would name Matt Gaetz. But he made it clear that he was intent on launching a vendetta against the so-called enemies within, and those enemies weren't simply in the Justice Department, but he found -- he believed that many of them were there.
 
So, it makes perfect sense in his world that he chose an absolute loyalist to be -- as he put it, his Roy Cohn or his Bobby Kennedy. In other words, he wanted someone who would follow what he needed done, not what the law might suggest or practice might suggest is the appropriate approach. So, Matt Gaetz who's famous for being a shock jock on behalf of Trump in the House of Representatives.
 
And also infamous for a number of as yet unproved allegations surrounding his personal life. He was the person who fits the Trump mold. Indeed, what's been so interesting in the last day and a half is that we see a different mood, a different approach to Trump 2.0 so far than the first Trump administration. The storm when drawn, the energy, the chaos was coming from him from his words in the very beginning of his previous administration.
 
In this case, he's actually, first of all, less, available. And his words have been rather, temperate. And today he was very, congratulatory and supportive and appreciative of President Biden. It's his actions that are provocative. And creating a sense of storm and the actions are the appointments he's making.
 
CHURCH: And Tim, we're also hearing negative reaction to Trump's pick for Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, once a Democratic presidential candidate, but now a Republican. She previously questioned U.S. intelligence. So, would you expect Gabbard and these other controversial picks to get confirmed given Republicans now have control of the House as well as the Senate, but some Republicans not happy with some of these picks?
 
NAFTALI: Well, historically, presidents get their choices. It's very rare, that a -- that at the start of an administration, a president's appointee will be turned down by the Senate. It's interesting to note that President-elect Trump is assuming that his picks are going to have a rough time because he's talking about saying to the Senate don't even come into session. I'm just going to point assuming that his picks are going to have a rough time because he's talking about saying to the Senate, don't even come into session.
 <br>[02:10:08]
 
I'm just going to appoint these as recess appointments. Recess appointments in the American system are OK for acting, chiefs of departments, but they can only stay a certain amount of time and then they either have to be confirmed or replaced. The one point about Tulsi Gabbard that's worth mentioning is that she -- while she had served in the military, she was a civil affairs officer, she's never been a high-level intelligence officer, either in the military or on the civilian side.
 
And what she's noted for are unusual, to put it mildly, analyses of both the Syrian situation and generally Russia in the world. She is sympathetic, at least in the way she describes what Russia and Syria have been up to, seems to be sympathetic to their hardline leaders, and she has doubted the good officers and the good intentions of the United States government when Joe Biden was in the White House.
 
She has, in a sense, made Russia's argument that the U.S. goal isn't simply to defend Ukrainian sovereignty, but to actually destroy Russia's And, achieve regime change, which is not the U.S. position.
 
CHURCH: And earlier Wednesday, President Joe Biden and President-elect Trump met for a sit-down meeting at the White House. A tradition Trump refused to follow when he was the outgoing president. What stood out to you in this rare moment of a president welcoming back his predecessor who plans to pretty much completely overhaul the government?
 
NAFTALI: Rosemary, what stood out to me about the meeting between President-elect Trump and President Biden today was how normal it was. In fact, how boring. Sometimes boring is good, though because it restores a tradition that was unbroken until four years ago when there wasn't a peaceful transition of power. When the president who had lost an election, chose not to recognize the fact he had lost the election and tried to find a way to stay in office. At that point, President Trump did not meet with President-elect Biden. He did everything he could to obstruct the transition to a Biden administration. So, what we saw today was the way it's supposed to be. So, it was the -- it was the normal, normalness, if you will, of today. The fact that it stuck with tradition, that it seemed to live up to expectations of an earlier era, that made it so remarkable. It is something, isn't it? When the normal is remarkable?
 
CHURCH: It certainly is. Tim Naftali, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.
 
NAFTALI: My pleasure, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is reassuring allies that the Biden administration is doing all it can to support Ukraine before Donald Trump enters the White House. Blinken met with NATO's Secretary General in Brussels. He says the outgoing U.S. administration is working to ensure Ukraine gets the aid it has been promised so it can come to the negotiating table with Russia from a position of strength.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We've obligated just recently and pushed out the door. Another $8 billion in security assistance for Ukraine. That was in September, another almost half a billion dollars just a few weeks ago and President Biden is committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Blinken also met with his Ukrainian counterpart, who is urging allies to act quickly and decisively on aid because, "Ukraine's defense cannot be put on hold." Those meetings came after a series of blasts rocked Ukraine's capital Wednesday morning as Russia bombed Kyiv with Missiles from the first time -- for the first time since August. Ukraine says air defenses intercepted two cruise missiles and two ballistic missiles along with dozens of attack drones.
 
And one man in the Kyiv region was wounded by falling debris. Crowds of people sought shelter in the city's subways as sirens sounded. Residents fear a major attack could cripple Ukraine's damaged energy infrastructure even further ahead of winter. The country's foreign minister laid out the stakes to U.S. and European allies.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDRII SYBIHA,? MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF UKRAINE: There was another massive attack on our capital Kyiv, and other cities and communities. One more sleepless night for our children. 96 drones and missiles, including ballistic ones. Russians once again targeted innocent people, children, entire families while they slept peacefully in their homes. Ukraine's defense cannot be put on hold and wait.
 <br>[02:15:00] Every day, Russia is bombing our critical infrastructure, energy, sports, hospitals and schools. We need better protection for our Every day, Russia is bombing our critical infrastructure, energy, ports, hospitals, and schools. We need better protection for our people. Already now, not later.

CHURCH: Authorities in Brazil are investigating two explosions outside the Supreme Court as a suicide attack. CNN's Julia Vargas Jones has details.
 
JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The first explosion was a car bomb from a car parked not far from the Supreme Court building in Brasilia. The second explosion came from explosives tied to an attacker's body, police say. And we now know he actually tried to enter the Supreme Court building, wasn't able to and detonated the explosives on the steps right outside the front door.
 
Authorities are investigating this as a suicide attack, but they're not releasing further information on the suspect quite yet. But we are learning from both Agencia Brasil, a government-run news agency and CNN affiliate in Brazil, CNN Brazil, that the supposed attacker came from southern Brazil and in 2020, he had run for local office under former President Jair Bolsonaro's Partido Liberal, the Liberal Party.
 
Now, that information, CNN cannot independently verify. Now, the context of this attack is very important. This is the same location where, in January 8th, 2023, protesters, supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed both the Supreme Court, the Presidential Palace, and Congress violently. Hundreds of people were arrested then, and President -- former President Jair Bolsonaro is still in custody still being investigated for his potential role in the attacks.
 
Of course, this is also coming as Brazil readies to welcome world leaders ahead of the G20 in just five days.
 
Julia Vargas Jones, CNN, Los Angeles.
 
CHURCH: Still to come. Coastal Spain is once again struggling with torrential rain and severe flooding. After getting nearly a month's rainfall in one hour, we'll have details after the break. 
 
Plus, thousands of police officers deployed across Paris to prevent violence ahead of a soccer match between France and Israel. We'll tell you how officials are planning to stop anti-Semitic attacks.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: The Philippines government reports what is now Typhoon Usagi has made landfall across the northern tip of the islands. Heavy rains and winds of 175 kilometers per hour have been battering the area. The storm has weakened slightly since making landfall. This is the third typhoon to hit the north in just one week, but it won't be the last. A fourth storm further east over the Pacific is expected to strengthen to a typhoon in the coming hours and hit the Philippines sometime this weekend.
 <br>[02:20:03]
 
Nearly a month's worth of rain fell in one hour in Southern Spain on Wednesday. Severe thunderstorms and torrential rain battered the Malaga area. Nearly 3,000 people and 1,000 homes were evacuated and more rain is in the forecast. CNN's Pau Mosquera has more.
 
PAU MOSQUERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's been already two weeks since Valencia suffered the worst floods in the history of the region and it seems like Spain cannot catch a break from the torrential rains. Why is it so? Well, Spain's meteorological agency has informed of the arrival of a new cold drought to the peninsula, and it's bringing some heavy rains. This is why this agency has activated red alerts in some seaside regions, such as Malaga, in the south of the country.
 
There, the authorities have decided to preventively evacuate around 3,000 people that live on the banks of the Guadalorce River, given the risk of overflowing. Also, the authorities have decided to suspend all high-speed train connectivity between Malaga and Madrid because of these meteorological conditions. Even some neighbors are already informing the emergency service of local floods in towns or (INAUDIBLE) water is already flooding some basements and patios. A situation that is also happening in Tarragona in the east of the country.
 
There, the authorities are informing that it can accumulate up to 180 liters of water per square meter in just 12 hours. Potentially leading to also some local floods. This is why the regional government. The Generalitat de Catalunya is informing the population of those affected areas to remain the highest they can inside their homes in the second floors and avoid moving between towns before this meteorological phenomenon finishes by the end of the week.
 
Also, this Thursday, all the eyes will be fixed in Valencia as there are going to be red alerts for the region. And whatever it happens, many are hoping that it won't be as devastating as what happened two weeks ago.
 
Paul Mosquera, CNN, Madrid.
 
CHURCH: A new report by Human Rights Watch is shining a light on the displacement of the majority of civilians in Gaza as Israel's war against Hamas shows no sign of ending. The report says Israel's actions have intentionally led to the forced mass displacement which it described as a widespread and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime, a war Crime against humanity and ethnic cleansing.
 
The U.N. estimates 1.9 million people were displaced in Gaza as of last month. That's more than 90 percent of the population. According to the report, the majority of civilian infrastructure has been destroyed, leaving much of Gaza uninhabitable. Human Rights Watch says Israel's evacuation system has not just failed to keep Palestinians in Gaza safe, but instead put them in harm's way.
 
The Israeli military is denying accusations in the report, saying it's committed to international law and issues evacuation orders to protect civilians from combat. But here's how one displaced Palestinian describes the situation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
IHAB ZAARAB, DISPLACED PALESTINIAN (through translator): This is the Al-Mawasi area, which they told us was safe. They told us that from Salah al Din Street to the west, it is a safe area. And from Salah al Din Street to the east is not safe. But we discovered that there is no safe area in Gaza.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Israel's newly appointed defense minister says the country has expanded its military ground operation in southern Lebanon. Israel Council's comments come as Israeli airstrikes target what the military describes as Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Beirut.
 
Nearly 20 strikes were reported in that area on Tuesday and Wednesday. Meantime, Hezbollah says it carried out at least 20 attacks against Israel and its troops in Lebanon on Wednesday. Katz did not give any details on the move to expand operations but said this during his meeting with troops.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISRAEL KATZ, ISRAEL DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We will not make any ceasefires, and we will not stop, and we will not take our foot off the pedal, and we will not allow any arrangement that does not include achieving the goals of the war, which is disarming Hezbollah, withdrawing it from beyond the Latani River and creating the true conditions for the residents of the north to return to their homes safely.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Israel's offensive against Hezbollah has taken a heavy toll on civilians in Lebanon, including children. The Lebanese Health Ministry says airstrikes across the country have killed at least 20 children since Sunday. In total, more than 2600 people have been killed since Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah in mid-September.
 <br>[02:25:03]
 
Well, Paris is ramping up security in the city ahead of a soccer match between France and Israel on Thursday. It comes after violent clashes in Amsterdam last week between Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian supporters prompting a ban on public protests. Pro-Palestinian groups gathered in Paris on Wednesday to oppose a controversial pro-Israel gala by a far-right Israeli association. In the coming hours, thousands of officers will be deployed to ensure security in the city.
 
CNN's Melissa Bell has details from Paris.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: A huge police presence will be around the Stade de France here in Paris on Thursday to ensure that the planned match between Israel and France goes ahead as peacefully as possible. It had already been described as an event that was likely to attract tension, but the events of last week in Amsterdam which saw more than 70 people arrested after a night of violence against Israeli fans in the Dutch capital, has led to renewed fears that these kind of sporting fixtures can become lightning rods for pro-Palestinian support and possibly, as we saw in Amsterdam last week, tension and violence.
 
That's why French authorities are taking no chances. Four thousand policemen and women, but also more than a thousand stewards in the Stade de France. 20,000 tickets have been sold rather than the 80,000 that can normally be taken inside that stadium. And any pro-Palestine signs have been banned. The only signs that will be allowed are either Israeli or France flags. French authorities say that will be closely monitored.
 
We saw earlier this week a basketball match in Greece attended by a Tel Aviv side where the fans had displayed large free Palestine signs. That is the kind of expression of support that the French are keen to avoid this time. At the match, also on Thursday, will not only be the French president but two former presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. There, we understand to show their opposition to any form of anti-Semitism.

CHURCH: Fears are growing in some U.S. communities over a key Trump campaign promise, mass deportations on day one. Here from several Hispanic families who have different takes on his return to the White House.
 
Back with that and more in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Republicans will enjoy a unified government in Trump's new Washington after earning enough seats to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives. They captured the 218 seats needed to cross that threshold on Wednesday, even though a handful of races are still undecided.
 <br>[02:30:06]
 
Democrats are sitting at 208 seats, so Republicans will once again have an extremely narrow majority. Republicans flipped several Democratic Senate seats last week to win control of that chamber.
 
House Speaker Mike Johnson will likely keep his job after Trump endorsed him, no challenger has emerged, even though some members of the party's right wing have expressed frustration with his leadership. Johnson will face a floor vote on January 3rd. The Republican control of Congress means Trump will have little trouble pushing through his agenda, which is expected to include hardline immigration enforcement.
 
Already Trump has chosen two vocal immigration hardliners to join his second administration, Stephen Miller as a White House Senior Staff and Tom Homan as his Border Czar. Those moves send a clear signal that Trump appears intent on fulfilling his campaign promise of mass deportations. CNN's Rosa Flores has more on what this could mean for Hispanic families facing deportation, even those who supported the President-elect.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How many of you are U.S. citizens? How many of you support Donald Trump? You're undocumented and you support Donald Trump?
 
GELACIO VELAZQUEZ, UNDOCUMENTED TRUMP SUPPORTER:  I support Donald Trump for the economy.
 
FLORES (voice-over):  Two Hispanic families with mixed legal status in Houston with two different takes on President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. This is the Espinosa's first gathering since Trump's win.
 
FLORES:  How many of you fear that deportation could impact your family?
 
FLORES (voice-over):  Cesar Espinosa, a husband and father, was a DACA recipient until this summer when he got a green card. His sister and brother-in-law are DACA recipients. His sister-in-law is a green card holder, and the rest of his family here are U.S. citizens. Some who are not present are undocumented.
 
FLORES:  You're a green card holder; your wife is a U.S. citizen. Why are you afraid of deportation?
 
CESAR ESPINOSA, FEARS DEPORTATION UNDER TRUMP:  I just became a green card holder after 33 years of being in this country. I don't think people understand the fear. It's a constant shadow hanging over our heads.
 
FLORES:  What was your reaction to Donald Trump winning?
 
KARYANNA ESPINOSA, FEARS FAMILY MEMBERS COULD BE DEPORTED:  I cried a lot. It was -- it was emotional. Have my family, like if they're going to be here or they're not going to be here. And how do you tell all of our kids, like my nephews, they're also our kids.
 
C. ESPINOSA:  To tell people that this doesn't live in kids and children's mind and teenagers, in young adult's life is a lie.
 
FLORES (voice-over):  Gelacio Velazquez is an undocumented mechanic who has worked in Houston for 25 years.
 
VELAZQUEZ:  Oh.
 
FLORES (voice-over):  He plays in this park with his two U.S. citizen children, ages five and nine, and stands by Donald Trump.
 
FLORES:  So you support Donald Trump because of the economy?
 
VELAZQUEZ:  For the economy, yes.
 
FLORES:  But you don't support the anti-immigrant rhetoric?
 
VELAZQUEZ:  I'm not support of the anti-immigrant action.
 
FLORES:  Do you support his mass deportations?
 
VELAZQUEZ:  No. It is not human.
 
FLORES:  Are you afraid that you could be deported in this mass deportation?
 
VELAZQUEZ:  I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.
 
FLORES (Voice-over):  Espinosa runs a migrant advocacy group and says many people are afraid and have called him in tears.
 
C. ESPINOSA:  I think there's a heightened sense of fear.
 
FLORES:  Explain why Latino men are going to Trump.
 
VELAZQUEZ:  Democrats forget the promise when these guys are in the office in the Washington. The Latinos want a better nation.
 
FLORES (voice-over):  Espinosa believes some of the Latino support for Trump was a vote against the prospect of the first black female president.
 
C. ESPINOSA:  There's still a lot of machismo. There's still a lot of misogyny. And something that we need to say aloud is there's a lot of anti-blackness.
 
FLORES (voice-over):  Velazquez says he hopes Trump finds compassion for immigrant fathers like him who are not criminals.
 
FLORES:  If you get deported, would you regret your support to Donald Trump?
 
He's saying that he wouldn't regret supporting Donald Trump.
 
So, you're really not thinking about yourself. You're thinking about your children and the future of your children?
 
VELAZQUEZ:  Yes. I want the better for my children.
 
FLORES (voice-over):  Cesar says he feels guilty for bringing so much uncertainty to his family.
 
FLORES:  What's it like for you to see your wife go through this and the emotions that she's going through?
 
C. ESPINOSA:  I apologize to her a lot. We fell in love right away and we got married almost right away because when you know, you know.
 
FLORES (voice-over):  We asked Velazquez and Espinosa the same final question. FLORES:  Do you have a plan in case you get deported?
 
VELAZQUEZ:  I respect that decision. I leave the country. I'm not coming back.
 
C. ESPINOSA:  There is a plan. We've talked about it openly with our family.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
FLORES (voice-over):  Turns out these two Hispanic families with two different takes on Trump's win have the same plan if they get deported. They would go to Mexico as a family.

CHURCH:  World Leaders are gathering in Peru where the Annual APEC Summit is getting underway. But diplomats say much of the focus will be on one person who's not even there, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who pledged to slap tariffs on both friends and foes. The current U.S. president and his Chinese counterpart are said to arrive later on Thursday. Before holding their final meeting over the weekend, experts say Beijing smells opportunity in Trump's election victory, and it will try to divide the U.S. and its allies while presenting itself as a more stable alternative to Washington.
 
Well, for more, Marc Stewart joins us now live from Beijing. Good to see you, Marc. So, what can we expect to come out of this APEC Summit, especially with Trump looming so large over it?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Rosemary, good morning. On paper, the APEC Summit is supposed to be this economic forum with 21 different world leaders. But obviously, the changing tone of Washington with the incoming Trump Administration and its America-first agenda is certainly going to dominate conversations with many of these diplomats, as they try to figure out a new world when it comes to both politics, economics.
 
There are two conflicts going on, the Middle East and of course Ukraine, and how the Trump Administration is going to figure in on all of that. From where I am in Beijing, of course there is a lot of curiosity, a lot of interest in this meeting between Chinese Leader Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden. Really two things to look out for, number one, this meeting between the two leaders, China perhaps may be looking to symbolize to the world and to the incoming administration that it craves communication and stability because it wasn't that long ago that diplomats here in Beijing would spend many nights lying awake wondering what was next under the previous Trump Administration, during the first Trump Administration.
 
There's no question there have been some tense times between the Biden Administration and China. We saw some very frosty moments when the balloon was shot down. But over time, things did cool down and we have seen regular diplomatic conversation and visits from the United States and China. In fact, just this year, we have seen U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen come to China, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
 
These are the kind of discussions that Beijing would like to continue, but there's also a lot of concern that the tone and tenor may change if China critics such as Marco Rubio take office. So, the symbolism of this meeting will be significant. And then the other point to keep in consideration when it comes to China and the U.S., China will likely make a point, whether it be through speeches or through individual meetings, to let the world know that there is a heavy price to pay if you are heavily aligned with the United States and that it may be worth having a relationship with China, as China does try to establish itself as this alternative to the West.
 
It certainly is making some very visible moves. In recent months, we have learned of Visa0free travel for some European nations coming to China. We also have learned that China is going to resume trilateral discussions between Japan and South Korea. These are very visible signs as China tries to let the rest of the world know that it too can be a player. Rosemary, of course, a lot of attention on the incoming Trump Administration, not just by China. We're also expecting to see world leaders from Japan, Australia, as well as the Prime Minister of India.
 
CHURCH:  All right. Thanks to Marc Stewart, bringing us that live report from Beijing. And we'll be right back.

CHURCH:  However, the real cost after taxes and commission is about $4.8 million. The auction house says the unidentified buyer who put in her bid over the phone was ecstatic after acquiring the necklace. The piece contains 300 carats of diamonds and Sotheby's says it may have a very interesting history.

JESSICA WYNDHAM, SOTHEBY'S GENEVA:  It's likely or possible that some of these diamonds may have come from the famous diamond necklace that led to the downfall of Marie Antoinette. But, unfortunately we're unable to know it for sure, but it's the most spectacular jewel. I think it's one of the most exciting pieces that we've had for a long time, not only with the provenance, but the design. It's almost like a scarf, so you can wear it knotted up at the front or you can wear it open.
