ANNA COREN, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States, around the world and streaming on CNN Max. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong. Just ahead, same mission, opposite approaches. With just three days to go, we look at how the Biden and Trump teams are preparing their candidates for the CNN presidential debate.
 
One area of Russia is observing three days of mourning after deadly coordinated attacks on synagogues and churches.  
 
And tens of millions of Americans sweltering under extreme temperatures. We look at whether relief could be in sight from the heat dome. 
 
We are counting down to CNN's historic presidential debate. In just three days, a sitting U.S. president will debate his predecessor for the first time. This will also be the first major showdown between Joe Biden and Donald Trump since 2020. President Biden is at Camp David, hunkered down with his advisors preparing. He's looking at possible questions, holding mock debates and focusing on how best to frame Trump as unfit for office. 
 
In sharp contrast, his Republican rival shunned the traditional debate prep for the campaign trail over the weekend. And later today, he's expected to attend a fundraiser in New Orleans. Well, meanwhile, after spending months describing Biden as a mentally unfit leader, Trump and his surrogates are now suddenly talking him up. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DOUG BURGUM, GOVERNOR OF NORTH DAKOTA:  There has been a real effort on the Biden team to try to lower expectations, but I think we have to look at the guy's run for office more than a dozen times. He's run for president four times. He's been campaigning since President Nixon was in office. This guy has got the ability, and we've seen him in debate four years ago. We've seen him in the state of the union this year, that when he needs to, he can step up. But I think this is a real opportunity for CNN, most trusted name in
 
 news, to ask some tough questions, including, you know, because this is a rematch. And when we had this debate just before the election four years ago, Joe Biden looked into the camera and said, you know, that Hunter Biden's laptop was a smear campaign, Russian disinformation, called it garbage. 
 
And now we know that none of that is true. And I think this is an opportunity. I think America's waiting. I mean, CNN has got an opportunity to ask tough questions of both these candidates. 
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  Yeah, I think they're both safe to say they'll be tough questions for everybody. But it's interesting that you say Biden is lowering expectations because, I mean, Trump has also been doing that. You yourself have called Biden infirm. I mean, you have been setting the bar pretty low for President Biden. Is that a mistake? 
 
BURGUM:  Well, I don't know if it's a mistake or not. I mean, I think there's a -- I think America sort of looks at the state of the state. He stood up and he spoke strongly for over an hour. And then when we're with a group of governors with him back in February, we were limited to two questions, one Republican governor, one Democrat. Each got to ask a question, 40 governors. We had two questions with the president. 
 
Questions had to be submitted two days in advance. That's a far cry from standing in a debate for 90 minutes. So I think we're all anxious to see which Joe Biden is going to show up. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  The shift may hint at their possible concerns that they've set an unnecessarily low bar for the president's debate performance. Well, CNN's Kevin Liptak has details on Mr. Biden's debate strategy. 
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN REPORTER:  President Biden has now completed three days of debate prep out at Camp David, and we are getting some new insights into the Biden campaign's strategy heading into this week and heading into Thursday's debate in Atlanta. They've released a memo spelling out some of the things that they're doing to boost enthusiasm among their supporters ahead of this showdown. 
 
That includes 300 debate night watch parties and 1600 events in battleground states to try and ramp up energy around President Biden's appearance on that debate stage against President Trump. And I think this memo really lays clear the three most important items that President Biden will want to hammer home on that debate stage. 
 
One is the issue of abortion. And this is one that the Democrats really believe will be galvanizing for their supporters come November. President Biden really wants to lay at Donald Trump's feet the overturning of Roe versus Wade. 
 <br>[02:05:01] And in fact, on Monday, the Biden campaign plans 50 events around the anniversary of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that stripped the nationwide right to abortion, really trying to rally their supporters around this key issue. 
 
The second item on the debate stage that you're going to hear from President Biden is this idea of democracy and the threats that he believes Donald Trump poses to American democracy, threats of political violence. This, of course, has been an underpinning of the entire Biden campaign, and certainly he wants to hammer that point home on Thursday night. 
 
The third issue is the economy. The number one issue for many voters. President Biden wants to claim that Trump's record and agenda would only benefit the wealthy. Of course, this is a vulnerability for President Biden. Many Americans don't see the economy as improving, despite indicators that suggest the economy is doing well. It is something that he will have to talk about on the debate stage on Thursday night. 
 
Now, the other items that I think are likely to come up and that we heard from Biden's surrogates on Sunday is this idea of Trump as a convicted felon. We did hear from one key voice, Mitch Landrieu, who's a co-chair of the campaign. He talked about this idea of which Trump would show up on the debate stage. 
 
Would it be a restrained presidential Trump? Would it be a bombastic sort of ferocious Trump like we saw in 2020? Listen to what Mitch Landrieu said today. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MITCH LANDREAU, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, BIDEN CAMPAIGN:  It really doesn't matter how Donald Trump shows up. If he comes in unhinged like he is most of the time, or he sits there and is quiet, people are going to know that he's a twice impeached convicted felon who's been found to have defamed somebody, sexually abused somebody and gone bankrupt six times. They will always know that. And that is something that the American people have to think about. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIPTAK:  So you hear there a preview of sorts of what you might hear from President Biden on the debate stage when it comes to all of the legal issues that have been surrounding President Trump. This is certainly a major backdrop to this entire campaign and will be a major backdrop as well to this debate, this face off on Thursday night. Kevin Liptak, CNN, Washington. 
 
COREN:  Well, Ron Brownstein joins us now from Los Angeles. He is a CNN senior political analyst and senior editor at "The Atlantic." Ron, great to see you. This, of course, is a crucial moment for both men. What are you expecting from this rematch? 
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, you know, it's interesting because certainly we're going to hear each candidate try to focus the attention of the electorate on the issues that they think most advantage them. I mean, from Trump, it's certainly going to be inflation, immigration, crime. Biden, as you mentioned, is going to talk about abortion, democracy, an economic populist argument, a contrast with Trump. 
 
But, you know, I think the lesson of the history of our debates going back to 1960 is that there have been very few occasions where one side or the other, one candidate or the other has had a decisive win about a policy argument. I think the debates have been more consequential for the verdicts voters take from them about the personal capacity and character of the candidates. 
 
And I suspect that will be the key impact here again, with so many questions swirling in the electorate about the character of Trump and the capacity and capability of Biden.
 
COREN:  Well, let's talk about that, because the last time they were in the same room on stage together was the debate in October 2020. I mean, they share a mutual hatred and animosity for one another. The question, I guess, is, you know, Biden, he's 81. Will he be on his game? Will he be on the attack? Trump, 78. Will he be constrained or unhinged like we've seen in the past? 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Right. I mean, look, I think those are the most important questions about this debate, not who wins the argument about tax policy. I think that voters are going to be watching both to see whether Biden, you know, projects the energy, the vigor, the kind of wickedness (ph) that will give them more confidence than polls now show Americans have about his ability to do the job for another four years. 
 
And certainly Trump is at risk of validating what is going to be, I think, one of the core narratives and has been one of the core narratives for the Biden campaign, which is that if you re-elect him, you are signing up for four more years of chaos, confrontation and division. And Trump, as you noted in that first debate in 2020, seemed virtually unhinged and encapsulated, you know, in those couple hours that argument from the Biden campaign. 
 
So, I think how they say, you know -- how they say -- how they perform on Thursday is going to be as important as what they say and the arguments, they make against each other. 
 <br>[02:10:02]
 
These are very familiar figures. People have a lot of settled opinions about these two candidates. It's not like one is an unknown challenger, as we usually get in the debates. 
 
And so that's why I think kind of like the judgments that people make about each of them individually may be more important than the arguments they make against the other. 
 
COREN:  And Ron, I think what's also really interesting is how will the rules affect their performances? You know, like no live audience, no opening statements, two minutes to answer, one minute rebuttal. And then, of course, microphones can be muted or will be muted. Will this change the dynamics and perhaps the energy of the debate? 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  I think they will change the debate significantly. And I think of those, I mean, they're all important, but the microphones being muted seem to me have the potential to really affect the outcome of this debate. And to some extent, that protects Biden from Trump, but it also protects Trump from Trump, you know. 
 
I think Biden will have a better chance of delivering a coherent argument to voters if he is not constantly interrupted by Trump the way he was in that first debate in 2020. But the fact that voters, you know, at least as I understand the way the technology is going to work, you know, whatever Trump does, voters are not going to hear and see him constantly trying to interrupt. 
 
Biden may also make it easier for Trump to have, you know, deliver a better impression, because certainly that, you know, that 2020 kind of performance did not really endear himself to anyone except his hardcore supporters. You know, there's one other interesting contrast, I think. In many ways, Trump wants to look back and Biden wants to look forward. 
 
Trump clearly wants to frame this campaign and certainly this debate as, were you better off in my four years or his four years? You know, was life more affordable? Did the border seem more secure? Biden, I think, you know, has a hard time winning that argument, whether deservedly or not. Most Americans will say they were better off when Trump was president. 
 
But that doesn't mean that most Americans are necessarily on board with the agenda that Trump has laid out for a second term, including ideas like mass deportation and tariffs that could make inflation worse. And so Biden, in many ways, wants to get voters to focus on what Trump would do if returned to power. 
 
I think Trump wants to basically kind of imprint the argument that things were better than when I was president and if you re-elect me, they're going to be better again. 
 
COREN:  It's certainly going to be a fascinating debate. Ron, I have so many more questions I want to ask you, but unfortunately, we have to leave it there. I'll have to wait for our next interview. Ron Brownstein, great to see you. Thank you so much. 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Thanks for having me. 
 
COREN:  Tune in to watch the CNN presidential debate on Thursday, 9:00 p.m. Eastern, and we will replay the entire debate at 7:00 a.m. London time. It's 2:00 p.m. here in Hong Kong. 
 
Authorities in southwestern Russia's Dagestan province have declared three days of mourning after a series of attacks on churches and synagogues on Sunday. At least 15 police officers and a priest were killed in what appears to be coordinated attacks. But the total number of victims remains unclear. 
 
(VIDEO PLAYING) Well, here you can see heavily armed law enforcement officers taking on gunmen at a Russian Orthodox Church in Makhachkala. Well, this is the aftermath of an attack on a police traffic post in the same city. A synagogue was also attacked. 
 
Similar scenes in the city of Derbent. Authorities say a priest was killed during the assault on a church there. Molotov cocktails were used in an attack on a synagogue. So far, no claim of responsibility. But officials told Russian News that the perpetrators were, quote, "adherents of an international terrorist organization." Well, Dagestan is a predominantly Muslim province with a small Christian and even smaller Jewish minority. 
 
Well, senior international correspondent Ivan Watson joins us with more. Ivan, what more are we learning on what appears to be coordinated attacks? 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right. Well, Russia's National Anti-Terrorist Committee just announced that counterterrorism operations had been concluded in these two cities of Dagestan a little bit more than an hour ago, 8:15 a.m. local time. And in this statement announced by Russia's state TASS news agency, they say that armed militants attacked two synagogues and two churches, as well as police officers in these two cities, the region's capital, Makhachkala and Derbent, both of these cities on the banks of the Caspian Sea. And the violence began in the evening on Sunday. 
 <br>[02:14:54]
 
And it apparently was a very bloody night, with at least 15 law enforcement officers reported killed, as well as a Russian Orthodox priest, a 66-year-old man at the church in Derbent. And the authorities are also saying that at least six of the armed militants were killed in this.
 
Now, it seems that the synagogue in Derbent was burned. There have been reports that there had been extra security outside synagogues in Dagestan ever since late October of last year. That's when an angry mob overran the airport in Makhachkala. They were protesting against what they believe to have been the arrival of a flight from Israel. 
 
Some of the crowd there were carrying Palestinian flags, and they were chanting things like they didn't want Israeli refugees coming to Dagestan. And this was in the wake of the Hamas attacks in Israel and the ensuing bloodshed that has continued to this very day. All this just goes to say that Dagestan, a Russian republic in the Caucasus, has a long history of violence and political instability. 
 
It is next to Chechnya, which was the scene of horrific conflicts between Chechen separatists and the Russian government throughout the 1990s. And we've seen incidents and reports from state media of Russian law enforcement going after suspected ISIS militants in Dagestan. In March, ISIS claimed responsibility for an absolutely deadly terrorist attack on a concert hall outside of Moscow, the Crocus City Hall, where more than 140 people were killed. Very important in this instance in Dagestan, these coordinated,
 
 apparently coordinated attacks, there have yet to be any claims of responsibility. And we're waiting to hear more from Russian authorities and the Kremlin about who they think was behind these acts of violence, Anna. 
 
COREN:  Ivan Watson, we appreciate you keeping across this story for us. Many thanks. 
 
A Ukrainian strike in Russian-occupied Crimea left at least five people dead, including three children and more than 100 others wounded. Russia's Ministry of Defense says it shot down four missiles. Another missile exploded in the sky, scattering fragments over a busy beach in Sevastopol on Sunday. 
 
Russia says the Ukrainian fired missiles were supplied by the United States and blamed Washington for the attack. Witnesses say air raid sirens did not sound to warn of the attack. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for comment. 
 
Meanwhile, Russia's continued bombardment of Ukraine's second largest city has left another person dead and 12 others wounded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says strikes on Kharkiv on Sunday knocked out electricity in parts of the city, halting the subway. Officials say a home and a school were damaged in the attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SERHII ZHONYK, DEPUTY HEADMASTER:  They are barbarians. I don't know how else to call them. Why did they hit the school? I don't understand them. They are not human, not human. They want to spread panic among the people of Kharkiv, but this is in vain. They can see how the people of Kharkiv restore everything right after it is destroyed. We too will get down and restore the school tomorrow morning, ourselves and with all the help we can get. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Russian troops are inching closer to Kharkiv after an offensive near the border last month. Sunday's attack came one day after Russian-guided bombs killed at least three people and wounded dozens more. Mr. Zelensky repeated calls for more air defense support from his allies, saying, quote, "every day Kharkiv suffers from this Russian terror."
 
The Israeli Prime Minister is giving new details about his plans for the war in Gaza, what he's telling local media next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[02:20:00]
 
COREN:  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant is now in Washington, where he's set to discuss the war against Hamas with top U.S. officials this week. Among them, his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Gallant spoke about U.S.- Israeli relations before departing for the U.S.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translation):  The United States is our most important and central ally. Our ties are important and probably more important nowadays than ever.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  The White House said it's looking forward to constructive consultations with Gallant, while also saying it will not keep responding to claims by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. was delaying the shipments of weapons. U.S. officials last week called those claims not accurate and disappointing. 
 
Well, meantime, in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu says the intense phase of fighting in Gaza is, quote, "about to end" as the country looks to possibly shift some military power to its northern border. But the Israeli leader is making clear this doesn't mean the war against Hamas is over. CNN's Paula Hancocks has more details from Jerusalem. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given an interview to the Israeli TV Channel 14, and he's really given some more clarity on the war in Gaza and his plans for its future. Now, he said within this interview that the intense phase of the war is about to end, also saying that he's vowing to shift the power to the north, meaning northern Israel on the border with Lebanon. There have been increasing cross-border attacks with Hezbollah over recent weeks.
 <br>[02:24:58] 
 
Now, he also pointed out that this doesn't mean that the war will come to an end. He is saying that the current phase of fighting in Rafah will come to an end. He also said that he was ready for a partial deal with Hamas. This is about the ceasefire hostage deal, which is on the table at the moment, but has really been in limbo in recent days. He says, though, that he is willing to agree to a partial deal. He wants to get some of the hostages back. 
 
But he also said that he will continue after the ceasefire to try and achieve his goal of eliminating Hamas. Now, of course, this may well be problematic for Hamas. We have heard consistently from Hamas officials that they want a specific timeline for a permanent ceasefire for this war. So it may even make it more difficult for the two sides to come to any kind of agreement now on this ceasefire hostage deal, which I must add has been stalled somewhat over recent days. 
 
He also pointed out he wants to bring people back to the north, meaning tens of thousands of residents who have been evacuated due to the tension up north. And he said that he would like a political agreement. That would be great. But if it's not possible, we will do it another way. Now, of course, on the Lebanese side as well, there are also tens of thousands of residents that have had to be evacuated. So this interview really giving a little more clarity on where the Israeli prime minister is and what he plans for the coming potential days, weeks. There is no timeline when it comes to these clarifications. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Jerusalem. 
 
COREN:  A Greek-owned cargo carrier was struck by Iran backed Houthis on Sunday. U.S. Central Command says the vessel was making its way to Egypt when it was hit by an uncrewed aerial system. The crew reported minor injuries and moderate damage to the carrier. This is the fourth time the vessel has been targeted by the Houthis. 
 
Still to come, the death toll soars during this year's Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Authorities saying too many people just weren't prepared for the extreme heat they would endure.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:31:17]
 
ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome back. 
 
In the U.S., millions of people are still experiencing a record breaking heat wave. The scorching heat is now moving south after baking the Northeast over the weekend. High temperatures are expected in much of the region this week.
 
CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIT:  A stormy Sunday in New England and in the Mid-Atlantic does come with some relief from the heat. Look at these temperatures, taking a back seat with highs and low 80s from Boston, New York, 89 degrees in Washington, D.C. after they had sweltering heat or weekend. 
 
But notice, we still have a piece of the heat dome sitting back in the Central Plains, with temperature still in the middle and upper 90s, going for 99 degrees in Oklahoma City. But like I mentioned, Washington, D.C., one of the places that get a little bit of a break after you guys hit 100 degrees on Saturday for the first time since 2016, more than 2,000 days, so definitely not the type of extreme heat that we see in the Mid-Atlantic especially not in June. 
 
Here's a look at some of that relief again, kind of briefly on Monday from Richmond to Washington, D.C. Temperatures, upper 80s and low 90s at three degrees on Monday and Philadelphia, 81 in New York. But notice how these highs back in the middle and upper 90s do start to creep in again as we get back into the middle of the week because we still have this heat dome that's sitting nearby. It just kind of gets nudged a little bit all about front came through just for about a day or so, but then that heat starts to settle in again for more than 78 percent of the lower 48. That's 250 million the only people again, with these temperatures at 90 degrees or hotter as we get into the work week. 
 
In fact, were looking at more than 300 records bold daytime highs, and overnight lows, bowling as we go through the next couple of days to this heat just continues to swelter. So we're looking at temperatures up in the upper 90s, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, in Atlanta, St. Louis, middle and upper 90s as well. Dallas temperatures that 99 degrees on Tuesday, you could see dc getting back in some of that heat as we get into the middle of the week, 96 degrees by Wednesday. 
 
So that keeps the heat risk moderate at major, and extreme in some locations, this means that we really need to pay close attention for those signs and symptoms on heat sickness, check on kids, elderly and paths, make sure everybody is trying to stay cool and hydrated.

COREN:  Saudi Arabia says more than 1,300 people have died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage as temperatures at times peaked above 50 degrees Celsius or 122 Fahrenheit. It says most of those who died were on authorized to perform the trip and walked long distances in the scorching sun. 
 
CNN Scott McLean has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's been clear for several days now that the official death toll from this years Hajj would likely rise. And now we know by precisely how much the Saudi Arabian government says the more than 1,300 people died at this year here's pilgrimage, at least in part due to the extreme heat. It says that almost half 1 million people received some form of medical attention. Some are still hospitalized. 
 
It also says that all of the families of the 1,301 victims have been notified despite serious challenges in identifying all of the bodies. On Monday, the mercury ahead almost 52 degrees Celsius, 125 degrees Fahrenheit, and what you have to remember is that almost everything at the Hajj is outdoors. And it involves some physicality, walking some distances between or two some of the various sites.
 
And pilgrims that we spoke to describe, really seeing two categories of pilgrims.
 <br>[02:35:03]
 
One, the official kind, the kind that came with a Hajj visa that had proper transportation options and air conditioned accommodations. And then you had this unregistered kind of pilgrim that maybe came on a tourist visa or a business visa to Saudi Arabia, didn't have proper transportation and didn't have access to the proper accommodation. In fact, some people were setting up these makeshift tent encampments to try to get under any shape that they possibly could. 
 
And the Saudis say that some 83 percent of all of the pilgrims who died were in that latter category. Now, countries like Egypt are cracking down on tour companies that may have helped facilitate these unofficial travel routes we have also heard from the daughter of an American couple who paid more than $20,000 to a travel company to attend this year is Hajj only to find out that that company could not provide the proper transportation and she says that on the day that her parents died, they reported waiting several hours for transportation that never came. 
 
So they ended up walking along distance to one of the sites they went missing and were later confirmed dead. And then to add insult to injury, she says that she had asked the Saudi government to hold the bodies for identification, but it turns out they had already been buried and now her and her family are not sure where they were buried.

The woman told staff she was out for morning, jog an accidentally entered the safaris zone where the animals roam freely. She was attacked as she attempted to run away, sustaining serious injuries. French news outlet TF1 reports that she's stabilized at hospital now.
 
Well, six climate activists are charged with criminal mischief and trespassing after they stormed the 18th grain of the PGA Tour's Travelers Championship in Connecticut on Sunday. They appeared to wave at smoke bombs which left red and white powder on the grain this is the tournament leaders, including world number one Scottie Scheffler were getting ready to putt. 
 
The protesters were quickly arrested. Some were wearing shirts that read "No golf on a dead planet". The group Extinction Rebellion has claimed responsibility.

COREN:  Welcome back to our viewers in North America. I'm Anna Coren in Hong Kong. 
 
We are just three days away from the CNN presidential debate, where President Biden is in intense preparations with advisors, former President Trump spent the weekend on the campaign trail. 
 
Both candidates are sharpening their attacks on each other while the Biden campaign is planning to intensify its attempts of portraying Trump is an unhinged criminal, Donald Trump mocked Mr. Biden for going to a, quote, log cabin to study, prepare.
 
The new debate rules mandate microphones will be muted except when its the candidates turn to speak. And there will be no studio audience. The debate will give millions of voters a chance to assess the energy, endurance, and sharpness of the two candidates.
 
Well, meantime, there are concerns in the Democratic circles at the Israel-Hamas conflict could hurt President Biden's reelection prospects and it's not just because of flagging Arab-American support. Some experts worry that the support of Jewish voters may be diminishing as well. 
 
CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  The ongoing turmoil set off by the October 7th attack by Hamas and Israel's bloody war launched in response is becoming yet another weight on President Joe Biden's reelection, with warning signs flashing over Jewish voters support for the president.
 
For all the attention over how the Israel-Hamas war has endangered Biden standing with Arab Americans and progressives who taken up the cause of Palestinians in key states, Jewish-Americans who make up enough of the population to be determined in tight battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona have been scrambled, too. 
 
That's all the feelings brought up by the conflict, but also the pain over the surge at antisemitic incidents and rhetoric, particularly on the left in recent months. 
 
Josh Shapiro, the governor of key battleground state Pennsylvania, and an observant Jew himself, told me: From Pharaoh to Hitler, to Kim Jong-un, at what point in our history when a dictator has been leading a nation has a minority group done well? Donald Trump will eviscerate the rights of minority groups, including American Jews. Doug Emhoff, who's Vice President Kamala Harris is husband and also Jewish, has been taking a lead on this, too, calling Donald Trump a known antisemite now, Biden and Donald Trump have very different records on Israel and condemning antisemitism with Biden spending a lot of time on both over his years in politics. But Republicans are looking to play into the anxieties with operatives telling me they planned to campaign on the idea that Biden's presidency has led to Jews in America being less safe and more Israelis being killed.

CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The Council on American-Islamic relations says that this family was Muslim and it's why they believe this could have been racially motivated, and its also why they're calling for this to be investigated as a hate crime. 
 
Now authorities say this all happened back in May 19 when they were called to an apartment complex pool in Euless, Texas, they were called for a disturbance between two women and attempted drowning. And authorities say when they initially arrived to the scene, they arrested Elizabeth Wolf for public intoxication. And once they began that investigation, they spoke to the mother of the victim who told them that Wolff had asked her where she was from an asked if those were her children. 
 
Once she answered that question, that mother says that Wolf grabbed her six-year-old son. Here is how the executive director of the council's Dallas-Fort Worth chapter is describing it.
 
MUSTAFAA CARROLL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS, TEXAS:  According to the mother, the six-year-old son was able to escape, but her petite three-year-old daughter was unable. The alleged attacker snatched off the mothers head scarf and used it to beat the other way, as well as kicking her to keep her away from forcing her child he had underwater. 
 
Now that mother also telling police that her child was yelling for help, that her child was coughing up water, but thankfully, she was able to pull her child's out of the water.

Both children were evaluated medically and authorities saying they are okay. The mother also telling police that Wolf made racial statements and made statements about her not being American. 
 
Now, Wolf was charged with attempted capital murder. The bail was set for $25,000. She was also charged with injury to a child that bail was set at $15,000. 
 
She posted bail and it's why the council is now asking for a higher bail. It's why they're asking for this to be investigated as a hate crime, and there also asking for the safety and security of the Muslim community overall.
