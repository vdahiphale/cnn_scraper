UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Kim Brunhuber. 
 
BRUNHUBER: U.S. Democratic senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey is angrily rejecting calls to resign after federal corruption charges. It's the second time since 2015 that Menendez has faced federal criminal charges. 
 
Menendez remained defiant as calls for his resignation multiplied on Friday, saying, quote, "It's not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat. I'm not going anywhere." 
 
Many of those calling for him to step down are members of his own party, including New Jersey's governor, who said, quote, "The alleged facts are so serious that they compromise the ability of him to effectively represent the people of our state." 
 
The speaker of the New Jersey general assembly said, quote, "We are given the public's trust. Once that trust is broken, we cannot continue." 
 
CNN's Kara Scannell has more on the investigation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Some of the cash was stuffed in the senator's jacket pockets.
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Indicted again, New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez facing corruption related charges for the second time in 10 years. 
 
Prosecutors announcing a three-count federal indictment against the Democratic senator and his wife over their dealings with three New Jersey associates and businessmen starting in at least 2018.
 
WILLIAMS: The senator and his wife accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes, in exchange for Senator Menendez using his power and influence to protect and to enrich those businessmen.
 
SCANNELL (voice-over): The alleged bribes include more than $550,000.00 in cash hidden in the senator's home and safe deposit box, a Mercedes-Benz convertible and gold bars worth tens of thousands of dollars, among other things.
 
The indictment also alleges the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair, quote, "provided sensitive US government information and took other steps that secretly aided the government of Egypt."
 
WILLIAMS: Behind-the-scenes, Senator Menendez was doing those things for certain people, the people who were bribing him and his wife.
 
SCANNELL (voice-over): The senator issued a defiant statement in response to the U.S. attorney's latest allegations. 
 
"I have been falsely accused before because I refused to back down to the powers that be. And the people of New Jersey were able to see through the smoke and mirrors and recognize I was innocent."
 
Menendez has long maintained his innocence in this latest probe into his dealings telling CNN back in April --
 
SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): This inquiry will end up, I believe, in absolutely nothing.
 
SCANNELL (voice-over): The senator faced similar corruption charges in 2015. He fought off conspiracy, bribery and other fraud charges related to political favors.
 
MENENDEZ: To those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I won't forget you.
 
SCANNELL (voice-over): That case ended in a mistrial, a partial acquittal and all charges against the senator being dropped. In this latest case, Menendez remains defiant, saying he won't be "distracted by baseless accusations." SCANNELL: A lawyer for the senator's wife said that she denies any wrongdoing. All five defendants are due in court Wednesday to face these charges. This comes as there is a growing call by a number of New Jersey lawmakers for the senator to resign -- Kara Scannell, CNN, New York.

BRUNHUBER: Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer tells CNN his chamber may try to push through a bipartisan bill to fund the government as chaos rules in the Republican-led house. 
 
With the U.S. a little over a week away from a government shutdown, Schumer says he's trying to cut a spending deal with Mitch McConnell. 
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
BRUNHUBER: This as he says Kevin McCarthy says he'll try to pass a series of yearlong funding bills next week, even though it usually takes months to hash out differences on spending legislation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: Think we've made some progress, those who have been the holdup passing the rule to get on to these bills. We want to do it individually rule but we could do a minibus rule. The rules are going to go in today. 
 
We've got members working. And will be able to move forward on Tuesday to pass these bills. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: CNN's Melanie Zanona has more details from Capitol Hill. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lawmakers have left Washington for the weekend without a clear plan to avoid a government shutdown. This after conservative hardliners once again scuttled Kevin McCarthy's plans. 
 
Initially, the House GOP was planning to vote on a stopgap measure to fund the government and included a number of conservative priorities. But McCarthy had to reverse course once he realized that he did not have the votes to move forward. 
 
Now they do have a new plan that they're trying to pursue next week. A number of McCarthy's allies outlined that strategy with reporters in the capital on Friday. Their plan, as of right now, is to try to pass individual, long term spending bills, as many as they can. 
 
And the hope there is that they could get some more conservative hardliners on board with a short-term plan to avoid a government shutdown. But the challenge with that plan is that all of those bills are dead
 
 on arrival in the Senate, something that Kevin McCarthy has warned members would not work in their favor if they're not able to pass anything in order to have leverage. 
 
And furthermore, over on the Senate side, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has now taken steps to advance his own short-term funding bill, something that's likely to include Ukraine aid and disaster money. 
 
So that could really tee up a showdown with the House. Let's take a listen to what Schumer said to our Manu Raju about working with Mitch McConnell on a bipartisan plan. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You're building on an agreement with Leader McConnell to put Ukraine in a continuing resolution?
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER: He, McConnell and I, are both strongly for aid for Ukraine and I believe the majority of members of both parties in the Senate agree with that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZANONA: So McCarthy is likely going to have a decision to make. He can either ignore that bill from the Senate and risk a government shutdown or he can put that bill on the floor and risk a threat to his speakership because hardliners have warned, they are willing to oust him if he works with Democrats -- Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.

BRUNHUBER: The United Auto Workers' strike is now in its second week. And if you're needing car repairs, you could soon be out of luck. The strike has now been expanded to include 38 parts and distribution centers in 20 states belong to General Motors and Stellantis. 
 
This move is likely to hit dealerships hard and limit their ability to service vehicles. The union said it won't expand its strike at Ford facilities, noting extreme improvements in negotiations with that company. 
 
President Biden, who has been criticized for not showing enough support for the union workers, said he will go and join the picket lines. 
 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will travel to the Rio Grande Valley and Texas in the hours ahead. The state has seen a surge of migrants at the U.S. border over the last few days. Many of those people have arrived in cities like El Paso and Eagle Pass. 
 
Republican governor Greg Abbott is sending buses to the two cities to help authorities deal with the influx, which he blames on President Biden. Priscilla Alvarez has more on Biden's efforts to handle the crisis. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden is again contending with an increasing number of crossings at the U.S.- Mexico border. Homeland Security officials tell me that, over the course of last few days, border authorities arrested more than 8,000 migrants each day. 
 
That compared to late May, when those daily encounters were around 3,500, numbers that held over the course of the summer. Homeland Security officials couldn't quite say what had led to this latest surge. 
 
But they pointed to poor economic conditions as well as the climate crisis in Latin America as drivers of migration. 
 
Now the administration announced this week that they would send 800 new active duty military personnel to the U.S.-Mexico border to serve in a supporting role, something they've done before, as well as add capacity to border facilities to accommodate those who are crossing as they are processed through those facilities. 
 
But what the images this week showed is that this remains a logistical humanitarian and political challenge for this administration. The handling of the U.S.-Mexico border has been a delicate political issue for President Biden, as Republicans continue to hammer him over the issue. 
 
And Democrats also raise concerns over the images on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the administration also had a major announcement this week, when they said that nearly half a million Venezuelans already in the United States would be eligible for work permits under what's known as temporary protected status. 
 
That was a move that addressed major stress point with New York, which has been seeing an influx of migrant arrivals as well. 
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
ALVAREZ: So all of this taken together, again, underscoring the issues and challenges this administration still faces on immigration more than two years later -- Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: And just to note, later this hour, we'll take you to the border town now synonymous with the crisis and we'll look at what's behind the surge and how the city is responding. 
 
The migrant crisis is also dividing leaders in Europe, who are grappling with how to handle tens of thousands of migrants fleeing parts of Africa. The plight of migrants has been a main focus for Pope Francis, who's wrapping up a two-day visit to Marseille, France. 
 
He's visiting with French President Emmanuel Macron soon. On Friday, the pontiff told reporters that the treatment of migrants arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa i, quote, "cruel and lacking in humanity." CNN's John Allen joins me now from Rome. 
 
So John, the pope again getting involved in the controversial issue of migration, in an issue dear to him, of course. Take us through his meeting with Macron, who isn't exactly a radical liberal on the issue. 
 
JOHN ALLEN, CNN SR. VATICAN ANALYST: No, in fact, Kim, I think we need to take a moment to reflect on the fact that we are going to be witnessing a grand historical irony today. 
 
Traditionally, when a French president meets the pope, politically speaking, that's considered an effort to reach out to the Right in France. That is, to cultural conservatives. Today, however and many observers believe that Macron hopes this meeting is going to help him on the French Left. 
 
That is, he will be meeting with the world's leading champion of the rights and the human dignity of migrants and refugees at a time when his own government is taking an increasingly hardline position on the issue. 
 
Yesterday, in Marseille, we heard Pope Francis talk about the Mediterranean Sea as a huge cemetery. That's a reference to the estimated 20,000 migrants and refugees who have died, trying to make that crossing since 2014. 
 
We also heard him condemn the fanaticism of indifference. And today, we are expecting the pope to use even stronger language on the migrant question. Now what difference that is going to make to Macron's policies remains to be seen. 
 
But it is clear that the conversation between these two men today, Kim, is going to be robust and probably a bit challenging. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right. And obviously, it's a polarizing issue. France said it would bolster its borders with Italy, wouldn't take in any Lampedusa migrants. 
 
So how is the pope's message being received broadly in France?
 
ALLEN: Well, I think in general, people know that, when Pope Francis comes, he is going to speak in defense of migrants and refugees. That has been one of the cornerstones of his political agenda over the last 10 years. 
 
His first trip outside of Italy was to the island of Lampedusa, where he laid a wreath in the sea to commemorate those who have died. So I think it's no surprise to anyone he's pushing this message. 
 
As you indicate, it's a tremendously divisive issue, not just in France but all across Europe. And so far, the pope's efforts to promote this policy of welcome and of incorporation of migrants and refugees hasn't done much to stem a strong anti-migrant tide across Europe. Whether today, he is going to turn a corner, remains to be seen. But
 
 at least, it is clear, I think, to all observers that Macron is going to hear today a challenge from the world's probably preeminent moral voice on this question. 
 
And he'll hear a message that will not sit entirely comfortably with the policies that his own government is pursuing, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes, exactly. We'll be following this visit throughout the coming hours. John Allen in Rome, thank you so much, for us, appreciate it. 
 
Tropical storm Ophelia is just off the coast of North Carolina and is expected to make landfall in the coming hours. It is almost at hurricane strength and it's already bringing storm surge, flash flooding and winds to North Carolina and Virginia. 
 
Parts of North Carolina are under a hurricane watch and significant impacts are expected in both states. More than 38,000 customers are without power in North Carolina and Virginia. 
 
Severe weather is also forecasted in Maryland and Delaware. Maryland's governor has declared a state of emergency. Saturday's game in Washington between the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals has been postponed because of the storm. 
 
Now Ophelia is expected to deliver heavy rain across much of the mid- Atlantic, continuing through the weekend. 
 
All right, still ahead, a standing ovation for Ukraine's president in the Canadian parliament. Volodymyr Zelenskyy wins a pledge of more support in Ukraine's war against Russia's aggression. We'll have more details on that coming up. 
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
BRUNHUBER: Plus, we're less than four hours away from the opening ceremony of the first Asian Games ever. China is showing that it's open for business after the pandemic. We'll have a live report from Zhengzhou. 
 
Later, we will take a look at Colorado head coach Deion Sanders, who's shaking up the college football world. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: Ukraine is disputing Russia's account of a missile strike on its naval headquarters in Crimea. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER (voice-over): Russia said only one soldier is missing after Ukraine hit its Black Sea fleet headquarters on Friday. But Ukraine special operations forces now say dozens of people were killed or wounded, including some senior leaders of the Black Sea fleet. 
 
The statement didn't provide any evidence for the claim. Meanwhile, Kyiv says Russian drones and artillery pummeled parts of southern and central Ukraine overnight. The attacks killed one person and wounded three others in the Kherson region. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Friday's strike on Crimea came on the heels of multiple attacks on Russian targets there. Those strikes may be far behind the front lines. But a top Ukrainian general told CNN in an exclusive interview that it will still help --
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
BRUNHUBER: -- Ukraine's ongoing counteroffensive because they degrade Russia's equipment and its chain of command. Matthew Chance has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine's latest spectacular strike on-occupied Crimea, caught on camera by passersby.
 
Smoke is billowing from the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet, an edifice of Russian power on the peninsula, smoldering and in ruins. This Russian state media images show blown out windows and a collapsed roof. Russia says that five missiles were intercepted. There is no denying that others punched through.
 
"Explosions, explosions, right here in the center of the city," says the woman recording this aftermath. She seems shocked but not surprised.
 
For weeks now, Ukraine has been stepping up strikes on targets in Crimea, like this hit on a military shipyard earlier this month, badly damaging the Russian surface vessel and a submarine, being repaired in a dry dock.
 
Ukraine has also been degrading Russian air defenses, destroying at least two sophisticated S-400 systems placed in Crimea, another setback for Russian forces.
 
At sea, naval drones have targeted Russian shipping.
 
And Ukrainian Special Forces have seized control of strategic Black Sea oil and gas drilling platforms. Crimea, annexed by Russia back in 2014, now appears firmly in Ukraine's sights -- Matthew Chance, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: And Salma Abdelaziz has been following developments in Ukraine. She joins us now from London. So Salma, let's start with that attack on the Black Sea fleet
 
 headquarters, a significant development. Still so much that we don't know. 
 
What more are we learning?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So we do have a statement this morning, Kim, from Ukraine's Special Forces. It says that dozens of Russian soldiers were killed in that strike on the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet. 
 
It goes on to say, in that statement, that the timing of the strike was significant, apparently taking place, again, according to Ukrainian officials, during a high-level meeting. 
 
And that that led to several members, several senior members, leadership members of the Black Sea fleet, being among those killed or wounded. Again, important to remember here that Ukraine have provided no evidence of this claim. 
 
And Russia, of course, disputes it. As you mentioned, the Russian official line to date is that only one Russian soldier is missing. And they do admit that this headquarters has been struck. 
 
But regardless of what the outcome of this specific strike is, as you heard there from our Matthew Chance, Crimea, this Russian occupied peninsula, has been very much in the crosshairs of Ukrainian attacks. 
 
And in recent weeks and months, as its long range capabilities, Ukraine's military long-range capabilities have increased, it has left those Russian forces on that peninsula ever more vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes like this one. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Salma, you're talking about the long range capabilities. The threats to invading Russian troops could grow even further now with reports that President Biden could finally send those long-range missiles that Ukraine's been asking for. 
 
ABDELAZIZ: Yes, so we're speaking here of the Army Tactical Missile Systems also known as ATACMS for short. These have long been a request from Zelenskyy. They do have a range of nearly 190 miles. That's much further than the furthest range that Ukraine has now, which is the Storm Shadow missiles from the U.K. 
 
Those have a range of about 155 miles. And again, it's all about that vulnerability that Russian troops would feel deep in Russian occupied regions. 
 
The ability to strike at the heart of Russian command and control centers almost 200 miles away from the front lines would deeply complicate the Kremlin's fight, deeply complicate the ability to supply and provide its troops on those front lines. 
 
Now what we know so far?
 
Again, this has followed the pattern that we've seen over and over again, Kim, with requests for any weapons from President Zelenskyy. First, you have this initial resistance from Washington. Think the F- 16s, the tanks, the HIMARS. And then there's months and months of lobbying that eventually leads to a shift in strategy. 
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
ABDELAZIZ: And that appears to be what's happening here. We're expecting that President Biden is going to make a statement anytime, anytime soon on this. And those could be provided. 
 
But the important thing to remember here, Kim, is that throughout this conflict, there's been one weapon after another that Ukraine has wanted. But there is no magic bullet here. There's no magic missile system here that's going to suddenly change the tide. 
 
This is all about building, building, building as the days of this counteroffensive are really numbered because of the upcoming winter. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes, good point. Salma Abdelaziz in London, thanks so much. 
 
Ukraine's president is thanking Canada for its ongoing support in the war. Zelenskyy and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau signed an updated free trade agreement aimed at rebuilding Ukraine. 
 
Trudeau says Canada will support Kyiv for, quote, "as long as it takes, providing long term support instead of a piecemeal approach." 
 
Zelenskyy says he's grateful for Canada's decision to train F-16 fighter jet pilots. Plus, a military aid package worth nearly $0.5 billion and funding for mental health services in Ukraine. He delivered an impassioned speech before Canadian parliament. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: It is genocide what Russian occupiers are doing to Ukraine. And when we want to win, when we call on the world to support us, it is not just about an ordinary conflict; it is about saving lives of millions of people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is touting a potential deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia. His remarks came Friday at the United Nations General Assembly. Saudi Arabia, like many Arab states, doesn't currently recognize Israel. 
 
Netanyahu says such an agreement could create, quote, "a new Middle East." Here he is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: For centuries, my country was repeatedly invaded by empires passing through it in their campaigns of plunder and conquest elsewhere. But today, today as we tear down the walls of enmity, Israel can
 
 become a bridge of peace and prosperity between these continents. Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia will truly create a new Middle East. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: The Israeli prime minister also said Palestinians shouldn't have veto power over new agreements with Arab states. 
 
On Thursday, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas warned against sidelining Palestinians in any potential deal. 
 
Haiti's acting president has delivered an urgent request at the United Nations General Assembly to strengthen the country's security. Friday, Ariel Henry asked the U.N. to authorize a multinational support mission to the country. He's requesting police and military forces to help combat gangs and restore peace and order to the country. 
 
Waves of crime and unrest have rocked Haiti since the nation's former president Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021.

BRUNHUBER (voice-over): All right, still ahead, a new surge of migrants at the U.S. southern border. We'll give you a close-up look at the humanitarian crisis when we come back. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
The migrant crisis at the U.S. southern border is escalating. In just 24 hours this week, nearly 9,000 migrants crossed the Rio Grande and passed through razor wire to enter the United States. 
 
On Friday, Texas governor Greg Abbott announced he is sending buses to the border cities of Eagle Pass and El Paso. The Republican governor says the buses will take the migrants to other cities and help border communities that are, in his words, "overwhelmed and overrun by President Joe Biden's border crisis." 
 
For a closeup look at the human toll of the migrant crisis, we turn to CNN's Ed Lavandera.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A small group of migrants scour the riverbank, searching for a safe place to slip through razor wire. Their final obstacle in a months-long journey to reach U.S. soil.
 
A man carries a young boy on his shoulders, leading a line of migrants crossing the Rio Grande.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language).
 
LAVANDERA: He said, "We faint, we passed out, this is crazy but, thank God, we are here."
 
Jorge Carrillo (ph) of Venezuela holds his 3-year-old child, telling me his family walked through three months in Mexico before crossing the river.
 
He said, "We cross illegally because of our children; can't take it anymore, they can't handle it anymore."
 
Eagle Pass, Texas, has been a flashpoint for U.S. border crisis, with no end in sight. For several days, thousands of people have turned themselves in to U.S. authorities. But on this day, the scene is dramatically different. Only a small number of migrants have crossed the river.
 
MAYOR ROLANDO SALINAS (D-TX), EAGLE PASS: People are frustrated, they are angry. This is not normal.
 
LAVANDERA: Eagle Pass mayor Rolando Salinas says city resources are strapped and claims that most of the migrants are processed and released. Many go to large cities...
 
CURTIS SLIWA, FORMER NYC MAYORAL CANDIDATE: We don't know where they are from, what their names are.
 
LAVANDERA: -- where they are increasingly met with resistance and dwindling resources.
 
SALINAS: So imagine Eagle Pass, a place of a town of 28,000 people, with limited resources. 
 
What are we supposed to do?
 
Fend for ourselves?
 
We can't.
 
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): With Joe Biden interfering with my efforts to secure the actual border.
 
LAVANDERA: Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott has gone on the political offensive, blaming the Biden administration for the crisis. Abbott is positioning his state as the only ones stepping up, posting a video on social media of state authorities standing in front of a migrant group.
 
The governor writing, "We are repelling illegal immigrants at the border," and reposting this video, writing, "We are refusing to let migrants in and sending them back." But the migrants in that video were not repelled from the border. We watched as they all eventually helped each other crawl underneath the razor wire and turn themselves in to state authorities and Border Patrol agents.
 
JESSE FUENTES, KAYAK COMPANY OWNER: I am frustrated with everybody, with everybody, because, for me, it's about the river. 
 
LAVANDERA: Jesse Fuentes runs a kayak company on the Rio Grande and is suing Abbott for altering the river and hurting his business.
 
FUENTES: All these barriers, have they stopped them?
 
Have they stopped them?
 
No, sir. They haven't. Until the problem is addressed, these people are coming over here for the American dream.
 
LAVANDERA: Local officials in border communities like Eagle Pass fear this latest migrant search is far from over. 
 
The mayor of Eagle Pass says federal authorities had told him 50,000 to 60,000 migrants --
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): -- are starting to make their way through southern Mexico. And that large groups of migrants are waiting for the trains in Mexico moving north to start running again.
 
Jorge Carrillo (ph) and his family arrived shaken and exhausted but with a clear eye of what they've seen along the way, to make it this far.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language).
 
LAVANDERA: He says there's thousands of people coming behind him.
 
The most pressing question for local officials all along the U.S. southern border is just how long this migrant surge is going to last. Here in Eagle Pass, local officials tell us they've been told by federal authorities that there are tens of thousands of migrants making their way up north through Mexico.
 
So the question is, where are they all going to end up?
 
What specific areas of the border are they going to end up in?
 
And that's what they're most concerned about. So they don't know if this is going to last weeks or months. But they are bracing for the worst -- Ed Lavandera, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: And joining me now is CNN opinion writer Raul Reyes. He is also an attorney and immigration analyst for "USA Today." Good to talk to you again. Earlier this, week officials arrested close
 
 to a record number of migrants. And we heard there in that piece that the migrants say thousands of people are coming behind him. 
 
So what's behind this latest surge?
 
RAUL REYES, CNN OPINION WRITER: The starting point, I think, that is important to remind people, is that this is not illegal immigration per se. These are people who are generally coming here under American asylum law, which requires presence on American soil. 
 
So they are coming here to make their asylum claims. And these pictures we see are very troubling. I think anyone, whatever your political affiliation, they're very disturbing. But these are just the visible part of a much broader crisis in our entire immigration system, where we have 10 million undocumented people. 
 
Where we haven't done an overhaul really since 1986. A whole generation. And where the programs that we do have, like DACA and (INAUDIBLE) for (INAUDIBLE) status, those are just temporary fixes. Those are sort of Band-aids on a much larger crisis. That's why we are at this point. 
 
BRUNHUBER: You talk about the politics here, then the response. We see the governor of Texas is now ordering more buses to send the migrants to Democratically controlled cities. 
 
Greg Abbott was writing here, "Until President Biden upholds his constitutional duty to secure America's southern border, Texas will continue to deploy as many buses as needed to relieve the strain caused by the surge of illegal crossings." 
 
Surely this can't be the best solution, right?
 
REYES: No, absolutely not. And in fact, depending on the circumstances, whether or not these migrants have full, knowledgeable consent to make these trips, they might be legally dubious because, basically, we have seen instances of governors in Florida and Texas sending some migrants around the country under basically false pretenses, where the migrants were promised things and sent off without full knowledge of the situation. 
 
What we are seeing, though, whether we're talking about the border or places like New York City and Los Angeles, it's just unsustainable. 
 
BRUNHUBER: And you mentioned, in New York, those migrants end up in cities like New York and President Biden was facing a barrage of criticism from his own party, especially in New York. So now he's allowed almost 0.5 million Venezuelan migrants to apply for work permits. 
 
But Republicans argue that protecting recent Venezuelan migrants from deportation will just encourage more to head north. 
 
Are they wrong here? REYES: Well, I'm not going to go out so far to say they are wrong but we do know that there is no tangible link between specific U.S. immigration policies and an influx of migrants from particular countries. 
 
And that's per the Migration Policy Institute. As I see, it there is a tremendous benefit at, at least in New York City to allowing these people temporary protected status. Because that means the most important thing, is they can work right away as opposed to having to wait a minimum of six months. 
 
That means they can get off of social services. That means the taxpayers' burden in New York state and New York City will be lower. That means they can start contributing to society, paying their taxes, finding their own homes and not putting this tremendous strain on the city, which I mentioned, we all know it's unsustainable. 
 
And until we see more of a federal response, more of a response from Congress around all of these immigration issues, that's the status quo. And Congress, through their inaction, got us to these problems. And Congress, they offer the only way. Out but so far, we are seeing a complete abdication of their responsibility around these issues. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Let's talk about Congress, then. Conservative Republicans are vowing to shut down the government unless Congress agrees to new anti-immigration measures. 
 
How do you think this is going to play out politically at the federal level over the next days and weeks?
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
REYES: It's very hard to make a prediction, given the makeup of this Congress. Even there's a lot of dissent on the right side of the aisle about what the proper path forward is. But one thing is for sure. 
 
No matter who has been in the White House or who has had control of Congress over the last few decades, our immigration policies are centered around deterrent strategy and also a strategy of securing the border first. 
 
The idea that we're not going to make any type of move on immigration reform until the border is completely secured. But those policies have failed for over 25 years. It seems like, if lawmakers were truly interested in a solution, they might try a different approach. 
 
Because what we have up to now clearly isn't working. It's going to take a lot more effort and cooperation and compromise to move the needle on this issue. Sad to say, that's not really something that is practically or politically very viable or realistic in this Congress right now. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes, everyone agrees it's broken. No one can agree how to fix. It always appreciate getting your perspective. Raul Reyes, thank you so much for speaking with us. 
 
REYES: Thank you.

BRUNHUBER: A federal judge in California has struck down a statewide ban on firearm magazines holding more than 10 rounds. The judge issued an injunction Friday, calling the law arbitrary and capricious. 
 
He said there is, quote, "no national tradition of prohibiting or regulating firearms based on their firing or ammunition capacity." California officials said they'll appeal. Governor Gavin Newsom says the decision is politics, pure and simple. 
 
All right, in just a few hours, China will officially open this year's Asian Games. Beijing is hoping the events will also give it a boost competing on the world stage. We'll have a live report from China, next. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: China is less than four hours away from the opening ceremony of the largest Asian Games ever. Chinese state media say Xi Jinping will in the host city of Hangzhou to declare the games open. More than 12,000 athletes from roughly 45 nations are set to participate in the games, a new record. 
 
Athletes will compete in 40 sports, 61 disciplines and 481 events over the coming weeks. Dignitaries from around the world are in China for the opening ceremony, notably Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, making his first visit to the country since the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011. 
 
For more on all this, CNN's Marc Stewart joins us live from China. 
 
Marc, the biggest ever Asian Games. 
 
What are you keeping your eye on?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there. Let me just start with some context on this, from Hangzhou, China. The Asian Games without question are a very big deal in this part of the world but especially for China. 
 
According to state media, the government has spent a lot of money on venues. They are sleek, they are modern. 
 
But above that, this is an opportunity for president Xi Jinping to tell the word that China is open for business and, two, that it's also in a position for dealmaking on its own, especially now that the COVID restrictions, that we saw here for about three years have been lifted. And as such that is why we saw that face to face meeting with the
 
 president of Syria and Xi Jinping. During that time, some agreements were made, including China pledging to support Syria in its rebuilding and also to integrate Syria more fully in its Belt and Road initiative, an economic and infrastructure program that really has been at the center of China's economy at least in most recent times. 
 
But again there is this message that the pandemic is over. You can come to China. You can be a visitor, you can be a tourist. That's why we are seeing people from more than 40 countries, athletes from more than 40 countries participate here. 
 
People are not wearing masks, they are not wearing (sic) social distancing. That is a big shift from the past, especially from the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, when very much a bubble type system was in place. 
 
What does remain though is very tight security, even in our walks and our drives around the perimeter of the Asian Games complex. There are a lot of restrictions; movement is very limited. 
 
Nonetheless, the focus is on sports. The opening ceremony is tonight. It's a moment that president Xi Jinping and other leaders from Beijing, pretty safe to say, hope the focus is on sports and not some of the economic problems that are plaguing China right now. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Interesting, thanks so much Marc Stewart in China appreciate it. 
 
Still to come have a look at this.

BRUNHUBER: Let's turn now to a man who's captured the sports world's attention, by turning one of the worst squads in college football into a top 20 team that, so far at least, is undefeated. CNN's Andy Scholes takes a look at how Deion Sanders is shaking things up in Colorado and making headlines. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DEION SANDERS, COLORADO FOOTBALL COACH: Who ready?
 
Who ready?
 
Who ready?
 
Well, give me my dern theme music then, Deejay. 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORT CORRESPONDENT: Colorado Buffaloes have taken college football by storm this season, thanks to one man, Coach Prime. 
 
After three seasons coaching HBCU Jackson State, Deion Sanders instantly transforming Colorado into the most entertaining team in college football. And he did it by being unapologetically himself. 
 
SANDERS: I make a difference. I truly make a difference. I make folks nervous now. I get folks moving and they see that. I get folks twiddling their thumbs, I get them thinking and second guessing themselves. 
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): First thing he did after getting the job, he told all the players he inherited to leave.
 
SANDERS: I told y'all to get ready, to go heads up in the 4th.
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): Coach Prime overhauling the Buffaloes' roster, bringing in 86 new players this season. 
 
And critics said, his in-your-face, brutally honest method would never work. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything Deion has been doing has been putting a target on his team's back. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No one like Deion, told give guys a bunch of pink slips. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For all the hoopla and all the hype going into the off-season, with Deion Sanders and Colorado, it does not mask the fact that they don't have any players on that roster. 
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): But Sanders continues to prove them wrong. 
 
SANDERS: Do you believe?
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): Coach Prime has completely changed Colorado's culture, bringing unprecedented excitement. 
 
PEGGY COPPORN, BUFFALOES SUPERFAN: I'm Peggy.
 
Do I call you Prime?
 
Do I call you that or --
 
SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE).
 
COPPORN: Well, how about good-looking?
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): Even 98-year-old Colorado superfan Peggy Copporn, who has rarely missed a game since 1940, can't believe what Coach Prime has brought to Boulder.
 
It's (INAUDIBLE) unbelievable. All this attention the one man has brought to this town, it's so great. 
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): For the first time ever, Colorado's completely sold out of tickets. The school says merchandise sales are up 819 percent from last season. 
 
Rapper Lil Wayne led the team out of the tunnel before last week's win over rival Colorado State. And that was after The Rock was in attendance as Boulder hosted the ESPN's college game day. 
 
DWAYNE JOHNSON, ACTOR AND FILM PRODUCER: He's changing the face of college football and he's doing it his way. But he's also doing it in a way that -- and this is the hard part -- that is galvanizing not only a town, in Boulder, Colorado, but also galvanizing an entire country. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
SANDERS: You make me proud, man. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
JOHNSON: Did you hear?
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): Two recruits that have helped Coach Prime's instant success in the Rockies are two of his sons, Shedeur, the team's star quarterback, and Shilo, a defensive back who wears Dad's iconic number 21. 
 
Fans have known Deion Sanders for decades as one of the best athletes ever. 
 
But is he now the best coach in college football?
 
SANDERS: Let me see them here, so I can look at it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel that?
 
SANDERS: You think I'm going to sit up here and tell you somebody else? 
 
You think that's the way I operate, that somebody else got that on me?

NASA is on the verge of a historic achievement years in the making. One of its spacecraft is about 30 hours away from delivering the first asteroid sample collected in space. 
 
When the spacecraft OSIRIS-REx swings by Earth on Saturday it's set to release a capsule carrying about eight ounces of rocks and soil from the near asteroid, Bennu. The craft will continue its tour of the solar system, while the capsule is expected land in the state of Utah. 
 
Scientists hope the sample will provide insights into the formation of the Earth and the solar system.
