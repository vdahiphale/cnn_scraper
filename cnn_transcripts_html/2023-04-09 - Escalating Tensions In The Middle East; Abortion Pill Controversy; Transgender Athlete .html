LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak.
 
Escalating tensions in the Middle East, Israel's military carries out attacks in Syrian territory, casting a shadow over a weekend of religious celebrations, we're live in Jerusalem with the latest.
 
Abortion pill controversy, we will examine the contradictory rulings that led to a legal standoff over an established medication to induce abortion.
 
And the cultural war debate over transgender athletes, we will speak to a 13-year-old transgender cross country runner and his mother on their experience with discrimination.
 
One of the holiest times of the year is now underway in Jerusalem. Religious events of different faiths are being observed from Easter Sunday mass to prayers during Ramadan, to the Passover priestly blessing happening right now, with thousands of worshippers gathering at Jerusalem's western wall.
 
Earlier, Muslim worshippers were seen praying peacefully at the Al- Aqsa Mosque. It was in stark contrast to the scene from last week when Israeli forces violently raided the compound. Jordan has warned that if worshippers are attacked again, there would be more catastrophic consequences for everyone. That's on top of all the violence we've seen since last week's raid. In the latest escalation, Israel has carried out a new wave of attacks in Syrian territory.
 
CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us now from Jerusalem with more. Salma, the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, say they have struck targets in Syrian territory. What more can you tell us yes?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRRESPONDENT: Yes, a lot taking place this morning. We understand from the Israeli military, it says that it struck back after late Saturday. Three rockets were fired from Syria. Syria, for its part, says it was responding to ISRAELI attacks inside Syrian territory, something that Israeli authorities have neither confirmed or denied.
 
Israel says it did respond to those three rockets from Syria with fighter jets hitting military targets inside Syria, including radar systems. A drone was used as well, according to Israeli authorities, to hit the launching pads of those rockets that were fired into Israel. Already, Syria responded yet again and Israeli authorities saying they responded to that response as well.
 
But beyond this tit-for-tat, really, what you need to take away from this is that this area of tension, this area of concern during this heightened period is now expanding, Laila. That's the main point here. We already had rocket fire in the last few days coming from Gaza, coming from Southern Lebanon as well, now Syria being added to that theater of concern.
 
And all of this comes at a time when everyone is looking at the old city. You'll remember that this latest bout of violence really began at Al-Aqsa Mosque rather on Wednesday when Israeli police raided Al- Aqsa Mosque. Right now, again, all eyes back at that flashpoint complex known as Al Haram Al Sharif, the noble sanctuary to Muslims, known as Temple Mount.
 
To Jews right now, there are coinciding, overlapping prayers taking place. You have those live images showing what is called the priestly blessing, a very important and special prayer in Judaism taking place at the western wall. Simultaneously overnight, there were prayers taking place at Al-Aqsa mosque.
 
It's important to note here that it's also the holy month of Ramadan. Very normal, part of tradition of Ramadan is to pray overnight in mosques, so that was taking place as well. That took place peacefully last night. But this morning eyewitnesses saying that Muslim worshippers were blocked, banned from entering for dawn prayers at the mosque.
 
And then as well in the old city, you have Easter services taking place. There seems to be a bit of back in fourth overnight with Israeli authorities accusing some people, accusing some people inside Al-Aqsa Mosque of barricading themselves inside.
 
Jordan was quick to respond to this. A side note, it is Jordan, the Al Wafa Organization of Jordan, which manages that holy site for Muslims, saying that Israeli police would see an increase in violence and escalation of violence if they did yet again raid the mosque.
 <br>[03:05:02]
 
Of course, that happened peacefully. But, again, this is just a moment of really heightened tensions, three different faiths observing their religious traditions, all at once under a very heavy police presence.
 
A final note again on the noble sanctuary on the Temple Mount this morning, there were also non-Muslim visitors, Jewish visitors at that site coinciding at a time when Muslims were ending their prayers again. That's something that took place quietly. But it seems all sides here want this to go ahead, go underway, everyone to carry out their religious practices without incident. But a very heightened times of tension and a concern that there could be friction there.
 
HARRAK: Salma Abdelaziz, reporting for you from Jerusalem, thank you so much, Salma. Well, earlier this week, Israel launched strikes in Southern Lebanon, saying it was also responding to rocket fire from that area.
 
CNN's Scott McLean is life for you in Lebanon now with more. Scott, could we see Lebanon being dragged into hostilities? And what would it mean for embattled Lebanon?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, Laila, the state of Lebanon may not be firing the rockets towards Israel but they undoubtedly have a role to play here. The Lebanese Army has been busy trying to prevent the next potential attack, trying to find the rockets and rocket launchers that may be used. In fact, they found a rocket in an orchard in Southern Lebanon just yesterday afternoon in the area that we actually traveled to as well.
 
But their task is a lot easier said than done. Things here, especially in Southern Lebanon, are complicated, especially given the factions, given the militant groups and given the simple fact that when it comes to especially the Palestinian refugee camps, the Lebanese authorities don't have a real effective way to actually police these areas and this is -- these are the places where the Lebanese foreign minister at least believes that some of these rockets are actually originating from.
 
And even outside the camps, if you just look at the landscape, and we saw it for ourselves, there's plenty of good spots to hide weapons if you wanted to do that, in the hillsides, in the orchards there as well, and there's plenty of people that you run into that have an axe to grind with Israel.
 
And when we went to the first bombing site, we found some of them. This was a bridge that had been built over an irrigation channel that took a direct hit. Presumably this could have been a spot where you could hide weapons, though the locals there told us that there weren't any there, and this would not have been a great hiding place. But they also -- some of them made no apologies for the barrage of rockets from Lebanon, the most since 2006 that were fired in the direction of Israel.
 
One man said that, look, the Lebanese firing of rockets should be a message that the Lebanese people stand for resistance. And when I asked him whether he wanted peace with Israel, the answer was pretty blunt. Of course, not.
 
But keep in mind that this man really had nothing to lose. He wasn't that close a few miles to where these bombs actually came down. It's a different story when you talk to the farmer whose children were sleeping when the roof of their farmhouse caved in due to the force of the blast.
 
One other points, Laila, and that is that we also went to the area where the Lebanese military says that the rockets actually were launched from, we couldn't find anyone who was real keen to talk to us on camera, but we did find one man who spoke to us off camera and he said that, look, he doesn't support this kind of escalation, he said. When his kid gets scared, he also gets scared, and this, frankly, is not the time.
 
If there's good news, it's that the Israelis have indicated that unless there is new rocket fire from Lebanon, they're not going to strike back again. Laila?
 
HARRAK: Scott McLean reporting for you from Beirut, thank you so much, Scott.
 
A well known and established medication to induce abortion is now at the center of a legal standoff that could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That's because of two apparently contradictory rulings that were handed down last week. A resolution of the controversy could have far reaching impact.
 
CNN's Rosa Flores has our report.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What we have here are two federal orders on abortion that have created a chaotic legal landscape in the United States. Let me take you through it. First, we have an order issued by a Texas judge that suspends the FDA approval of a drug called Mifepristone. Now, there is a separate order for a separate case out of the state of Washington and the federal judge there ordered the federal government to keep access to this drug in at least 17 states and the District of Columbia.
 
Now it's important to point out that what's at the center of these cases is not the right to abortion. That was the question that went before the U.S. Supreme Court this past summer when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The question of the center of these cases is administrative law.
 <br>[03:10:03]
 
What it really is it's a statute that allows the FDA to regulate medications, in this case, Mifepristone.
 
Now, the plaintiffs argued that the FDA approval was flawed, that the FDA did not consider the risks to women and girls. And the FDA fought against that, saying that this drug is safe, that has been used by millions of women, that women in the United States depend on this drug.
 
Now, the judge in Texas put a pause to his order for seven days, which means that access to this drug right now is uninterrupted. It is available.
 
Now, let me take you through a portion of disorder because some of the language is important. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk out of Texas did not mince words. He ripped apart the FDA approval of this drug in his 67- page order.
 
And I want to take you through some of the points that he made. He says that the FDA s refusal to impose certain restrictions on this drug, quote, resulted in many deaths and many more severe or life threatening adverse reactions. He goes on to say, due to the FDA's lax reporting requirements, the exact number is not ascertainable, but it is likely far higher than its data indicate. It goes on to say whatever the numbers are, they likely would be considerably lower had FDA not acquiesced to the pressure to increase access to chemical abortion at the expense of women's safety.
 
Now, there's been a lot of reaction from leading medical groups. These are the scientists. Because there's one important note to make here, this judge is not a subject matter expert. He's not a doctor. So, it's the doctors, the scientists who are coming out in droves to fact check, to correct the record that's spelled out in this order.
 
One of those organizations is the American Medical Association. The president of that association issuing a statement saying in part that this ruling, quote, flies in the face of science and evidence and threatens to upend access to a safe and effective drug. The courts disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation.
 
Now, there is no question that this judge was sympathetic towards these plaintiffs during the four-hour hearing that happened last month. There's no question that that was exactly what was happening in court, but he appeared to be skeptical.
 
But now that we read this order, now that we read the language in the order, that 67 pages, where he rips apart the FDA's arguments, it is very clear that this judge is also ignoring the arguments made by the FDA, which, at the key of that argument, was the fact that the FDA stated explicitly that this drug is safe.
 
Rosa Flores, CNN, Houston.
 
HARRAK: The U.S. Justice Department intends to appeal the ruling in Texas, and critics have been publicly denouncing the decision as another attempt to block access to abortion. Take a listen to U.S. Senate majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY) (voice over): I think the Republicans know that their decisions, the Dobbs decision, this court decision, are wildly unpopular with the American people. They're probably, at least in some of the survey data, unpopular with a large number of Republicans. So, they are afraid to speak out, but that is outrageous.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, New York's Democratic governor is also speaking out, pointing the finger at, quote extremists in the Republican Party and predicting the issue will be central and next year's presidential election.
 
The two Tennessee lawmakers whom Republicans ousted from the statehouse last week soon may be heading right back. Democrats Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis, who are black, were expelled from office allegedly for breaching decorum during a gun control protests on the House floor. A third Democrat, who is white, survived expulsion by a single vote.
 
It was the first time multiple lawmakers have been kicked out of the House in the same session since 1866. Their supporters say they are enraged, but what they view as an attack on democracy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LISA SHERMAN LUNA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TENNESSEE IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE RIGHTS COALITION: It was both and raging, but also incredibly inspiring to see so many Tennesseans fighting for democracy, fighting for gun reform and really just the energy that this has led to in our movement here in Tennessee.
 
TEQUILA JOHNSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE EQUITY ALLIANCE FUND: This is not just a moment for us organizers here in Tennessee. This is a part of a movement. We've been on the ground knocking doors. We've been bringing young people out to do voter registration and to mobilize and organize people to action.
 <br>[03:15:04]
 
And those three who were expelled or the two who were expelled and Gloria Johnson, they represent our movements. They are our leaders. They are the people that our people elected. And it was just heartbreaking to witness what I say a public lynching of two black men in our state capital.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Now, local commissions will choose interim lawmakers until special elections can be held. But in both cities, it appears the commissioners just might choose Jones and Pearson to retake their seats.
 
CNN's Isabel Rosales has details.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The spotlight right now is shining on those two vacant statehouse seats. Local lawmakers in the districts of Jones and Pearson right now, they're working to determine those next steps that Tennessee Constitution empowers them to appoint an interim successor. So, we could be looking at a situation here where these ousted lawmakers are put back into their same seats.
 
On Friday, we saw the White House sending support in the way of Vice President Kamala Harris. She flew to Tennessee. She met one-on-one with the so called Tennessee three, and she also spoke before a crowd. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: It wasn't about the three of these leaders. It was about who they were representing. It's about whose voices they were channeling. Understand that. And is that not what a democracy allows?
 
A democracy says you don't silence the people. You do not stifle the people. You don't turn off their microphones when they are speaking about the importance of life and liberty.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: This week, all eyes on Nashville and Memphis, the two biggest cities in the state of Tennessee, an important meeting for the Metro Council happening over a Nashville on Monday, where they are looking to not only nominate but also to appoint Representative Justin Jones, former representative, back into his same seat. We're told by a city council member, Jeff Syracuse, that they have the numbers, that they have a super majority in order to push that vote through.
 
Meanwhile, over in Memphis, in the Shelby County area, the commissioner's office there, Mickell Lowery, the chairman of the board of commissioners, saying that they will not discuss Pearson's situation until their regularly scheduled meeting happening on Wednesday.
 
Isabel Rosales, CNN, Atlanta.
 
HARRAK: Apparent U.S. intelligence documents, some marked top secret, have shown up on social media. And now the Justice Department is joining the Pentagon in investigating how this is happening. We'll have the latest from Washington.
 
And Ukrainian children hug their parents for the first time after they were taken against their will to Russia. CNN was there when the families we reunited and emotional stories poured out. That's ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
HARRAK: Taiwan's Defense Ministry says it is closely monitoring a large number of Chinese ships and warplanes now encircling the island in military exercises, while China says the drills are in retaliation for last week's meeting between Taiwan's president and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. State media says the forces carried out simulated precision attacks against key targets on the island.
 
Taiwan's Defense Ministry reports at least 58 warplanes and nine ships have been detected in the Taiwan Strait Sunday. It says more than half of those aircraft flew into Taiwan's air defense identification zone.
 
A trove of what apparently are U.S. intelligence documents recently ended up on social media. And now, that news is triggered investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and the pentagon. CNN's Kylie Atwood tells us from Washington some of the information is marked top secret and includes information on u. S relations with Ukraine, Israel, South Korea and others.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The Department of Justice has now opened an investigation into this apparent trove of classified U.S. documents that have appeared on social media sites in recent weeks. And these documents cover a wide range of topics, like U.S. support for Ukraine, South Korean officials concerned about providing ammunition to the United States that could then be given to Ukraine to be used in the Ukraine war, UAE, United Arab Emirates' ties to Russia, information having to do with U.S. allies, such as Israel.
 
Now, we don't know the source of these leaks, and we also can't independently verify that these documents haven't been altered in some way, but they do appear similar to the initial trove of documents having to do with the U.S. support for Ukraine that caught attention earlier in the week. And U.S. officials did confirm that those documents appeared to be authentic.
 
Now, in addition to the Department of Justice opening this investigation, the Pentagon says they are looking into the matter and looking at these documents is pretty surreal because they are photos of crumpled up pieces of paper that have classified markings on them, some holding top secret markings, which is the highest level of classification, some holding markings of the office at the Pentagon that advises President Biden, so obviously creating quite a bit of alarm among us officials, particularly at the Pentagon.

HARRAK: Ukrainian troops are fighting to keep a lifeline open for the embattled city of Bakhmut. A CNN team reports near constant artillery fire in the town of Chasiv Yar, a key supply route.
 <br>[03:25:00]
 
The fighting suggests Ukrainians are working hard to keep Russians away from that road as they try to regain ground in Bakhmut.
 
Meanwhile, Ukraine says its energy system has been struck by more than 1,200 Russian rockets and drones. That statement didn't say over which period of time but the energy grid has been repeatedly targeted for months.
 
And we're hearing personal stories from a group of Ukrainian children who were allegedly deported by Russia. More than 30 of them returned to Ukraine on Friday after spending months in Russia and occupied Crimea.
 
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh was there when the children were reunited with their families.
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Jubilant scenes in Kyiv as a Ukrainian NGO, Save Ukraine, returned home a number of children who have gone through hellish months in a very secured (ph) route out of occupied parts of Ukraine held by Russia, back through Russia proper itself and Belarus into Ukraine itself.
 
Some of these children accompanied out on a rescue mission by their own parents. Some of these children guided out by the parents of other children who had the power of attorney from their own families to bring them back to Ukraine proper.
 
We spoke to one mother and son, Iryna and Bogdan, from Kherson, one of the first parts of Ukraine to be occupied by Russia. And she recalled how horrified she'd been struggling to get through to her 13-year-old son finally reaching a teacher despite the appalling phone connections. Here's what they had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOGDAN, RETURNED HOME AFTER ALLEGED DEPORTATION: We were driving here for nearly a week, and I met my mother for the first time in six months. We went to the summer camp for two weeks but we got stuck there for six months.
 
Why should I cry now? But I cried when I saw my mom from the bus. I'm very happy to be back.
 
IRYNA, MOTHER OF TEEN RETURNED TO UKRAINE: There was no phone connection. I was very worried. I didn't know anything, whether he was being abused, what was happening to him. I was calling his teacher asking for at least five minutes just to hear my son's voice to make sure he was all right. My hands are still shaking.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALSH: Now, Bogdan there very cavalier, flippant, seems to have sort of washed off him or the fear of those months, but still clear that for six months he was held against his will there.
 
And part of a number of stories we heard of these rescued children deported, held against their will, some further inside Russia or in occupied parts of Ukraine, part of this pattern of behavior that's behind the International Criminal Court's indictment against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his envoy for child welfare, saying this is happening, according to Ukraine, on a scale of possibly tens of thousands of children.
 
But startling scenes of jubilation here as this NGO continues to try and bring to light through small numbers of children rescued and brought back to Ukraine, quite frankly, the horror of these families forcibly separated by Russia during their invasion.
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine.
 
HARRAK: The woman accused of the bombing that killed Russian military blogger of Vladlen Tatarsky is said to be cooperating with investigators. That's according to Russian state media. Darya Trepova was charged with terrorism offenses in connection with Tatarsky's killing and put under arrest through at least June 2nd.
 
Trepova faces up to 20 years in prison. Her husband told an independent Russian media organization he thinks his wife was framed.
 
Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered at a Moscow cemetery on Saturday for Tatarsky's funeral. He was accorded military honors, including a gun salute and a military band. Among those who attended the funeral was Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. A Russian Duma members spoke to reporters after the service.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEONID SLUTSKY, CHAIRMAN, LDPR PARTY: He always said what he thought his life was bright, was true. It was, it is and it will be an example for those young people who today live for Russia, where people of different views stand side by side together, including people of the opposition standpoint stand for the country for its future, for the president.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Moscow has blamed Ukraine for the bombing, an allegation that Kyiv has denied.
 
It's the holiest day in the Christian calendar, and soon, Pope Francis expected to preside over Easter mass amid concerns about his health. We will head to the Vatican for the latest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS: At times, we may simply feel weary about our daily routine, tired of taking risks in a cold, hard world, where only the clever and the strong seem to get ahead. At other times, we may feel helpless and discouraged before the power of evil, the conflicts that tear relationships apart the attitudes of calculation and indifference that seemed to prevail in society, the cancer of corruption, the spread of injustice, the icy winds of war.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: It's Easter Sunday, the holiest day of the Christian calendar, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus. And that was Pope Francis leading the Easter vigil service at the Vatican on Saturday. And soon, the pontiff will be presiding over Easter mass. Thousands of the faithful are already gathered in St. Peter's Square, as you can see right now. The pope has been recovering from bronchitis after being hospitalized last week.
 
CNN's Delia Gallagher has more.
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: A beautiful Easter vigil on Saturday evening in a darkened St. Peter's Basilica with Pope Francis lighting the Easter candle in the back of the church. The pope also baptized eight people, including one American, during the service.
 
Now, Pope Francis has managed to make most of the events of holy week, the week leading up to Easter here at the Vatican, with the exception of Friday evening in front of the coliseum for the way of the cross, the Vatican said that the cold weather would just prevent him from going.
 
Now, normally that would be a concern when a pope skips an event like that. But given that Francis is 86 years old, getting over about of bronchitis and the event is held at 9:00 at night in indeed a cold Rome these days, it seems instead just a prudent decision to let the pope rest.
 
Francis has one more Easter event on Sunday morning in St. Peter's Square and that would wrap up for him what has been a very challenging week, but he has proven to be up to the challenge.

HARRAK: The Iranian government is turning to modern technology to find and punish women who don't cover their head in public. Women have been required to wear her job since the Iranian revolution in 1979. Well, recently, Iranian police put down protests by women flouting the hijab law. Now, police are going to use smart cameras to identify women who bare their heads in public.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AHMAD-REZA RADAN, IRANIAN CHIEF OF POLICE: With the use of advanced technology and equipment, the person is identified. She will be warned. Then that person will be introduced to the judicial system with the documents to deal with the issue.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: On March 30th, two women without the hijab were in a store in Northeastern Iran when they were confronted by an angry man who dumped yogurt on them. The two women were arrested for not obeying the hijab law. The man was arrested for, quote, disturbing order.
 
Just ahead, proposed restrictions on transgender participation in school sports are being discussed at the state and federal level. I'll speak with a transgender student athlete from Kansas that's just passed a ban.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: The Biden administration has proposed a new federal rule that would allow schools to enforce some restrictions on transgender student athletes but it opposes policies that would categorically ban those students from participating on teams consistent with their gender.
 
And while in Texas, transgender women and girls will no longer be able to compete on teams consistent with their gender, that's after state lawmakers overrode the governor's veto.
 <br>[03:40:05]
 
The ban applies from kindergarten through college and goes into effect July 1st.
 
Joining me now are Alex and Cat Poland. Alex is a transgender cross country runner. Cat is Alex's mother and LGBTQ rights advocate and coordinates the Gay/Straight Alliance at Alex's school. Together, they are lobbying for trans rights, and they join me now from Hutchinson, Kansas.
 
Cat, let me get your reaction and, Alex, please feel free to jump in, how do you feel about the Biden administration's proposed rule that will prohibit outright bans on transgender athletes but will allow some limits?
 
CAT POLAND, ALEX'S MOTHER: I was grateful to hear that he was making some kind of an effort to address this issue. When I learned more about it, though, I realized there could potentially be a lot of loopholes that schools might use to continue prohibiting trans athletes, so I do find that concerning..
 
HARRAK: What do you think people get wrong about trans kids wanting to participate in school sports?
 
ALEX POLAND, TRANSGENDER STUDENT ATHLETE: I think a lot of people think that there's disadvantages and advantages with like biological sex and things mainly with trends, women, and thinking that there will have an advantage over cis girls because they have more testosterone things.
 
And I don't know. I just think that we should get to participate in sports like normal kids and not have to be singled out by mainly adults because I -- on sports, I practice it, none of the kids really said anything to me directly, like with tennis. It wasn't -- no one really necessarily said anything to me, but I overheard a lot of transphobic, homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic, things like that.
 
And I didn't really want to be -- I was scared that because some kids don't know. And I was scared that kids would figure out and then I'd get harassed like more and stuff. And so I didn't want to have to go to practice scared.
 
HARRAK: I'm really sorry, Alex, that you had to go through that. And what would you tell other parents, Cat, who are going through a similar situation?
 
C. POLAND: Yes, that's a great question. I was fortunate to know some people who could connect me with support groups, I would say reach out, find support networks reach out to other parents of trans children. There's a wealth of information out there. Unfortunately, there is a wealth of misinformation out there as well.
 
So, you know, the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, There are research resources out there that can give you good and accurate information and helpful information to help navigate this with your child.
 
HARRAK: Now, as you know, there have been several proposed bans across the country that have sought to restrict or prohibit the participation of trans student athletes on sports team. What's your hope for what should happen? What would be your ideal solution?
 
A. POLAND: Yes. I just think that there shouldn't be all this stuff that you have to go through and adults debating whether or not you should be able to play on a middle school sports team in my instance just because your genitals are different from other kids, which that part doesn't have anything to do with this sport, obviously.
 
C. POLAND: Yes. And I would echo what Alex says that there shouldn't be the barriers there and in an ideal world, every child would get to participate in an athletic team, especially that aligns with their gender and just have fun and get exercise and enjoy all the things that sports can bring.
 
HARRAK: A final thought from both of you. What do you want people to know above everything?
 
C. POLAND: That's another good question. I want people to know that being transgender is very real. It's not something that somebody chooses. And transgender people can have wonderful, beautiful, healthy, thriving lives, but we just need to get out of their way and give them the best support that we can.
 
A. POLAND: Definitely. I think that people should just know that transgender people are just normal people. And a lot of people -- a lot of times when you tell people hey, I'm transgender, that's kind of all they see you as.
 <br>[03:45:00]
 
But me, I'm just a normal kid. I have things in common with all the other boys my age and being transgender is just something that I am and it doesn't, I guess, define me as a person, and that's not all I am.
 
HARRAK: Alex and Cat Poland, thank you so much. Thank you so much for coming on.
 
C. POLAND: Thank you.
 
A. POLAND: Of course.
 
HARRAK: In the U.S., there is a new reality for expecting mothers giving birth could be more dangerous based on where you live. A new study shows the highest rates of life threatening complications are in Washington, D.C. California, Nevada, New Jersey and New York. Well, this as hundreds of hospitals across the country are shutting down their maternity wards, forcing expectant mothers into long drives for care.
 
CNN's Elizabeth Cohen has more.
 
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Delivering babies is one of the most important things that a hospital can do. But now many hospitals are saying they're not going to do it anymore.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
COHEN (voice over): Bonner County, Idaho, picture perfect, idyllic, a great place to ski or swim or fish, but not a great place to have a baby.
 
LEANDRA WRIGHT, BONNER GENERAL PATIENT: I just found out a couple of weeks ago via Facebook that my local hospital is shutting down their O.B. units.
 
COHEN: Leandra Wright has six children and now she's five months pregnant with her seventh. Ten minutes away is Bonner General Hospital, where they have been delivering babies for more than 70 years. But next month, they'll stop. That means when Leandra's new baby is born this summer, she'll have to do this 40-mile drive all the way to Coeur D'Alene, on a good day, it will take 45 minutes.
 
WRIGHT: It's frustrating and worrisome.
 
COHEN: Leandra has a history of fast laborers. Her son, Noah, was born on the way to the hospital.
 
WRIGHT: My fifth child was born on the side of the highway.
 
COHEN: New moms and Bonner County aren't alone. Since 2011, 217 hospitals in the U.S. have closed their labor and delivery departments. In the past year alone, hospitals across the country have stopped delivering babies.
 
Money is one reason the American Hospital Association points out that almost half of U.S. births are paid for by Medicaid, which has low reimbursement rates. Employer-sponsored insurance pays about $15,000 for a delivery and Medicaid pays about $6,500.
 
Bonner General says one reason for shuttering their obstetrics unit is because they won't have enough providers certified in neonatal resuscitations. And abortion laws appear to be playing a role too. A hospital press release says, due to Idaho's legal and political climate, highly respected, talented physicians are leaving. The Idaho legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalized physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care.
 
Well, Bonner didn't specifically name abortion, the state does have one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, banning the procedure almost completely with only a few exceptions.
 
Next month, Leandra's obstetrician will stop seeing her.
 
WRIGHT: Even us existing patients will have to find other services. It just really is surreal that it's something I have to worry about.
 
COHEN: She needs to find another obstetrician and then figure out what she can do to avoid giving birth on the long road to the hospital.

COHEN (on camera): Some parts of the United States have such low access to obstetrical care that the March of Dimes calls them maternity deserts. And they say more than 2 million women of childbearing age live in maternity deserts in the United States.

HARRAK: We're learning that ten- time U.S. National Cycling Champ Ethan Boyes died on Tuesday after he was struck by a car in a San Francisco park. Police say the 44-year-old was sent to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Boyes was called deceptively fast with the world record in the 1,000 meter time trial for men aged 35 to 39.
 
The National Basketball Association says it will investigate the curious case of the Dallas Mavericks and why it benched five of its top players in a crucial game. The Mavericks were playing the Chicago Bulls Friday night for a chance to make it into a play in tournament but losing meant they would end up tenth in the NBA's overall standings, meaning they wouldn't have to give away an upcoming first round draft pick.
 
But to be clear the Mavs have not said why it kept its top players after court and have yet to comment on the investigation.
 
Organizers of the Masters hope the bad weather is finally behind them so players can complete golf's first major tournament of the season later today. Well, the Masters' website says the third round is set to resume at 8:30 local time.
 
Heavy rain on Saturday drenched the Augusta National Course, forcing yet another suspension of play.
 
CNN Sports Don Riddell has the story.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beautiful, isn't it?
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORTS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Australians have always excelled at irony and Adam Scott captured the mood perfectly at Augusta National.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, I feel like I just survived.
 
RIDDELL: Early on Saturday morning, play resumed at the Masters. Tournament organizers we're trying to make up for lost time the previous day when inclement weather, which had toppled several trees, called a halt to the action. Almost half the players returned to the course to complete their second rounds, trying to keep their hopes afloat in a torrential downpour.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I'm good in the umbrella.
 <br>[03:55:01]
 
VIKTOR HOVLAND, PRO GOLFER: He's got a hold umbrella. I've got a hold the umbrella. He's got to clean the ball and, you know, you kind of have to work together a little bit. And if you're not used to it, it can get awkward.
 
SAHITH THEEGALA, PRO GOLFER: It was brutal this morning because it's just so cold.
 
RIDDELL: The temperature had plummeted from the mid-80s to a real feel of 39 degrees. Even some of the world's best players struggled to hold it together. Two-time Major winner Justin Thomas was all at sea capsizing and missing the cut after dropping six shots in eight holes.
 
Tiger Woods survived the cut qualifying to play the last two rounds of the Masters for a record equaling 23rd consecutive time, but his face of thunder said it all. Even the veteran players who had seen and done it all had never witnessed Augusta National quite like this.
 
FRED COUPLES, PRO GOLFER: Am I going to look thrilled to play 18 holes in this, this afternoon? No. I'm a wimp. I'm an old wimp. But I'm excited to play.
 
RIDDELL: The tempest briefly subsided to lure the third round players back out onto the course but the rains quickly returned. And even Augusta's highly sophisticated subterranean drainage system soon became swamped, greens became lakes, and after just six holes, the leaders were told to call it a day.
 
MACKENZIE HUGHES, PRO GOLFER: It felt like a different sport today, you know, dealing with all the elements and the cold, rain.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mentally, it's obviously hard just because you're generally not having the most fun out there. But, yes, I mean, it's basically impossible. I don't really know what you're supposed to do.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIDDELL (on camera): What they will have to do now is returned to the course early on Sunday morning to play both their third and fourth rounds. The weather forecast is set to be dry and everyone is hoping for a day of much smoother sailing.
