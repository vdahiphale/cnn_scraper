CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Ukraine is facing pressure on its eastern front as Russian forces rapidly advance on the city of Pokrovsk. Authorities have begun what they call a forced evacuation of children and their parents. They say it's necessary with the city in range of Russia's heavy weapons.
 
Residents are being warned they have two weeks at most to leave the city before Russian troops arrive, with more than 53,000 civilians remaining in Pokrovsk, which Ukraine uses as a military hub. 
 
Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces now control more than 1,200 square kilometers in Russia's Kursk region, according to Ukraine's president. Russian officials say they have resettled more than 121,000 residents since the start of the incursion two weeks ago.
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian has been following this. Clare, just talk to us first about how strategically important this city of Pokrovsk actually is.
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, it's a small town. It's sort of similar size to Bakhmut, which, of course, the Russians took over last year. But it has been in Russia's sights really since they took Avdiivka back in February. It's about 60 or so kilometers west of that. And it is on a road intersection. It's been used by Ukraine as a military hub, essentially to sort of house forces and equipment.
 
And if the Russians were able to take it, then it would open up the road up to Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, other major military hubs in the east. So it would put the Donetsk region, which Russia still does not fully occupy, at serious risk. It's been a real target for Russia, really, as I said, ever since Avdiivka and even before that.
 
And I think this is where you find the risk of the incursion into Kursk. On the one hand, the Ukrainians have been clear that they intend to try to distract Russian forces by bringing them from other areas, try to ease the pressure on the front lines, but they are also risking doing that to themselves, right? 
 
There were concerns around the eastern front when Russia opened a new front in the Kharkiv region back in May. Would this mean that the Ukrainians were still able to defend Pokrovsk and other towns effectively? I think the same questions are being asked now, as the Russians are clearly making progress.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, and the Ukrainian incursion is continuing apace, it seems. We've said 1,200 square kilometers now taken in the region. Have you seen, then, given what you just said, any sort of change in strategy from the Ukrainians, given that, you know, they may have to deploy at this point?
 
SEBASTIAN: Well, so, obviously, we can see from the numbers that the Ukrainians are putting out that the advance in the Kursk region has slowed, right? So, last Thursday, they said 1,150 square kilometers. Now, some five days later, it's just 100 square kilometers more than that.
 
So, obviously, the first few days and the first week when they had that element of surprise were the most effective. 
 
I think what we see now, as well as attempts to advance our consolidation, they've been pretty vocal. They want to create a buffer zone, they want to try to prevent the cross-border attacks back into Ukraine, and we continue to see those, right.
 
There was an overnight assault involving missiles and drones, the Air Force saying some of those actually originating in Kursk. So, that is a key aim. 
 
But we have heard from Zelenskyy on another really interesting part of this, sort of the public relations side of this incursion, and talking about why this is also about sending a message, in a sense, to the West. Take a listen.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We are now witnessing a significant ideological shift. Namely, the whole naive, illusory concept of so-called red lines regarding Russia, which dominated the assessment of the war by some partners, has crumbled these days somewhere near Sudzha. 
 
If partners removed all existing restrictions on the use of weapons on Russian territory, we would not need physical entry, particularly into the Kursk region, to protect our Ukrainian citizens in the border area and destroy Russia's potential for aggression.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: So, that is pretty stark, right? He's saying, essentially, that if the U.S. and other Western allies had provided more long-range missiles and had lifted restrictions on using them inside Russia, they wouldn't have needed to go into Kursk with ground troops in the first place. He's also sort of arguing that the fact that they've now invaded Russia and we don't see anything out of the ordinary course of the hostilities and violence of this war in response, that it sort of makes a mockery of Western fears of escalation. Having said that, though, we don't see from the West, and in particular the U.S., U.K. and France, which have provided those long- range missiles, that they are yet ready to lift any kind of restrictions on using them inside Russia.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, interesting. Clare, thank you. 
 
Now, a passing of the torch at the Democratic National Convention will have some of U.S. President Joe Biden's emotional speech ahead.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Christina Macfarlane. Here are some of today's top stories.
 
It's day two of the Democratic National Convention, and tonight we're here from both Michelle and Barack Obama. The former president has made his national debut at the Convention of Boston 20 years ago. At the time, Obama was a state lawmaker from Illinois.
 
Former President Donald Trump tells Reuters he would consider appointing Elon Musk to a cabinet or advisory role if re-elected. Trump also said he'd be open to ending a tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, a move that might anger the Tesla CEO. 
 
And a super blue moon lit up the skies around the world on Monday. It's a rare combination of a super moon and a blue moon, and it takes place when the moon is closest to the Earth. Now, despite its name, blue moons don't actually appear blue. This one is making a three- night appearance, so try to catch a glimpse of it if you can.
 
Now as Democrats kicked off their national convention with a message of unity, hope and a new way forward with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. But the night was also about honoring the service of President Joe Biden. CNN's MJ Lee has more from Chicago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The first night of the Democratic National Convention here in Chicago, clearly an emotional moment and evening for President Joe Biden, who was the keynote speaker. Of course, he was initially meant to speak on the final night of the convention, but because he dropped out of the 2024 race four weeks ago, the president instead opening the convention here in Chicago. 
 
And when he first took the stage after being introduced by his daughter, Ashley Biden, you could see the emotion. He actually turned away his back to the stage for a moment as he wiped away tears. And when he took the podium, the crowd inside this arena holding "We Heart Joe" signs for several minutes would not stop chanting, saying, Thank you, Joe. And we love Joe over and over again. That moment to clearly bringing the president to tears. 
 
And this was a speech that was long on accomplishments. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
He really took the time to lay out everything that he sees as the key accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration and at times calling out his former opponent, former President Donald Trump. And he made the case to everyone in this room and to the Americans tuning in that it is time for them to elect Kamala Harris come November.
 
Take a listen to what he had to say about his vice president.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee. And it was the best decision I made my whole career. 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BIDEN: We've not only gotten to know each other, we've become close friends.
 
She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity, enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story.
 
LEE: And notably, when President Biden was finished speaking, we saw Vice President Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, joining him and the first lady, Jill Biden, on stage. Members of their families were also on stage as well, clearly wanting to show the entire room here and the nation watching the sign of unity for the party and the country. 
 
We know that there are going to be many other speakers, key national Democrats that will be speaking on behalf of the president and the Biden administration's accomplishments, but also, of course, on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris and making the case for her over the next three days.
 
But it was clear that the first night, the beginning of this convention, really was about trying to pay tribute to President Biden. And again, it was very clear that he was moved by those emotions and the signs of support that he could see all around this room, the gratitude that he could feel from those chants of we love Joe and thank you, Joe, that really initially didn't end for a number of minutes. This was clearly a moment that he didn't anticipate even as of a number of weeks ago but culminated in the president dropping out and now delivering a completely different speech than what he would have some weeks ago.
 
MJ Lee, CNN in Chicago.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE: Meanwhile, Republican Vice President nominee J.D. Vance visited Philadelphia Monday and slammed what he called the absurdity of Harris's rise to the top of the Democratic ticket. He also downplayed the momentum of his Democratic rivals.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I don't think that we have to blunt her momentum. I think we just have to tell the truth to the American people. I mean, our message is really simple, that Donald Trump delivered peace and prosperity.
 
There was peace all over the world. He delivered rising take-home pay for American workers. And Kamala Harris's administration, which is now 1,300 days and running, has delivered higher prices, unaffordable housing and a chaotic situation all over the globe.
 
We just really have to contrast those two visions and those two records of accomplishment. I think if we do that, the American people are going to give Donald Trump another chance. We just have to carry that message for, I guess, about the next 80 days.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: The Republican contenders are on a week-long blitz through seven crucial battleground states. Today, Trump and Vance will hold events in Wisconsin and Michigan focused on crime and safety. On Wednesday, they will return to North Carolina to discuss national security.
 
And later this week, Trump will visit the southern border in Arizona while J.D. Vance stops in Georgia. 
 
Now former Republican congressman George Santos has pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and identity theft. It's part of a plea deal after Santos was accused of fraudulent activity during his midterm campaign two years ago. He was set to stand trial on nearly two dozen federal charges. Outside court, he told reporters he took full responsibility for his actions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEORGE SANTOS, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Pleading guilty is a step I never imagined I'd take. But it is a necessary one because it is the right thing to do. It's not only a recognition of my misrepresentations to others, but more profoundly, it is my own recognition of the lies I told myself over these past years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Well, Santos will serve a minimum of two years in prison and pay almost $400,000 in restitution. As part of the plea agreement, a U.S. attorney says Santos acknowledged committing a litany of other crimes that we held accountable for whilst he's sentenced this February. 
 
Now U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's push for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal has taken him to Egypt and Qatar today. Ahead, a look at the issues that could prevent an agreement.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Egypt right now to discuss the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar. Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday and says Israel has accepted a proposal to bridge gaps in ceasefire negotiations and the next step is for Hamas to accept it. 
 
Alon Pinkas is a former Israeli Consul General in New York. Joining me now from Tel Aviv. Alon, thanks so much for joining us. Before we discuss this, I just want to show our viewers some video that we have been receiving into CNN of the bodies of these six Israeli hostages retrieved from Gaza.
 
I don't know if we can show this. Yes, the identities of the individuals during this military raid and military operation overnight. Once again, I think, underlying the urgency of this ceasefire deal to be passed.
 
Alan, we heard from Blinken last night that Israel had agreed to this so-called bridging proposal, although we don't really know many of the details of that proposal yet. But how optimistic are you at this stage that Hamas will even agree to this or that this is indeed a breakthrough?
 
ALON PINKAS, FORMER ISRAELI CONSUL GENERAL IN NEW YORK: Well, unfortunately, Christina, I'm not optimistic. And I'm not optimistic because I look at the last six months worth of negotiations and there was always a new Israeli condition or a new Israeli stipulation or a new Hamas refusal to entertain proposals. And it seems that both sides were in no rush, no hurry and had no incentive to end this.
 
But it's not just what Blinken said, Christina. It's also what Joe Biden, President Joe Biden, said in Chicago last night. When he said, quote-unquote, the protesters are right, the war needs to end.
 
And this illustrates or illuminates, rather, the urgency with which the U.S. is approaching this. And Blinken did, in fact, say this is the absolute last opportunity. And yet at the same time, even though, you know, Mr. Netanyahu supposedly said he agrees to the American bridging formula, there are a lot of caveats there on the Israeli side. There are a lot of stipulations, a lot of what-ifs. And on the other side, Hamas hasn't agreed to it yet. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
So we find ourselves in this vicious and tragic circle in which both sides have one thing in common, and that is that they seem to want, when I say both sides, I mean Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Sinwar, not all Israelis and not all Palestinians. They seem to be intent on prolonging this war.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, it does seem that the Americans are trying to work more to their timetable rather than that of Hamas or Israel, as you point out. And neither Hamas or Israel are going to want to agree to a deal where either side can claim any sort of victory. So I guess this leads to the question of where does this leave the mediators and what more leverage should Egypt, the U.S., Qatar be putting on the table in order to force them into some sort of deal?
 
PINKAS: Well, the thing is, if you put it in a broader context or historical context, the last two times that the U.S. was involved in a serious and extensive way was 2014 when then-Secretary of State John Kerry tried to renew a peace process and again in 2021 when the Biden administration tried to revive the JCPOA, the so-called Iran nuclear deal. 
 
But on both those instances, the U.S. could afford to disengage and say, we gave it our best, we can't want this more than the parties, thank you and goodbye. 
 
This time it cannot because the conceivable or likely escalation could very well involve the U.S., which means that the U.S. needs to now look deep into their toolkit and find some levers of pressure. Now one of those, going back to your question, your remark, one of those is to stand up and just call everyone's bluff and say, look, this is Israel's fault, this is Hamas' fault, it was Israel's fault here, it was Hamas' fault there, because I honestly don't see where mediation, where more mediation could be helpful, it exhausted its usefulness.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, and as Blinken now heads to Egypt, it will be interesting to see what he looks to address there, how he can perhaps encourage Qatar and Egypt as well to pull their levers of leverage in this instance. Alon Pinkas, we have to leave it there, but we appreciate your thoughts, thank you.
 
PINKAS: Thank you.
 
MACFARLANE: Now from the Olympic podium to the Democratic National Convention, ahead, a gold medal presidential endorsement for Kamala Harris.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back. Sports and politics coming together in Chicago with a patriotic speech from the basketball coach Steve Kerr. He won three NBA championships as a player in Chicago, and he took to the stage in a windy city to speak Monday night at the Democratic National Convention.
 
Less than two weeks ago, Kerr was coached the U.S. men's basketball team to an Olympic gold medal in Paris.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEVE KERR, U.S. OLYMPIC MEN'S BASKETBALL COACH: I cannot think of a better metaphor for what this country is all about than the way Team USA came together at the Olympics. We had players from across our wonderful country, players who have trained and fought relentlessly, shed tears trying to beat one another throughout their careers, joining forces to wear the red, white, and blue.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) [04:55:04]
 
MACFARLANE: Now off the court, Kerr has supported the Biden administration and spoken out on Democratic issues, including curbing gun violence. 
 
And now to the stories in the spotlight this hour. Prince Harry and Meghan wrapped up their visit to Colombia Sunday. Duke and Duchess of Sussex led a forum on Afro women and power, and Meghan surprised many by speaking in fluent Spanish, even translating for Harry during this closing event. 
 
Well earlier that day, they spoke to young people about digital violence and cyberbullying. The couple even busted some salsa moves. Very nice. 
 
And meanwhile, here in the U.K., the first 1 pound coins featuring King Charles III entered circulation this week. The Royal Mint released this video showing the production of the coins, one side of which will feature British bees. Around 3 million coins will make their way across the country through post offices and banks. I think the bees are nods to King Charles there. 
 
And animals big and small stepped up to the scales at the London Zoo for their annual weigh-ins. Some of the zoo's 14,000 animals took part, giving zookeepers a chance to make sure vital statistics are accurate and up-to-date.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANGELA RYAN, HEAD OF ZOOLOGICAL OPERATIONS, LONDON ZOO: What we do is weigh about 400. We don't weigh things like our leafcutter ants, although they weigh about 5 milligrams. But most of the mammals and birds and reptiles will be weighed.
 
I think one of the most challenging things is weighing animals when there's lots of them in one habitat. So it could be something like our rainforest, where we have a sloth, we have monkeys, we have birds all in one area, getting them to individually go onto a scale when they all want to get on there at the same time can be hard work.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: I mean, they must have different scales for a gorilla and a bird, right? The lion cubs apparently weighed in at around 17 kilograms, whilst the heaviest animals were the camels at around 680 kilograms each. The statistics are shared with zoos around the world.
 
This is why they do it. It's for conservation, apparently. And they use this for tracking animals in the wild. Very sweet. 
 
I mean, how do you weigh a camel, for goodness sake? 
 
Anyway, British stunt driver Jonny Davies claims he's broken the world record for the fastest speed whilst being dragged behind a moving motorbike. Rather him than me. This is what the stunt looks like. Davies said the bike was using hit speeds of nearly 257 kilometers or 160 miles per hour.
 
The Guinness Book of World Records has yet to confirm whether Davies set a new record for the stunt. I hope for his sake that he did. Dicing with death.
 
And that'll do it for us here at CNN NEWSROOM. Thanks for joining us. I'm Christina Macfarlane. CNN "THIS MORNING" is up next.
