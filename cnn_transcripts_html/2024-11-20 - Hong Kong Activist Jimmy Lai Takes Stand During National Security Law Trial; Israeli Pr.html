MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Jail media tycoon Jimmy Lai is testifying at his own national security trial in Hong Kong. It's a high-stakes court battle that could see him spend the rest of his life behind bars. The pro-democracy activist was arrested nearly four years ago amid Beijing's deepening crackdown on dissent. In his defense, Lai told the court he had always opposed violence during the anti-government protests of 2019.
 
Hong Kong officials argue that Lai's actions jeopardized China's national sovereignty and security. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following developments for us. And Kristie, this is a very significant day in that trial.
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Max. The court has adjourned for today, but I'm standing outside the court where earlier today, the jailed media mogul Jimmy Lai spoke for the very first time in his national security trial. Earlier, he had pleaded not guilty to several charges, including sedition, including colluding with foreign forces. Very serious charges that if convicted could send him to life in prison. 
 
Earlier today, we saw about 100 people, members of the public gather outside for a chance to sit inside the courtroom. And security has been very tight this day, this rainy day here in Hong Kong with police officers pulling and picking some members of the public from the line to question them and to search them.
 
Now, inside the courtroom, we got a chance to see and to hear from Jimmy Lai himself. He's now 77 years old. He appeared visibly thinner. He waved to supporters in the courtroom, including his wife, including his daughter. And he also spoke calmly. He talked about how he had always opposed violence and that he finds any advocacy for independence for Hong Kong, quote, crazy.
 
This is a trial that is being closely watched and monitored here in Hong Kong and around the world. Watch this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STOUT (voice-over): As a father figure to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, Jimmy Lai has been on a collision course with the Chinese authorities for years, but he never let that phase him.
 
JIMMY LAI, FOUNDER, APPLE DAILY: I think it's a good idea any time, any situation that you are in to fight for your freedom, because without freedom, you have nothing left.
 
STOUT (voice-over): Last year, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called him, quote, one of the most notorious anti-China elements bent on destabilizing Hong Kong. 
 
The former media mogul finally getting his day in court on Wednesday, taking the stand in his high profile trial, which began nearly a year ago. He faces a possible life sentence for multiple counts of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security, along with a separate charge of sedition.
 
And for 77 year old Lai, life would most likely mean life. He has already been in custody for nearly four years. His arrest after sweeping national security laws imposed by Beijing, which China said restored stability to Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests in 2019.
 
At that time, Lai had lobbied foreign governments to apply pressure on China, but his lawyers denied that happened after the new laws came into effect. In 2020, Lai was marched out of the offices of Apple Daily, the pro-democracy newspaper, which he founded. 
 
Today, most of Hong Kong's political opposition have either fled the territory or are in prison, like Lai, who after a lifetime of speaking up for democratic freedoms, may be getting his final chance to speak publicly before spending the rest of his days behind bars.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
STOUT (on camera): Jimmy Lai's relationships with U.S. politicians was a focus during questioning this afternoon in the courtroom. His dealings and exchanges with the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with the former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with the former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, the list goes on. 
 
But it's important to note two things. Number one, he did not directly talk with then president, now president-elect Donald Trump, and that these discussions took place before the summer of 2020. That was when Beijing imposed the national security law on the territory. Back to you -- Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Kristie in Hong Kong, thank you so much for that. We'll be following it closely. 
 
Anyone who frees a hostage from Gaza will be paid millions of dollars. That's according to the Israeli Prime Minister, who made the offer during a visit to central Gaza on Tuesday. Benjamin Netanyahu also promised safe passage out of the territory for any person and their family who return a hostage. And he issued this warning to the captors.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I want to say to those who are holding our hostages, whoever dares to harm our hostages, his blood is on his head. We will pursue you and we will get you. I also say to those who want to get out of this maze, whoever brings us a hostage, we will find a safe way for them and their family to get out.
 
We will also give a reward of five million dollars for each hostage returned. You choose. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
The choice is yours, but the result will be the same. We will bring them all back.

FOSTER: Paul Hancock's covering this live for us from Abu Dhabi. I mean, it's a pretty appealing offer, isn't it, for people there considering how desperate they are?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, it's certainly come as a surprise. I mean, what we've been hearing from the Israeli prime minister is that Hamas will be completely destroyed. And the assumption is that Hamas and other militants are the ones that are potentially still holding these hostages, or at least those affiliated with those groups.
 
It has come as a surprise, as it seems to be a departure from what the Israeli prime minister said before. But we don't have any more details beyond what he has said that you just heard there. We don't know how it would work logistically, practically on the ground in the midst of a war.
 
We have had, though, some responses from families of those who are still being held hostage in Gaza. Ruby Chen, for example, he's the father of Itay Chen, who the IDF said they believe was killed in the October 7th attack by Hamas, his body then taken into Gaza. Let's listen to what he said about this offer.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RUDY CHEN, FATHER OF ITAY CHEN, A U.S. CITIZEN HELD IN GAZA: It is unfortunate that after 411 days, the prime minister does not have a strategy. That is a tactic. And it is not a way to get all 101 hostages. It might bring a few.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: And CNN also spoke to the mother of another hostage, Matan Zangauker, who said, quote: The prime minister is trading the hostages live. Saying it's unacceptable that he is offering money to Hamas. She also went on to say that the attempt to divide and rule in Gaza through bribes to the captors potentially puts the hostages in danger. So she's concerned that this offer could actually put those hostages in danger. It's believed that just over 100 are still being held, a third of them, according to the Israeli authorities, are believed to be already have deceased at this point. So it's a very difficult situation for those hostage families listening to what the prime minister has said. And as I say, Max, there's been very little clarification or more details about it since we also heard from the mother of that hostage.
 
It's unbelievable that the man who funded Hamas is once again offering money to Hamas. 
 
Now, this refers back to a controversial deal back in 2018 when Qatar was funding Hamas, transferring millions of dollars to Gaza. And it was known by Israel. It was tacitly approved by Israel at the time. Netanyahu said that was to stave off humanitarian catastrophe and also to try and make the Israeli villages around Gaza safer. 
 
But it certainly is a controversial decision to publicly say this while he is standing in central Gaza, at the Netzarim Corridor, which splits north and southern Gaza apart.
 
And of course, it raises the question, well, where does this lead negotiations? Is this a tacit acceptance that negotiations with Hamas to try and secure the release of these hostages in tandem with ceasefire? Does that mean that that is going nowhere -- Max?
 
FOSTER: OK, Paula Hancocks. Thank you so much for joining us from Abu Dhabi with that. 
 
The 27-year-old son of Norway's crown princess has been arrested on suspicion of rape. Marius Borg Hoiby is accused of violating the criminal code that references sexual intercourse with someone who is unconscious, or for other reasons, unable to resist the act. Norwegian police specified that Hoiby is accused of carrying out a sexual act without intercourse with a woman said to be unable to resist the act. His lawyer told Norwegian media that his client denies the allegation.
 
Closing arguments today in the trial of the French man accused of organizing the mass rapes of his drugged wife over the course of a decade. The victim spoke in court on Tuesday, condemning the, quote, cowardice of the dozens of men on trial for raping her. Melissa Bell has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Gisele Pelicot, the 71-year-old French woman who is believed to be the victim of dozens of rapes organized by her husband over the course of a decade using chemical sedation, has spoken for the third time to the court since her trial began. A trial that could have happened behind closed doors and that she instead decided to have play out publicly. For the third time she spoke, speaking of the cowardice of the men involved, many of them sitting in court before her.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
Her husband Dominique Pelicot has recognized his guilt and his actions, but most of the 50 men also being judged in the case have denied any involvement in rape. Gisele Pelicot spoke to them in court saying that rape was rape. And at what point did anyone walk into a bedroom and find someone unconscious without then leaving and reporting it to the police? 
 
Two of the couple's sons also spoke to the courts on Monday, urging the court to find a guilty verdict for Dominique Pelicot and to punish him severely. That verdict expected around the 20th of December.

FOSTER: Officials in Los Angeles are making moves to cement its status as a sanctuary city. An ordinance passed by the city council will prevent city resources from being used in federal immigration enforcement. This comes as President-elect Trump plans to ramp up deportations and has suggested withholding federal funding from sanctuary cities during his term.
 
Council members say the move is crucial to protect immigrant communities. The mayor is expected to approve the measure. 
 
Coming up, what Sweden and Finland are advising its citizens as the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalates.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: U.S. officials now believe there was no sabotage after two underwater internet cables were cut in the Baltic Sea. Joining me is Clare, because obviously that was the first thought of the Baltic is something Russia has been accused of breaching in terms of airspace and in the water. But it turns out this cable was damaged somehow differently. People talk about an anchor, possibly. But just the fact that it's so exposed creates a vulnerability, doesn't it?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It absolutely does. I think that's one of the sort of ways in which this is an instructive episode. And obviously, we still don't know for sure. You know, there are still investigations going on. The Finnish Bureau of Investigations, Swedish Prosecutor's Office are both investigating. 
 
But you know, later on Tuesday, several U.S. officials told CNN that they now don't think there were any indications they say of nefarious activities or intentional damage to seafloor infrastructure. They say that it was likely caused by an anchor drag from a passing vessel. 
 
But obviously, the fingers were not directly pointed at Russia. But there was a lot of talk about Russia and the hybrid war tactics that we've seen from them ramping up recently and throughout the war in Ukraine.
 
And the Kremlin has just recently commented on this saying that any accusations that Russia has anything to do with are ridiculous. 
 
But look, alongside the issue of the vulnerability of the seafloor infrastructure, which carries the vast majority of global internet data, this shows just how front of mind these hybrid warfare tactics are for European and U.S. officials. In fact, take a listen to earlier in the day on Tuesday what the German Defense Minister had to say about this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
BORIS PISTORIUS, GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): This is a very clear sign that something is going on here. Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed. And I also don't like to believe inversions that these were anchors that happened to be above these cables and cause damage.
 
So we have to know that without knowing specifically who it came from, that this is a hybrid action. And we also have to assume that without knowing by whom yet that this is sabotage.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Does that suggest that could have been a Russian anchor? I don't know.
 
SEBASTIAN: I mean, look, I don't know. At this point, the investigations are looking into some shipping activity in the area. So there is still a lot more work to be done on this.
 
But obviously, we're getting mixed messages from officials because they don't know either. And as I said, these hybrid warfare tactics are really front of mind. This came on the same day that we got a joint statement from six European foreign ministers, including of Germany, saying Russia is systematically attacking European security architecture. As I said, though, the Kremlin is calling any accusations it was behind this ridiculous.
 
FOSTER: OK, Clare, thank you. 
 
Sweden and Finland have updated guidance meanwhile, for their citizens on how to survive in the event of a war. Excuse me.
 
It comes as NATO allies bolster defense measures amid Russia's war in Ukraine. Millions of booklets are being distributed to households. And an online version available as well.
 
Several tips include advice on stockpiling bottled water, sanitary products, and growing edible food stuffs at home. The Swedish brochure was first published during World War II. 
 
A closer look now at the Russian President's decision to lower the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons. The move is sending a clear and threatening message to the West after the U.S. President gave Ukraine the green light to strike inside Russia. CNN's Brian Todd has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Vladimir Putin once again rattles his nuclear saber at his enemies. The Russian President updating his stance on nuclear weapons just a couple of days after President Biden gave Ukraine permission to hit targets deep inside Russia with American made weapons. 
 
Under Putin's new directive, Russia will consider aggression from any non-nuclear country like Ukraine as a joint attack on Russia if there's participation of a nuclear armed country like the U.S.
 
And at that point, according to Putin's spokesperson, Russia, quote: Reserves the right to use nuclear weapons even if only conventional weapons are used against Russia.
 
EVELYN FARKAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE MCCAIN INSTITUTE: Any time the Russian President threatens use of nuclear weapons, it means he's scared because that is like his fallback when he's very nervous.
 
TODD (voice-over): Under Putin's new stance, Russia could basically use nuclear weapons at any time since U.S. officials say the Ukrainians in recent days have already used American made long range missiles to strike Russian targets well inside Russia.
 
WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: It will enable the Ukrainians to put at risk airfields and ammunition dumps and fuel depots that will, again, disrupt the Russians.
 
TODD (voice-over): The key question, what are the Vladimir Putin really would use nuclear weapons in Ukraine?
 
TAYLOR: We can't dismiss it, but we have some evidence that he doesn't use it in the past and we know that he's not suicidal.
 
FARKAS: There's immediate literal fallout. So there's political fallout in Russia, but also fallout which strikes Russian troops, Russian civilians.
 
TODD (voice-over): Still, at one point during the Ukraine war, according to journalist Bob Woodward's new book, War, President Biden's national security team assessed there was a 50 percent chance Putin would use nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. And CNN's Jim Sciutto reported the U.S. prepared, quote, rigorously for that possibility in late 2022. It would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.
 
Putin's latest nuclear threat, on the heels of Biden's green light for Ukraine to use long range missiles inside Russia, could complicate President-elect Donald Trump's plans to end the Ukraine war quickly after he gets into office. On the other hand --
 
FARKAS: I think it strengthens Donald Trump's hand as he enters office because he will have a Ukraine that continues to have a bargaining chip, a Ukraine that can potentially pressure the Russian president.
 
TODD: When asked if the Biden administration's green light for Ukraine to use those long range American made weapons deep inside Russia was an escalation, two analysts CNN spoke to said that was no escalation compared to the way Putin has repeatedly escalated during this war, including the move to bring in at least 10,000 North Korean troops to join his side in the fight.

FOSTER: Still to come, tennis superstar Rafael Nadal draws to a close his glittering career on the court. Ahead, the heartfelt tributes made to the 22 time Grand Slam champion.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: An emotional Rafael Nadal said goodbye to professional tennis on Tuesday after the last match of his incredible career at the Davis Cup. It wasn't the fairytale ending he was hoping for. The 22 time Grand Slam champion in Spain were ousted from the competition by the Netherlands.
 
CNN's Don Riddell though has more on this historic moment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Well, they say that all good things must come to an end but that doesn't mean that anybody is ready when the end does in fact come. 
 
We have just witnessed the last act of Rafael Nadal's extraordinary tennis career. On Tuesday night in Malaga in front of the Spanish fans who've adored him for so long and surrounded by the teammates that he inspired to play the game. Nadal's remarkable 23 year career came to a close. And it was emotional right from the off even before a ball had been struck. Nadal was tearful during the national anthem before the Davis Cup quarterfinal match against the Netherlands.
 
He had to compose himself quickly because he went out first playing what was his first competitive match in some three months and he did find the going tough. Nadal was beaten in straight sets by Botic van de Zandschulp. 
 
But he wasn't necessarily finished, not quite. If his teammates could win their matches then Spain would survive and prolong his career just a bit. Carlos Alcaraz tried his best but ultimately they lost in the doubles and that was that. 
 
So watching on from the sidelines this was the moment that Nadal knew his wonderful journey as a professional tennis player had come to an end. Everybody knew that it was going to be the end this week at some point but of course everybody was hoping that he'd go out on a high. But in any case the Spanish team was prepared to mark the occasion with a special retirement ceremony. Nadal spoke at length on the court in Spanish and English about his career and this moment. At times, the crowd chanted his name, Rafa, Rafa, Rafa and as he took the applause and as he watched a video of his career highlights that's when the lip began to wobble and the tears began to flow. 
 
Some of his contemporaries, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic Serena Williams, also players known as the GOATS. They were speaking, they were wishing him a fond farewell. They were all saying how much they're going to miss him and quite honestly it was very hard to watch and not be moved as a spectator. 
 
Remember, Nadal won a record 14 French Open titles, 22 Grand Slam singles titles. He was, as I say, one of the big three and he absolutely will be missed. Back to you.

In a recent interview with CBS, Share revealed she was unaware of Bono's company called Cher Enterprises, which collected all the revenue from the duo's work for almost 12 years, but Cher said she owned nothing. Part two of her memoir is due out next year. 
 
England football captain Harry Kane has become the latest sports star to be honored with a statue, but fans aren't that convinced by it. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
Kane posted this picture of him on X smiling with the sculpture saying it was a real proud moment for him. But the statue is drawing criticism over its lack of resemblance actually to the striker while some commented on the post to congratulate Kane. Others asked if he was actually pleased with it. He seems to be, doesn't he? 
 
Automaker Jaguar has unveiled its brand new logo for the electric vehicle age. This, if you remember, was the sports car company's old logo complete with the leaping Jaguar. This is their new one with an entirely different font. Jaguar says it's part of a corporate reset as the company looks to transition itself into an ultra-luxury fully electric brand.
 
As Americans get ready for Thanksgiving next week, there's a new wine you can actually share with family and friends courtesy of Pizza Hut. It is partnered with Irvine's Just Beyond Paradise winery to create a tomato-based wine that apparently captures the essence of a pizza slice with hints of basil, oregano and garlic. But Pizza Hut says it actually tastes more like white wine when it's chilled.
 
You can buy a bottle of the limited edition wine on Irvine's website or just for yourself or as a gift that comes in a pizza box, of course.

JELLY ROLL: You got to go for the neck. 
 
PRINCE HARRY: The neck?
 
JELLY ROLL: I was thinking like my lower back or my a**.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Definitely one way to announce Jelly Roll as the headliner for the closing ceremony of next year's Invictus Games. It's the International Adaptive Sports Tournament for Injured Veterans and Service Personnel, Prince Harry started back in 2014. And we're told the tattoo isn't real, by the way.
