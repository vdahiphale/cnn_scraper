BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: May 24th, 2022. One year ago today, a gunman walked into an elementary school and went on a murderous rampage. He slaughtered 19 schoolchildren and 2 teachers in Uvalde, Texas. 
 
And a botched police response and many still unanswered questions torment the heartbroken families. 
 
Last hour, at 12:49 local time, church bells rang out to mark the moment that police finally answered the classroom. Also today across the state, Texas held a moment of silence. And statewide, flags are flying at half-staff. 
 
Next hour, President Biden is scheduled to speak and call on Congress to confront the nation's gun violence epidemic. 
 
CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is joining us now from Uvalde.
 
Where this is a community that is coping still a year later, Shimon? 
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, coping, I think, feeling a lot of anger, a lot of anxiety. 
 
I was just talking to some family members that we featured in our documentary Sunday night. They actually came here and dropped off flowers, 
 
Mia Cerrillo, who was one of the girls who called 911, as she's on that bus with the other students who were rescued, some 77 minutes after, and they came here to lay flowers. 
 
But you can tell that this is really affecting the families today and the survivors. You can just see it. You can just feel it. There were tears in her eyes. 
 
And you could -- you know, having been around these people for a little while now, there's definitely a different feeling today than there has been any other day that I've certainly seen them. It's just really sad to see. I can only imagine the memories this must bring back for many of the
 
 survivors and for these families, who a year ago were on the streets here, as police were, at this point, rescuing their kids or some of these parents finding out that their kids were being brought to a hospital. 
 
Parents on this day were out here for over an hour awaiting answers. 
 
And to think about this, Brianna, we're now a year later and they're still waiting for answers and trying to get some sense of what exactly happened here. 
 
That's what they're dealing with here. Today is a lot about the grief, a lot about the suffering, the sadness.
 
There's also anger. Because they just feel like they can't move forward right now without these answers, without getting the support of many of the political leaders and the community leaders here, and law enforcement. 
 
So, a lot of work, but today is certainly a day about those families, about the kids who died and those who are survived. 
 
KEILAR: Today is a day about remembrance. They also do want these answers. What are the questions that weigh most heavily on them? And why do they feel that officials are not being forthcoming with them? 
 
PROKUPECZ: So, they definitely feel that there is protection. That a lot of the law enforcement officials, the leaders, the decision makers are being protected. 
 <br>[14:35:57]
 
And they are also then protecting some of the officers that were here, because some of the officers who were here on that same very -- on that day still are employed by the Uvalde Police Department. 
 
And that's certainly very upsetting for them. There's a sense of anxiety here about that, about law enforcement. 
 
So they feel, in some ways, no one wants to hold anyone accountable for what happened. Because it is embarrassing. It could potentially hurt political leaders. 
 
You know, it's interesting where we're not seeing the governor here. You're not seeing any of the other local leaders here right now, because simply, the families don't want them around. 
 
They feel that everyone here has failed them. And that they continue to fail them. And so they don't want any of these people around. 
 
The biggest question, obviously, is what took so long? Why did it take 77 minutes for these officers to finally reach the classroom. 
 
And for the families whose kids died, they want to know specifically how they died and how they suffered. And that is something that they really, really want to know, because they feel it could give some closure over what happened here -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: Shimon Prokupecz, in Uvalde, thank you so much. 
 
To walk through the streets of Uvalde is really to be reminded of these 19 children and the two teachers that this community lost. 
 
This is some of what you can see from the sidewalks and the store windows downtown. It is an enormous labor of love to ensure that they're never forgotten.
 
These are some of the 21 murals curated from artists across Texas. So 10-year-old Tess Marie Notta, who loved softball. She was wearing her grandmother's bracelet when she was beard. 
 
Erma Garcia, who taught at Robb Elementary for her entire 23-year career. And her husband there, he died of a heart attack two days after the shooting. They were high school sweethearts. 
 
And 10-year-old Mayte Rodriguez told her parents she wanted to be a marine biologist. And 10-year-old Lexy Rubio, who was a star on her basketball team. And 11-year-old Miranda Mathis, who loved collecting rocks and feathers at the river. 
 
Jaise, Jayla, and Xavier Lopez, all of them 10 years old. And 9-year- old Jacqueline Casarez. Her dream was to go to Paris and see the Eiffel Tower. 
 
And 11-year-old Lei Salazar, who was the fastest runner in her class. And 10-year-old Navaeh Alyssa Bravo whose parents say she was a total daddy's girl. 
 
Eva Morales, a dedicated fourth grade teacher and a talented karaoke singer who left behind a 23-year-old daughter. And 10-year-old Rogelio Torres. He had an impressive collection of Pokemon cards that he was very, very proud of. 
 
And then there was 10-year-old Amory Joe Garza, who died a hero, calling 911 from her classroom. The muralist added a bronze star to her lavender dress. 
 
The man who oversaw this project is an art teacher at Uvalde college and he told the Smithsonian that he didn't want these 21 murals to be just paintings. He wanted them to be American monuments, because these children and these teachers deserve to be honored and remembered.

JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: This just into CNN. CNN has learned that Ron DeSantis, Florida governor, has filed to run for president in 2024. Of course, this long-anticipated. This move now makes it official. 
 
We will continue to cover as other events are planned for today, including a conversation on Twitter. 
 
The headline there, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has filed to run for president in 2024. 
 
Another story we're following right now, an important court hearing underway in a civil lawsuit filed in the family of Gabby Petito against the parents of Brian Laundrie.
 
That comes nearly two years after Petito's killing and then Laundrie's disappearance and his subsequent death. 
 
One of the key rulings we are expecting centers on whether a letter Laundrie's mother wrote to her son labeled "Burn after Reading" can be handed over to the Petitos. 
 
CNN's Jean Casarez has been following this story for us.
 
Jean, tell us the importance of this letter and what you're learning so far about the Petito family's demands here. 
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The hearing is underway right now. What they're initially arguing, and this is the Laundrie's family, they're arguing to dismiss the entire complaint. 
 
Now, they've tried this before unsuccessfully. They're trying it again today. 
 
They have not gotten to the portion yet, though, with what you're talking about, Jim. 
 
The family, the Laundrie family is asking for what is called legally a protective order, because they hold a letter, a letter that was found in a backpack next to Brian Laundrie's remains. It was Brian's backpack. And that letter was written by Roberta Laundrie to her son, Brian. 
 
Now, we have not seen the letter. They don't want to turn it over to the Petito family in this case, which involves intentional infliction of emotional distress, because they say it's not relevant, we don't have a duty.
 <br>[14:45:55]
 
But we heard in a prior hearing from the Petito attorney, who has seen the letter at the office of the FBI, said that the letter says, in part, quote, "burying a body, refers to providing a shovel. And also refers to baking a cake with a shiv in it." 
 
This is written by Roberta Laundrie. And she admits she wrote this letter to her son, Brian Laundrie, found in his backpack next to his remains when they were found in the Carlton Reserve. 
 
Roberta Laundrie has alleged in legal documents, this letter is not dated. I wrote this a long time before he and Gabby went on that trip and it was to repair our relationship. 
 
We were not on good terms at times, Brian and myself. And we had read books together and I wanted to bring us together again from some of the quotes from some of those books, and that's what it was referring to. 
 
And "Burn After Reading," well, Gabby had bought a book, "Burn After Writing," and we always laughed about that, and that's why I wrote that on the outside of the letter. 
 
The Petitos believe it is very relevant, because they are saying, you knew what had happened to Gabby. You would not answer our calls. You blocked us on Facebook. You blocked our texts. You wouldn't respond to us. And that emotionally destroyed us, and so this is outrageous behavior under the law. 
 
SCIUTTO: Goodness. Those phrases about burying the body and get you a shovel. 
 
I understand you have some new reporting as well on the case of the Idaho murders, the case of Bryan Kohberger, the man indicted for the murder of those four University of Idaho students that we've been following closely on this broadcast. What are we learning? 
 
CASAREZ: We have just confirmed -- and we this is in Pennsylvania. We have confirmed with a source that is familiar with the situation that there is an investigative grand jury in Pennsylvania that has already heard testimony via subpoena -- they did not come voluntarily, they were subpoenaed. 
 
The mother of Bryan Kohberger has already testified before an investigative grand jury. The father is set to testify before a grand jury. We understand that is set for tomorrow. We do not know what this is in regard to at all. 
 
But what we know are the facts. And that is that an investigative grand jury in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, can only look at potential crimes in that county, in Monroe County. 
 
Of course, this is where the family home was. It's where Brian and his father drove to, where he would spend the holidays with, when, at the time, he was arrested. 
 
But one other thing that can be done with an investigative grand jury, they can offer a presentment of what they believe should be crimes. They can say that they don't believe there are any crimes. 
 
Additionally, under the law, the judge and the district attorney in Monroe County can send the transcript of any testimony to another jurisdiction with another investigation. So in this case, it would be Idaho. 
 
They can do that because that transcript is an official record and it can get in the hands of the prosecutor. 
 
SCIUTTO: Notable, because Kohberger drove across country with his father following those murders, went to his home. There were questions about what he was doing there, what he was disposing of. 
 
I know you'll bring us the latest when you have it. 
 
Jean Casarez, thanks very much. 
 
We'll be back with much more.

BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: It is the end of a streaming era. Netflix is officially beginning its crackdown on users who share passwords here in the United States. So no more letting your bestie binge of "Bridgerton" or "Seinfeld" on your dime. 
 
After years of turning a blind eye to password sharing, Netflix is putting an end to free rides. Saying, quote, "Your Netflix account is for you and for people who live, your household." 
 
CNN's Brian Fung joins us with more. 
 
Brian, perhaps not a surprise Netflix saw its earnings decline in the last 12 months. How are they going to enforce this? 
 
BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: Boris, the whole "we're going to make you pay" thing is going to be I.P. address based. They'll look at where you're located, and if you're not located in the same household as the subscriber, that's going to be a big clue. 
 
As you mentioned, they're going to try to make people who are sharing passwords either create a new account and migrate their profiles over or have the subscriber add someone to their account for another $8 a month. 
 
Now as you said, Netflix has long turned a blind eye to this. But because of their subscriber issues, they've had to really find new ways to gain revenue. And you know, we're talking about a lot of potential money here. 
 
Netflix estimates that as many as 100 people worldwide are password sharers. And if you do the math here, you quickly find out, if everyone paid that $8 a month, that's $800 million a month in Netflix's pocket. So a really big deal -- Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: Huge deal. More potential money for streaming rights and productions. Obviously, it could lead to certain squabbles in our personal lives, right? 
 
I'm wondering is there any indication, Brian, that perhaps using a VPN, virtual private network, you might be able to get around the Netflix -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 <br>[14:55:57]
 
FUNG: That's a great question. I think it's something a lot of people will probably try. Netflix will have probably some issues with people losing -- some people ending their subscriptions deciding not to use Netflix. 
 
As you pointed out, this is a very hyper-competitive streaming environment where there's constantly great content being put out by all manner of providers. But Netflix clearly thinks this is worth the risk. 
 
SANCHEZ: Is there any indication that perhaps other streaming networks might be considering a similar move? 
 
FUNG: That's a great question. I think a lot of other networks are going to be watching very closely to see what happens with Netflix and if there's any potential consumer fallout. That will be a really big sign for them going forward -- Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. See a lot of awkward conversations with exes in this situation. 
 
Brian Fung, thank you so much for breaking that down for us. 
 
We have news to report right now. We're going to send it over to Brianna and Jim. 
 
I believe there's some breaking news. 
 
SCIUTTO: Breaking news just into CNN. And it's sad news. Tina Turner, music legend, icon through decades, has died. She was 83 years old. 
 
CNN's Stephanie Elam has more on her incredible life and musical legacy. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(SINGING)
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): "Proud Mary" was one of Tina Turner's signatures, showcasing her unique sound, look and moves. 
 
TINA TURNER, SINGER: That's my style. I take great songs and turn them into rock and roll songs. 
 
ELAM: Icon, survivor, a queen of rock and roll. 
 
Tina Turner began life as Anna May Bullock in rural Tennessee. As a teenager, she moved to St. Louis, where she met rocker, Ike Turner. 
 
TURNER: Ike was very good to me when I started my career. Started to sing weekends with him. We were really close friends.
 
ELAM: The Ike and Tina Turner Review's first hit came in 1960 with "A Fool in Love," a song they performed on "Shin Dig." 
 
They married in 1962 and, in 1966, recorded "River Deep Mountain High." 
 
(SINGING) ELAM: It was a hit overseas but flopped in the U.S. 
 
Off stage, Ike's drug abuse fueled violent outbursts. 
 
TURNER: I had had a lot of violence. Houses burned. Cars shot into. The lowest that you can think of in terms of violence. 
 
ELAM: After years of physical and emotional abuse, Tina left Ike in the mid '70s with nothing but her name. At one point, relying on food stamps to survive. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: In the early '80s, Turner's cover of "Let's Stay Together" reignited her career. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: "Private Dancer" followed in 1984. A runaway critical and commercial success. The album featured her only number-one song.
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: Though she wasn't a fan. 
 
TURNER: I didn't like it. I wasn't accustomed to singing those kinds of songs. 
 
ELAM: It was also the title of a 1993 film based on Tina's autobiography. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the picture do it justice? 
 
TURNER: I would have liked for them to have had more truth. But it's impossible. People would not have believed the truth. 
 
ELAM: Turner herself appeared in movies such as the Who's "Tommy" and "Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome." She sang its theme song. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: As well as the theme to the James Bond film, "Golden Eye." 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: One major role she turned down would go to Oprah Winfrey in "The Color Purple." 
 
TURNER: It was too close to my personal life. I had just left such a life. Too soon to be reminded. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: The "What's Love Got to Do with It" soundtrack gave Turner another hit. Her personal favorite? 
 
(SINGING)
 
TURNER: It was special because, at the time, no one believed in it but me. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: Turner continued recording and touring into her 80s. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM: She was honored by the Kennedy Center in 2005 and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo act in 2021, 30 years after of her first induction as part of a duo with Ike Turner. 
 
All the while, her Buddhist faith kept her going. 
 
TURNER: Because you make this lifetime, it could be the effect of a better life next lifetime. It will be better. And gets better and better. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[14:59:50]
 
SCIUTTO: The sad news we have to report. Tina Turner, music legend through decades, has passed way. She was 83 years old. A star really in the '60s, '70s, the '80s, well into the later years of her life. 
 
We're joined by Stephanie Elam, who, of course, just told her story there.</pre>
