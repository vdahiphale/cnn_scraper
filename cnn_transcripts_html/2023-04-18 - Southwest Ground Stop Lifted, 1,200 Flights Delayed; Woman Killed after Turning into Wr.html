JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  We have breaking news. A ground stop just lifted after a nationwide halt of Southwest Airlines flights. The airline dealing with what they're calling a major technical issue. We're getting new reporting in for the thousands and thousands of people affected by this. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It may happen any moment; the Supreme Court could determine the fate of a commonly used abortion drug as soon as today. We're outside the court with the very latest. 
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  A jury has just been selected in the historic defamation lawsuit against FOX News. The latest from inside the courtroom, including what we're learning about the jurors. 
 
These major stories and more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.

BERMAN (voice-over):  All right, the breaking news:  a nationwide ground stop for Southwest Airlines was lifted just moments ago. Now the Federal Aviation Administration had issued that stop after Southwest reported intermittent technology issues. As you can imagine, this means all kinds of delays. 
 
We've counted 1,200, at least at this point. CNN's aviation correspondent. Pete Muntean is here with all the details. 
 
Stop lifted but imagine a lot of problems coming, Pete. 
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You know, we'll see the ripple effect here, John, this ground stop by Southwest Airlines were laid by the FAA, lasted only about 20 minutes. But we are seeing the delays continue to pile up. 
 
At 10:30, there were 800 nationwide. Now we're up to 1,249 according to FlightAware. That's 30 percent of Southwest's entire schedule for the day coast to coast. We see in these incidents that once something like this happened, there is a big domino effect. 
 
So we will see how quickly this does truly resolve itself for Southwest Airlines and at airports across the country. 
 
What's interesting here, John, is that we have just heard there is a departure delay for flights going into Dallas Love Field, which is one of Southwest Airlines' biggest hubs, because simply, because of these delayed flights, they do not have enough gate space. 
 
We first found out about this from a tweet from Southwest Airlines, relaying its message to a customer that was complaining about these delays. It said there were intermittent technology issues. The FAA put out this ground stop around 10:30 this morning on the East Coast due to equipment issues, according to the FAA. 
 
Still not totally clear what these equipment issues actually were and how similar this is to the holiday meltdown that Southwest Airlines experienced, stranding tens of thousands of customers nationwide over the Christmas and New Year's holidays. 
 
We're talking 17,000 flights were canceled during that period, John, so this may not be near as big as that meltdown, although still very significant for an airline that really took it on the chin reputation wise, when it had that meltdown at the end of last year. 
 
BERMAN:  So let me get this right. 
 
We still don't know why the ground stop was issued or what exactly the technical reasons were that Southwest was backed up today. Apparently they feel they've got that situation fixed. 
 
But now there's a backup and the reason there are concerns about this, particularly with Southwest, is what we saw in December, when you had so many people just stranded. 
 
MUNTEAN:  The issue with the holiday meltdown was there was big time weather across many parts of the country. And Southwest had planes and crews out of position en masse. In fact, at some point Southwest was flying planes that were completely empty, trying to get them back into position. 
 
And that just simply seemed to fail over and over again. In this case, we are not sure if it's the scheduling system that Southwest had that meltdown with over the holidays. This could be something completely different -- not to speculate. But it could be an operational system. 
 
Might be something as simple as not being able to get weather to its pilots. We just don't know from Southwest Airlines just yet. We've not actually gotten an individual statement from them. We're putting this all together from what the FAA is telling us and what the information is from FlightAware. And the delays just keep going up. 
 
John. 
 <br>[11:05:00] BERMAN:  Well, if anyone can get to the bottom of it, you, Pete, it is you. We'll let you work the phones for a little bit. Let us know what you find out about this and if these delays start being alleviated. Appreciate it. 
 
Sara. 
 
SIDNER:  All right, we're waiting for an 84 year old man, charged in the shooting of a 16 year old boy, to turn himself in. Andrew Lester is charged with two felonies after shooting Ralph Yarl when the teenager went accidentally to the wrong house, trying to pick up his twin brothers. 
 
Lester told police he was scared to death and he fired his gun because he thought the teen was trying to break in. But the teen only pressed the doorbell. Thankfully, Ralph survived the shooting and is now recovering at his home. 
 
His aunt telling CNN he has a long road ahead. 
 
FAITH SPOONMORE, RALPH'S AUNT:  There's a major part of Ralph that died on Thursday. What Ralph went through, like he lost a part of himself that day. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE).
 
SPOONMORE:  A lot has changed since that happened. The way in which he's going to walk through this world, it's going to be totally different because of what happened. There's a lot of healing that's going to have to happen after that event. 
 
And every single day is a challenge. Every hour is a different story. And it's a long road, so he's -- right now he's just healing.

SIDNER:  Truly innocence lost. CNN's Lucy Kafanov is following this for us. 
 
Lucy, what more are you hearing this morning?
 
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you said, Sara, the focus now is when this 84 year old suspected gunman is going to turn himself into police custody. And I want to give you a sense of sort of the geography and the choreography of what unfolded on that day. 
 
This incident took place on the porch of the home behind me; 84 year old Andrew Lester told police that Ralph Yarl pulled up to this house, that he rang his doorbell. But Ralph had made a mistake. This home is located on 115th Street; the home where Ralph was supposed to pick his younger siblings is about one block away, 115th Terrace. 
 
That mistake nearly costing him his life. Now Lester is facing two charges, the first of which, armed criminal action, could earn him 3 to 15 years behind bars. The more serious charge, which is first degree felony assault, could see him spend the rest of his life in prison. 
 
And we've been here, Sara, for the past two days. It does not appear that anyone's been home there. We -- again we are waiting for this 84 year old suspected gunman, suspected shooter to turn himself into police custody. 
 
Ralph, we know, is recovering at home. But of course, there's the physical recovery but also the emotional trauma that is going to take a very long time to heal from -- Sara. 
 
SIDNER:  Yes, really good report. Thank you so much, Lucy Kafanov -- Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Now a man is now charged in upstate New York with second degree murder, the circumstances surrounding it extremely troubling. He's accused of shooting this young woman, what you're looking at right here, Kaylan Gillis, for simply and accidentally pulling up to his house. 
 
Twenty year old Kaylan Gillis and three friends turned into his driveway, looking for a friend's house Saturday night. Police say that is when this man, 65 year old Kevin Monahan, allegedly fired two shots at the car from his porch. 
 
One struck Gillis and she later died as her friends and emergency services desperately tried to get her help. Brynn Gingras has much more on this. 
 
And since we heard from you last hour, you were able to speak with one of Kaylan Gillis' friends. 
 
What are they telling you?
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  OK, so this is actually someone who took Kaylin Gillis' senior portrait, a member of that community, who they, she said, as far as the community concerned, they're just in a spectrum of emotions, from disbelief to shock to grief for this family, who many people know quite well. 
 
And she said that she just remembered Kaylin as someone who is very determined about how she wanted her senior portraits taken -- in a good way. And she says she certainly remembers her smile, speaking so lovingly and affectionate about Kaylin so much she would see often, who she apparently worked in a store in that community. 
 
So you can imagine the community just going through all these emotions like I just talked about over this senseless tragedy. As far as the suspect is concerned, 65 year old Kevin Monahan, it's unclear if he's gone before a judge just yet. 
 
But he has a second degree murder charge for this incident that took place over the weekend. And you described some of it. But just to give you a little bit more context, this happened in Hebron, New York. It is a part of the state that doesn't have -- is a very rural area, doesn't have great cell phone reception. And the sheriff said that she was with her three friends in the car.
 
 They were looking for another friend's house, didn't have GPS, trying to find that friend's house, pulled into the driveway of this suspect, Monahan, and then realized quickly that they were at the wrong home but not before Monahan fired two shots at that car. 
 
It then took those friends to drive away about five miles and to be able to call 9-1-1. 
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
GINGRAS:  And Kaylin, with paramedics arriving, sadly died on the scene. Authorities also say, when they went to arrest Monahan, he didn't come out quietly. There was about an hour or so stand up, didn't say anything incriminating. 
 
But as far as authorities believe, nothing was even said to him when the car pulled into that driveway. And when they left, again, just a senseless, senseless tragedy. There's a GoFundMe page for Kaylin and her family. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Thank you so much for giving us what we know to this point. 
 
Let's get some more information right now from the sheriff. Joining us now is the sheriff for Washington County, New York, Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy. 
 
Sheriff, thank you so much for taking the time. We have the -- we have -- the latest -- the latest we heard was from you in this press conference that we have learned. 
 
But what more have you learned about what happened when Kaylin Gillis and her friends pulled into this driveway this weekend?
 
SHERIFF JEFFREY MURPHY, WASHINGTON COUNTY, NEW YORK:  Yes, just as stated, this was a tragic incident, where, you know, these -- these young adults were looking for a friend's house and again, you know, it's a rural area -- dirt roads, dirt driveways, easily to get confused and went up the wrong driveway and noticed their mistake. 
 
And then tried to turn around and go out of the driveway. And that's when Mr. Monahan came out to his deck and fired two shots. 
 
BOLDUAN:  As they were trying to leave, is when -- is your understanding of when he opened fire.
 
Do you have any sense at this point, Sheriff, of why he fired, why he shot at the car? 
 
MURPHY:  Unfortunately, Mr. Monahan was not cooperative at the scene and as he's used to speak with us or come down the driveway, certainly we weren't going to send officers up to his house. The house is on a hill. So, technically, that wouldn't (INAUDIBLE).
 
But, he did, you know, was taken into custody by the state. Police actually, their special weapons team. But he has not made any statement. He obtained a lawyer before he came out of the house. He has not made any statements and, quite frankly, has not shown any remorse in this case. 
 
BOLDUAN:  No remorse, nothing at all in this senseless tragedy. 
 
MURPHY:  No, you know, and if I could (INAUDIBLE) you know, as stated, Kaylin was a kind, beautiful soul, was an honor student. She loved art and Disney. She was planning on moving to Florida, to start college, marine biology. 
 
And you know, it's a case like this is just absolutely senseless. 
 
BOLDUAN:  And Sheriff, I think that you had mentioned at the press conference that Kaylin Gillis' family. 
 
Do how they are doing?
 
And how does this -- how does this hit you and knowing that family? 
 
MURPHY:  Yes, we've been in contact with the family quite a bit, make sure that they're doing OK and that their needs are met and to keep them as informed as possible in this case. 
 
And, yes, I have a daughter, you know. So, obviously, that plays into your thoughts and in cases like this. And again, it's just a senseless tragedy. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Were any words exchanged between -- the --  I'm going to call them kids, these young adults in the car and Monahan before -- are you getting any sense.? 
 
It's so senseless, everyone's just trying to grasp for more details of what would take -- what would bring someone to the point of opening up fire on a car as it's trying to pull out of your driveway. 
 
MURPHY:  You know, I can't say that the other young adults that are involved in this, so the passengers in the vehicle, they're -- under the circumstances, they were remarkably --  they're -- they were very good at giving us information, especially for the little time that they spent in the driveway. 
 
They all concur that it was a very short time that they realized that they were at the wrong house. And due to the lack of service and GPS, they were turning around and they were leaving. 
 
As you said, you know, there's absolutely no reason for this man to come out on the deck and shoot at the vehicle, especially when they're leaving. So, you know, in the -- in the trauma that these young adults have endured with this as well and, like I said, I can't say enough about them. 
 
They finally got cell service. They finally were able to connect with our public safety dispatch, which did an excellent job in guiding them to a location where they could be met by patrols and an ambulance out in the middle of this rural area. 
 
BOLDUAN:  And Sheriff, I mean, this man is now charged with second degree murder. 
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
BOLDUAN:  And the justice -- you know, and the -- and the justice system will work its will. And this will work its way as it should. 
 
Do you have any thoughts as the investigation will continue but this is now moving into kind of a different, I would say, kind of a different part of your investigation, of what should happen to this man, Kevin Monahan? 
 
MURPHY:  Yes, I -- you know, this subject, like I said, he was not threatened at all. The kids didn't get out of their cars. They didn't say anything. There was no words exchanged. 
 
You know, they were turning around, as I said, leaving. So there certainly was no threat. So, you know, I'm hopeful that we will be able to get a successful prosecution in this case and that justice is served for the Gillis family and for Kaylin. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Yes. And still just disbelief why something like this would have to happen for just one accident, on accidental turn into the wrong driveway on a Saturday night. Sheriff, thank you for coming on. We'll stay very close to this investigation -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  All right.

SIDNER:  There are still no arrest days after someone shot and killed young people and left 32 others injured at a sweet 16 birthday party in Dadeville, Alabama. The sister and mother of one of the victims, Philstavious Dowdell, spoke to CNN. His sister was there when her brother was shot.

ALEXIS DOWDELL, PHIL'S SISTER:  Hey, my brother and I turned them over and I was telling him, I was like, you fine, like you going to make it, you strong. 
 
LATONYA ALLEN, PHIL'S MOTHER:  It was a nightmare, I just -- a nightmare I just saw that a nightmare that I don't wish on any parent. It just goes to go and see my baby laying down. You know in a pile of blood (ph).

SIDNER:  So much pain there. 
 
We're also learning more about another victim, 19 year old Marsiah Collins, who was an aspiring musician, looking forward to attending LSU in the fall. 
 
Newly released body camera footage shows firefighters and sheriff's deputies rushing to help actor Jeremy Renner after a nearly deadly snowplow accident. "The Avengers" actor says he broke more than 30 bones and suffered other severe injuries. 
 
Today the Supreme Court is hearing a major religious liberty case that could clarify how far employers must go to accommodate the religious beliefs of their workers. A Pennsylvania postal worker, who said his Christian beliefs bar him from working on Sundays, is suing USPS, saying he was discriminated against because of his religion -- John. 
 
BERMAN:  A busy day at the Supreme Court because the court could decide as soon as today whether millions of women can have access to the abortion pill, mifepristone. 
 
The anti abortion group that initially brought the case is up against a new deadline, which is like one hour from now, to submit additional filings to the high court, all why the temporary hold on a lower court's ruling to restrict access to the drug is set to expire at 11 pm tomorrow night, 
 
CNN's Jessica Schneider outside the court this morning. 
 
Jessica, walk us through the process here. 
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  The Supreme Court, John, actually does have a few options here. So they could decide before 11:59 tomorrow night to actually extend the stay, meaning extending that pause on any restrictions on the abortion pill. That's what the FDA wants. 
 
That's what the Biden administration wants. Or the Supreme Court could simply do nothing, let that stay expire. 
 
Well, what would happen at that point?
 
Well the Fifth Circuit's ruling would then go into effect. And that ruling says that the FDA would have to really change the way this drug is administered. It would no longer be allowed for women over six weeks pregnant. Right now, it's allowed for women up to 10 weeks pregnant. 
 
Women also wouldn't be able to get this drug in the mail and they wouldn't be able to do it via telehealth visit with their doctor. They would have to do everything in person. 
 
The FDA has already said to the court that it is creating a lot of -- a lot of confusion as to exactly how they would make these changes so quickly if the Supreme Court doesn't extend this pause. 
 
And in fact, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin, he spoke on the Senate floor yesterday, talking about just how much confusion all of these court rulings have given to doctors and patients. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  Erasing a constitutional right that had been on the books for 50 years, the right wing majority opened the floodgates for new laws and new rulings and even criminalizing abortion. 
 
And the laws seem to be changing almost every week. Doctors have no idea if the care they provide today will be legal tomorrow. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHNEIDER:  In this case itself has really been in flux for almost two weeks now; about  1.5 weeks ago that Texas judge issuing that decision, saying that all FDA approval of the abortion pill had to be halted. 
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
SCHNEIDER:  That has not been into effect. In fact, none of the changes that these lower courts have made have been in effect, all because of the Supreme Court stepped in last week. We will see what they do in the coming hours. 
 
The briefs by those anti abortion doctors due in less than an hour before noon. And then we're expecting a reply from DOJ as well as the drug manufacturer, Danco. And then it's up to the Supreme Court about what to do next year, John. 
 
Will they let those restrictions go into effect or will they continue the pause on all this while the appeals process plays out? We'll see. 
 
John.
 
BERMAN:  The clock is ticking. Jessica Schneider, we know you will keep us posted. Thank you so much for your reporting.
