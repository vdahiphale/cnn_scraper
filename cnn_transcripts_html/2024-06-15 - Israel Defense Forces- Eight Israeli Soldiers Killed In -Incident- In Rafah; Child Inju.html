FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.
 
This "BREAKING NEWS" from the Middle East right now. The IDF says eight Israeli soldiers were killed during what they are calling an incident in Rafah. It marks one of the deadliest single incidents for Israeli forces since October 7th.
 
CNN's Paula Hancocks is live for us in Tel Aviv. Paula, what more can you tell us?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, we understand this happened in the western area of Rafah. It's an area where there has been fighting over recent days.
 
Now, the IDF saying eight soldiers have been killed in these particular incidents. They are looking into it, investigating, finding out the cause of what happened. As you say, it is one of the deadliest days from the Israeli military side since October 7th.
 
Now, what we're hearing is a statement as well from Hamas, they say that they carried out this attack, they called it a complex ambush, saying that they had attacked vehicles. First of all, the military bulldozer, which was then in flames, and subsequently an APC, which had gone to the rescue of those on the bulldozer. The IDF says, as I say. They are looking into the cause of what exactly happened.
 
But we do know that there had been fighting in that area. This is the Tel Al-Sultan area of Western Rafah. We heard from a member of the media office in Gaza that they had heard artillery and shelling, they say, since dawn. They'd had a number of phone calls asking for injured to be picked up, asking for bodies to be retrieved, with said that it was simply too dangerous to get to some of those areas because of the ongoing Israeli military operation.
 
Now on Friday, the IDF said that they had uncovered a number of tunnels in this particular area, also saying that they had found a large quantity of weapons. Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: And then, separately, Paula, you also have new reporting on the struggles of children trapped in Gaza. The desperately need medical treatment?
 
HANCOCKS: That's right. This is a real issue now since the Rafah crossing has been closed for some 5-1/2 weeks. Those desperately needing medical treatment simply can't get out of Gaza. Now, I must warn you this report has some very distressing images in it. In particular, one girl called Hanan, but her parents asked us to show these images so the world can see what their daughter is going through.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANCOCKS (voice over): Hanan Aqel had gone out to buy some sweets when the air strike hit.
 
HANCOCKS (voice over): I miss seeing mama, she says. I miss my mama and my sisters. 9-year-old Hanan has not been able to open her eyes since the strike 10 days ago. Doctors say she has 20 percent burns on her face, hands, chest, and leg.
 
One of thousands of patients trapped inside Gaza without hope of the treatment they need.
 
Her mother says, she tells me, I want to play. What have I done to deserve this? She can't sleep properly because of the pain, her whole- body hurts.
 
Surrounded by war for eight months, this was Hannah and just hours before she was hit. They had been forced to leave their home in Rafah when the Israeli military moved in and were sheltering in someone's garden in Al-Breej (PH) says.
 
Hanan says, my sister went to a grandfather and asked for one shackle for her and one for me. I went to the shop and was about to pay the man and a missile fell. I didn't hear the whizzing; I just saw a red light.
 
Hanan's doctor says she was in critical condition when she arrived.
 
They removed shrapnel from her face and reconstructed her nose. He says they now have no choice but to wait to transfer her out of Gaza, hoping her wounds don't get infected.
 
Most children need medical transfers, he says, for a more qualified treatment than here. We don't have the treatment, the tools; we don't have the supplies.
 <br>[12:05:03]
 
The Rafah crossing has been closed since May 7th, when the Israeli military took control. Egypt says it will not open the crossing until the Israeli military withdraws for security reasons. One Egyptian soldier was killed last month in fighting along the border.
 
Israel says they will not hand over control of the crossing to Palestinian authorities, fearing Hamas would use the area to smuggling weapons.
 
DR. RIK PEEPERKORN, REPRESENTATIVE FOR WEST BANK AND GAZA, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: The Rafah crossing should be reopened as quickly as possible or there should be an alternative. We have no estimation at the moment how many of the patients, which should have left, actually have already passed away.
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over): Khloud Al-Sharqi says she was displaced three times while pregnant. Her baby, Malak, born four days earlier, has a heart defect, spending most of her young life in an incubator.
 
The doctors did what was necessary, she says. But they said that she must be transferred out of Gaza quickly.
 
She adds, one of the doctors told me not to have high hopes. That sentence is so difficult to hear.
 
Malak is not the only baby desperately needing medical treatment outside of Gaza. Her doctor confirms if these children do not get treatment, they are likely to die.
 
Ali Darwish has a broken spine, ribs and leg after an airstrike hit his house, killing his siblings, his aunt says. Without urgent specialized treatment outside of Gaza, she has been told by doctors he may be paralyzed. For these children, a escaping Gaza may be their only hope for the future.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANCOCKS (on camera): With Israel and Egypt still blaming each other for the Rafah crossing still being closed, time is literally running out for some of the more critical patients trapped in Gaza. Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: Paula Hancocks, thank you so much. So, this latest incident in Gaza comes as leaders from around the world are meeting for a peace summit. More than 100 nations and organizations are gathering in Switzerland where they are discussing the war in Ukraine.
 
Earlier today, Vice President Kamala Harris held a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
 
CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, joining us now with more on this. So, Nic, notably absent from this peace summit are officials from both Russia and China. So, what do attendees realistically hope to accomplish?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, they know that they are not going to walk away with a peace deal that Russia is going to sign up to. Russia's, as you say, is not even there. The aim of this, and I have to say, you look around the room there in Switzerland, where we've just heard from the Swiss president who's spoken to the 101 countries and international organizations -- more than 50 leaders there. It's a huge number, I can't remember seeing that many leaders all together in one room like that before, and we're expecting Kamala Harris to speak to them as well.
 
Clearly, they are not going to get peace here. And that's what we heard from the Swiss president, when she introduced this. He said, look, we're here, high in the mountains. The mountains are a reminder of the path ahead. It's high, and it's tough, but you go one step at a time.
 
But what she said they want to do, is to get a comprehensive agreement and support for a just and lasting peace for Ukraine and for Russia, of course. That abides by the U.N. Charter.
 
Now, the U.N. Charter says that it must be done on the terms of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. And that really underscores why Russia isn't there, because that would mean Russia would have to pull its troops out of all those areas of Ukraine that it's illegally occupied and annexed. They calls them part of Russia now, but that's not recognized by the international community. And that really tells you just how far this has to go. And the war is still going on, people are still dying today.
 
But this is a first initiative. And by bringing together so many countries, and so many heads of state, the idea is to get this very broad consensus, which sends a very clear message to Vladimir Putin who won't come now that the terms are being set for what peace should look like.
 
And as the Swiss president said, he will or Russia will be -- will need to be in the room to discuss this ultimately, after these many, many steps in this process. But it's setting the conditions and terms for what the final outcome is going to look like that is agreed to by all these countries. And that's pretty powerful. That's a powerful aspiration.
 
WHITFIELD: It is indeed. All right. Nic Robertson, we'll leave it there for now. Thank you so much.
 
All right, still to come this hour.
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
All eyes on Buckingham Palace today as the Princess of Wales makes her first public appearance in months, live to London next.
 
Plus, dangerous heat is gripping much of this country this weekend. We'll tell you what cities could see records toppled.
 
And with less than two weeks before the first presidential debate of 2024, CNN has released new details on the ground rules both campaigns have agreed upon. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:15:09]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. This morning, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, made her first public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis in March. And she joins her family and other Royals on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, as you see right there to actually celebrate the king's 75th birthday and enjoy the Trooping the Colour military parade
 
Kate and Charles shocking the world in March when they each revealed they had been diagnosed with cancer. And since then, neither of them have said what type of cancer that they are actually being treated for.
 
I want to bring in now, CNN's Nada Bashir in London. Nada, great to see you. So, what was the public's reaction to seeing the princess? I know this is really the king's day, but it kind of felt like more it was her day with people so, you know, anticipating her appearance.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: Absolutely, Fredricka. I mean, this is an event which typically annually draws huge crowds outside of Buckingham Palace to mark the king's official birthday, not his real birthday.
 
But, of course, many of those who attended the Trooping the Colour ceremony earlier today we're here to catch a glimpse of the Princess of Wales, Catherine. This was, of course, her first public appearance since making that shock announcement to the British public that she is undergoing treatment for cancer.
 
And then actually she released a statement yesterday sharing her photo on Instagram and saying in that statement that she was thankful for the well wishes and messages of support that she has received from members of the public over the course of the last few months. But as we saw her today, taking part in this ceremony, she appeared to be in high spirits. She was joined, of course, by her family with her three children to mark the king's birthday. The king, of course, is also, as you mentioned, Fredricka, undergoing treatment for cancer.
 
But this was an opportunity for members of the British public and tourists visiting London for the day to catch a glimpse of senior members of the royal family together. Of course, this is a slimmed down version of the monarchy, previous times with the Queen Elizabeth II, would have seen a much larger appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. But a slightly smaller show today for the royal family.
 
But a moment of celebration none the less. Of course, it remains to be seen whether we will continue to see the Princess of Wales taking part in these sorts of events. She did mention in that statement yesterday that she is not out of the woods just yet, that there are good days, and that there are bad days. So, it may well be a case-by-case basis. This will not be a full return just yet for the princess of Wales as she continues her treatment. Fredricka.
 
WHITFIELD: OK. Nada Bashir in London, thank you so much for that.
 
All right. Well, today's celebrations come a day after the princess actually released a statement saying that she is making good progress. But treatments will continue for a few more months and she is quoting her now, "not out of the woods yet." Her message also saying, in part, is not it was underscoring, "On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity as well as starting to do a little work from home. I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal."
 
Some pretty powerful words there. For more of royal insight, I'm joined now by CNN royal commentator and royal editor for Hello magazine. Emily Nash.
 
Emily, glad you could be with us. I mean, tell us about, you know, what today's Trooping the Colour event was really all about. And I must say that it was you know, the Princess, her arrival, which really upstages everything, right?
 
EMILY NASH, CNN ROYAL COMMENTATOR: Absolutely. Look, this was the family reunion that everyone had been waiting for. You know, for the last six months, the royal family has been facing such a challenging time with both the king and the princess, undergoing cancer treatment. So, it was really wonderful to see her back there in the middle of the family and on the balcony, which is such a symbolic thing for the royal family and for the British public.
 
WHITFIELD: It is a symbolic thing. I mean, usually people have become accustomed, especially, you know, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it would be about 20 members of the royal family on the balcony. It's pared down now. I counted about 10. Maybe I missed one or two, but what is the signal that is sent, you know, to the world with that appearance on the balcony?
 
NASH: So, I mean, this has always been since the beginning of King Charles' reign about having a slimmed down monarchy. There was an awareness back in the 80s that people suspected, you know, there were a few hangers on if you'd like with a wider family. Sometimes you'd see upwards of 30 people for example, on the balcony.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
NASH: This is really projecting how the monarch is going to look going forward under his reign. But at the heart of it, as you say, it is a family, it's a celebration, and considering everything that's going on this year.
 <br>[12:20:04]
 
Not even the rain was going to dampen that today, especially for the crowds, you know, who packed down the mouth (PH)to catch a glimpse of them all.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. And we can look at these pictures over and over again, right? I mean, it's always so pleasant to see little Prince Louis, and George, and Princess Charlotte. But, you know, that moment to see a Princess Kate emerge in -- from the limo, or, you know, from the carriage, I should say, I mean, that was really a striking moment. How does she look to you?
 
NASH: Well, look, if you weren't aware of what had been going on, for the past few months, you might not realize that anything had been going on. She looked absolutely beautiful as always, you know, immaculately dressed. But more importantly, smiling so broadly, and clearly so happy to be there with her family.
 
You know, she was really keen that she could be there to support the children, in particular, who might otherwise have been in the carriage on their own because their father was on horseback today. And, you know, family means everything to her. So, I don't think she would have missed it for the world.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, she looked amazing. And maybe, you know, in step with trying to send a signal of very little change even though she did have that very profound statement, you know, about taking every day, you know, so gently.
 
She was dressed in something that her regular go-to designer, Jenny Packham put together for her, the hat designed by, you know, her royal favorite, Philip Treacy. I guess that was important too, to convey a sense of normalcy that, you know, she always looks poised and polished. And clearly that was important to make sure that, you know, she still looked like the Kate that most people are used to.
 
NASH: Absolutely. You know, and it was in stark contrast, really, to the barely casual image we saw of her just yesterday. And I think that was really setting outs, you know, how this hasn't all been plain sailing for her. She has a good days, she has her bad days, but this was clearly very much one of those good days. WHITFIELD: And what about that King Charles? This was about him after all. I mean, even though we are spending a lot of time talking about her, I mean, she really is the, you know, the centerpiece of fascination for everybody.
 
But for King Charles, he too diagnosed with cancer. You know, we This isn't our first time seeing him in public view, like it was for Princess Kate, but how does he -- how does he look to you? And, you know, is there anything to the fact that the, you know, the palace is still not giving too much detail about his health, his treatment, similar to, you know, Princess Kate?
 
NASH: Look, I think that what you see with the king is that he has been very active, he was at the D-Day commemorations just a few days back. And that speaks volumes, really about how he is coping.
 
I mean, obviously, they are slightly adapting his schedule, he wrote in a carriage today rather than on horseback. I think that, you know, people are taking things day by day, but the very fact that he was back out there, and doing as we say, what is expected of them monarch, attending his own birthday parade is this huge public moment for the royal family.
 
For him, in particular, I think he's doing remarkably well, especially, given also the fact that you know, he is doing this at an age where most of his peers will be long retired.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Today, his 75th birthday celebration. But the real birthday comes in November. So, something tells me we're going to be doing this again on a much grander scale later on in the year.
 
Emily Nash, thank you so much, outside Buckingham Palace.
 
NASH: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. President Biden and former President Trump, both on the campaign trail this weekend. We are live after a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:28:14]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. We are less than two weeks away from the first presidential debate which will be hosted right here on CNN. And today, both candidates are hitting the campaign trail ahead of the big event. Later today, President Biden will hold a fundraiser in Los Angeles with a group of big time Hollywood stars and former President Barack Obama.
 
Meanwhile, Donald Trump is in the battleground state of Michigan where he will attend a roundtable and to speak at a conservative conference with a number of potential vice-presidential candidates.
 
We've got team coverage of today's campaigning. CNN's Eva McKend is covering the Trump event in Detroit. But let's begin with Arlette Saenz in Los Angeles, where President Biden will attend a star-studded fundraiser event later on today.
 
Arlette, even before this fundraiser begins, the Biden campaign has already raised a whole lot of money. Thanks, in support from these big Hollywood stars.
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Fred. Biden campaign officials tell me this morning that President Biden, who just raised $28 million heading into tonight's fundraiser here in that Peacock Theatre right behind me in Los Angeles.
 
Now, President Biden will be on stage with former President Barack Obama as well as Hollywood stars like George Clooney, and Julia Roberts. It comes as the campaign is really trying to tap into that celebrity power to try to help President Biden with a second term to the White House.
 
Late night host Jimmy Kimmel will be moderating this conversation between Biden and Obama. And this is really modelled after an event that took place in New York City back in March. At that time, they had gotten together Biden, Obama, and also, Bill Clinton -- an evening with the three presidents.
 
At the time, that fundraiser raised $26 million. But tonight's fundraiser will actually be the new record for a Democratic presidential fundraiser as it's set to bring in $28 million.
 <br>[12:30:08]
 
Now, tickets started around $250 and ranged all the way up to the $500,000 range. And the campaign has also been running a small donor grassroots contest for people to travel here, to attend the fundraiser and meet Obama, Clinton and George Clooney, and Julia Roberts as well. 
 
The campaign is also providing a chance for small dollar donors to attend part of this event virtually at home with a chip in about $20. Now this all comes as they're not just trying to tap into the power of celebrity to attract donors, small dollar, big donors to their campaign. But it comes as the Biden campaign is also looking to maintain their cash advantage that they've had over former President Donald Trump.
 
Now Trump has made some significant gains in his own fundraising really potentially narrowing the gap between the two parties. If you take a look at the month of May, former President Trump's campaign has said that they brought in $141 million in May including $53 million raised online just in the 24-hour period after the former president's conviction in that criminal hush money trial in New York City.
 
Now the Biden campaign, I will note, the Trump campaign has not said how much cash on hand they have. But the Biden campaign has not yet released their numbers yet for May, but they did enter that month with about $192 million cash on hand. Cash on hand is important here because it allows the campaign to run their operations, run those T.V. ads, open offices, hire more organizers. So the Biden campaign is really hoping that a big fundraiser like this will help with their numbers heading into this November election. WHITFIELD: All right. Arlette Saenz in Los Angeles, thanks so much.
 
Let's go now to Detroit where we find Eva McKend, following Donald Trump's campaign events. So Eva, great to see you as well. What will the former President be doing today in the Motor City?
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, the former President will address thousands of attendees here at the turning point action convention. They're calling of the people's convention, turning point, of course a powerful and important ally for the former president. This conservative group attracts the true believers. As I was walking in, I saw people wearing t-shirts with Trump's mugshot on it with pride. Charlie Kirk leaves this organization, powerful millennial in the conservative movement, a controversial figure. He has recently suggested that women over the age of 30 are no longer attractive.
 
He has also said that riding on planes with black pilots would give him pause due to corporate diversity programs. So that gives you a sense of his vision. The former president, though, a controversial figure himself, being a convicted felon. But still his supporters here, that is no issue for them. He -- they believe that he is just a consistent target.
 
But listen, Fred, when Trump addressed this group, the reason why it is so pivotal and key is because this group will spend millions of dollars helping turnout the vote and pivotal states across the country, including right here in Michigan, where President Biden won in 2020, just by about 3 percent, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, quite remarkable. Eva McKend, Arlette Saenz, thanks to both of you ladies. Appreciate it.
 
All right, so in just 12 days, June 27th, just steps from where I am standing here at CNN's Atlanta studio. CNN will host President Biden and former President Trump for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. And we are now learning more about the format rules, the two men have agreed to follow. The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks. And during those breaks, the candidates and their staff will not be allowed to interact. Both presidents will appear at uniform podiums, and their position will be determined by a coin flip.
 
The microphones will be muted throughout the debate except when it's a candidate's turn to speak. There will be no prompts or pre-written notes allowed on stage. Each candidate will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. There will be no studio audience. And the moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion.
 
To qualify for the debate, any candidate must satisfy the requirements outlined in Article 2 Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. And they must file a formal Statement of Candidacy to the Federal Elections Commission. Both Mr. Biden and Trump have done so. As have third party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein. And in addition, the candidates must appear on enough state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency currently only Biden and Trump do.
 <br>[12:35:04]
 
And finally, the candidate must receive at least 15 percent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN standards of reporting. Kennedy has received at least 15 percent on three qualifying polls so far, and he is on the ballot in six states making him eligible for 89 Electoral College votes. You'll be able to watch the debate right here on CNN, June 27th or stream it on Max.
 
When we come back, a new ruling from the nation's highest court. The U.S. Supreme Court making it legal again to buy bump stocks, the gun accessory that lets semiautomatic rifles fire hundreds of bullets a minute.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:40:31]
 
WHITFIELD: In a major ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a federal ban on bump stocks. That decision makes it legal again to buy the gun accessories that let semiautomatic rifles fire hundreds of bullets a minute. Those devices were banned during the Trump presidency after a gunman used bump stocks during the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history in Las Vegas. CNN's Paula Reid has details.
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: On Friday, the Supreme Court struck down a ban on bump stocks. Bump stocks enable semiautomatic rifles to fire at speeds comparable to machine guns. This was a rare regulation to result from a mass shooting in the United States. This regulation of course resulted from the 2017 Las Vegas shooting from a hotel that left dozens of people dead and hundreds injured.
 
Now Friday's decision fell along ideological lines. Just as Clarence Thomas writing for the majority that, quote, we hold that a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a machine gun, because it cannot fire more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. And even if it could, it could not do so automatically.
 
Now the liberal justices joined in a fiery dissent written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor who wrote, quote, when I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. A bump stock equipped semiautomatic rifle fires automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger because I like Congress call that a machine gun, I respectfully dissent.
 
Well, now the ATF which put forth this regulation originally released a statement calling on Congress to legislate and try to restrict these bump stocks that way but of course, it is unrealistic that in an election year Congress would actually be able to pass anything this sensitive.
 
Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. WHITFIELD: And summer doesn't officially start until next week but it will sure feel like it today in parts of the south and more will experience this heat wave in the coming days.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:47:18]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, a heat wave is spreading across the country. And while it's not officially summer, people in the south can see temperatures climb into the triple digits. CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa is in the CNN Weather Center with more on all this. So how hot is it going to get?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: We are looking at temperatures in the extreme zone that we're worried about heat risk and heat sickness in some places. Here's a look at that heat dome. We've been talking about it out west over the last couple of days and weeks, we'll starting to shimmy its way into the Central Plains. And eventually we'll even get up into the Midwest and New England as we go into the workweek.
 
Look at these temperatures this weekend, 98 degrees in St. Louis on Sunday temperatures and 97 on Sunday in Little Rock. So again, climbing up towards 100 degrees, Chicago, even getting up towards 97 degrees by Monday. We're looking at hundreds of records falling both for daytime highs and overnight lows. We're not really looking at any relief on the overnights with these temperatures staying up towards 80 degrees for a lot of locations. So more than 360 records could fall as we go through the week.
 
This is the heat risk map I was telling you about, extreme. You see those purple's for parts of the Northern Plains going into the Midwest. Tuesday, Chicago with some of these extreme impacts as well. And then getting into what upstate New York, Ohio as we go into Wednesday that extreme risk means that we really need to pay attention for signs and symptoms of heat sickness because we're looking at these temperatures way above average for this time of year.
 
Chicago middle and upper 90s through Sunday and Monday average for them for this time of year is 81 degrees. So we're looking at temperatures not only sweltering hot during the day about 10 to 15 degrees above normal. But those overnight temperatures again will sit near 80 degrees closer to where the daytime high should be. And it gives you no relief at night. It doesn't even cool off at night for those that are vulnerable to heat sickness or don't have access to air conditioning to cool off.
 
And even for a place like Chicago that we don't really think about extreme heat there, their summers are getting warmer since 1970. Chicago has warmed about a degree and a half in the summer season, adding about eight more days that are above average in June, July and August in the summer. And again without that relief on the overnight it just makes things like heat sickness even more difficult.
 
WHITFIELD: Time in nearly unbearable. All right, Elisa, thank you so much. And stick around, I'll have you come back to talk about some other extreme conditions.
 
All right, let's go now to CNN's Rafael Romo in Atlanta where just a week ago the city was dealing with a water crisis now it's heat. What's happening?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Fred, you know how those of us who live here roll our eyes when tourists call our city Hotlanta. Well, this weekend they're more than justified if they want to do that. Fortunately, we have many places like this splashpad around the city where families can cool off this is the historic Fourth Ward Park splashpad, which has been way more active than usual and where people showed up earlier than you would expect although some families left because it was probably lunchtime for their children.

Elisa Raffa was talking about it. A major dome of extreme heat is sending temperatures soaring to near triple digit territory. And this heat wave is not only impacting Atlanta, according to the local office of the National Weather Service, temperatures in most of Georgia and the South, for that matter, are expected to be around 100 degrees today. But for many families, like the ones we ran into here at the splashpad, this is the perfect opportunity to start enjoying the summer.

NATE ELGART, ATLANTA RESIDENT: You know, you never know with Atlanta, sometimes it's colder, sometimes it's warmer. So it's always a surprise, like Atlanta always keeps you on your toes. It's one of the fun things about living here. But, yes, this is a great place to kind of bring the kids to cool off in a day like this.

ROMO: And Fred, beyond the obvious this kind of weather, it can pose risks for many people, especially young children and the elderly. The city of Atlanta, has postponed the family and friends field day citing extremely high temperatures. Also, the city has opened that cooling center that started serving people at 11:00 a.m. today, and will remain in operation until 6:00 p.m. Local officials say they plan to make it available again tomorrow during the same hours and this oppressive heat that is settling over the southeast today is just a taste of what's in store for the rest of the country next week.
 
So what we're doing here is just trying to give folks around the nation a preview, Fred, of what's coming their way out too.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, more to come. All right, Rafael Romo, thank you so much in a very hot Atlanta, I won't put it together but most people do.
 
All right, Elisa Raffa is back now for a very interesting story that you've been working on tsunamis. I mean, it could strike with very little warning. And I think no one can forget the really big one that struck a while back Indonesia, you know, being severely impacted 20 years ago.
 
And since then, scientists are now trying to pinpoint ways in which to detect them. See what's coming in advance?
 
RAFFA: Yes, still working on that 20 years later. And what was so fascinating was I learned about all of the lessons that we learned from 2004. Before that, scientists only had really poorly colored or black and white pictures from the 1960s to study tsunamis, but that happened in the digital age. We have tons of pictures and video and we have learned a lot. Take a look.
 
WHITFIELD: All right.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At an ocean tsunami is a singular event and in the sense that it changed everything.
 
RAFFA (voice-over): December 26th, 2004. Destructive waves caused by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake claimed nearly a quarter million lives from Southeast Asia to the Horn of Africa, prompting a worldwide wakeup call.
 
DR. HERMANN FRITZ, TSUNAMI RESEARCHER, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: Immediately made tsunami a household word. Everybody knows about tsunamis around the world now.
 
RAFFA (voice-over): Water heights reached an astonishing 167 feet in Sumatra, one of the locations closest to the earthquake. But devastation stretched from Asia to Africa with impacts felt in 17 countries. Tsunami scientists, Hermann Fritz, deploys into the damaged zone to learn from these disasters. Hoping to put some sense into scientific simulations and his lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
 
FRITZ: You could also think of this experiment here, like a tsunami on a treadmill. OK. So essentially, you have this roller here that will be approaching the coastline and will essentially devastate the buildings, wash people away, ground people and clear everything and it's paths.
 
RAFFA (voice-over): The Indian Ocean tsunami was the first of its kind in the digital age. Tourists with camera phones were able to capture the first quality color images of these rare waves.
 
FRITZ: basically gave tsunami an image, gave tsunami a video, gave tsunami a face.
 
RAFFA (voice-over): It also gave tsunamis a more universal warning system. At the time, scientists were only focused on shaking along the Pacific Ocean rim.
 
FRITZ: There are no warnings issued. And that is really the big failure, but the world was not prepared for tsunamis in 2004.
 
RAFFA: Can we predict for tsunamis? FRITZ: So unfortunately, that is the billion dollar question in geophysics is that we cannot predict the next earthquake.
 
RAFFA (voice-over): Only once the ground starts to shake in waves move, can scientists then plug the observations into supercomputers to calculate the size and speed of the possible tsunami. A lot of science needs to happen really fast. Imagine not knowing where a hurricane will go until a couple of hours before landfall.
 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has significantly increased buoys to detect these deep ocean waves. There were only four deployed in 2000. Now there are more than 70 stations monitoring tsunami activity worldwide.
 <br>[12:55:03]
 
FRITZ: A lot of new buildings go up along the coastlines. There are more and more people in harm's way.
 
RAFFA (voice-over): Simulating tsunami waves in a lab can help improve forecast, better understand the impacts of damage and create more resilient building codes. But until we can pinpoint the next big earthquake --
 
FRITZ: Which takes more than 30 seconds back at inland or to high ground.
 
RAFFA (voice-over): Public education and awareness is key.
 
FRITZ: Spontaneous evacuation even in the age of technology is the most efficient at saving lives.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFFA: So this still really only gives us minutes of warning as a meteorologist can empathize with him. Imagine on knowing minutes until hurricane making made landfall so.
 
WHITFIELD: No time to react.
 
RAFFA: Incredible where the science could go in the next 20 years.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. All right, fingers crossed, hopefully enough to give people more much better warning. All right, Elisa Raffa, thank you so much.
 
All right. And tune in Violent Earth with Liev Schreiber. New episode airs tomorrow at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and Pacific.
 
All right, much more on the breaking news. When we come back, eight Israeli defense soldiers killed in an incident in Rafah.
