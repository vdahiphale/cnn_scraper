THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[18:00:00]
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR:  It is 1:00 a.m. in Tel Aviv, 8:00 a.m. in Sydney, and 6:00 p.m. here in Atlanta. I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Julia 
 
 Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome to "First Move," here's your need to know. And breaking news, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will be interviewed by CNN on Thursday. It 
 
 comes as Donald Trump says he agrees to the terms with Harris for a head- to-head debate.
 
An incredible rescue, a 52-year-old Israeli hostage taken by Hamas, found alive in a tunnel in Gaza by the IDF. He's now reunited with family.
 
Meta feeling the pressure. Mark Zuckerberg says he was wrong to cave into government demands to crack down on COVID misinformation.
 
And suiting up for space. Nokia and NASA coming together to put cell phones into orbit and on the moon. That conversation coming up.
 
But first, the special counsel prosecuting Donald Trump has filed a reworked indictment in the federal election subversion case. Jack Smith 
 
 slimmed down the allegations against the Republican nominee. It comes after the Supreme Court ruling that gave broad immunity to presidents. 
 
 Prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges that were initially brought against Trump. Our Katelyn Polantz is following the developments 
 
 and joins us now from Washington. Good to have you with us, Katelyn.
 
So, this is a new indictment against Trump, but essentially, the charges are the same as the old indictment, but Jack Smith, the special counsel, 
 
 has refined the allegations.
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CNN AND JUSTICE REPORTER:  That's right, Lynda. So, what the special counsel and the Justice Department did was they went 
 
 back to the grand jury in Washington, D.C. and they presented a newly written version of this indictment against Donald Trump. It's shorter and 
 
 it cuts out things where Donald Trump was speaking in the Oval Office or in the Rose Garden, where he was getting briefings from federal officials and 
 
 intelligence agents because he was the president. And it cuts out the pieces where he was directing an official at the Justice Department and 
 
 trying to put pressure on the Justice Department to give his election fraud claims more air.
 
So, all of that is removed from the case now. And this new set of charges instead frames up what the next couple of proceedings and months are going 
 
 to be in federal court in Washington in this case. It makes clear the Justice Department wants to take this to trial. They want to do it in this 
 
 way, and they want to keep Mike Pence too in this case, the vice president who they say, in the way that this is rewritten, was acting as the 
 
 president of the Senate, so part of Congress rather than the vice president to Donald Trump as an executive branch official.
 
So, they're trying to create some distance there to keep that part of the case alive. But it is a significant action to come and it really does put 
 
 us right in the thick of trial proceedings or pretrial proceedings in this case against Donald Trump in Washington D.C. just two months the election.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, I mean, the timing, it really is interesting. What are the next steps, Katelyn? How quickly could this proceed? And has there been any 
 
 reaction yet from Donald Trump?
 
POLANTZ:  There has been some, he is tweeting or posting on Truth Social quite a lot about how he sees this as an act of desperation and something 
 
 that may be where he believes they're trying to interfere with the election. But this was an existing case against Trump that was still alive, 
 
 where the prosecutors are coming back and just incorporating what they believe the Supreme Court needed them to do.
 
We do know, Lynda, that there are going to be more things to come just in the next couple days. This week, even, on Friday, the Justice Department is 
 
 expected to lay out to the judge here exactly how they think the timeline should move forward, how this new indictment should be talked about.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
And then, there's a hearing scheduled for next week. Trump is not expected to appear in person at that hearing, but it is a moment where everybody's 
 
 going to have to talk about how do we get this toward a trial, how does this indictment look, what do we have to ask about -- in questioning the 
 
 legal underpinnings of the allegations now and how they're written now, and what will the courts need to decide in the coming weeks before a trial if 
 
 this is going to go forward?
 
There's always the possibility things could go up on appeals again before any trial would take place. So, there is a long road ahead. But there are 
 
 some things to come in this case, even in the next, you know, seven days,
 
KINKADE:  Wow. Yes. Interesting development. Katelyn Polantz, good to have you across all those details for us. Thank you.
 
Well, CNN has announced that it will air an exclusive interview with Kamala Harris on Thursday. This is her first since becoming the Democratic 
 
 presidential nominee. Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, will also take part, and it will be part of their first interview together as a ticket.
 
Well, Harris has faced criticism for not sitting down for a formal interview or news conference since President Biden bowed out of the race 
 
 for the White House back in July. Well, meantime, Donald Trump says he has reached an agreement to take part in a TV debate with Harris, which is set 
 
 to happen September the 10th on the ABC.
 
Well, for more on these developments and joined by Eva MckEnd in Washington. Good to see you, Eva. So, just a few hours ago, the headline 
 
 was how long will Harris wait until she sits down for an interview with the press? Well, now, we know the answer and it's going to happen quite soon, 
 
 really.
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, in just two days, on Thursday, during her bus tour in Georgia, she's making stops in 
 
 Savannah and some of the surrounding areas. And during that time, she and her running mate, Governor Walz, will sit with our colleague Dana Bash to 
 
 answer some in-depth questions for the first time.
 
During the Democratic National Convention, she sat with social media influencers, really, and understanding that she also needs to speak to 
 
 young voters as well. But, you know, that is not the same, Lynda, as speaking to a journalist who is going to likely have aggressive questions 
 
 about some of the policy reversals that we have seen from the vice president. So, on this vitally important issue of fracking and its 
 
 implications in the swing State of Pennsylvania.
 
At one point, she wanted to ban fracking. That is no longer her position. She has to explain that on immigration. She, at one point, even writing in 
 
 her memoir very affectionately about immigrants and really concerned about the fate of undocumented immigrants during the Trump administration. She 
 
 now advocates for a bipartisan border enforcement bill that does not include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. So, that is a 
 
 pretty dramatic policy reversal as well. And now, for the first time, she'll be in a position where she has to answer these questions.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, no doubt. A huge amount of interest in that interview set to take place here Thursday on CNN. But also, a great deal of interest in the 
 
 debate that now, finally, after all this back and forth over the details, is set to happen, right?
 
MCKEND:  It is, Lynda. There has been some back and forth between the campaigns over this issue of muted mics. You know, during that very fateful 
 
 CNN debate earlier this summer, when the respective candidates, so Biden and Trump, were not supposed to be speaking, their mics were muted.
 
The Trump campaign says that they agreed to those same conditions. Evidently, Trump's team thinks that's pretty good for him, for his mic to 
 
 be muted. And that was, I think, done in part as to not throw President Biden off. But the Harris team, they want something entirely different. 
 
 They don't want those mics to be muted. They want them to be live for the entire course of the debate because they don't think that the former 
 
 president can kind of control himself. And so, they're hoping That he is disruptive in a way that is off-putting to voters.
 
Now, Trump today saying that the matter has been settled, that the mutes -- the mics will, in fact, be muted when the respective candidate is not 
 
 supposed to be speaking. But the Harris campaign still seems to be litigating this with ABC to get their desired conditions for the debate.
 
KINKADE:  All right. Eva, good to have you with us on both those developments. Thanks so much for joining us from D.C.
 
Well, I want to turn now to a rare moment of joy and in months of grinding war. More details are emerging about the rescue of an Israeli hostage. 
 
 Farhan Al-Qadi is the eighth hostage to be rescued alive from Gaza and the first to be freed by the Israeli military from Hamas' sprawling tunnel 
 
 network. He is said to be in a stable condition.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
A senior IDF official says Al-Qadi was found through intelligence, pushing back on rumors that the Israeli military found him by accident. Well, for 
 
 more on this, I'm joined by Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Good to have you with us, Jeremy. No doubt a great deal of relief for his family. What can 
 
 you tell us about the operation?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you said, this is the first time that Israeli troops have actually gone into a tunnel in Gaza 
 
 and successfully rescued a hostage from inside that tunnel. In the past, it has always been above ground operations that have resulted in so far eight 
 
 hostages being rescued from Gaza by Israeli forces. And without a doubt, at the end of the day, this is mostly a moment of celebration for his family 
 
 after 326 days of captivity.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Israeli hostage Farhan Al-Qadi is taking his first steps of freedom. After 326 days of captivity, an Israeli military 
 
 helicopter has landed in Gaza to take him to Israel, back to his family. Moments earlier, Al-Qadi was rescued by Israeli special forces who were 
 
 combing through a network of tunnels in Southern Gaza.
 
READ ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON:  We cannot go into many details of this special operation, but I can share that Israeli 
 
 commandos rescued Qaid Farhan Al-Qadi from an underground tunnel, following accurate intelligence.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Al-Qadi is the first Israeli hostage to be rescued by Israeli forces operating in those tunnels. The seven others who have 
 
 been rescued were being held above ground. An Israeli military officials said the forces found Al-Qadi alone without his captors.
 
At Soroka Medical Center, each step brings these men that much closer to the brother they feared might never return alive. They're running toward 
 
 the whir of a helicopter delivering their 52-year-old brother back into their arms.
 
Al-Qadi has visibly lost weight. But doctors say he is in good medical condition. His family is overjoyed.
 
It is a joy that cannot be explained, his brother Hatem says, more than the joy you get from a newborn baby. This is a man who has been resurrected.
 
Al-Qadi, a member of Israel's minority Bedouin community, now on the phone with the Israeli prime minister, thanking him for getting him home and 
 
 reminding him that other hostages are still waiting.
 
The Israeli prime minister currently engaged in ceasefire negotiations tells him he is committed to returning everyone without exception.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DIAMOND (on camera):  And, Lynda, there's no question that the clock is still -- is very much ticking for the remaining 104 hostages who have been 
 
 captive since October 7th. Of those, at least 30 are confirmed dead by the Israeli government. And what is also clear is that those hostages will 
 
 likely not emerge from Gaza as the result of Israeli military operations, instead, it will be a deal, a hostage deal, a ceasefire deal, the one that 
 
 is currently being negotiated in Cairo and in Doha that will ultimately lead to the release of most hostages if they can get there. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  All right. Jeremy Diamond for us in Tel Aviv, Israel, thanks very much. Well, call it a case of meddling with Meta, the company which owns 
 
 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.
 
In a letter to Congress, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that the Biden White House pressured his social media firm to censor content during the COVID 
 
 crisis. The White House says it did it to help save lives, but Zuckerberg says the administration's demands were wrong. Zuckerberg also says he 
 
 should not have suppressed the politically charged story of Hunter Biden's laptop during the 2020 election when Donald Trump was president.
 
Well, Clare Duffy joins me now for more on this. Of course, when it comes to COVID, Clare, it wasn't just the Biden administration there were plenty 
 
 of doctors trying to curtail the spread of misinformation. What did Zuckerberg say in this letter about what he would do differently next time?
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  Yes, Lynda, it is really interesting because if you think back to 2020, even many of the big social media 
 
 platforms themselves were acknowledging that this was a crisis that had potentially deadly consequences, and they were being maybe a little bit 
 
 extra cautious as a result of that.
 
Mark Zuckerberg now saying that he felt pressured by the White House to remove content, including humor and satire related to the pandemic. But 
 
 ultimately it is always still the decision of these platforms about how to moderate their content, and the White House is sticking by what it did.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
In a statement, it said, our position has been clear and consistent. We believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account 
 
 the effects their actions have on the American people while making independent choices about the information they present.
 
And this, of course, comes after a Supreme Court ruling that found that the White House can continue to communicate with big tech platforms when they 
 
 find content that they think is harmful or violates those platforms' rules. And so, I think we could read this as Mark Zuckerberg sort of saying that 
 
 he is going to evaluate and respond to those requests differently in the future. But the timing and the sort of format of this communication is 
 
 really interesting, I think.
 
KINKADE:  Just quickly, I'm intrigued by the timing of this. This is years after the pandemic, months before a general election. Why now?
 
DUFFY:  Yes, it is a really good question. In many ways, this plays directly into this narrative that Republican lawmakers have been spreading 
 
 that big tech companies censor the viewpoints of conservatives. There's not a ton of evidence of that, but a lot of what, you know, Zuckerberg is 
 
 saying in this letter sort of does play into that narrative, and you already see Republican lawmakers celebrating this, saying that it's proof 
 
 that the Biden-Harris administration tried to censor conservative voices and pressure big tech companies.
 
I don't think that that's exactly what this letter is saying, but it potentially could be really beneficial to them heading into this election 
 
 period. I think, certainly, what Zuckerberg is trying to do here is kind of hedge his bets and avoid any perception of bias, especially heading into 
 
 the election if the company ends up having to make some tough content moderation decisions about political misinformation, he doesn't want any 
 
 allegations that was done at the behest of the Biden White House. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Interesting. All right. Clare Duffy for us. Good to have you on the story. Thanks so much.
 
Well, still to come, troubled ties. Mexico's outgoing president is pausing relations with the U.S. and Canadian embassies in a dispute over judicial 
 
 reform in Mexico. So, how will it impact the North American economy?
 
Plus, there is a strong financial basis for the reunion of Oasis. The squabbling Gallagher brothers are making up and heading out on tour. 
 
 Britpop fans are ecstatic, and we're going to have much more on that reunion coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade. A Tuesday tick high on Wall Street tops today's Money Move. U.S. stocks rising across the board. The 
 
 Dow up a mere two points, but it was enough to close at another all-time high. Stocks getting a boost from a better than expected read on U.S. 
 
 consumer confidence, which rose to a six-month high.
 
Shares of A.I. chip giant NVIDIA gained ahead of its eagerly awaited earnings report on Wednesday. Apple shares also in the green. It's 
 
 replacing its chief financial officer, and it's also expected to unveil its new iPhone with A.I. features on September 9th. A mixed day in Asia with 
 
 gains on the Nikkei and Hang Seng Index.
 
Well, the Mexican government is now pausing relations with the U.S. and Canadian embassies in the country after the ambassadors criticized a 
 
 proposed judicial reform. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is pushing to elect judges by popular vote. The U.S. ambassador called that 
 
 reform a major risk to democracy that could also harm U.S.-Mexico trade relations. The Mexican president says the freeze in ties is with the 
 
 embassies and not with the countries.
 
Well, Gustavo Valdes is following the developments joining us now live. Good to have you with us. So, I have to ask you, like the U.S. and Mexico 
 
 are each other's top trading partners. Now, in this diplomatic spat, Mexico planning to overhaul the judicial system. Just explain how this could 
 
 potentially impact trade.
 
GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, let's make it clear that so far, the argument is against the two ambassadors, the ambassador from Canada to 
 
 Mexico and Ken Salazar, who is the U.S. ambassador in Mexico. They both have said that they don't think the proposed reforms will be good for 
 
 democracy in this North American zone. They fear that because these new judges only need to be -- have a law degree, there would be no vetting. 
 
 They could just run for the post. It could be a problem for democracy.
 
And even, they think, that somebody from the cartels could run for office and, you know, win the position. And that would be also a problem for 
 
 Mexico, for the region. Also, these judges, eventually at some point, might have to rule on trade issues between these three trading partners. So, that 
 
 is the concern from the ambassadors.
 
Again, this is just the ambassadors. Although, today the State Department put out a statement saying that they respect the changes. They think that 
 
 some reforms might be good, but the judicial reform of electing judges might not be the best. It was the same reaction from the Foreign Relations 
 
 Committee in the U.S. Senate.
 
The president this morning, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said that until these ambassadors don't respect Mexico's independence and sovereignty, 
 
 there will be no communication. Lopez Obrador has about a month left in office. His successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, today said that she supports the 
 
 position of the president, but we have to see what happens after he leaves office.
 
KINKADE:  Wow. So, just give us a sense of what has been the reaction in Mexico to this.
 
VALDES:  So, it's a little bit complicated because even those who believe that the reforms might be going too far, in Mexico, there's this really 
 
 hard pushback to foreign interference. One of the things every Mexican is drilling their head from elementary school is this phrase, el respeto al 
 
 derecho ajeno es la paz, respect to other people rights is peace. And this is applied to the sovereignty of every nation.
 
So, they're very touchy when a foreign nation, especially the United States, tries to mingle in a local politics. So, it's a little bit of mixed 
 
 bag, criticizing the reform for what it is, but also not liking that the United States might be trying to impose or give an opinion on the process.
 
Now, President Lopez Obrador, who is one of the champions of this phrase, and he has used it repeatedly over his six years as president, he has also, 
 
 in occasions, especially when it comes to immigration policy or some policies from Republicans in the United States, criticize what happens 
 
 north of his border. So, you know, it's a give and take sometimes.
 
KINKADE:  All right. Gustavo Valdes, good to have you staying across the story from us for us. Thanks so much.
 
From a stormy relationship to stormy weather, a powerful typhoon is now moving over Japan's southern islands. It is expected to hit more of the 
 
 country later this week. And for more on this, I'm joined by Chad Myers. Good to see you, Chad.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
CHAD MYERS, METEOROLOGIST:  Nice to see you too. This is really going to be a devastating storm for the people of Kyushu. We are going to see areas on 
 
 top of these mountain ranges that will pick up one meter of rainfall, widespread half meter of rainfall as the storm continues to move very 
 
 slowly.
 
The forward speed is seven kilometers per hour, about four miles per hour. So, this is going to be a slow-moving event. We're already seeing the radar 
 
 show up here. Very heavy rainfall on some of these islands here, south of the big island of Kyushu. This is the area that will see, likely, that at 
 
 least 10 inches of rainfall, 250 millimeters without a doubt.
 
But look, we go here. This is 24 hours from now, then 48, then 72. This is four days from now. This is barely moving. And in the entire time this is 
 
 happening, it is pouring down tropical rain. So, there will be flash flooding. There will be rivers completely like they've never been before. 
 
 And everywhere that you see white, that's a half a meter of rain, talking Kagoshima all the way up toward Osaka, especially there along the coast 
 
 with the onshore flow, and there will be onshore flow. Right now, we're still border lining between that Category 3 and even a little bit stronger. 
 
 So, still in a lot of warm water.
 
Speaking of warm, back into the United States, Chicago, you felt like 115 Fahrenheit. That's 46 degrees Celsius earlier today. And now, you have some 
 
 thunderstorms on the way that might at least cool you down. Detroit, same story, storms headed toward you right now with a severe thunderstorm watch. 
 
 And some of these storms could produce winds of about 70 miles per hour, over 110 KPH. So, that is a significant wind event.
 
More than 200,000 customers in Michigan right now already without power. And there you go, coming right into Detroit, into Wayne County, into Macomb 
 
 County, that's the area that's seeing the heaviest thunderstorm and wind activity right now.
 
It gets better tomorrow, but still above average for the next, I would say three to four days, but then, you get a cold front that comes through and 
 
 that's going to help things out. Look at Green Bay, look at Chicago. You go from a feels-like today of 115, and tomorrow you're going to be more like 
 
 85. That's a 35-degree difference. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Wow. Incredible. All right. Chad Myers, good to have you with us. Thank you. We're going to take a quick break. Much more on "First Move" in 
 
 just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back to "First Move." I'm Lynda Kinkade with a look at more of the international headlines this hour. Ukraine is vowing to 
 
 retaliate after another massive Russian bombardment. For the second straight night, Russia pummeled Ukraine with drones and missiles, killing 
 
 at least five people and setting off air raid sirens across the country.
 
Now, this comes one day after what Ukrainian officials are calling the largest air assault by Russia start of the war. Monday's onslaught killed 
 
 at least seven people. And here you can see the multiple Ukrainian regions that were attacked.
 
Sudan's state-run news agency says more than 130 people have died after the country was hit with heavy rains and flash flooding. Many of the victims 
 
 were found near the City of Port Sudan where a dam collapsed on Sunday. The floods have destroyed more than 12,000 homes in a country torn by civil 
 
 war.
 
There it is, the torch making its way to Paris for tomorrow's opening ceremony of the 2024 Paralympic Games. Organizers say 1.75 million tickets 
 
 have been sold. More than 4,400 athletes will compete in 22 sports in nearly 550 events.
 
Well, turning to one of our top stories now. And the Israeli military has freed a hostage from Gaza, the eighth Israeli captive to be rescued alive 
 
 since the beginning of the war. The IDF says Farhan Al-Qadi was rescued from a tunnel in Gaza after the military received specific intelligence. 
 
 He's reportedly in a stable condition. The 52-year-old father of 11 had been held by Hamas for 326 days.
 
I want to welcome Liz Naftali. Her great niece, Abigail, was held captive by Hamas for about 50 days. She was released last November as part of a 
 
 hostage deal just two days after she turned four. Well, Liz Naftali joins us now from Tel Aviv. Liz, I really appreciate your time today.
 
LIZ NAFTALI, GREAT AUNT FOR FOUR-YEAR-OLD RELEASED HOSTAGE ABIGAIL:  Thank you.
 
KINKADE:  I want to ask you first about the hostage release today. Al-Qadi, he escaped Gaza and we heard from his brother who said, I can't explain 
 
 these feelings. It's better than being born again. What's the feeling for you today, given you had relatives taken and killed by Hamas, your 
 
 beautiful little great niece was released, but how are you feeling today upon that news?
 
NAFTALI:  Well, first, the news is amazing because somebody who's been held, kidnapped, and taken across the border 326 days ago is free. He's 
 
 back. And he's back at home. He's back at home in Israel where he is a citizen. And it's the most joyous thing because I know after 51 days while 
 
 Abigail was a hostage, seeing her actually back in Israel was the moment where myself and our family could just take a breath, you know, seeing her 
 
 in my niece's arms, her aunt, not her mother, because her mother was murdered, but seeing her back was -- is the greatest relief.
 
But when you ask that question, keep in mind, that was nine months ago. These people, Mr. Al-Qadi and all these other hostages, 110 have been there 
 
 326 days and Abigail with 105 women and children were released nine months ago. And so, I just think about the 110 families, the 110 hostages, and 
 
 they can't breathe yet. They can't have that sigh. They can't say that it's a miracle or they're reborn. They're still in the worst -- the most 
 
 incredible pain that I think humans can have.
 
KINKADE:  And Al-Qadi reminded the Israeli prime minister in a phone call today from his hospital bed about those other hostages still being held 
 
 captive in Gaza. You've met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, several times. What is your take? Is he doing enough?
 
NAFTALI:  Listen, I did meet with the American hostage families, with the prime minister on two occasions when he was in the United States. And our 
 
 message was, no, he is not doing enough. Because on one hand, he says that he's going to do everything to free the hostages, and he's been saying that 
 
 for 10 months. And here we are 10 months later, and they are not free. They are still down in Gaza, many of them in tunnels.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
And so, when you say, is he doing enough? No, because my goal and the goal of the 110 families and originally 250 families is -- was to get the 
 
 release of their loved ones. So, until he signs a deal, until he makes a deal and he can make this deal, it is about political will, he will not 
 
 have done enough.
 
KINKADE:  And when you look at the numbers, right, the amount of hostages released in a prisoner exchange deal as opposed to this, what, seven, 
 
 eight, nine hostages released after being rescued by the IDF, if you were taking part in the ceasefire talks right now and the hostage negotiations, 
 
 what would be the ideal outcome? And obviously, it can't come soon enough.
 
NAFTALI:  Well, first, I think a diplomatic solution is what we saw that worked in the -- at the end of November. There was a ceasefire. There was 
 
 the ability to bring home 105 women and children. So, when we talk about what worked, we saw that work. And that was a moment where both the prime 
 
 minister, Netanyahu, and the leader of Hamas, Mr. Sinwar, agreed. And that's how these people, women and children, came home.
 
And that was after incredible, incredible work by the U.S. administration, President Biden, Vice President Harris, National Security Adviser Jake 
 
 Sullivan, Secretary of State Blinken. I mean, everybody has been working on this. You look at CIA Director Bill Burns. I mean, I could keep going on.
 
The Americans have leaned in. The Americans have proven to be Israel's greatest ally, friend, supporter, and they have been instrumental in making 
 
 sure these talks continue. And then you have the side of the mediators, the Qataris and the Egyptians. So, there's all these people. And by the way, 
 
 think about it. You have the G7 that all wants this deal and all stood for this deal and then you have the U.N. Security Council that voted for this 
 
 deal.
 
And so, here we are at this moment, which is like this is a deal that Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mr. Sinwar are being pushed to do, and we saw that 
 
 it worked for 105 and now, we have 110. And it is the time, we are at that time. We don't have other time. This is that moment.
 
And, you know, it's a moment of bravery and boldness. And, you know, you talked about that six hostages had been rescued. In those rescues, 
 
 remember, so -- one member of the IDF was killed in that. And if you think about it last week -- in the last week, six hostage bodies have been 
 
 brought back. They were bullet written. People are dying. The rate of getting people back with a hostage with going in and trying to get them 
 
 via, you know, the army has not brought back 110 people. It has brought back six. And now, there is Mr. Al-Qadi who got out today.
 
And so, it's just not -- it's not a feasible way to get out hostages. And the way to get out hostages is to do the diplomatic route, and I know that 
 
 this is the number one focus at this moment, because here we are at this point where they're negotiating in Cairo of President Biden and his team, 
 
 they're there, they're with the teams from the Israeli side, the Egyptians, the Qataris, and I believe representatives of Hamas.
 
This is that moment where we need political courage and we need political will. And that is what will bring home 110 hostages. But to keep going and 
 
 hoping that the army can go in and get these people -- and keep in mind, this was the first hostage that was taken out of a tunnel. The rest were 
 
 above ground. We believe most of the 110 are under and they are deep under and they are guarded.
 
So, this idea that we can keep going with the military and that will bring out 110 people, six, seven people have been brought out in 10 months.
 
KINKADE:  Yes. And of course, your niece -- your great niece, Abigail, taken captive after witnessing the murder of her parents. We're really 
 
 thinking about her. Just four years old. Is she doing all right right now? How's she doing?
 
NAFTALI:  You know, thank you for asking. And, you know, thank God, thank President Biden, thank America, thank everybody, thank the people that were 
 
 negotiating and mediating, the Qataris, the Egyptians, because this four- year-old is now able to be a child who gets to play and go to school and swim and dance and just be a child.
 
But keep in mind, he did not get to come home. Her home was destroyed by Hamas terrorists on October 7th. Her mother and father were murdered by 
 
 Hamas terrorist on October 7th. So, while there is a point where we are very blessed and she is loved and she will be taken care of with her 
 
 brother and sister who also witnessed the murder of their parents, this is devastating.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
And we don't know what will be, but we know that she is loved. But it goes back to this point, which is today, we need to get 110 more. They're not 
 
 four-year-old little girls, but they are children. There's a one-year-old. They are mothers. They are sons. They are daughters. They are fathers. They 
 
 are grandparents. They are brothers and sisters.
 
And when I think about Abigail and I look at her and I see this miracle of a child who gets to live and our family at least gets to breathe and move 
 
 forward, I look and I think this is that moment where we just have to push as hard and we need everybody to lean in so these other families and these 
 
 hostages can be free and have the opportunity that Abigail has. And these others who have been released through diplomatic negotiations.
 
You know, I'm not a military expert. I'm not a diplomat, but this is that time and this is a time for the humanity, which we keep talking about, and 
 
 this is that time that these hostages must, must be released. And it comes down to Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mr. Sinwar.
 
KINKADE:  Liz Naftali, we really appreciate your time and thank you for sharing your story with us. We appreciate it. Thank you.
 
We're going to take a quick break. More "First Move" in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. The SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission was delayed Tuesday because of a helium leak. The next launch window opens in about nine hours 
 
 from now and the Polaris crew hopes to conduct the first ever commercial spacewalk.
 
The four civilians will go deeper into space than any person since the Apollo astronauts. In a separate mission, plans to go even further. Artemis 
 
 III aims to return humans to the surface of the moon for the first time in over 50 years.
 
Nokia is working with Axiom Space to design and build them a next generation space suit. It will be equipped with 4G wireless, which means 
 
 astronauts will have an easier time speaking to one another and sending images to back to Earth.
 
Well, for more, I'm joined by Bernie Edwards of NASA's Space Technology Mission, and Thierry Klein, the President of Solutions Research at Nokia 
 
 Bell Labs. Great to have you both with us.
 
THIERRY E. KLEIN, PRESIDENT, NOKIA BELL LABS SOLUTIONS RESEARCH:  Thank you for having us.
 
BERNIE EDWARDS, NASA SPACE TECHNOLOGY MISSION DIRECTORATE:  Thank you for having us.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
KINKADE:  Bernie, I'll start first with you. So, NASA and Nokia joining forces on just absolutely like an incredible capability when this mission 
 
 is set to take place in 2026. Astronauts will have high speed network capability on the moon. Just explain how this will work.
 
EDWARDS:  So, NASA is very excited about the idea of demonstrating the cellular technology that we take for granted here on Earth on the moon. So, 
 
 the cellular equipment being built by Nokia will be installed into the spacesuit that Axiom is building and that will communicate with a network 
 
 in a box equipment built by Nokia that we anticipate to be in the human landing system. And again, this will provide expanded capabilities for 
 
 communications.
 
And I just wanted to remind everybody that, you know, astronauts need air, they need water they need food. But really, if you're going to the moon, 
 
 whether it's robotic or with humans, you need power, you need communications, you need navigation. So, this is critical technology, and 
 
 we're looking forward to the demonstration.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, it's incredible. So, astronauts will be able to transmit videos in real-time. I want to ask you, Thierry, about this, how this 
 
 application might work, because Nokia essentially will have a cellular network on the moon, right? Just explain it.
 
KLEIN:  Yes. So, it's really, Lynda, at the core, it's the same network technology that you and I use every day and that's deployed on terrestrial 
 
 networks in consumer networks, enterprise networks. So, we're taking that same technology and then, we're building a very compact, highly integrated 
 
 network in a box that we integrate on the human landing system and that's really optimized for the space environment, from a size, weight, power 
 
 perspective, as well as the harsh environments of the moon.
 
And then, we have essentially the equivalent of your smartphone, but it doesn't look like a smartphone. It's really a device module that we 
 
 integrate into the Axiom space suit that will be connected to the helmet mounted cameras that the astronauts have, telemetry data on the suit as 
 
 well, as the voice communication system, and it will establish a wireless link between the astronaut's suit and the human landing system. And 
 
 ultimately, all of that information will be sent back to Earth for mission controllers.
 
KINKADE:  Incredible. And so, I mean, I'm picturing what we're going to see in 2026 when these astronauts land on the moon. Bernie, can you explain the 
 
 sort of images we'll be getting back compared to what we've seen in the past?
 
EDWARDS:  Yes. So, we're very excited about returning humans to the moon. And so, the astronauts basically can use a legacy radio system to 
 
 communicate. They also have Wi-Fi. And then, of course, they'll have this cellular demonstration that we're talking about.
 
This really increases the ability to send, you know, high-definition television channels. We're expecting to see beautiful images from the moon, 
 
 things that we didn't have the last time we were there 50 years ago. I think it will excite the public. You know, NASA is going back to the moon 
 
 to inspire people to do incredible science and communication technologies will enable all of that.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, exactly. It's going to be really exciting. I imagine there were quite a few cell companies that would have wanted this role and this 
 
 mission. Can you explain how this partnership came about, Thierry?
 
KLEIN:  Well, we've been working with NASA and others in the space industry for seven, eight years now, and really building on Bell Labs' technology 
 
 that we've developed over a couple of decades now in robust mission, critical communication systems.
 
And we have already the intuitive machines mission that we're part of right now, and we're really looking at advancing the capabilities and building 
 
 these this mission critical networks. And it's been really a great partnership with NASA for several years. And now, we're very excited to 
 
 partner with Axiom Space to integrate the same cellular technologies into their next generation space suits.
 
KINKADE:  Yes. Next gen space suits. We -- I was mentioning earlier that we've got these private citizens that are going to potentially launch into 
 
 space tomorrow. They'll be doing a spacewalk in space suits that have never been tested in space. Will these next gen space suits that you guys are 
 
 working on be tested in space before they're deployed?
 
KLEIN:  So, of course that's the purview of Axiom. They are testing their spacesuits and we're testing the communication system. We're testing it on 
 
 terrestrial environments. We're testing it on the intuitive machines mission, and then. we will be integrating the technology with the space 
 
 suit and then do a complete system test to make sure that everything works as anticipated and as required.
 
KINKADE:  It's exciting, exciting times. Hopefully, we'll get to chat again before this mission. 2026 is when it will happen. Bernie Edwards of NASA's 
 
 Space Technology Mission Directorate and Thierry Klein, president of Solutions Research at Nokia Bell Labs, thank you both very much for joining 
 
 us.
 
EDWARDS:  Thank you.
 
KLEIN:  Thank you for having us. Thank you.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
KINKADE:  Well, from incredible astronauts to a sensational senior who's proving age is no limit when it comes to following your dreams, take a look 
 
 at Minette Bailey, a British woman who celebrated her 102nd birthday in a pretty unusual way. She jumped out of a small plane on Sunday to skydive 
 
 over Suffolk, England, becoming the U.K.'s oldest ever skydiver. Bailey is a veteran who served in the Women's Royal Navy Service during World War II. 
 
 And this grandmother's jump raised money for a local veteran's charity. Of course, she is no stranger to amazing feats. On her 100th birthday, she 
 
 drove a Ferrari around Silverstone Race track.
 
Happy birthday, what a way to celebrate. That's incredible.
 
Well, next, from wonder wall to wonderful news. If you're a fan of the 1990s rock, that is, Britpop icons, Oasis have announced they are going to 
 
 get back together. That next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back to "First Move." Britpop fans are rejoicing after Oasis announced they will reunite to play 14 shows next year. And to 
 
 paraphrase their hit single, "Wonderwall," July 4th will be the day that they're going to throw it back to you. Max Foster has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, , CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR:  (voice-over):  Fans may have wondered if they'd ever seen Noel and Liam Gallagher play on stage 
 
 together again. But 15 years after their feud broke up, one of the U.K.'s biggest bands, a reunion for the brothers is definitely maybe on the cards.
 
Oasis will tour the U.K. and Ireland next year. The group announced it on Tuesday, and industry insiders expect tickets to sell out within minutes as 
 
 fans clamor to hear hits like "Supersonic" live.
 
Oasis shot to fame in the 1990s as part of the so-called Britpop era. The band's debut album, "Definitely Maybe," released 30 years ago this week, 
 
 was the start of a journey that saw Oasis become one of the biggest bands in British history.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
A second record, "What's the Story, Morning Glory," was the U.K.'s bestselling album of the decade, featuring anthems like "Wonderwall" and 
 
 "Don't Look Back in Anger." But the Gallagher brothers became just as famous for their wild lifestyles and public arguments as their music. After 
 
 years of making the front pages for their bust ups, Noel Gallagher walked out of the group in 2009 in Paris, saying he simply could not go on working 
 
 with Liam a day longer. Two years later, Liam left fans in no doubt that he felt the same way.
 
LIAM GALLAGHER, OASIS:  Me and him don't get on. He's a different person than I am. And that's just the way it is. Some thinks he's the man and I 
 
 think I'm the man, you know what I mean?
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  It seems it's taken this long for them to put the feud and their successful solo careers aside and reconcile. And the peace 
 
 deal could be lucrative. Analysts say the Gallagher brothers could make millions of dollars when tickets go on sale this Saturday.
 
The band will play 14 dates across Britain and Ireland, and they say they plan to play more dates outside Europe later next year. Fans may be 
 
 speculating how long the truce will last though.
 
Max Foster, CNN London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE:  Well, finally, on "First Move," it was the year 2004, five years before Oasis broke up when the term podcast was coined. Well, today, yet 
 
 another podcast deal has been signed worth upwards of $100 million. Brothers and NFL stars Jason and Travis Kelce have inked a deal with 
 
 Amazon's podcast studio, Wondery, for their podcast called "New Heights."
 
The agreement brings exclusive ad sales and distribution rights for all audio and video episodes to Wondery. It also includes the entire back 
 
 catalog. You'd want it too, right?
 
Well, that just about wraps up the show. I'm Lynda Kinkade. Thanks so much for joining us. Stay with CNN.
