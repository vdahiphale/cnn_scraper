(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: All right, we are listening in now as President Joe Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has just taken to the mic already is proposing new rules requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled or delayed flights.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: The only one that being some of the most important and memorable events in our lives. And our economy depends on these airlines doing a good job. When you board a flight, whether you are up before dawn, coffee in hand ready to go to a conference, or up past everyone's bedtime wrangling toddlers like Chasten and I were the other night, you count on that airline to provide the service that you paid for.
 
We're here today to share the latest steps that we're taking to ensure that airlines do just that. It's important to note here that just over two years ago when President Biden took office in the depths of the pandemic, the biggest concern around our nation's airlines was whether they would stay in business at all. And if they did, how many years or even decades it would take for them to recover? But President Biden acted to restore this economy swiftly and demand came back faster than most forecasters thought was even possible.
 
And we know some U.S. airlines have struggled to meet that demand. Now weather remains the top cause of airline delays but staffing and other issues under airlines responsibilities meant that last summer we saw unacceptable rates of delays and cancellations even on blue sky days. And when extreme weather events collided with airlines that were unprepared, the problems multiplied as more than two million Americans experienced with the failures at Southwest Airlines over the last Christmas holiday.
 
The good news is we are seeing real improvements. Each month so far this year, preliminary data show cancellation rates under two percent, even during that busy spring break season. But summer travel is going to put enormous pressure on the system and we need to continue our work. We're always prepared to work collaboratively with airlines when there are steps that we can take as a department that would help. In New York, we've taken steps that would allow airlines to use larger planes with more seats at lower frequencies, which means that they can move more passengers overall but with less congestion. In Florida, where the closure of airspace to accommodate commercial space launches, now actually happens often enough to noticeably affect airline schedules. We're engaging the space sector to keep more launch windows clear of peak flight periods. And across the country, we're hiring more air traffic controllers to keep up with growing demand.
 
In fact, the latest application window is closing today, so I'm encouraging anyone who's interested to consider applying. And FAA recently used new technology to clear over a hundred new more efficient flight routes that will save time and money. The FAA and Department of Transportation are doing our part but airlines need to accept their fundamental responsibility to better serve passengers. When they don't, we are here to enforce passenger rights and hold airlines accountable.
 
And just over two years, this administration has delivered some of the most significant gains in airline passenger protections in decades. We have stepped up enforcement, rules, and transparency. We've empowered passengers with better information. We've helped get a billion dollars in refunds and counting back to passengers. And we have secured enforceable commitments around customer service that didn't exist just a year ago.
 
And another major step is coming, as you all hear in just a moment from the president. All of this is possible because President Biden is leading an administration relentlessly focused on making everyday life better for Americans. Just as the Biden-Harris administration is delivering historic investments to improve physical infrastructure everywhere from airport terminals to crosswalks. We're also acting to ensure Americans have a better experience with our transportation systems wherever they go, and however they get there.
 
It is an honor to serve in an administration that always puts consumers and workers first. And now, it is my great honor to introduce the President of the United States, President Joe Biden.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you all for being here. Please, sit down. As we approach Memorial Day this weekend, and -- Memorial Day weekend, I'm rushing it, and a busy summer travel season, I'm here to talk about steps my administration is taking to make air travel better for all Americans.
 <br>[14:05:10]
 
The airline industry is a key part of our economy. And they've been critical partners in a number of important initiatives from requiring employees to get COVID vaccines and addressing the supply chain problems over the last couple of years. But I know how frustrated many of you are with the service you get from your U.S. airlines, especially after you, the American, taxpayer stepped up in 2020, the last administration in the early days of the pandemic to provide nearly $50 billion in assistance to keep the airline industry and its employees afloat.
 
I get it. That's why our top priority has been to get American air travelers a better deal. We've made real progress some of what you've just heard. Historically, when delays and cancellations are the airline's fault, the law has only required airlines to refund customers the price of their flight ticket, but not the cost of meals or hotels, or transportation when you get left in limbo.
 
In fact, a year ago, almost no major airline guaranteed any compensation beyond the price of the ticket if they caused the delay and the delay was their fault. No reimbursement for a hotel after a canceled flight or a meal after a delayed flight. But then, we challenged them to do better.
 
And in fact, they did. Airlines started to change their policies when they're at fault for canceling and delaying the flight. Now, nine major airlines cover hotels, 10 cover meals, 10 rebook for free. That's real savings for middle-class and working-class families, for example, to rebook fees could run as high as $200 per ticket.
 
Now, you don't have to pay anything to rebook for most airlines. And that 200 -- that $200 is back in your pocket. Even more, if you're traveling with your family.
 
But that's not all. At my State of the Union address, I pointed out airlines charging up to $50 a ticket just so you can sit next to your child. As I said baggage fees are -- fees are bad enough, but that you know the cost. Airlines can't just treat a child like a piece of baggage.
 
Well, guess what happened? Major airlines changed their ways. American Airlines, Alaskan Airlines, Frontier Airlines, they agreed to address family seating, so parents can sit with their children without paying an additional charge. United Airlines also took important steps toward guaranteed free family seating beyond not -- another as no cost beyond the cost of the original cost of the ticket. For families, that's money back in your pocket. And that's good -- that's a piece -- that gives you peace of mind. That's progress.
 
But there's more. Last fall, the Department of Transportation proposed a rule that will be finalized this year. If finalized as proposed, it would require airlines to show you the full ticket price upfront before you purchase it, including fees for baggage, for internet, and for changing your seat. That way you can get a fuller more accurate price before you purchase your ticket and you can compare prices and pick the best deal.
 
But we're not stopping there. We know how frustrating delays, cancellations, and re-bookings are for travelers. Last holiday season, travelers are stranded for days and had to scramble to find other ways to reaching their destinations. Many miss family gatherings, spent Christmas at an airport, waiting countless hours in line or on the phone because there weren't enough pilots or weren't enough personnel. That's not acceptable.
 
And well flight delays and cancellations have come down since then, there's still a problem. American air travelers deserve better and that's what we're going to do. And that's what we're doing here today. And I'm proud to announce two critical steps that my administration is taking to protect American air passengers.
 
First, we just launched a new website, flightsright.gov -- flightsright.gov. It features a dashboard we created last fall to give travelers more transparency to airlines' compensation policies. So, if it's the airline's fault and your flight was canceled or delayed, you can check the dashboard to see how the airline should be compensated you like re-booking a flight or accommodating your hotel, room or -- and your meals.
 
And today, we've expanded that dashboard to include airlines guaranteed additional compensation, like cash miles or travel vouchers. But here's the deal. If you look at the dashboard today, you'll find that only two airlines guarantee additional compensation beyond the ticket refund. If your flight is very delayed or canceled, and the airline could have prevented that from, you deserve more than just being -- getting the price of your ticket, you deserve to be fully compensated.
 <br>[14:10:09]
 
Your time matters. Impact on your life matters. That's why I'm announcing the second critical step today to protect American consumers.
 
Later this year, my administration will propose a historic new rule that will make it mandatory -- not voluntary but mandatory for all U.S. airlines to compensate you with males, hotels, taxis, rideshares or rebook -- and rebooking food fees, and cash miles and or travel vouchers whenever they're the ones to blame for the cancellation or the delay. And that's all on top of refunding the cost of your ticket.
 
Airline passengers in Canada, for example, in the European Union, and in other places already get these compensations. And guess what? It works. One study found that the European Union required airlines to compensate passengers for flight delays, the number of flight delays went down.
 
I appreciate Secretary Buttigieg's leadership on this issue. And I hope and I expect the Department of Transportation to move as quickly as it can to put this new rule in place. It matters. I know these things may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most of middle-class families and people struggling to get the cost of -- in the first place to get that airline.
 
And so look. These actions are in addition to other progress, we were making the lower costs for American families, holding corporations accountable, and growing our economy from the bottom up in the middle out, not just the top down. I signed a groundbreaking executive order on competition that is helping us through everything from lowering the cost of hearing aids to ban the non-compete clauses. And my State of the Union address, you may recall, I call for an end to junk fees. That is those hidden surcharges that you'd see at hotels, concerts, and credit card bills that you didn't know about before you got the ticket.
 
I continue to call on Congress to pass the Junk Free Prevention Act because that's what American consumers deserve. I'm going to close with this. We're making progress but we have more to do. Threes -- to reverse decades of concentrated corporate power and to continuing to lower prices and increasing opportunities for families, workers, and small business owners and entrepreneurs. So, let's finish the job.
 
Remember who we are, as I've said many times, we're the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. This is just about being fair. It's about being fair. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you.

BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: We've been watching President Biden speaking alongside Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg talking about airlines and saying "American air travelers deserve better." The president speaking about the frustrations that many Americans have experienced because of delays and cancellations of flights and now unveiling a new rule that could potentially force airlines to compensate those passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled because of the airlines. Of course, we're going to stay on top of this story and bring you the very latest as it unfolds. Jim.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, he also announced a website there that folks can check things out. Other story we're following today. What drove him to kill? We are learning new details about the Texas mall shooter, but do they tell us anything about a motive so often a question in the wake of these things? We are going to be live in Allen, Texas.
 
Closing arguments underway in the E. Jean Carroll battery and defamation trial against Donald Trump. We will be live again outside the courthouse with the latest from there.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:17:38]
 
KEILAR: Another community in America asking why after a gruesome mass shooting. Police in Allen, Texas are on the hunt for a motive after a 33-year-old man opened fire at a mall Saturday killing eight people and wounding at least seven others. We are learning some key details about that gunman who was killed by a police officer on the scene. Authorities say he was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and at least one other weapon plus multiple magazines. A source tells CNN he was also wearing an item that links him to far-right extremism.
 
We have CNN's Josh Campbell learning that the gunman was removed from the U.S. military in 2008 after just three months due to mental health issues. And Josh is with us now. Josh, tell us what else you are learning. JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Brianna. So, this is a key detail about the shooter's past. Now, a law enforcement source familiar with his investigation told me that he was previously in the U.S. military but had been expelled due to concerns about mental health issues.
 
Well, our colleagues Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon have received word from the U.S. Army confirming that reporting that back in 2008, this suspect served a very brief stint, just about three months. Didn't make it through basic training, had no MOS, no specialty, he was removed under Army Regulation pertaining to health and mental issues. They didn't specify the exact reason.
 
But why is this important? Because this is just the latest case, this mass shooting that's really raising questions about the robust nature of background checks in this country. If the U.S. military said we don't want this guy in our ranks, there are some issues here. He's still able to go on -- later on and become a security guard, obtain weapons training, gather a small arsenal, I'm told, from a law enforcement officer, and as we know come to this mall behind me conducting this mass attack.
 
Now, at this hour, investigators are still working to determine a motive. However, I'm told by a source that they are investigating, particularly whether the suspect was motivated by right-wing extremism. And that is for two key reasons.
 
First, after the suspect was shot and killed in the middle of that shooting by an Allen police officer, authorities found on his chest an insignia with the letters RWDS with police believe stands for right- wing death squad. That's the same type of insignia that we've seen extremists around the country where it rallies and protests.
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
I'm also told, Brianna, that the suspect had a robust online social media history, including posting online about white supremacy and about Neo-Nazis. So, again, authorities certainly narrowing their scope here as it pertains to that suspect's motivation. Of course, we've talked about the investigation, the motivation, we obviously can't overlook the victims who are first and foremost, from us, we know, Brianna, that two people have been identified who were killed. We're waiting for authorities to announce the identities of the additional six. But we were told, according to the president of the United States releasing a statement, the number of people slaughtered in this attack include children, Brianna.
 
KEILAR: Horrible. Josh, thank you for the report. I do want to bring in Shimon Prokupecz now. He has some breaking news for us coming out of Texas. Shimon, what can you tell us?
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. So, this is coming out of the State Capitol in Austin, where the Uvalde families have been gathering now for weeks asking for a subcommittee to take a vote -- to get a vote out onto the House floor. They'd like to see -- they raise the age. They're asking for the age to purchase the assault rifles from 18 to 21 in the state of Texas, and of course, it would have to go through all sorts of passages of legislation by the House members and then the Senate.
 
But right now, a small victory here for the Uvalde families who've been fighting for this, asking for this for pretty much almost a year now since this happened. And so now, this committee has decided they are going to bring the vote to the floor. It's unclear if it's ever going to get there, but at least it's gone out the small victory for them. But it's gone from this committee and now we wait for the house legislators there in Austin to make a decision of whether or not they're going to hear this.
 
This is something that Uvalde, the families have been asking for. They want the age raise from 18 to 21. So, of course, this is going to be seen as a small victory for them but they say the fight goes on so they can get this legislation passed.
 
KEILAR: Yes, look at something that so many Americans do support. Shimon Prokupecz, thank you for that. Jim?
 
SCIUTTO: CNN has obtained this photo of what appears to be the gunman on the ground on the left in black with an AR-15-style weapon just nearby, as well as several magazines on the gunman's person. The high- powered assault rifle has been the weapon of choice in many of the country's mass shootings. I'm sure it sounds familiar.
 
Most recently, the Louisville bank, the covenant school in Nashville, Tennessee, the Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia, just last fall. A defining characteristic of this kind of weapon is the speed and the power of its bullets. Researchers at Wayne State University have studied how an AR-15 blast impacts the human body. Their findings are just terrifying.
 
This is a block of 20 percent gelatin. It's meant to mimic how human flesh reacts to a gunshot. Watch the team fires a handgun round. This is a -- at one thousand feet per second into the block, relatively straight line, it comes out the opposite side. Now, watch as the team fires around from an assault rifle. It explodes inside and remains inside the flesh.
 
Again, this mimicking the reactions of the damage to a human body, it's remarkable and I've spoken to trauma surgeons who describe treating these wounds in the emergency room. And they say the wounds resemble what they see or what they've seen from a warzone.
 
This is something we've been studying for some time here. The youngest victim we should note in Saturday's shooting was just 15 years old. It's a weapon designed for war deployed at a shopping mall. Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: Another awful story from this weekend in Texas. At least eight people are dead, several more injured in Brownsville after a speeding SUV plowed into 18 people at a city bus stop. Police say the driver was George Alvarez. He's now facing eight counts of manslaughter and 10 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
 
The crash was caught on surveillance video. We're not going to show you all of it but you can see at the top of your screen, the SUV is speeding before it strikes the crowd. Police say after the vehicle turned over, Alvarez tried to run away. And you can see in this cell phone video a crowd of people appearing to try to keep him from escaping.
 
Let's go to CNN's Nick Valencia now who's live for us in Brownsville. And, Nick, you were able to ask officers, one of the key questions here whether this was intentional or not, what did they say in response?
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): That's right. It's something that's still not given much clarity here. Although eyewitnesses tell us they don't need an investigation. They're sure that this was an intentional act. But investigators have not released that information with a hundred percent certainty, just saying that it's part of the thread of their investigation. George Alvarez, they also said was somebody that was known to them.
 <br>[14:25:02]
 
They have prior -- 20 -- more than 20 prior charges. A lengthy criminal history, which includes aggravated assault, theft, and driving while impaired. And I want to set the scene here according to eyewitnesses about what happened because they tell me they believe Alvarez was impaired when it - what happened, happened here. They said he came barreling through this intersection blowing through a red light hopping over this curb and eventually ending up down there at a bus stop where you see a memorial has popped up.
 
And, Boris, noticeably, you know, I've walked up and down this street here and what is noticeably absent are any signs of skid marks. And you mentioned that whether or not this was intentional. Well, we asked to the police chief at a press conference earlier whether or not they ruled that out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALENCIA: Chief, Nick Valencia with CNN. How were you able to rule out that this was not intentional, but it sounds like you're saying he lost control.
 
FELIX SAYCEDA, CHIEF, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS POLICE: We have not ruled that out, sir. It is an ongoing investigation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALENCIA: All of this, of course, happening just days before Title 42 is set to expire. Tensions here and anxiety very much so high, with the prospect of even more migrants coming across in record numbers, Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: Nick Valencia, thank you so much for putting that in context for us. Now, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Officials at the U.S.-Mexico border are bracing for that migrant surge ahead of the lifting of Title 42. In just three days, the Trump-era policy that allows certain immigrants to be quickly turned away based on pandemic grounds at the southern border, that will expire. Right now, border officials are encountering over 8000 migrants a day already. That number could rise to 10,000 a day when Title 42 ends. Here, you can see a new drone video of what that border looks like. Long lines of migrants camped out just on the other side of the border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the other side from El Paso.
 
CNN's Rosa Flores. She is in El Paso, Texas. You've been there. We were speaking to you last week. And in the many days leading up to this. What are you seeing now? Maybe you're seeing evidence of the surge growing?
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Definitely. So, the pictures, Jim, still very dramatic. Just take a look behind me. And I kind of want to give you the closest to a 360 view that I can because you'll see that migrants continue to line this street around the church. And now, it's growing beyond the block where the church is located.
 
As we give you a 360 view, you'll be able to see that a lot of the migrants tried to stay out of the sun. And so, you'll see that the areas that are Sunny, and don't have as many migrants, and then the areas that are shaded, have more migrants sitting by those buildings, or they're creating their own shade with some blankets or tarps or whatever it is that they find. And you can see that all of these four blocks have migrants on the street.
 
And this one that you see -- what you see across the street here. They moved the migrants because of construction. But if you look closely, you'll see that their blankets are on the sidewalk. They will unfold those blankets at night and sleep on the sidewalk.
 
Again, a very dramatic scene here in El Paso. The city of El Paso is still under a state of emergency. And according to officials, about two thousand migrants continue to call the streets of El Paso home.
 
One of the things that they're very concerned about is public safety, especially after the tragedy in Brownsville. You can see that these barricades were added over the weekend to close the street right in front of the shelter. You'll also see that there are some added resources, more porta-potties, and more washing stations as the number of migrants out here grows.
 
I've been in contact with community leaders on both sides of the border and they tell me that they already are seeing an influx of migrants in their communities. In Tijuana, about 6000 migrants are waiting. As I move along the border, for example, in Del Rio and in Laredo, the respite centers there, Jim, telling me that what they're receiving right now is what -- is the decompression efforts by border patrol. What that means it's a really fancy word of moving migrants who are coming into El Paso to areas like Del Rio and Laredo for processing because they've gotten more space over there, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Listen. It's a dance and that dance only becomes more difficult in the coming days. Rosa Flores, in El Paso, thanks so much. Brianna. KEILAR: Closing arguments underway in E. Jean Carroll's battery and defamation trial against Donald Trump. We are live outside the courthouse with the very latest.
