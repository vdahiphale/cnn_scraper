CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Basketball player Brittney Griner is back in the U.S. after 10 months in a Russian jail. What's next for her, plus 
 
 details about the prisoner swap. 
 
Brazil is ready to dazzle on the pitch but Croatia could hurt their winning plans. We are live in Doha for the World Cup. 
 
And one man in China risked it all by tweeting out videos of protests which the Chinese government didn't want the world to see. 
 
I'm Christina MacFarlane in London. Hello, and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
And we begin with Russian president Vladimir Putin saying more prisoner exchanges between Moscow and Washington are possible after U.S. basketball 
 
 star Brittney Griner landed back in her home state of Texas just a few hours ago. She was swapped with convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout 
 
 after spending 10 months jailed in Russia. Thursday's exchange did not include another American who the U.S. State Department says is being 
 
 wrongfully detained in Russia, Paul Whelan. 
 
A short time ago the U.S. National Security Council's John Kirby sat down with my colleague Kaitlan Collins to talk about White House thinking on the 
 
 Griner-Bout swap. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION: The deal really kind of came together in the last week or 
 
 so, and it just became readily apparent to the president and the entire team that it was either make this exchange, get one back, and the only one 
 
 that they were willing to trade was Brittney for Mr. Bout, or get none, and leave her there. 
 
And I can think we all would agree that not even one more day in a penal colony for Brittney was a good outcome, so the president made that tough 
 
 decision and executed the deal. 
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Viktor Bout is a free man. He was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans. Are you concerned that he is a threat to 
 
 Americans or to any other citizens? 
 
KIRBY: Look, with any kind of exchange like this, we do a national security assessment, and that was the case here with Mr. Bout, to take a look at 
 
 what the risks might be. Again, we are going to be vigilant, we're going to watch. He's on the street now. He would have been free in six years. It's 
 
 not like he was serving a life sentence. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Well, we have team coverage, Rosa Flores in San Antonio, Texas, Kylie Atwood is standing by at the U.S. State Department, and Fred Pleitgen 
 
 is live for us in Berlin. Let's go, though, first, to our Rosa Flores. 
 
And Rosa, the moment that officials in the U.S. have been working for for months, happening just a few hours ago. Walk us through the moment we saw 
 
 Griner touched down on U.S. soil and what has followed for her after that arrival. 
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christina, you're absolutely right. This is the place where Brittney Griner landed. This is Kelly Field in San 
 
 Antonio, Texas, and at about 4:30 local time, we saw a plane come in, and then a few officials actually boarded the plane for a few minutes, and then 
 
 a few minutes after that we saw that Brittney Griner walked off of that plane and then directly into a hangar. 
 
So there was no fanfare, there was no public spectacle, no big welcome for the WNBA star. It was pretty uneventful here from the ground, from what we 
 
 could capture from a public space. Now we don't know exactly what happened once she went into the hangar. And U.S. officials have been pretty 
 
 tightlipped about exactly what is going to happen to Brittney Griner once she arrived on. U.S. soil. 
 
What they will say, though, is that of course medical services will be provided, that her condition and whatever it is that she needs will be 
 
 discussed, and that those services will be provided to her. 
 
Now we do know a little bit about what happens once individuals like herself land on U.S. soil because this just happened a few months ago with 
 
 Trevor Reed. Trevor Reed actually landed at this airfield as well. And his family of course has done interviews with CNN in the past few months, and 
 
 they have expressed exactly what happens. 
 
And in the case of Trevor Reed, he was offered services for reintegration into society. And this is from the Department of Defense. They have the 
 
 gold standard program here in San Antonio, Texas, and of course they offer it to civilians who have gone through an isolation event like being 
 
 detained in a foreign prison, which is exactly what Britney Griner experienced. 
 <br>[10:05:01]
 
So, Christina, we're expecting for that to be offered to Brittney Griner. It is of course her prerogative to take these services. I'm sure she is 
 
 probably talking to her family and consulting, possibly with her own physician, we don't know, but those are definitely options of what's going 
 
 to happen here on the ground now that Britney Griner is on U.S. soil -- Christina. 
 
MACFARLANE: We will wait to hear more, Rosa, but of course just absolute relief I'm sure from her family that she is home on U.S. soil. 
 
Let's turn to Kylie Atwood. Kylie, we were hearing some more details there now from John Kirby of how this prisoner swap deal was negotiated. And we 
 
 know that the efforts to free Paul Whelan, according to the U.S. State Department, are still ongoing. What more can you tell us about that? 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, that's right. And we spoke with a senior administration official last night who explained 
 
 that essentially it's in Russia's best interest to continue having these conversations because there are things simply that Russia wants and the 
 
 United States has been clear in saying they're willing to entertain those asks in an effort to try and get Paul Whelan home. 
 
A commitment that President Biden and those folks around him in the national security space have made to Paul Whelan's family. It's important 
 
 to note that yesterday the Secretary of State Tony Blinken said that every offer that they possibly could make to get Whelan home as part of this swap 
 
 with Griner was made. But we're also learning from senior administration officials that that doesn't mean that they've essentially, you know, 
 
 completely hit a dead end here. 
 
Maybe they are at a halt for the time being. But a senior administration official explained that they are looking at new things that they can offer 
 
 to Russia. They are very clear eyed about the fact that they're going to have to offer something more. Something different to the Russians here. And 
 
 of course this comes on the heels of President Putin saying that another swap is possible. 
 
So there is a sense that there is some momentum here perhaps or at least some goodwill on both sides because they both have things that they want. 
 
 Just putting a finger on what the United States can give Russia is going to be the challenge. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, well, let's get into that with Fred Pleitgen who is in Russia, to get a response on that, because as Kiley was saying, Fred, Putin 
 
 has been speaking I believe in the last hour or so about the possibility of other exchanges between the U.S. and Russia. How do you read that, Fred, 
 
 given that we heard earlier today the Kremlin saying that this does not mean that there will be an improvement in Moscow -Washington relations? 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I certainly think it's something that's welcome news to Paul Whelan, and 
 
 certainly those -- his loved ones as well, and of course to the U.S. as well. 
 
It was really interesting to hear what Vladimir Putin said. He said that essentially there is a mechanism in place for negotiations like this. He 
 
 said that the Russians were not closed off to further negotiations and that in fact prisoner swaps in the future would be possible. Now Vladimir Putin 
 
 said for this case in particular that it was FSB, the Russian intelligence service, that led the negotiations on the part of the Russians. 
 
He said that compromises were made, and at this point or this instance, an agreement was found. And he also said that he believes something like that 
 
 could be possible in the future as well. So as Kylie was saying, right now the U.S. is looking at what else they could offer, what else could be on 
 
 the table. Certainly the Russian are saying that from their part, yes, negotiations about prisoner swaps can happen. 
 
And, you know, one of the things that we've heard from the Russian side during this process as well, and in general also, about the Paul Whelan 
 
 case, is that the Russians say that there is an established mechanism between the United States and Russia to deal with such negotiations. The 
 
 Russians are saying all of that. Always has to happen behind closed doors. 
 
There was a bit of tension between Russia and the U.S. in Britney Griner's case but certainly it seems as though the Russians are saying, yes, we can 
 
 continue talks, and of course one of the things that we know is that the U.S. has been asking about Paul Whelan for a very long time, and wants to 
 
 get him out. 
 
Viktor Bout was very important in all of this for the Russians. I think the Russians believe, Christina, that they got a pretty good deal on this. It 
 
 was always very important, they've been saying, that Viktor Bout is someone that they definitely want to get out of U.S. custody. And Viktor Bout, 
 
 after landing, certainly seems to be playing along with that as well. 
 
He came out in his first interview after landing on Russian soil, said that Russia does not leave its own behind. That certainly will be a welcome 
 
 message for Vladimir Putin. And he also said that he had no idea that he was going to be swapped. He said that they just came to him and said, look, 
 
 you're going now, that he had no time to prepare. But obviously for him, it's also something that is welcome as well. 
 
So I think from the Russian perspective right now, they think that they have gotten a pretty good deal on this. Viktor Bout very important to them, 
 
 but they also say that they are not closed off to further negotiations about people like Paul Whelan, for instance. 
 <br>[10:10:09]
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. And as you say, that would be very welcome news to Whelan and his family. 
 
Fred Pleitgen there live for us in Berlin. I should correct myself. Thanks to you, and thanks also to Kylie Atwood and Rosa Flores. 
 
Vladimir Putin admits that Russia is targeting to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, but he says Ukraine is to blame. The Russian president 
 
 spoke off-the-cuff at an award ceremony for Russian soldiers. Champagne glass in hand, he claims the relentless assault on the Ukraine's ability to 
 
 keep its power on and its people warm is Ukraine's own fault. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Right now there has been a lot of uproar about our attacks on the energy infrastructure of our 
 
 neighboring country. Yes, we are doing it, but who started it? Who hit the Crimean Bridge? Who blew up the powerlines from the cursed nuclear power 
 
 plant? Who isn't supplying water to Donetsk? Not supplying water to a city with more than a million people is an act of genocide. No one has ever said 
 
 a word about that. Total silence. But as soon as we move and do something in response they scream and shout to the whole universe. This will not 
 
 interfere with our combat missions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Well, today, Putin threatened to annihilate any nation that launches a nuclear attack on Russia. Meantime, the United Nations is 
 
 sounding an alarm on the suffering in Ukraine, calling it a human rights emergency. 
 
Let's go live to CNN's Will Ripley who's live for us in Kyiv. And, Will, given the immense suffering inflicted by Russia's ongoing targeting of 
 
 Ukrainian infrastructure, these comments from Putin clearly an attempt by him to shake the narrative and play to his base as we have seen many times 
 
 before. 
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: And doing it, you know, clutching a champagne flute, flippantly talking about brutal strikes 
 
 on civilian infrastructure that is plunging millions of people in this country into the dark and the cold for hours if not days on end. 
 
It is ignoring the reality that it was Vladimir Putin who started this war more than nine months ago when he sent a convoy driving from the 
 
 Belarussian border straight towards Kyiv, thinking somewhat -- who knows if he was deceived or if it was just ignorance or brash ego, but thinking that 
 
 the Russian troops would be welcomed with open arms by the Ukrainians after the relatively easy and illegal annexation of Crimea back in 2014, which I 
 
 was here to cover at that time. 
 
But this time around, even though the Ukrainians were not immediately prepared to fight off the Russians, they certainly have done so with 
 
 incredible success on the battlefield, although at a great cost in terms of human life and suffering of people. And so with Russia losing on the 
 
 battlefield, unable to regain any of the lost territory to the Ukrainians, the Ukrainians even launching counteroffensives, they have been striking 
 
 the power grid in an attempt to demoralize the people of this nation who are now days away from the official start of winter with sub-zero 
 
 temperatures, and an inability in some cases to heat their homes. which is why the government has set up tents that people can go to to get warm. 
 
They're doing the best they can to help people stay alive and stay out of the frigid temperatures, but these Russian strikes are certainly, you know, 
 
 harming the situation. There was just one, you know, it seems almost like every couple of weeks, or even less than two weeks, the Russians are 
 
 lobbing dozens of missiles directly at the power infrastructure that relies on Soviet-era parts that are not easy to replace. 
 
Certainly the United States can't send them over. Even though they can send generators, but generators don't solve the problem. And so they're even 
 
 asking for other Soviet nations for help in getting power -- badly needed power repair supplies in. And yet there's Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin, 
 
 holding up a champagne flute, blaming the bombing of the Crimean Bridge two months ago, which Russia used as an excuse to start this assault on the 
 
 civilian power infrastructure, while not acknowledging the fact that all of this, this entire, unnecessary, brutal situation was caused by one person 
 
 and that's him. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. And, Will, just briefly as a reminder to our viewers, how dire is the situation that you are seeing there in Kyiv this evening for 
 
 people who have been targeted? And what is the significance of the U.N. issuing this warning that we heard today? 
 
RIPLEY: Well, this is the United Nations, you know, looking at the calendar and knowing that temperatures are going to drop significantly, even lower 
 
 than they already are. And that there are people who are living in areas outside of the capital, which has managed to maintain around 70 percent to 
 
 75 percent power generation capacity. 
 <br>[10:15:02]
 
There were people living in very tall, Soviet-era buildings where just to get home they have to climb up dark, cold stairwells. You're talking about 
 
 elderly people, you're talking about people with health conditions, and so you have some people who are essentially trapped if they have an upper 
 
 level apartment with the lights off, in some cases without water supply as well. 
 
And so these difficulties are caused directly by the strikes that Russia is vowing to carry on. Vladimir Putin didn't say that they're going to take a 
 
 pause for the winter. He said they're going to continue. So we can expect to hear once again the air raid sirens go off. Thousands of people forced 
 
 to, you know, hide in underground bunkers and then come out to a reality of power maybe for 40 minutes or an hour each day in some cases depending on 
 
 if the power grid in their area has been hit. That is the situation and it's only going to get worse as we move deeper into the winter months. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. Temperatures dropping day on day. Will Ripley, really appreciate your reporting, thank you. 
 
The suffering in Ukraine reduced Pope Francis to tears. Here is what happened as he talked about war during a public prayer in Rome. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS, CATHOLIC CHURCH LEADER: (Speaking in foreign language)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: The Pope broke down Thursday during the prayers to mark the feast of the Immaculate Conception. He had to stop for about 30 seconds 
 
 before he could continue. 
 
Now China is looking to strengthen its ties in the Gulf. Is President Xi Jinping's visit to the region a turning point? We'll have more on that 
 
 ahead. 
 
Plus, kidnapped, raped, and rescued but then forced to have abortions by the very people who are forced to protect them. We'll have more on the 
 
 horrifying allegations coming out of Nigeria. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back. Right now the two teams trying to become the first semifinalists at the FIFA World Cup are fighting it out in Qatar. 
 
 Five-time champions Brazil in the first half of their quarterfinal match against Croatia which became one victory away from winning the title in 
 
 2018. Right now that match is level, at nil-nil. And slated today, Lionel Messi's quest for World Cup glory will take center stage as Argentina take 
 
 on the Netherlands in the day's other quarterfinal match. 
 
The "WORLD SPORT's" Amanda Davies is in Doha with an update on the match in progress and a preview of the one getting underway later. 
 
So, Amanda, it's five-time World Cup champions against the 2018 runners up and as we speak no scores on the board yet. 
 <br>[10:20:02]
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: No. And I think actually a lot of the Brazilian fans, the majority of the Brazil fans in the stadium might be a 
 
 little bit nervous because they have been so dominant at this tournament so far. People have been talking about them as six-time world champions 
 
 already. They have been scoring goals from all over the pit. People talking about that first 45 minutes in their last 16 games as the best 45 minutes 
 
 they can remember in World Cup history. 
 
But Croatia are aside who have some experience. They have a coach who knows how to get his team to dig deep and make themselves tough to beat. And they 
 
 have been giving Brazil a run for their money as things stand. Terrifying was actually the word that Zlatko Dalic had used to describe this Brazilian 
 
 set up in the run up to this match because of their strength in depth and they're attacking force in particular. 
 
Neymar, of course, coming back from his injury, knowing that one more goal from him will see him equal that record, 17-7 goals for Brazil scored by 
 
 Pele. But equally, Dalic said we have nothing to lose, and that is just what his side have been showing so far. Yes, they haven't scored many goals 
 
 but equally, they haven't conceded any. They have the experience of being the 2018 runners-up in this competition. And you have to say, things are 
 
 getting tight, but yes, only 20 minutes still goalless. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. Still goalless. And in terms of today's other match, Amanda, all eyes of course on one Lionel Messi as Argentina take on the 
 
 Netherlands, and as we know with every match this could be of course Messi's last. 
 
DAVIES: Yes. A lot of fans here who very much are not hoping that is the case. Yes, the Argentinian fans have traveled in their numbers but a lot of 
 
 the locals here have also decided that Lionel Messi is their man. Perhaps because of the Qatari link with Paris Saint-Germain, of course. His name 
 
 definitely the favorite on the back of shirts. And despite the Dutch's best efforts in the likes of Virgil van Dijk to try to talk about the team 
 
 they're not just playing Lionel Messi, they're playing the Argentinian team, it is impossible to look ahead to this match without talking about 
 
 the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner who scored three goals in four games so far in this tournament. 
 
And like you rightly pointed out, everybody talking about the exit of Argentina from this competition, probably being the last time we see him in 
 
 an Argentinian shirt. But equally on the other side, if Argentina win and it's the Netherlands go out it's likely to be the last time we see 
 
 legendary coach Louis van Gaal on the touchline as well. 71 years of age, having won all that he's won in this game. 
 
He's come back here for a third stint in charge of the Netherlands, really wanting to make amends for that semifinal exit on penalties at the hands of 
 
 Argentina in 2014. He's been enjoying this moment. We've seen him singing and dancing with the team as they've been back, getting back to the hotel 
 
 after their victory over the USA. And he is giving his side confidence, saying we have a score to settle. He is not letting Messi get away with it 
 
 without a fight. 
 
MACFARLANE: If there's any man who knows how to smother Lionel Messi, it is of course Louis van Gaal. We will see and wait the outcome of that later 
 
 today. 
 
Amanda, thank you so much, there live from Doha. 
 
Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. The Keystone Pipeline which carries oil from Canada to the 
 
 United States has been shut down after a leak was discovered Wednesday night. Officials say about 14,000 barrels of oil spilled into a creek in 
 
 Kansas. Federal safety regulators are investigating the leak. 
 
Russian opposition figure Ilya Yashin has been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. The Russian court found him guilty of spreading false 
 
 misinformation about the army. Prosecutors argue that his comments about the killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha went against the law that was 
 
 passed shortly after the invasion started. Yashin calls the verdict hysterical. 
 
Trucks filled with U.K. funded aid are making their way into Ethiopia to help those affected by drought and conflict. Badly needed supplies started 
 
 trickling in after the government has struck a peace deal with the Tigrayan rebels last month. And power was restored this week in Tigray's capital for 
 
 the first time in over a year. 
 
And Nigeria's military is angrily denying a report from the Reuters news agency that it has forced thousands of Nigerian women and girls to have 
 
 abortions after they were rescued from Boko Haram militants. 
 <br>[10:25:05]
 
One Nigerian army commander slammed the report as a fabrication. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAJ. GEN. CHRISTOPHER MUSA, NIGERIAN ARMY: It has never happened. It is not happening and it will not happen. It is not in our character. We are 
 
 professionals. We're human beings and these are Nigerians that you are talking about. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Reuters says its investigation found that the secret military operation began at least nine years ago in the country's northeast where 
 
 the militant group is most active. Amnesty International and other rights groups have called for an investigation. 
 
CNN's Nima Elbagir has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): The details are absolutely horrifying. Reuters news agency in a new 
 
 investigation says that they have evidence that at least 10,000 pregnancies were aborted. Pregnancies carried by women and girls who had been rescued 
 
 from the Boko Haram militant terrorist organization and who were carrying the children of their captors, forced by Nigeria's own military to abort 
 
 these pregnancies. This is what one girl who spoke to Reuters had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): In the beginning, we were in our town. Boko Haram came and attacked. They grabbed us and took us away to the 
 
 bush. After that, we were in the bush in their hands. Soldiers came and took us. After that, they took us to Maiduguri barracks. And they aborted 
 
 our pregnancies. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELBAGIR: This is not the first time that Nigerian authorities, that the Nigerian military has been accused of human rights violations. A CNN 
 
 investigation into the incidents at Lekki toll gate two years ago found that the Nigerian army had fired live rounds into protesters who were 
 
 protesting, who were demonstrating against police brutality. 
 
This is not only an issue for Nigeria and the condemnation that they're receiving from the Nigerian public for these allegations of human rights 
 
 violations. It's also an issue for the United States of America. Over the last two decades, Nigeria has been the recipient of hundreds of millions of 
 
 dollars of U.S. military assistance, of U.S. training. Also, they have been approved for U.S. armed sales. 
 
Any allegations of human rights violations causes great concerns in the United States because it would place the U.S. administration itself in 
 
 violation of U.S. law, of the Leahy Act, which prohibits the United States to give military assistance to foreign governments accused of human rights 
 
 violations. 
 
A year ago, when the judicial panel investigating what happened at Lekki toll gate found that CNN's investigation had actually been true, that the 
 
 Nigerian authorities, that the Nigerian army was guilty of firing live fire into demonstrators protesting police brutality, we asked the U.S. State 
 
 Department and they said that if this was true, that they would want the perpetrators held to account and that it would call into question U.S. 
 
 military support. 
 
Two years later, nothing has happened. The question remains whether these latest allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Nigerian military will 
 
 have an impact on the U.S.' support.

MACFARLANE: And welcome back, I'm Christina MacFarlane in London and you are watching CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
Chinese President Xi Jinping is meeting with more Gulf leaders today after Thursday talk with the Saudi crown prince. The two countries released a 
 
 statement emphasizing the importance of stability in global oil markets. Beijing is the world's largest buyer of oil and CNN's Steven Jiang tells us 
 
 oil is at the center of their relationship. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: When it comes to this fast, evolving and growing relationship between China and Saudi Arabia, it's 
 
 about more than just oil, but at the same time, nothing matters more than oil because as the world's second largest economy and its biggest oil 
 
 importer, China obviously needs reliable and diversified sources of energy especially at a time when Xi Jinping is trying to jumpstart a sluggish 
 
 economy because of the impact of his Zero COVID policy, which is finally easing. 
 
So Saudi Arabia really plays a crucial role in this strategy. Now in recent years, Saudi oil had been the biggest source of China's foreign oil until 
 
 early this year when Russia started flooding the global market with cheap oil after its invasion of Ukraine to counter Western sanctions. Now Saudi 
 
 Arabia has since reclaimed the top spot. But they obviously very much want to keep it that way by ensuring that China remains its loyal big customer 
 
 even when competitors are offering cheaper prices. 
 
And there are some geopolitical implications here as well, with reports saying both sides already talking about pricing some of the oil 
 
 transactions in the Chinese currency. Now that could pose a challenge to the so-called petrol dollar system which is critical to the U.S. dollar's 
 
 position as the global reserve currency. But that in a way very much speaks to Xi Jinping's desire to reshape a U.S.-led world order. 
 
And the Saudis are very much aware of that and they're trying to adapt to that, especially at a time when they seem to reconsider relying solely on 
 
 the U.S. as a security guarantee with decreasing U.S. military presence in the region. So in their joint statement after the summit, the two flexed to 
 
 deepen their cooperation and coordination in the field of defense, but even more notable was the language in earlier Chinese readout about a summit 
 
 really highlighting Saudi's firm support for China's efforts to deradicalize its population and also it's firm opposition to outside 
 
 interference in Chinese internal affairs in the name of human rights. 
 
All of that really thinly veiled references to China's policy on Xinjiang where Washington has accused Beijing of committing genocide against its 
 
 Muslim minorities. That's something China has always denied, but having that kind of firm support by the world's preeminent Muslim power is very 
 
 important for Xi Jinping, and something he could definitely use. 
 
Steven Jiang, CNN, Beijing.

MACFARLANE: Now the loosening of COVID restrictions in China was sparked by landmark protests. Video shared online give a rare glimpse of the harsh 
 
 reality on the ground, defying China's giant censorship apparatus. Now the man responsible for sharing many of those videos says he's received death 
 
 threats. He speaks exclusively with CNN's Selina Wang. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Video after video of historic anti-Zero COVID protests in China broadcast on the world's television 
 
 screens everywhere but inside China where authorities censored all evidence of the protests. 
 
So how did these images managed to get beyond China's controlled internet? Newsrooms around the world including CNN have been relying on information 
 
 from this Twitter account. And there's only one man behind it. Li, a Chinese painter in Italy, whose identity we're hiding for security reasons. 
 
MR. LI, OWNER OF TWITTER ACCOUNT WHYYOUTOUZHELE (through translator): This account may become a symbol that Chinese people are still pursuing freedom 
 
 of speech. When you post something within China, it will quickly disappear. This account can document all these historical events that cannot be saved 
 
 inside the country. 
 
WANG: His account quickly turned into one of the world's key sources for protest information. 
 <br>[10:35:04]
 
Li says he received thousands of submissions per day as the demonstrations unfolded. Apps like Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are banned in China. But 
 
 people used virtual private networks, or VPNs, which are prohibited in China, to access Twitter and send their videos to Li. 
 
(On-camera): What's the motivation behind all the work you do? 
 
MR. LI (through translator): It's to let people inside of China climb out of the great firewall, to see what's happening at this very moment. 
 
WANG (voice-over): But that's exactly what authorities want to prevent. Here is what happens if you search for information about any of the 
 
 protests on Chinese social media. You get a notice that says, "Sorry, no relevant results are found." Meanwhile, on Li's Twitter account, he was 
 
 rapidly uploading videos of demonstrations across China, from Urumqi, Nanjing, Guangzhou, to Shanghai, where protesters chanted for Xi Jinping to 
 
 step down, calling for freedom and an end to Zero COVID. 
 
And researchers say the Chinese government is even trying to bury information about the protests from social media users abroad. Search on 
 
 Twitter in Chinese characters for cities that had protests and you get this, a flood of spam in porn advertisements. The spam campaign, 
 
 researchers say, appears to be the work of Chinese authorities. Twitter did not respond to a requests for comment. 
 
(On-camera): Are you worried about your own safety? 
 
MR. LI (through translator): Of course, I'm very worried. I get a lot of anonymous harassment saying I know who you are, where you live, and I will 
 
 kill you. 
 
WANG (voice-over): His parents frequently call him in fear, he says. And the Chinese authorities have been harassing them, too, making midnight 
 
 visits to their home in China -- 
 
(On-camera): What price do you think you have to pay for the work that you do? 
 
MR. LI (through translator): This account is more important than my life. I will not shut it down. I have arranged for someone else to take over if 
 
 something bad happens to me. I'm immensely prepared. Even if authorities won't let me see my parents again. 
 
WANG (voice-over): Authorities in China tried to keep the country in a parallel universe. But Li is playing a pivotal role in breaking that 
 
 bubble. Li spends hours a day on the account, only taking breaks to feed his cat and barely slept during the peak of protests. As he sorted and 
 
 verified the endless stream of video submissions, each one urgent and historic, he's doing the work that he hopes one day Chinese journalists and 
 
 Chinese citizens from within China will be able to do without fear.

MACFARLANE: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are giving their unfiltered side of the story in their new Netflix series. So how are the British media 
 
 receiving this? We will discuss that next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:08]
 
MACFARLANE: The reviews are coming in for the much anticipated Netflix docuseries, "Harry and Meghan." So far, there have been no bombshell 
 
 revelations. The first three episodes released on Thursday, taking us through intimate moments the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's relationship. 
 
 Meghan's first exposure to the demands of royal life and Harry's concern about the media's portrayal of Meghan. 
 
The royal family has not commented. And they can't relax just yet because volume two is on its way premiering next week. Meantime, the British media 
 
 have wasted no time in giving their take on Harry and Meghan. 
 
Anna Stewart joins me now to tell us how it has gone for Harry and Meghan. We have the papers in front of us. We know the British press never hold 
 
 back. What have they been saying? 
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They don't, and really they were the ones that were mostly targeted I think by Harry and Meghan, not just the royal 
 
 family. It was very much the press, and not just the tabloid press, not just the paparazzi but also media outlets including TVs like BBC, Sky, big 
 
 outlets, but also the newspapers. 
 
Interestingly, though, look at some of these. We got the "Daily Mail" here that says palace anger at assault on the Queen's legacy. There was a 
 
 similar story actually from the "Daily Telegraph" as well, "Sussexes TV show claims are a direct hit on the late Queen's legacy." So a lot of 
 
 people actually questioning whether particularly some of the discussion about the commonwealth, which one guest on there called a privileged club a 
 
 former colonized nations. 
 
Some of that might be quite damaging to the royal family's reputation and to the Queen's legacy. Others, though, like the "Daily Mirror" have this to 
 
 say, Christie. "Stop this royal circus." Now this is what I found quite interesting because I felt like no minds were necessarily changed by the 
 
 three episodes yesterday. Those who are supportive of the Team Sussex still are. Those who are horrified by their actions are ever more. 
 
But also increasingly, a lot of people perhaps not wanting to hear anymore because a lot of it was very repetitive and at this point in time, you 
 
 know, thousands of ordinary Brits are choosing between eating and heating with the cost of living crisis and here we have more complaining. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. I feel like "The Mirror" actually sums up a bit of the mood of the nation about this, why is it coming now when people are in such 
 
 crisis? We know the royal family have not said anything yet, Prince Charles, I'm sorry, King Charles -- I keep doing that. 
 
STEWART: We're all doing that, don't we? 
 
MACFARLANE: Was out and about, I believe, today. Did they say -- you know, can we expect something from the royal family knowing what's coming down? 
 
STEWART: I actually was wondering, because as we know from the late Queen generally the policy is don't comment, but this time round, given it's King 
 
 Charles, I was wondering particularly if there were new bombshells which we were worrying about with the trailer, and hey, they may come next week, but 
 
 no, no comment at all. 
 
So King Charles doing his walkabout, all official engagements, we got some pictures we can show you. Meeting Ryan Reynolds and Rob  McElhenney who are 
 
 the new owners of Wrexham football club, which is newly called a city so this is one of the reasons he was there. No comment, I look forward to the 
 
 next three episodes and whether that changes anything. It could do. 
 
MACFARLANE: We will wait to see. In the meantime I am watching episodes two and three tonight. So -- 
 
STEWART: I think I make a little appearance next two or three. Could be a joy. 
 
MACFARLANE: We'll keep an eye out on that. Thank you, Anna. 
 
All right, "WORLD SPORT" is up next and I'll be back in 15 minutes with more of CONNECT THE WORLD. Stay with us.
