(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ERICA HILL, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: You are looking at live pictures from ground zero currently, the names of the nearly 3000 people who were 
 
 killed on 9/11 23 years ago are being read as well as those who were killed in the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center.
 
New York City, continuing to mark a number of somber moments throughout the morning on this 23rd anniversary, we will see some of those moments marked 
 
 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and in Washington, D.C. as well. Just after 09:00 a.m. here in New York City, I'm Erica Hill.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: And I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is just 05:00 p.m. here in the UAE, this is "Connect 
 
 the World". Welcome to our special coverage of the 9/11 anniversary commemorations. 
 
We are also following CNN's other major story today. The aftermath of a highly consequential debate. Vice President Kamala Harris and Former 
 
 President Donald Trump debating for 90 minutes. We'll bring you detailed analysis on what we learned about their domestic and foreign policies and 
 
 look at who won the night in the eyes of analysts and voters.
 
HILL: And we'll have all of that for you just ahead. First though, as we noted, this marks 23 years since the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil. 
 
 September 11th, the day that changed not only America, but in many ways, the world forever. In New York, as I noted, the service underway now at the 
 
 site of the 9/11 Memorial.
 
The families of victims of both the 2001 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing reading now the names of their loved ones. This will 
 
 continue for the next couple of hours. We are also awaiting the next moment of silence, which will observe the moment that flight 175 struck the South 
 
 Tower of course, at 08:46 a.m., the first plane struck the North Tower.
 
Among the family members and those remembering their loved ones down there today, of course, you'll see an Honor Guard. You see a number of first 
 
 responders. You will also see a number of dignitaries. Among them, the Former President Donald Trump there at Ground Zero, along with the members 
 
 of his family, and Senator J. D, Vance, his running mate. 
 
You see Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, pardon me. Also on hand, President Biden, Vice President Harris, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, 
 
 also there as the events began earlier this morning. Those are just some pictures, of course, of the memorial there where each of the names is 
 
 etched. 
 
A number of family members arriving earlier in the day with roses, we're told by our colleagues down at the site at Ground Zero. As they mark this 
 
 somber occasion, it is a day where you can feel it in the air in New York City. It feels a bit heavier as people remember where they were as they 
 
 think about the lives that were lost. and as they reflect on what these 23 years have been like. I want to pause now as we listen in just ahead of 
 
 this next moment of silence.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And my grandfather, FDNY, Captain James J. Corrigan, we love you so much and we miss you so much. Me and my three sisters wish 
 
 we got to meet you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Gary Eugene Burch.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joshua David Birnbaum.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: George John Bishop.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chris Romeo --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jeffrey Donald --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Joining me now CNN's Senior National Security Analyst, Juliette Kayyem. She's also a Professor at Harvard University and Former Homeland 
 
 Security Official with the Obama Administration that department, of course, the Department of Homeland Security, Juliette was founded in the wake of 
 
 the 9/11 attacks.
 
Every year, there's this discussion of what has changed since then. But I wonder, as you reflect on this, what is it that you focus on, on this day?
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Yeah. You know, I think, like most people, just sort of came upon me for the first 10 years, 
 
 the anniversary of 9/11 was we all sort of stopped. Some of us went to New York, and I think it's just the nature of time. 
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
And the nature of how a country comes to terms with the trauma like this that it is now a day. And I hope everybody stops to remember. I think what 
 
 strikes me as I looked at quotes from years ago is both how much changed, obviously, policy wise, for the United States, in terms of the Department 
 
 of Homeland Security.
 
Two wars Afghanistan and Iraq, who were -- that were launched in its -- in its wake, as a response to 9/11 and then the consequences of those wars for 
 
 the United States and the rest of the world. But I have to say, I'm sort of a little bit more emotional than I -- than I thought, because I'm now 
 
 seeing the sort of generational looking at these pictures, the generational impact of 9/11.
 
These are grandchildren of the men and women who died. They've never, obviously, met their family member who perished. And you see, I think the 
 
 personal impact that 9/11 still has on so many families. Most of us look at it from afar, but there are these families who will hold this for a very 
 
 long time. You look at this young, young boy who I'm guessing is a -- is a grandson of someone who was lost.
 
HILL: Yet such an important point as we look at this next generation and how they will learn about what happened on that day?
 
KAYYEM: Yeah.
 
HILL: What the ripple effect has been, and where they take that is this new generation? Juliette, appreciate it as always. We are going to continue our 
 
 coverage of the ceremonies here in New York and, of course, across the country today. We do also want to get to our other top story on this 
 
 morning, that is the U.S. Presidential Debate. 
 
It was a night of heated exchanges, to put it perhaps mildly. So of course, the question the morning after, what is the impact? We'll have that 
 
 reaction for you and analysis from our very own Stephen Collinson just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, it started with a handshake initiated by the Vice President --
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Kamala Harris -- debate. 
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good to see you.
 
HARRIS: Thank you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to you both. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, it ended with final statements vastly different in tone and content. In between, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump sparred for more than 
 
 90 minutes in what was their first and possibly only presidential debate of what is this unprecedented campaign.
 
The exchange volleys on the economy, on abortion, on health care, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and support for Israel, U.S. foreign policy and 
 
 immigration. Both candidates, at times, skirted answering direct questions from the ABC moderators. 
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
Over the course of the debate Harris goaded Trump into angry responses that repeatedly contained falsehoods, including this exchange on abortion.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Because they're radical the Democrats are radical in that. And her vice-presidential pick, which I think is a horrible pick, by the way, for 
 
 our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice-presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution 
 
 after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion because the baby is born is OK. And that's not OK with me? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Harris's running mate, Tim Walz, made no such claims, and infanticide is criminalized in every state, which a moderator pointed out. 
 
 Here is what Harris had to say about abortion rights. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe V Wade, and as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a 
 
 pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion that is not happening. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Trump also exaggerated claims about inflation as he tried to tie a potential Harris Presidency to Joe Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Remember this, she is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've 
 
 ever had, a horrible economy, because inflation has made it so bad that you can't get away with that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. Your time is up. 
 
HARRIS: I want to just respond briefly. Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump, and what I do offer is a new generation of 
 
 leadership for our country. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, inflation has been far higher under President Biden than during Trump's term in office, but it's far below the all-time high and has 
 
 fallen to its lowest level in 3.5 years. Well, a CNN Poll taken just after the debate shows 63 percent of viewers think Harris won.
 
With just 55 days to go until Election Day the big question for Harris is, will that translate into votes, especially in those key battleground states 
 
 that we often talk about, that will decide this U.S. election? There is an awful lot to unpack here with friend of the show CNN's Stephen Collinson. 
 
 And it's great to have you, Stephen.
 
In your analysis on CNN Digital, you surmise that Harris laid the trap for Trump and he kept falling into it. Just explain where you're at with that?
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER: Yeah, it was incredible. What Harris wanted to do was to show the American people the worst aspects 
 
 of Trump, to try and remind them what it was like, the bitterness and the chaos during the four years when he was president. 
 
So, she baited him on issues like immigration, on his friendship with Vladimir Putin. All of these questions she used to leverage the perceived 
 
 faults in his character to undermine his own case. This was especially so on the question of immigration. That's an issue where Harris is shown by 
 
 polls be quite vulnerable in this election.
 
But Trump wasn't able to prosecute a good case. Instead, he often exaggerated the extent to which undocumented migrants were coming into the 
 
 country, no more so than when he latched on to this conspiracy theory or this racial slander that's been percolated on conservative media about how, 
 
 allegedly, Haitian immigrants were eating pets. Listen to what he said in that answer.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what's happening 
 
 to the towns all over the United States. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats they're eating -- 
 
 they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINSON: There's no evidence or information whatsoever that that is true. Even Trump's Vice-Presidential Nominee J. D. Vance debunked that on 
 
 Tuesday. But it shows the -- not just the racial depths to which Trump is prepared to go. I think it illustrates how he's in this conservative media 
 
 bubble. 
 
He said he justified his comments by saying he'd seen someone say it was true on television, and the fact that he is inside this insulation that 
 
 he's given from conservative media I think served him quite poorly last night. 
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
ANDERSON: No, I noted exactly the same point when he said it. Thank you for bringing that up. We saw the CNN Poll that almost two thirds of respondents 
 
 think that Harris won that debate. A lot of that may have to do with optics right, as much as substance. 
 
COLLINSON: Yeah, but optics also often do decide a debate. Think back to the very first Presidential Debate, Kennedy against Nixon. People who 
 
 watched that saw a fresh new leader, and they basically handed the election to Kennedy when he was the -- he was -- he was the underdog in that race in 
 
 1960.
 
So, optics can be important. I think the question here is whether the rave reviews that Harris has been getting translate into changing the minds of 
 
 the movable voters, that perhaps 150,000 200,000 people who will decide this election in the swing states. Chris Wallace, a long-time journalist 
 
 who now works for CNN. He covered his first campaign, I think, in 1968. He had a very positive review of this debate. Listen to what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRIS WALLACE, CNN ANCHOR: Kamala Harris pitched a shutout on almost every subject I can think of. And I think she did on style as well. I mean, my -- 
 
 the image of the debate to me is she's there, happy, smiling, expressive, shaking her head and dismay at things Trump was saying. And Trump looked 
 
 angry, scowling. She was looking directly at the audience. He was looking at the moderators and arguing with them. And something else.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And he was --
 
WALLACE: Donald Trump looked old tonight.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, that's fascinating, isn't it? Stephen Donald Trump posted online after the debate for some hours has to be said, way into the wee 
 
 hours of the morning that it was three on one last night. He's also and he was talking about -- it was Kamala plus the moderators there, I guess.
 
He's also casting doubt on a second debate, but he was the candidate who spoke for the most amount of time last night. I thought that was a really 
 
 interesting statistic. He had more time, both in answering questions and in the rebuttals of the interventions, than Kamala did by some degree. Was 
 
 this in the end to his point, anyway, unfair a debate for Donald Trump?
 
COLLINSON: No, because the reason he was speaking more is because he was often questioned on his facts, and he was asked to clarify those facts, 
 
 many of which were false. He did -- the fact that he spoke some more than Harris did, actually hurt him, because what he was saying was undermining 
 
 his own case in many ways.
 
And proving her point, from her point of view, at least, that he should never be allowed back into the Oval Office again. On the question of a 
 
 second debate, the fact that Trump doesn't seem to want a second debate, and the fact that he's now saying the moderators were biased, the whole 
 
 biased, the whole thing was rigged, I think, is a tell. 
 
It seems to show that he believes he lost this debate, and his best interests and hopes of winning this campaign lie in perhaps not exposing 
 
 himself to that all over again. But one final point, debates don't necessarily translate into electoral victories. Not everyone in America 
 
 sees things as the media pundits do on the night of the debate.
 
ANDERSON: Harris won the debate, but can she win the election that tops out, the "Meanwhile in the Middle East -- meanwhile, sorry, "Meanwhile in 
 
 America" Newsletter we write "Meanwhile in the Middle East" from here in Abu Dhabi. "Meanwhile in America" Stephen Collinson with his colleagues, 
 
 Kaitlan who and Selby Rose, it is always a jolly good read. That is how it is topped out post-debate today. Do sign up for that. Stephen, always a 
 
 pleasure mate. Thank you. 
 
Well, among the topics debated last night was the war in Gaza. Each candidate trying to speak to an important cohort of Arab American voters. 
 
 Vice President Harris recalled the horrors of October 7th and offered some mild criticism of Israel's response that is believed to have killed more 
 
 than 40,000 Palestinians. 
 
Harris also reiterated her support for a two-state solution. Former President Trump, meanwhile, offered even fewer details. Instead, he 
 
 criticized Harris for not visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during what was a recent Netanyahu visit to Washington, take a 
 
 listen to what they had to say very specifically.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: Israel has a right to defend itself we would and how it does so matter because it is also true, far too many innocent Palestinians have 
 
 been killed.
 
TRUMP: She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now, and I've been pretty good at predictions, 
 
 and I hope I'm wrong about that one.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, CNN's Nic Robertson live in Tel Aviv. It was the wee hours of the morning, both here and there, and when this -- when they slugged it 
 
 out, as it were for 90 minutes Tuesday night. You were watching, of course, just explain to us the material difference between these two candidate's 
 
 stances. And how might those positions affect this election, Nic?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: And I think we got a real sense from Harris about why she staked out that she would help defend 
 
 and give Israel everything it needs to defend itself, and that it has a right to defend itself. And before going on to talk about the way that she 
 
 sees the way forward, which is important to get the hostages released.
 
But also, important that it's a path to a two-state solution and dignity and respect for the Palestinian population here. And of course, that marks 
 
 her out from Trump. And the reason that she was so strong on defending Israel, because that was Trump's attack against her, that she would be weak 
 
 on it to the point of saying that he thought if she were president, then within two years, there would be no state of Israel.
 
Look, I don't think there was anything in there that people here in this region hadn't heard before. Some of it is perhaps a little uncomfortable 
 
 the way that Israel responds to its -- in its right to self-defense sits uncomfortably with this government. There's no doubt about it, because of 
 
 the implicit criticism.
 
But we didn't hear from anyone in the government commenting, because they have actually heard all this before, from Harris. We did hear from Yair 
 
 Lapid, one of the sorts of leading opposition figures, saying he felt that it was good that both had had a heated debate about the importance of 
 
 supporting Israel.
 
But when it came to this issue of two state solution, when he was being interviewed. He said, look, we're nowhere near that for the next couple of 
 
 years. And that, I think, get to get broadly at the sentiment here. But shifting the dial here, not shifting the dial in the United States, maybe, 
 
 but again, nothing new.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you Nic, thank you. Nic is in Tel Aviv. During the debate, Harris and Trump both spoke about how they would handle Russia's 
 
 war on Ukraine and how they deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was another heated topic. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president, if I win when I'm president elect and what 
 
 I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other. I'll get them together. That war would have never happened. And in fact, when I saw Putin 
 
 after I left, unfortunately, left because our country has gone to hell.
 
But after I left, when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said, oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good, strong point 
 
 of negotiation. Well, it wasn't. And it's only getting worse, and it could lead to World War III.
 
HARRIS: Because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, 
 
 Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.
 
And understand what that would mean, because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are 
 
 so thankful that you are no longer president.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen joining me now from Kyiv again. Wee hours of the morning, you are up, Fred, you will have heard that exchange. 
 
 Just how worried might the Ukrainian President be? Let's start with this, with a Trump presidency. Is it clear at this point?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think that they would be extremely concerned about a Trump presidency. It's definitely 
 
 not something that the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been letting on. But certainly, you can feel here in Kyiv that a lot of 
 
 officials would be quite concerned if Donald Trump would become the president again.
 
One of the things that, of course, they've also latched onto, they've heard about, is the fact that Donald Trump, for a long time now, has been saying 
 
 that he would end the war very quickly.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
At some times, he says it would be within a day. This time, he said it would be before he even became president. But certainly, that's not 
 
 necessarily something that the Ukrainians believe will actually happen. But one of the things that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said in the past is, look, 
 
 if there is some sort of plan for peace, if there is some sort of plan that the Former U.S. President has to bring this war to an end that he would 
 
 like to see it.
 
He would like to see what it entails. So far, apparently, there haven't been many details that have been forthcoming. So quite a difficult and 
 
 uncertain situation. Also, for the Ukrainians, they do believe that if Donald Trump becomes president, the uncertainty would definitely be a lot 
 
 greater for them.
 
Again, they're not sure, exactly sure what would happen, whether or not weapons would be cut off. But one of the things that is, of course, a big 
 
 fear here on the ground is that any sort of peace that they would be forced into, any sort of ceasefire that they would be forced into, could also 
 
 entail the Ukrainians giving up territory for good, and that's definitely something that they do not want to do.
 
On the other hand, of course, there are also some issues with the Biden- Harris Administration that the Ukrainians have had in the past. The weapons deliveries, of course, have been substantial. Kamala Harris alluded to that 
 
 in her answer. And the Ukrainians, of course, have said that they're very grateful for all the weapons that they've received from the United States.
 
But they also do feel that some of these weapons come too slow, come too late. And in some cases, of course, especially if you look at longer 
 
 distance weapons, the Ukrainians are saying they really want the U.S. to lift some of the restrictions on being allowed to target Russian territory 
 
 and deep inside Russian territory with those weapons. One of the things that Ukrainians keep saying is, look, the Russians are hitting our cities 
 
 with missiles.
 
The Russians are using glide bombs that fly very far to hit frontline troops and frontline cities. And the Ukrainians feel that they can't really 
 
 answer that and that they're essentially fighting with one hand tied behind their back, where they do have some longer distance U.S. weapons, but 
 
 they're not allowed to use them to hit deep inside Russian territory, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, Fred. And just a note the U.S. and U.K. Foreign Secretaries in region as we speak. Thank you. Just ahead the U.S. inflation 
 
 report for August, released just minutes ago, what it means for interest rates and indeed these presidential contenders. Julia Chatterley breaks 
 
 that down for us, up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, the 23rd anniversary of 9/11 the New York Stock Exchange is open, and those ringing the bell commemorating the day, of course. Welcome 
 
 back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, and you are watching "Connect the World". It's half past 5 here in Abu Dhabi. It's half past 9, of course, in 
 
 the -- on the East Coast.
 
The U.S. inflation report for August is out. It says consumer inflation has slowed to the lowest rate since February 2021 dropping from a 2.9 rate in 
 
 July to 2.5 percent in August. This is one of the last big economic data releases ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting, where policymakers, 
 
 of course, are expected to make interest rate cuts.
 
It is by how much that the markets are interested in at this point. Let's have a look and see what the big board is up to and -- market off there 
 
 about a half of 1 percent as we speak. Let's get you to Julia Chatterley, who joins me now from New York, the lowest -- slow to the lowest rate.
 
I'm talking about inflation here since February 2021, let's just provide some context for that. Of course, that was slapped by in the middle of 
 
 COVID, we were what, at least so far as the U.S. was concerned about 10 months, weren't we into sort of COVID lockdowns by then? Let's talk about 
 
 what the key takeaways are from this report.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: You raised such an important point that we are a long way from the most painful periods following the 
 
 pandemic, Becky, but people are still struggling with high prices. The good news in this into your point, it's slowing, and this is the slowest rate 
 
 that we've seen since what February of 2021 at around 2.5 percent.
 
What's still driving us, and this is what makes it so painful, is housing costs, rent a huge part of this rising 0.5 percent we saw a spike higher in 
 
 airline ticket prices -- for some late summer travel, I think that after five months of decline, some back to store, clothing prices also added to 
 
 this.
 
What's helping us on the downside, Becky, and perhaps that's even more important, oil, gasoline prices coming tumbling down, and we've seen it all 
 
 prices are down a quarter in the last 12 months or so, and that really is helping the overall pain that people are feeling here.
 
For me overall, Becky, I think what's crucial in this number now, as you pointed out, the Federal Reserve meet next week is the question over what 
 
 they do. This number explains to me why they're saying, look, we care less now about the pressures from inflation, and we care more about limiting the 
 
 downside in jobs.
 
ANDERSON: So, what might we expect from next week's Federal Reserve meeting, on the spot Ms. Chatterley?
 
CHATTERLEY: Very good question. I love being on the spot. I think we do a quarter of a percentage point. I think that's what we get. I know a lot of 
 
 people out there. Borrowers would like to see half a percentage point. I think we go full circle to the disappointment that we were seeing in 
 
 financial markets, because I think this number blunts that urgency and the need to go half a percentage point. So, a bit of a from investors today and 
 
 borrowers --
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. I agree, but we are just speculating of course.
 
CHATTERLEY: Of course we are.
 
ANDERSON: There you go. Don't bet on anything that either Julia or I say.
 
CHATTERLEY: -- little bit --
 
ANDERSON: Well, I mean, you do know. I mean, you don't know what they're going to do, but you know your stuff. It's always a pleasure.
 
CHATTERLEY: -- thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you. All right, let's get you back to Erica Hill for more coverage of -- more of CNN's coverage of the 9/11 memorial happening 
 
 elsewhere, of course, in New York Erica.
 
HILL: Yeah, Becky, thank you. In many ways, it is tough to believe that it was 23 years ago today, the day here in New York City. It was picture 
 
 perfect. Began with beautiful blue skies, much like we are seeing this September 11 today.
 
But of course, the dark images that followed after those plumes of smoke from ground zero in the hours afterwards, of course, people across the 
 
 country and frankly across the world, struggling to determine what had happened New York City, marking that day with a number of moments 
 
 throughout the morning.
 
The first of six moments of silence across the country coming at 08:46 a.m., when the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade 
 
 Center. With me this hour, CNN's Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem, who's also a former homeland security official in the Obama White 
 
 House, and she's a professor at Harvard University.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
Juliette, always good to talk to you, especially on this day, though, as we look back and, in many ways, also look forward.
 
KAYYEM: Yeah.
 
HILL: So much changed in the wake of 9/11 across the board on so many levels, right? But as we look at the national security perspective, as we 
 
 look at the Department of Homeland Security, which of course, came out of these attacks.
 
KAYYEM: Yeah.
 
HILL: And where this nation stands today, both in terms of its own national security and the greater security across the globe?
 
KAYYEM: Yeah.
 
HILL: And what are you watching for this year?
 
KAYYEM: Yeah, there's been so many changes. The first is the threat environment. So, beginning with that, you know, it -- I teach, so I'm with 
 
 younger people who are -- who remain the same age young. And it's interesting, at some stage I realized, you know, 9/11 was not their moment. 
 
 It was actually the economic downturn. And in 2008, that was their shock moment.
 
Their parents lost jobs. They sort of, you know now the students I have now COVID was their shock moment. So one is that, and we see through that, that 
 
 you know, or Hurricane Katrina, that we have climate and cyber and other terror threats, including domestic threats now, and things like January 6 
 
 and, of course, the international threat that we're sort of now in this all-hazards world, right?
 
And not so focused on this particular threat, especially with the death of Bin Laden and so much changing. So that's one thing, how the threat 
 
 environment has changed so dramatically from you know, the days and weeks and months after 9/11 when all you could think about was --
 
HILL: -- moment yeah.
 
KAYYEM: Yeah, those moments --
 
HILL: It's such it's an important point. And Juliette, I love how you bring up to how it is different for the younger generation and their various 
 
 moments.
 
KAYYEM: Yeah.
 
HILL: I do want to know I would like us to pause here for just a moment. We're looking at live pictures from the Pentagon.
 
KAYYEM: Yes, thank you.
 
HILL: And as I pause, it is coming up on 09:37 another moment of silence for the moment that the plane struck the Pentagon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- stood heroically on behalf of the wounded and the hurting in your precious and holy name, I pray. Would you please join me in 
 
 a moment of silence and remembrance of the lives lost on that very minute on September 11, 2001.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and Gentlemen, please be seated. Ladies and gentlemen --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: You looking, of course, at the commemoration ceremony there at the Pentagon, just finishing that moment of silence, which again, marks the 
 
 moment that flight 77 struck the Pentagon. And for a moment there, you also saw the split screen, and you saw two people on the other side of your 
 
 screen on the right.
 
They are a short distance for me here in New York City, continuing to read the names, the nearly 3000 names of those who are lost in the terror 
 
 attacks of September 11, 2001 and also the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center. Juliette Kayyem is with me. Juliette, we were talking about just 
 
 before we went to that moment of silence, what you are noticing you're, of course, a former homeland security official.
 
You are now also a professor, and what you're hearing from your students and from younger people. We are 23 years now, since September 11.
 
KAYYEM: Yeah.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
HILL: And how understandably it is a different moment for them, especially if you're dealing with people who were either, young children not alive at 
 
 the time, but in terms of putting it into context for them.
 
KAYYEM: Yeah.
 
HILL: And what it means for the United States and what it means for the world? What are those discussions like for you in that classroom?
 
KAYYEM: Yeah. It's one of the biggest challenges is to get people who were not of age or even born to understand sort of both before and after aspects 
 
 of 9/11 for this country. I mean, we remember it from the just the experience of flying, which has been so impact, being on airplanes that was 
 
 just been so impacted to surveillance, to the fighting of two wars and its impact on so many military people and their families, the wars in Iraq and 
 
 Afghanistan.
 
I will say. And this is just, you know, this is me reflecting on students. It is now hard for them to understand what that meant for the United 
 
 States, because they don't know what it meant, what it was like to be the United States on September 10, the Cold War was over. We won.
 
There were best-selling books called "The End of History", and some believe that the liberal Democratic agenda would win throughout the globe. China 
 
 was barely mentioned, and they're just entering and trying to figure out a world that's very different than the one that we felt on September 10.
 
I want to say something else about American competency. They look at the wars and how they were fought. They then look at other issues impacting 
 
 this generation. You see it in the polling from the climate, but in particular about guns and COVID. Those are the existential threats they go 
 
 through or are going through.
 
So, their remembrance of or their understanding of 9/11 will be very different. It's incumbent on us to remind them, but I also think it's 
 
 incumbent on adults to reflect on mistakes that we made because of September 11 and what -- and how that has impacted the world our children 
 
 are inheriting. I think it's incumbent on both generations, or all generations, to do that. Maybe 23 years gives us an ability to do that, 
 
 because it's not as raw as it once was.
 
HILL: Yeah, important points all around. Juliette, always appreciate your insight. Thank you.
 
KAYYEM: Thank you.
 
HILL: And we'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump battled fiercely during Tuesday's presidential debate in 
 
 Philadelphia.
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
I hope you've been able to either catch it live with us or as one of our replays. I mean it was fascinating stuff. The debate opened with an 
 
 exchange on the economy, which voters repeatedly say is a top issue for them in this election. Harris slammed Trump over his economic -- proposals, 
 
 which she said includes a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.
 
She also blamed him for creating one of the highest trade deficits in the country's history when he was president. Trump, meantime, blamed Harris and 
 
 the Biden Administration for soaring inflation, which he described as a disaster for Americans of all economic classes.
 
I want to bring back CNN's Julia Chatterley now from New York. Just to discuss where these two candidates are at and how they suggest they might 
 
 go about fixing the economy, because, of course, it is a top issue for voters this year? Let's just have a listen to Trump on his biggest talking 
 
 point, inflation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: I had no inflation, virtually no inflation. They had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country. I've never seen a worse 
 
 period of time. People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else. These the people of our country are absolutely dying with 
 
 what they've done. They've destroyed --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: -- you and I have just been talking about the lowest growth in inflation since February 2021 in the latest CPI numbers just released 
 
 earlier today. But and there's a big but you and I have been talking about this, and you keep reminding our viewers who will be watching this all from 
 
 around the world.
 
Americans don't feel that. They don't feel better off. They feel worse off since the pandemic, despite the fact that these numbers are coming down. So 
 
 how do these two candidates suggest that they will fix that? And who has got the fix that will work at this point?
 
CHATTERLEY: OK, I think some facts are clear here. Inflations are need to be cleared up. Inflation is far worse under the Biden Administration, 
 
 prices in the last 3.5 years overall are up just shy of 20 percent that was around 6 percent for Trump, by the way, and he did have inflation.
 
We just didn't worry about it. So, this was the biggest rod he had to beat her with. And I'll sort of give him an 8 out of 10 for his efforts here. 
 
 It's tough remember, Becky, you and I know the person on the people that are most influential on bringing inflation down is the Federal Reserve.
 
And they have to hike interest rates at a time when it's already very painful for people. We had that period where Trump was potentially talking 
 
 about having a say in Federal Reserve policy. That's a complete no, no. He's backed off that in terms of the ways that they can go about this.
 
Harris, for her part, has talked about tackling price gouging, tackling big companies that are artificially keeping prices high. That created a sort of 
 
 shudder across markets. I don't see that working very well. He's talked about pumping more oil and gas to bring energy prices down.
 
We're down a quarter over the past year, so very little, actually, I think, net in terms of the policies they've announced. It's all about the Federal 
 
 Reserve. And we've seen that, even if it is painful today.
 
ANDERSON: -- it was really interesting because, of course, Harris brought up the fact that a series of economists have looked at Donald Trump's plans 
 
 reducing taxes and various other things, and have said that these are hugely inflationary. Of course, he knocked those back very specifically.
 
Another plank of Trump's economic plans, of course, are increased tariffs. I just briefly want to have our viewers, have a listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: We're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. 
 
 And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the 
 
 tariff off, because it was so much money, they can't. It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: There's no doubt that we are seeing a bit of a rewiring of globalization of late. But do his tariff theories play out that way in real 
 
 life?
 
CHATTERLEY: No, a tariff is a tax that a U.S. company pays on goods incoming to the United States, they then have higher costs. What do they 
 
 do? They do their best to pass them off to consumers. It just raises prices, ultimately, for consumers. Now, these companies can change where 
 
 they buy from, but that takes time, and a whole host of bodies have come out and said what this is ultimately going to cost the average U.S. 
 
 household over a yearly basis.
 
The highest one is the Center for American Progress Fund, $3,900 and that was what Kamala Harris referred to yesterday. Look the burden on this is 
 
 going to fall on the lowest income families. The likelihood is other countries respond with tariffs of their own.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
We're sort of flirting with trade war -- policies. And the biggest issue for me on this Becky, is the fact that he can do this with executive 
 
 orders. Congress can't limit, really, his powers. That will take time, as we saw with the Chinese tariffs, and we're way above anything he did there. 
 
 This is a huge worry.
 
ANDERSON: This is described by Harris during the debate as a Trump sales tax.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yeah, smart --
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: Always a pleasure. Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Still to come, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris first met face to face at last night's debate. Here they are well, reunited again this 
 
 morning, greeting each other in a show of unity at the 9/11 Memorial in New York, as the U.S. marks the 23rd anniversary of the September 11th attacks. 
 
 More on that just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: I'm Erica Hill in New York, where the city, and frankly, much of the nation is marking 23 years since the September 11 terror attacks. 
 
You're looking at live pictures now of the ceremony at ground zero at this hour, family members of those killed in the 2001 terror attacks and also in 
 
 the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center are reading aloud the names of the nearly 3000 victims that will continue to do that for the next few 
 
 hours. Stay with us. "Connect the World" continues after a short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, hello and welcome to "Connect the World". I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi with my colleague Erica Hill in New York. We will 
 
 have all the latest in U.S. politics on the day after a crucial debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. But first Erica with coverage of 
 
 the 9/11, Anniversary Memorial. 
 
HILL: Yeah, Becky thank you. We do begin this hour here in New York, where for a moment, while there is so much talk about politics, of course, and 
 
 divisions in this country, those seem to have been put aside. Earlier this morning at Ground Zero, President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, 
 
 Former President Trump, Senator J. D. Vance, all in attendance at a ceremony there at Ground Zero paying their respects, of course, to the 
 
 nearly 3000 lives lost 23 years ago in the September 11th terror attacks. 
 
You see also the Former Mayor of New York, Mike Bloomberg, there, as well as the two Senators from New York, Senators Schumer and Gillibrand next to 
 
 the vice president. The families of the victims of both the 2001 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing began reading the names of their 
 
 loved ones who were killed shortly after the first moment of silence, which was held at 08:46 a.m., when the very first flight hit the North Tower. 
 
Just ahead, we are going to continue to mark these pivotal moments throughout the morning. We do also know that Trump, Biden and Harris will 
 
 be making their way a short time from now to Shanksville, Pennsylvania to honor the passengers and crew who died there, of course, when flight 93 
 
 crashed into a field. 
 
And there will also be a moment at the Pentagon with the president and vice president a little bit later. I do want to take us though -- I want to 
 
 bring up the sound here, if we could for just a moment as we prepare to mark another moment of silence in just a few seconds from now, the moment 
 
 that the South Tower felt, let's listen in.
