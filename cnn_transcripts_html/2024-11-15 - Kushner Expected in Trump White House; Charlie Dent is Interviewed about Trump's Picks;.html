JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: From Donald Trump's campaign this time after being perhaps the most influential figure in the White House during Trump's first term. But we have new reporting this morning that he might have a major, new role this time.
 
And nearly 60 years old but still rocking the bikini briefs, Mike Tyson winning the battle against aging but can he still win an actual fight? A hundred million people might be about to find out.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BERMAN: So, new this morning, Donald Trump's son-in- law, Jared Kushner, might have been the most important figure in the White House not named Donald Trump during Donald Trump's first term. But Kushner absent, pretty much, from the campaign. Now, though, we are hearing there is a key role for him in the incoming administration. 
 
Let's get right to CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood for this. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
What are you learning, Kylie? 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, John, a key role, but from the outside is what sources are telling us. And the main reason for that is when you talk to diplomats from the region, when you talk to people in Trump's foreign policy circles, they point to the deep relationships that Kushner developed with Arab leaders while he was in the White House during the first Trump administration, and the fact that he has maintained those relationships. 
 
One diplomat from the region I spoke to said that all of the incoming members of Trump's team don't have what Kushner has in terms of the trust from the leaders in the region. He worked on those relationships. He maintained those relationships. Another source said that relationships in the region are really fundamental to getting anything done. 
 
Now, he's not expected to join the team, as I said, as a formal player. But from the outside, even this go round, it's going to be a little bit different. There will be complications. There will be tension because one of the things that Jared Kushner did over the last few years was develop an investment fund. He has a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia in that fund. So, there are some current diplomats who are concerned about the role that he will likely play from the outside because they're concerned about prioritization of the U.S./Saudi relationship in some ways that could financially benefit Kushner. 
 
But when you look at the members of the team that Trump has already pulled in over the last few days, a key question is how they're going to interact with Jared Kushner, right? And so I've talked to sources who say that they are developing those relationships. A source familiar with the matter says that Kushner's able to advise and brief them from the outside as much as they want. And a lot of these nominees have already read Jared Kushner's book, or are reading it, an indication that he is already involved in these relationship. We'll have to see how they play out.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: Yes, potential conflicts there, but not something that the incoming administration seems particularly concerned about.
 
Kylie Atwood, thank you very much for that.
 
Sara.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: All right, with us now for his take in all of this, the latest in the moves to go through the Trump transition, former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent.
 
Glasses or no glasses, I'm glad you're here this morning. 
 
CHARLIE DENT (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Thanks, Sara.
 
SIDNER: We all use them. We don't have to pretend. 
 
CNN has some reporting I want to ask you about, about Trump's transition team. He's not using the traditional FBI background checks, according to our reporting, for some of his cabinet picks, but instead using private companies to vet the potential candidates for administration jobs. I mean, to you, does this pose a potential security risk to the United States? 
 
DENT: Well, I suspect the reason why he's not using the FBI background check system is because he's afraid that they will not pass those tests and so he's trying to circumvent that process. So, yes, it does create concerns for me. 
 
And by the way, I'm friends with Tulsi Gabbard, but I'm sure her ties to Syrian President Assad and her relations with the Russians will come under heavy scrutiny for that position. And I suspect they want to avoid that. 
 
Certainly Matt Gaetz, he's already been investigated by the DOJ and, obviously, the subject of an Ethics Committee investigation. He would have enormous problems, as well. 
 
So, yes, they're using this process to - this new process of other companies to vet these candidates so that they - so they can avoid the FBI. It's very clear. 
 
SIDNER: You know, on that point, what are the chances that Donald Trump will try to push this through without Senate approval? In other words, use those recess appointments. 
 
DENT: Well, I don't think that the recess - look, Senator John Thune is a good man and he's an institutionalist. I don't think Senate Republicans are going to use this recess appointment process. If they do, it will be done very sparingly. And I don't think they would use it for candidates who are deemed unqualified. Maybe for somebody who is qualified, but controversial, like - you remember John Bolton, in the first Trump administration, I think he became - took his position because of a recess appointment. 
 
But I don't see that happening for a Matt Gaetz. I - I can't imagine that Matt Gaetz's nomination will last long. I think he'll have to withdraw it. And some of these other nominations, too, that are that controversial. 
 
And if you're a Senate Democrat, why would you obstruct this process? I think you would want Senate Republicans to be on the record voting on some of these very controversial nominees that would like to use this politically. 
 
SIDNER: I do want to ask you about something that "The New York Times" is reporting now, that Iranian officials say that Elon Musk met with Iran's U.N. ambassador for more than an hour in a secret location. It, obviously, shows you Iran's still willing to talk and have discussions. Do you have concerns about this - this secret meeting? 
 
DENT: Yes, I do, actually. And, by the way, it's - it's OK for presidents to use emissaries from time to time. 
 <br>[08:40:01]
 
Using Elon Musk, for example, we've - it's also been reported that he's had communications with Vladimir Putin, now with the Iranians. And I guess what would concern me is that Elon Musk is probably read into many aspects of what the government does, classified information, I suspect, he has access to at times. And that would concern me that - that a private citizen with as much at stake with the federal government is being used in this unofficial capacity. 
 
Again, it's not necessarily improper to use emissaries to probe adversaries, but I would - I don't think I would be using Elon Musk, given his high-profile and his extensive engagement with the federal government on so many business matters. 
 
SIDNER: You were, and you mention this, you were the chair of the Ethics Committee. The committee has canceled its meeting today, where we were expecting to - to see whether or not they vote to make the report on Matt Gaetz, on to the investigation into, among other things, potential sexual misconduct, drug use. Do you think the report is ever going to see the light of day? Will - whether Congress members get it, or the public gets it? 
 
DENT: Well, it's interesting. Ordinarily, once a member of Congress resigns, the House Ethics Committee loses jurisdiction of that investigation. That said, this investigation appears to have been completed. And the report is ready to go. So, the committee was going to meet, apparently, to vote on the report and then release it. 
 
I suspect, I don't know, I haven't seen it, but I suspect the report had very damning information. They were probably going to recommend some kind of a sanction on Matt Gaetz, reprimand, censure, who knows, maybe expulsion, which would be moot at this point. They could recommend all those things, but it - but now that the investigation is complete, the committee will be under tremendous pressure to release it. 
 
I think they can. You may remember Senator John Ensign was, I believe he resigned from the Senate, and a report was released after his resignation, as I recall. So, it's happened. 
 
And also, as part of the vetting process for Matt Gaetz for - for attorney general position, since he is a nominee, both Senators Durbin and Cornyn, I think, would like to see this report. They would like this report to be part of their record as they consider him as a - consider Gaetz as the next attorney general nominee. 
 
So, I think that this is a - I think there will be tremendous pressure to release it. The fact that the committee canceled its meeting today does not mean they won't meet next week or the following week. They still have time to deal with this. But there will be enormous pressure to release it. And I think there is some precedent. 
 
SIDNER: Charlie Dent, it's always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us early this morning. Appreciate you.
 
DENT: Thanks, Sara.
 
SIDNER: Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: So, today we are introducing you to one of 2024's top five CNN Heroes. 
 
Since 2021, a record number of unaccompanied migrant children have traveled to the United States, many fleeing violence and extreme poverty. Rachel Rutter is an immigration lawyer who is trying to help them. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The cartel started asking for money. They were telling my family they were going to kidnap me and my sister. My mother chose to just leave everything we had. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They killed my aunt. They tried to take my mom's and aunt's house. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The trip lasted like a
 
 month. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I came alone.
 
RACHEL RUTTER, CNN HERO: Once the children arrive here in the U.S., they've already been through so much trauma. It can be jarring when they arrive here and realize that it's really just beginning. 
 
These kids are not coming here to ruin the United States or take our jobs or commit crimes. They're coming here to be safe and to take care of their families. They want to study. They want to work. They want to achieve something here in the U.S. And they are some of the hardest- working, kindest, most resilient kids.

BOLDUAN: And you can go to cnnheroes.com to vote for Rachel or any of your favorite top five heroes.
 
Coming up for us, hearing about even one UFO sighting is fascinating, noteworthy, and, I guess, should be alarming. How about more than 750 sightings? The new Pentagon report just out.
 
And a Minnesota man is now free. A judge vacated his murder conviction after he sat wrongfully convicted behind bars for 16 years. What an unreliable star witness, a reality TV show, and a questionable photo lineup have to do with it all, and what he wants to do now with his newfound freedom. That man is our guest. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:49:36]
 
SIDNER: New this morning, a new study estimates that 260 million Americans will be overweight or obese by 2050. The study's co-author saying, quote, "obesity is at a crisis point throughout the USA." This as weight loss and diabetic drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, you know the names, have been considered game changers for some people. But there are still questions about side effects, accessibility, and ultimately the results. 
 <br>[08:50:02]
 
Our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, is here to answer your questions about these drugs. 
 
All right, we're going to start with saying, we love our Sanjay and we're glad you're here.
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much.
 
SIDNER: And then we're going to go with a question from Maria who is in Florida. Here's her question. She asks, once you reach your weight goal, can you stay in a lower dose of something like Ozempic or Wegovy, or potentially space out the injections for the maintenance of the weight that you've already lost? 
 
GUPTA: Yes. So, the quick answer here is, yes. And people aren't used to hearing that because you think you get your dose with medication -
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
GUPTA: You sort of stick with that same dose. These medications, you know, you dial up the dose on the pen. You can adjust that dose. Some people stay on a maintenance dose. They don't actually increase the dose. Some people will space out their dosing. So, there's all these different things that are already starting to happen. And, you know, it makes sense, because you're trying to quiet the food chatter in your brain. You're trying to see, what is the ultimate dose to get you the best results without having side effects. 
 
It's best to do it in conjunction with the doctor, for sure, to sort of monitor that. But two things really jumped out at me while we were working on this documentary. One is that most people are stopping these medications within 12 weeks. I think that's really interesting because I think the assumption was, these were going to be lifelong meds. 
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
GUPTA: Not the case for most people. 50, 58 percent. 
 
And the second thing is, a new study - actually I just printed it out, shows that about 80 percent of people will maintain a significant amount of weight loss after coming off these things, if they've - if they've done it in conjunction with lifestyle changes. 
 
SIDNER: (INAUDIBLE).
 
GUPTA: So, the medications serve as motivation, almost, as much as a medication. 
 
SIDNER: It's really interesting. I think people hear 12 weeks and it - that seems like, what?
 
GUPTA: Yes. Right.
 
SIDNER: Because you heard at the beginning, people thought it was going to be lifelong. 
 
We've got another question from Sam in Arizona and they write, they're hopeful that these drugs can help with infertility, but says they're frustrated that insurance companies refuse to recognize this. 
 
What can you tell us about these drugs and fertility? 
 
GUPTA: So, there - yes, there's a clear relationship here. You know, there's been these - these social media memes going around saying Ozempic moms.
 
SIDNER: Right. GUPTA: People who go on these medications, able to get pregnant for the first time. They hadn't been able to in the past. There's a clear correlation between losing weight and pregnancy. Something specifically known as polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS, that seems to be less symptomatic when people actually lose weight. So, that's probably the correlation there. So, that's the first part of the question. 
 
Second part, though, insurance, you know, because - they can cover obesity, but not necessarily PCOS yet for these medications. That may come with more studies. 
 
SIDNER: That would be the off-label thing, and insurance companies don't generally. 
 
GUPTA: That's right.
 
SIDNER: Sanjay Gupta, it's always great to see you. And this is going to be an incredible look. You spent a year, right, looking into this? 
 
GUPTA: Spent a year working on this, yes. In case you were wondering where I was. 
 
SIDNER: No, because you're always here, too. You do everything. 
 
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, it's always a pleasure. Thank you.
 
GUPTA: Good to see you, Sara. 
 
SIDNER: John.
 
BERMAN: The sabbatical is over. 
 
All right, a new report released by the Pentagon reveals hundreds of alleged UFO sightings. In just over a year, it recorded more than 750 sightings in the United States. The reported sightings came from everyday citizens, to commercial and military pilots. Some of the incidents are still under investigation, although the Pentagon claims that there is still no official evidence of extraterrestrial activity. The truth is out there.
 
So, this morning, Mike Tyson is 58 years old, which is too old for some things, but apparently not slapping the guy you're about to box in front of tens of millions of people. Tyson slapped Jake Paul in advance of their ridiculously hyped fight on Netflix tonight. Paul called the slap cute. He also called Tyson an angry little elf. 
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: John, thank you so much.
 
After 16 years behind bars, a Minnesota man is speaking out now as a free man. Edgar Barrientos-Quintana was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder of an 18-year-old in 2008 in a drive-by shooting. Now, after a years' long investigation and an even longer fight for
 
 justice, the state's top prosecutor says Barrientos-Quintana is an innocent man. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARY MORIARTY, COUNTY ATTORNEY, HENNEPIN COUNTY, MINNESOTA: Nothing can give Mr. Barrientos-Quintana back those 16 years, and for that we are so sorry. And our hearts are with the family of Jesse Mickelson over the irreparable loss. 
 
When the criminal legal system does not function ethically, it causes significant harm. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: In a scathing report some 130 pages long, the states review board found multiple miscarriages of justice here. Things like detectives coercing witnesses, a questionable photo lineup, prosecutors failing to reveal at trial that a reality TV crew was embedded with investigators at the time and gave scripted statements for investigators to read on camera. 
 <br>[08:55:04]
 
Also failing to reveal evidence that the conviction review unit determined would have shown that Barrientos-Quintana could not have been at the crime scene at the time of the shooting. 
 
Now, the victim's family supports his release from prison and believes he is innocent. 
 
Joining me right now is Edgar Barrientos-Quintana and his attorney, Julie Jonas. 
 
Thank you both so much.
 
Edgar, after reading about what you have been through, I mean, it's so wonderful to see you - your face and to see you free. 
 
What does - what does this feel like to be a free man once again? 
 
EDGAR BARRIENTOS-QUINTANA, MURDER CONVICTION VACATED ATER SERVING 16 YEARS IN PRISON: It feels good. It feels good to be back with my family. Enjoying the last couple days. It's new. 
 
BOLDUAN: To say the least. I mean I - like seeing you say just as you were being released that you never lost hope during all of those 16 years that you were in prison, and, I mean, you were made of better stuff than me because I'm wondering, how did you not lose hope in that time? 
 
BARRIENTOS-QUINTANA: Man, I have a - the Great North Innocence Project, they were on my case from the start. And knowing that they were fighting for me to go home, come home, my family just kept me going. Kept me going. BOLDUAN: Are you angry about what happened to you, the time that was
 
 stolen from you? 
 
BARRIENTOS-QUINTANA: No, no, no. I mean, I'm never going to get this time back. But, no, I'm not mad. I'm - I'm just living life right now. I'm just - I'm happy I'm out here. And, you know, life's too short for that right now, man. 
 
BOLDUAN: You know that better than anybody. 
 
Julie, from the play-by-play that I have read, Edgar was let down by like every single step of the judicial system along the way, from investigators, to prosecutors, to his own defense attorney at trial. How did they get this so wrong? 
 
JULIE JONAS, FORMER LEGAL DIRECTOR, GREAT NORTH INNOCENCE PROJECT: You know, I think it was just, in terms of the defense attorneys, real inexperience. These were people who should not have been trying a murder case. From the perspective of the state, I do think it was a significant problem that the first 48 was embedded with the case from the beginning. And so when investigators first turned their attention to Edgar and thought that they had solved the case, and then told the family that on film, once they found out about his alibi, that he was across town on video and he could not have made it in time to the crime scene, as the accomplice said he did, it just couldn't have happened that way, once investigators learned that, they were already committed to the story of his guilt, both to the producers of "The First 48," and the family, who, again, they told they solved the case on video, and the television program was already in production and shown on air just before his trial. I think it was very hard for investigators to go back and say, whoops, we made a mistake, this guy couldn't have done it. 
 
BOLDUAN: But, again, that's their job. I mean, you know, you've been representing him for 11 years, Julie. Was that the most glaring issue kind of along the way of how his case was handled? 
 
JONAS: Well, from my perspective, the most glaring issue were his defense attorneys. I mean Edgar had a wonderful alibi. As soon as we started investigating this case, I thought, how on earth could he have been convicted. He had the videotaped alibi, all of the scene witnesses, and there were seven of them, said that the shooter was bald or even shiny-headed bald. And we had him on video, just before the shooting at the - at a grocery store across town and again after the shooting at a baptism party that he went to that night with a full head of hair. But his attorneys, at trial, completely mishandled this evidence. And the jury just didn't get a full picture of all of the things that proved he was innocent. 
 
BOLDUAN: I think what we're looking at is a side-by-side is - of - and you correct me - if you can see this, Julie, but this is a picture of Edgar on the left, of kind of what - his booking photo, but then on the right is an old photo that was used during the photo lineup, correct? 
 
JONAS: You know, I can't actually see the videos that you're seeing. BOLDUAN: Oh, sorry.
 
JONAS: I believe you, because I know that those photos appeared in our post petition - post-conviction petition, as well as the report of the conviction review unit. So, I think I know what you're looking at, and that's right. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, absolutely. 
 
Edgar, what do you want to do with your life now? 
 
BARRIENTOS-QUINTANA: Just - just live life. 
 <br>[09:00:00]
 
That's it. You know, travel. Do what I was doing before I went to prison. Same thing. Work. Spend it with my family. My kids.</pre>
