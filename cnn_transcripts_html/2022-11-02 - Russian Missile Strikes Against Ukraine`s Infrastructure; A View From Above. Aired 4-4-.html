COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Welcome to CNN 10. I`m Coy. Happy to be right here with you on this wonderful Wednesday. We`re halfway 
 
 through the week, so let`s lock in and keep aiming to be a little better today than we were yesterday.
 
Now, in previous episodes, we`ve discussed the ongoing war that started when Russia invaded Ukraine in February of this year. This week, Russia 
 
 launched a new round of missiles against Ukraine. The more than 50 missiles largely targeted critical facilities in Kyiv, the capital city in Ukraine. 
 
 This is part of Russia`s increasing attacks against critical infrastructure across the country. 
 
This week, 80 percent of residents in Kyiv were left without water and as of Monday, many homes and businesses were without electricity as well. One 
 
 of the missile strikes hit an energy facility that powered 350 apartments in the capital, impacting many people who lost power. The Ukrainian 
 
 government urged residents to stock up on water from shops and pumping stations after the attack.
 
Following the attacks, emergency services in Ukraine were attempting to restore power and stabilize the situation as soon as possible, especially 
 
 before the start of winter. Leaders in Kyiv were also calling on assistance from the European Union and NATO as well as several governments. By 
 
 yesterday, Ukraine had already made agreements with 12 countries to obtain nearly 1,000 units of power equipment, including generators.
 
And this isn`t the first time Ukrainian citizens haven`t had access to water. Survivors of the siege in the city of Mariupol at the start of the 
 
 war had to collect rain water and melted snow for drinking Russian. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the recent onslaught of missiles are a 
 
 response to an attack on Russia`s fleet in Crimea on Saturday, which he blamed on Ukraine.

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  Life just got harder in Kyiv. Monday morning, 80 percent of the capital`s water off 
 
 following a new barrage of Russian airstrikes, spigots not use since the war began a lifeline again, but not unexpected. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everyone in Kyiv right now and they choose to stay here. They are like ready for this. 
 
ROBERTSON:  Will it make you leave the city? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, I will stay here. I didn`t leave it since the war begins. So, why have to do it now? 
 
ROBERTSON:  Despite the long lines in some parts of the city, patience aplenty. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I`m standing with my friends in one hour, maybe two- hour, maybe three, maybe no water after 20 minutes. But I`ll go back. 
 
ROBERTSON:  Scenes like this are becoming increasingly normal across Ukraine. Government officials say that there were ten different regions 
 
 targeted Monday, 18 different sites. 
 
Among them, a hydroelectric power plant, Ukraine`s biggest in Zaporizhzhia. Another power gen site in central Ukraine. Kharkiv subway in the east still 
 
 by strikes on vital infrastructure there. 
 
And despite intercepts, 44 across the country, according to the government, groups of missiles getting through, at least three according to this 
 
 witness near Kyiv`s hydroelectric power plant. 
 
A missile flew over our house and went to the balcony, and saw the second missile and a drone, she says, both were flying in the direction of the 
 
 power plant. It`s so scary when you see it. 
 
Three weeks of targeting Ukraine`s electricity network is pushing the power grid towards a tipping point, no doubt more of this to come.

WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:
 
What is considered the most expensive object ever built?
 
The Burj Khalifa, the Oakland Bay Bridge, the International Space Station, or the London Crossrail?
 
With estimates over $100 billion, the football field size International Space Station is by far the most expensive project ever constructed.

WIRE:  French astronaut Thomas Pesquet spent six months aboard the International Space Station last year. He says that experience made him 
 
 realize we live in an oasis in the cosmos that we need to protect. He also says they`ve discovered technology that could lead to us eating the 
 
 packaging that our food comes in.
 
For today`s "Call to Earth" segment, we`re heading 248 miles high to get a view of the earth very few people get to see.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
THOMAS PESQUET, ASTRONAUT AND FAO GOODWILL AMBASSADOR:  When you look at the Earth from the space station, it`s absolutely magical. It glows in 
 
 blue, and it`s the most beautiful scenery you could possibly imagine. 
 
When you take a step back and you see the arsenic`s entirety, you understand it it`s just an oasis in the cosmos. All around, there`s 
 
 nothing. No life. It`s blackness emptiness and there`s this blue bowl with everything we need to sustain human life and life in general which is 
 
 absolutely fragile. It makes you want to cherish the Earth.
 
I`m Thomas Pesquet, an astronaut for the European Space Agency. I`m coming back from my second mission to space, all onboard the International Space 
 
 Station, so permanent laboratory that orbits the Earth. 
 
Just like us on board of space station, the Earth is a spaceship and we are its crew. It flies around the sun. It has limited resources. It has some 
 
 protection means but they can be overcome. You don`t control the amount of resources that you have on board but you have to manage them.
 
And what you can control, the way you care about the spaceship, the way you maintain it because you want the flight to be as long and peaceful as 
 
 possible. 
 
You can see a lot of the consequences of human activities from space. Some of them climate change, some of them are just plain old pollution. 
 
My first mission was in 2016 launch, 2017 landing. My second mission was five years later, 2021, and I could see a difference. The most visible 
 
 effect is glaciers retreating, year after year mission after mission. You know, the ice caps melting in the poles.
 
I`m an ambassador for the food and agricultural organization of the United Nations. But during my mission on the space station, we had a lot of 
 
 research done on plants because space is a harsh environment for plants. By studying plants in the environment of space, then we can study how they can 
 
 resist to a drought or water scarcity, and then we can feed all those results to research being made on Earth and to create some more resistant 
 
 crops, the crops that will resist to climate change. 
 
We`ve also worked a lot on all our packaging just like on Earth, we`re trying to limit the production the use of plastic the production of waste 
 
 and so we came up with edible packaging, which is just a such a fantastic and simple concept. We need foam to protect everything from shocks during 
 
 launch into space, so what we did is we turned that foam into food it`s like gingerbread.
 
Now, our packaging is at the same time our source of food. It reduces the need to send cargo up. It reduces the production of trash. It`s brilliant. 
 
 So, hopefully, that technology can also transfer to packaging on the ground and then we can reduce our environmental footprint every time we go buy 
 
 something in the supermarket. 
 
If we set ourselves on the right path, there`s nothing we cannot do. We built that unbelievable facility in space. We`re using it every day, 
 
 peaceful cooperation between countries that we`re not always friends. So if we can transfer that model to the way we deal with the environment I think 
 
 we`ll get there.
 
I`m optimistic for the future. If we can make a space station fly, then we can save the planet.

WIRE:  For today`s 10 out of 10, we have a story creating a big buzz. It turns out bumblebees may be more complex than we thought. U.K. scientists 
 
 designed an experiment that gave 45 bumblebees the choice between a clear path to food or a player filled with wooden balls. 
 
Well, honey, the result was something to beehold. The bees repeatedly chose to roll the balls around, sometimes over 100 times. Researchers believe 
 
 that this show`s bees found playtime rewarding. Now, that`s intere-sting.
 
Shout out time now. Hive-five to Greeley, Nebraska, Central Valley Public Schools, rise up. 
 
And I`ll leave you with this today: if there`s something you want out there, think about the goal, speak about the goal, believe you`ll reach it 
 
 and you just might achieve it. 
 
We`ll see you tomorrow. I`m Coy and this is CNN 10.
