JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: We're at this hour where Donald Trump very shortly will leave taking off from Florida to come here to New York City where he faces arraignment tomorrow. He is expected tomorrow -- there you go, you're looking at live pictures of Donald Trump's plane. That is the West Palm Beach airport.
 
Trump, we believe, is headed there very shortly. That plane looks fueled up, ready to take off and come here tomorrow. He will be booked and fingerprinted at the Manhattan courthouse.
 
There are some new details about how this process will play out. And also, the New York City Mayor and the New York Police Commissioner will make a public safety announcement next hour. Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: This just in. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has filed an appeal against his arrest in Russia. No date though has been set for a hearing on this appeal. Gershkovich is currently being held in the -- in the notorious -- in a notorious pre- detention facility in Russia and he faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. In a phone call yesterday between Secretary of State Tony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Blinken called for his immediate release.
 
Joining me now is Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He has been involved in many negotiations for detained Americans overseas including helping with the successful release of Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner from Russia. Ambassador, it's good to see you. Thank you for coming in. This news that Gershkovich has filed an appeal, is this just part of the process? What does this mean?
 
BILL RICHARDSON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Well, this is part of the process. It's a good process that they're following. I think what is encouraging is that the secretary of state at his level, called the secretary of state of Russia.
 
That is very important. Keep it at a very high level. They hadn't been in touch in a long time.
 
Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, is a pragmatic person. I dealt with him when I was ambassador to the UN. He was the Russian ambassador to the UN. But this is -- this is positive at that level. [11:35:04]
 
Now the process of appeal when the hearing is, this is normal. This is Russian delight tactics. Russian, they've leveled this unfortunate arrest to a very disturbing level, raising the stakes enormously.
 
BOLDUAN: As of last night, you had not been in touch with the Gershkovich family. If they do ask for your help, ambassador, as so many families have, what's -- what do you tell them? What's the first thing that you say -- you tell them they need to do here?
 
RICHARDSON: Well, what I -- what I would do, and I'm not seeking this because -- but we have to have contact with the families. My foundation works for families at no cost to them. We take no money. We coordinate with the administration. We don't have to get their approval to get involved. We have worked with them on the past, as you mentioned.
 
But right now, the family is going through a very traumatic moment because they got all these people calling them all these pressures. But I think the fact that the secretary of state at his level, calling Lavrov -- also including Paul Whelan, which is the forgotten Navy guy out there. He's been there for years wrongfully detained. But it's going to take a very tough negotiation.
 
I think outside actors have to be part of this. It can't just be official channels. But the fact that it's at the highest level, Lavrov and the secretary of state have not talked enough, I think this is good. At this level, let's see what happens.
 
BOLDUAN: And let's see what happens is exactly right. I mean, you've seen this process so many times. You mentioned Paul Whelan. What does this case -- now dealing with Gershkovich, what does it mean to the efforts to bring Paul Whelan home?
 
RICHARDSON: Well, why did the Russians take Evan, The Wall Street Journal reporter? Three reasons. One, espionage charges. For the Russians, like Paul Whelan, this is the maximum course that they always exact. This is a bargaining chip on their part.
 
Secondly, I think they were upset at the detention of a Russian by the Justice Department. Third, I mean, the general state of relationship, it's so rocky between the United States and Russia. And I don't know how much contact is going on.
 
I think it's important to keep these humanitarian issues separate from the geopolitical issues on Russia and Ukraine. And I believe the secretary of state making this phone call after a long time that they haven't talked at that level with Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Secretary of State, is important. Let's see how that plays out. But I think a lot of actors need to be part of this.
 
This is an attack on journalism. I think you guys in the journalistic community, in the media community -- the journalist community, need to be part of a public effort internationally. It's not just America. Journalists are being arrested all around the world. In Myanmar, in Iran, and Venezuela.
 
All over the world, journalists are becoming prey because they're just doing their job and they're criticizing existing governments. So, I think there has to be an international effort, a multilateral effort, not just the United States but the European Union, the United Nations, protect journalists, protect NGO workers that are being all over the world arrested for no reason at all.
 
BOLDUAN: Thanks for those words and thanks for your efforts always, Ambassador. Appreciate it.
 
RICHARDSON: Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): We are keeping an eye on Palm Beach, Florida as former President Trump prepares to head to New York for his arraignment. Security is tightening in the city. The New York City Mayor and the NYPD Commissioner will make a public safety announcement in mere minutes.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:43:37]
 
SIDNER: A new study on autism reveals a potential new risk. Researchers found a moderately higher chance of autism in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with elevated lithium levels. CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen is here. This study didn't show a direct link between the two but what exactly did it say?
 
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Sara, what this study showed is that when moms were exposed to high levels of lithium, their children were more likely to develop autism. In fact, if you look at the moms who had the highest level of exposure, their children were 46 percent more likely to develop autism. So, this is not to say -- I want to be clear, not to say that lithium causes autism at all. No one would say that.
 
But you know, you and I both know so many families affected by autism. Those parents want answers about why this happened to their children. This may possibly be a part of that answer, Sara.
 
SIDNER: It's really interesting. Of course, it's going to be concerning to people who might say, hey, I guess maybe we should start drinking bottled water. Is that something they should be thinking about?
 
COHEN: It doesn't seem like that really makes a difference. There have been reports that lithium is in bottled water as well.
 
SIDNER: That's really interesting. I think a lot of people don't realize that bottled water is often taken from the tap, so -- with these companies repurpose it. I do want to ask you about how lithium actually gets into the water supply. Is that naturally occurring? [11:45:12]
 
COHEN: It is there. I think a lot of people don't know that lithium is in the earth and so it can get into the groundwater. That's the major source.
 
There are some questions about whether disposing of lithium batteries could -- or other lithium devices could add to that. That's currently being studied to see whether that might be a more minor contributor to lithium and drinking water.
 
SIDNER: Elizabeth Cohen, thank you so much for that really interesting study and all those details. Appreciate it. Turning to Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: And then there were two.
 
BERMAN: By that, you mean the two of us just sitting right here.
 
BOLDUAN: No. but Sara's right there.
 
BERMAN: I'm sorry.
 
BOLDUAN: Tonight, San Diego State University takes on UConn for the NCAA men's championship. And what a wild ride it has been. The only person that I want to speak with about any wild ride in sports is Christine Brennan. It's great to see you, Christine.
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Great to see you, guys.
 
BOLDUAN: This is the most -- 
 
BRENNAN: Congrats for the new show.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you.
 
BRENNAN: You're getting your steps in. I -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Well, you know, we need it. The most unlikely of -- unlikely matchups with this men's final. How did we get here?
 
BRENNAN: Well, lots and lots of upsets. I think San Diego State did a great service to the nation by getting rid of Alabama and all the trouble there. And all joking aside, of course, we're talking about the murder of a young woman and the gun being delivered by one of the players according to police.
 
Anyway, Alabama's gone. If they were in this, could you imagine the controversy? But it's San Diego State and UConn. Now, UConn is basketball royalty. More for the women.
 
BOLDUAN: Exactly.
 
BRENNAN: The men for now -- it's been nine years since the men have gotten this far. In fact, it's -- they've gotten even to the round of 32 but they're in it -- or round of 16, sweet 16. So, they're in it. They are the favorite. You know what it is. It's their offense. But San Diego State has a tremendous defense as we've seen. UConn has won every game in the tournament by double digits, so I would think they may be able to do that again.
 
BERMAN: I go back with UConn to Ray Allen and Nadav Hedefeld. I mean, if you remember those guys when it was -- 
 
BRENNAN: Sure.
 
BOLDUAN: No.
 
BERMAN: -- that was in the Big East before you were born. You -- look, the men's game, the finals are going to be great.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: We talk about the women's finals because this tournament for the women was -- I thought it was the best I've ever seen. And it was just riveting before, during, and now after.
 
BRENNAN: It is. And this is you know the 50th anniversary of Title Nine. Happy Birthday, Title Nine. Here's Caitlin Clark.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes -- (INAUDIBLE) 
 
BRENNAN: This is what America has created. And Angel Reese in the LSU team. I think this is absolutely the greatest. I agree with you, John. The greatest moment for women's sport -- women's basketball.
 
And I think Caitlin Clark will be the most discussed athlete in college sports, male or female, over the next -- and so she plays again. And there could be not just her senior year, but also a COVID year for her. She -- we could have two more years of her in college, why would she stay in college versus going to the pros? Because she'll be able to make more money. That NIL money, name, image, and likeness is going to be tremendous.
 
And the fact that gosh, for 20 years as you know I've been harping on. We got to say the word man's, that pesky adjective men's, right, to do -- it's not the tournament in the women's -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Right.
 
BRENNAN: -- it's the men's and the women's for the respect for women. And look at this. It's incredible. And people are still discussing the controversies. It's all great for women's sports and I almost can't believe that I live to see this day.
 
BOLDUAN: The game is good. The athletes are amazing. And now they've got characters and narratives and controversy. I mean, this is -- this is good TV. This is good for the sport.
 
BRENNAN: It is.
 
BERMAN: And also, for the tournament, the players come back for a few years, unlike the -- you know, prevalence of the one-and-dones in the men's game.
 
BRENNAN: No, that's true. We also had the Blue Bloods. You know, you had big schools, Iowa and LSU, big ten in SEC in the final. I think the upsets on the men's side have made it interesting, but maybe it's kind of like who are these guys?
 
Well, you know who these women are. They're playing a game, unlike anything we've seen before. The athleticism of women's basketball is extraordinary. As we've said, the characters the storylines. When wonderful men, dear friends of mine, who are kind of like I don't know if I like women's basketball -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Right.
 
BRENNAN: -- when they're tweeting about this as the greatest thing they've seen and Caitlin Clark is the best thing they've seen but -- 
 
BOLDUAN: I'm so (INAUDIBLE) to hear that after all -- 
 
BRENNAN: Let's declare -- let's declare victory.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, exactly.
 
BRENNAN: Well, you're -- of course, you're an athlete yourself -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
BRENNAN: -- and you know those days.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
BRENNAN: And where we are now. It is just a tremendous thing. And the country is embraced women's sports in a way I -- well, it reminds me back to 1999 in the Women's World Cup soccer. Brandi Chastain, that moment we are going to -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Oh, yes.
 
BRENNAN: Anyone would have wanted a ticket to that game back on July 10, '99. I think it's the same here. Anyone would have on a ticket to that game (INAUDIBLE).
 
BERMAN: That is such a great way to put it. I mean, that was roadblocked on my TV yesterday afternoon and evening. And I think that, for so many sports fans, they felt the same way. Christine Brennan, we demanded you come here for the launch. Thank you so much for being here.
 
BRENNAN: What an honor. Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: Good to see you.
 
BERMAN: Sara?
 
SIDNER: Thank you. That was great. We're continuing now to monitor Palm Beach County, Florida where any moment now former President Trump is expected to leave Mar-a-Lago and head here to New York for his arraignment.
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
We're following it all live and we'll bring it to you next. You're looking at a live picture of, as you can see, the Trump aircraft there.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:55:06]
 
SIDNER: All right, we are looking at live pictures from West Palm Beach overlooking Mar-a-Lago, the president's home. We are expecting him to leave in the next few minutes to fly from Florida, take that three-hour flight here to New York to face criminal charges, and be arraigned in court tomorrow. We will give you more details as soon as we see some movement there. But you are looking at his aircraft there on the tarmac.
 
Now, to some other top stories. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declined to comment on Sunday's deadly explosion in St. Petersburg, Russia that killed a well-known Russian military blogger and injured dozens of people. Russia has blamed the attack on Ukraine, calling it a terrorist act despite no evidence yet proving that.
 
Plus, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be hosting a bipartisan meeting with the president of Taiwan on Wednesday in California. A move that will heighten tensions likely between the United States and China.
 
And actor Leonardo DiCaprio is expected to testify today in a DC federal court as a witness for the government against Grammy-winning musician Pras Michel. Prosecutors allege that Michelle helped Malaysian billionaire Jho Low gain influence with American celebrities and Washington powerbrokers during both the Obama administration and the Trump administration. Low helped fund DiCaprio's movie, The Wolf of Wall Street. John.
 
BERMAN: So, just moments ago, NASA announced the names of the three Americans and one Canadian set to make a trip to the moon in 2024. I should say around the moon in 2024. CNN's Tom Foreman joins me now. Tom, who are these lucky for who gets to make this journey?
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you picked it right there. They're the lucky four is what they are. First, let me talk about what they're going to do so we understand why this is so important. What Artemis Two will do is echo what Artemis One did last year, spectacular blast off, more than a million-mile flight around the moon to get a sense of what was like all uncrewed.
 
Here's the difference. These folks on the left there, you see Jeremy Hansen from Canada. He was selected for this mission. One of the many people up there. And they will go up and fly around this in a trip that will be 600,000 miles to pave the way there.
 
There's Jeremy Hansen. Right next to him, you'll notice, was Victor Glover. He was the pilot for this. Christina Koch, a mission specialist who holds the current record for the longest time in space by a woman. And Jeremy Hansen from Canada. And Reid Wiseman is the commander of all of this.
 
So, what are they going to do? They're going to orbit the moon. It'll be the first lunar trip in more than 50 years, the last time we had men on the moon was in 1972. It possibly will be the farthest space trip ever because they may loop far enough out that this would be a record flight out there. And then they will come back here in a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Very, very big news on all these folks making this trip, John.
 
BERMAN: And the timeline is next year, 2024.
 
FOREMAN: Right.
 
BERMAN: And again, the goal here is to go you know around the moon. I do think it's very interesting. Their orbit will take them perhaps further than any human has ever been away from Earth. Around the moon with the ultimate goal of landing the year after?
 
FOREMAN: Yes -- well, yes, that's the goal. I don't think they're going to meet that and they've already indicated they may not. This would launch in November of next year, so we're more than a year and a half away from that to turn around and then actually go land on the moon in 2025. It's a reach, it is the goal, most likely it will push down into later years there.
 
So, that's the goal but it's just a goal right now. But boy, do they have the right people for this. These are really unbelievably talented aviators from the military. I mentioned Christina Koch spending so much time, but there, she also spent a year at the South Pole. Jeremy Hansen, the man from the -- from Canada, this is his first flight assignment as an astronaut. So, boy, that's a way to start with the big splash.
 
And interestingly enough, just because you're curious, they're all in their 40s. So, they all have a raw -- really strong resume of experience in flight and in space. And they will know what they're doing for this incredible, incredible mission.
 
And think about it this way. For a brief period of time, they will be the only four people who are that far away from everything that have ever been. That's a remarkable thing to think about. And boy, so exciting.
 
BERMAN: It is very exciting. I will say the fact that they're all in their 40s makes me resent them just a little bit, Tom Foreman, but they are very lucky.
 
FOREMAN: I think -- 
 
BERMAN: And I think -- FOREMAN: I think you're the alternate. You're the oldest.
 
BERMAN: (INAUDIBLE) the 12,000 alternate. Tom Foreman, great to see you. Thank you so much. It is very exciting news.
 
FOREMAN: Good to see you.
 
BERMAN: Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Berman, already looking for another job on their first day of this one. Great. Thank you so much for joining all of us for this inaugural edition of CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We'll be back with you again tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. "INSIDE POLITICS WITH JOHN KING" is next.</pre>
