ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a new warning from the Biden 
 
 administration as it tells Israel, improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, or possibly risk military aid. This as the first components of the 
 
 powerful U.S. anti-missile defense systems arrive in Israel.  
 
Prime Minister Netanyahu has reportedly assured the U.S., Israel will hit Iran's military, not nuclear or oil sites. We have the very latest for you. 
 
 And in the U.S. state of Georgia, early voting has begun and officials say it could be a record breaking turnout. 
 
But first, tonight, as U.N. warns that Gaza is facing the worst restriction on aid since the war began, Israel's biggest backer is now giving a 
 
 deadline for the humanitarian situation to improve. The Biden administration sent a letter to the Israeli government demanding it address 
 
 the Gaza aid crisis within 30 days or risk a halt in U.S. military assistance. That deadline comes just after the U.S. election. But the State 
 
 Department denies the two are linked. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  The bottom line is, we felt it was appropriate if we are making clear to the government of 
 
 Israel that there are these changes that need to be implemented, that we give them an appropriate period of time to implement it, to implement them.   
 
I didn't think it was appropriate to send a letter and just say this has to happen overnight. We give them -- made clear there's a short window in 
 
 which we want to see changes because the humanitarian situation is so dire on the ground, but it is appropriate to give them some time to work through 
 
 the different issues and find ways to get the level of trucks, get the level of food, water, medicine back up to acceptable levels. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  Yet, even with that demand, the U.S. is still providing significant weaponry to Israel including an advanced air defense system. 
 
 The Pentagon says some components arrived in Israel yesterday along with an advanced team of U.S. troops. The U.S. has also been coordinating with 
 
 Israel on a response to Iran's missile attack this month. 
 
And a source tells CNN, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has assured the U.S. that a counter-strike will be limited to military targets, not oil 
 
 or nuclear sites. Let's get more on all those strands, let's -- Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem, Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. 
 
Oren, let me start -- let me start with you and that letter from the Biden administration demanding that Israel improve what it's calling humanitarian 
 
 aid situation in 30 days. Just speak to that, not only to the demands, but also the 30 days. Why 30 days, why not three days? Why not now?  
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Isa, we have seen the frustration and worse from the Biden administration on what they see as 
 
 Israel's failure to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Whether that's food getting in from crossings that are all too often closed, 
 
 whether it's restrictions on the movement of Palestinians from the north to the south of Gaza, or humanitarian zones that need to be safe places. 
 
You have seen the Biden administration point these out very publicly and with increasing frequency in recent months. But this is certainly a step 
 
 beyond that. A letter from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Two senior Israeli officials saying you have 30 days 
 
 to address this humanitarian situation. 
 
And I'll read just parts of the letter here, the letter says "the U.S. wants to see quote, "urgent and sustained actions by your government this 
 
 month to reverse the trajectory." It also points out that since the Spring, humanitarian aid into Gaza has dropped by some 50 percent, and that 
 
 September had quote, "the lowest of any month during this past year in terms of humanitarian aid." 
 
So, there you see the administration putting out right there what is the problem, and giving Israel 30 days to address this, saying, look, this is 
 
 part of the U.S'. requirement by law that it routinely reviews who is receiving foreign military assistance and what they're using that for. 
 
The 30 days is essentially a timeline, a window that Israel has to fix this. We have seen the U.S. pressure Israel, this is certainly more of that 
 
 to get more humanitarian aid. And it is worth noting a couple of things here, 30 days, that deadline is after the election. And if you remember, we 
 
 have seen the U.S. pause at least one shipment of 2,000 pound bombs to Israel. 
 
As of now, that was paused several months ago, it remains paused. The threat here essentially is the U.S. is saying, look, you need to fix the 
 
 humanitarian situation in Gaza and do it fairly quickly here, or there is a risk that it will expand, that the pause will expand beyond those 2,000-
 
 pound bombs. 
 <br>[14:05:00]
 
That's pretty much the implicit threat here on the table or a warning, I should say. 
 
SOARES:  Do we know, Oren, when that letter was handed to the Israeli government and whether they have responded to this?
 
LIEBERMANN:  We haven't seen a response yet. It was essentially delivered over the weekend. I think the date on it was on Sunday, but it is within 
 
 the last few days here, worth noting, it went from the Defense Secretary and the Secretary of State to   Israel's Defense Minister, and not their 
 
 Foreign Minister, but to Ron Dermer, who is one of those who was very closest to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
SOARES:  Stay with us. Let me go to Jeremy, because Jeremy, of course, meantime, Israel, of course, fighting on two fronts. I wonder what it's 
 
 saying at this moment regarding how when and how it may retaliate to Iran, given we're what? Twenty one days or so away from a U.S. election. 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well, over the course of the last week, we have seen a lot of communication between the U.S. and 
 
 Israel over what that response will actually look like, which targets Israel will hit as it has vowed that it will indeed respond militarily to 
 
 that barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles fired by Iran a couple of weeks ago.
 
And those conversations between the U.S. and Israel have been aimed on the U.S. side in terms of reining Israel and to ensure that the response that 
 
 they deliver does not take things to a much higher level of escalation. And that is to say that we heard President Biden making clear that he opposed a 
 
 strike on Israel's -- on Iran's nuclear facilities that he also opposed, a strike on oil facilities inside of Iran. 
 
And so, now, it appears that through those conversations and perhaps also by the U.S. offering Israel a new advanced anti-missile system to be 
 
 deployed to Israel, that is already beginning to be deployed to Israel, that the U.S. has managed to convince Israel to limit its response to 
 
 military targets inside of Iran. 
 
And that's because a person familiar with the matter has told us that Israeli officials, including the Israeli Prime Minister have communicated 
 
 that Israel will not strike those nuclear or oil facilities. That being said, we are not hearing that from the Israeli government publicly for now. 
 
 The Israeli Prime Minister's office saying that they will ultimately make their own final decision about what and when to strike as it relates to 
 
 Iran. 
 
So, clearly, not publicly conveying for now that they have taken those other strike options off the table. We will ultimately only really find out 
 
 once Israel actually carries out this action. We don't know when that will be, but we do know that, that new anti-missile defense system that has been 
 
 provided to Israel, it has already begun to arrive. 
 
Components of it arriving in Israel today alongside some of the 100 U.S. troops who will operate it. The rest of those components and troops set to 
 
 arrive in the coming days. 
 
SOARES:  Yes, important context. Jeremy, appreciate it, Oren, thank you to you both. Well, nearly 100 American medics who volunteered in Gaza 
 
 hospitals have written an open letter to the Biden administration urging it to immediately stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel. And they describe really 
 
 in heartbreaking detail what they witnessed with their own eyes. 
 
And one passage says, "every one of us who worked in an emergency intensive care or surgical setting, treated pre-teen children who were shot in the 
 
 head or chest on a regular or even daily basis. It is impossible that such widespread shooting of young children throughout Gaza sustained over the 
 
 course of an entire year is accidental" -- their words. 
 
We're now joined by one of the doctors who signed that letter, Nabeel Rana is currently at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, he joins us now. Doctor, 
 
 appreciate you being with us. Let me start really where that passage I just read out continues. And it reads, "President Biden and Vice President 
 
 Harris, we wish you could see the nightmares that plague so many of us since we have returned. Dreams of children maimed and mutilated by our 
 
 weapons, and the inconsolable mothers begging us to save them." 
 
Can you just take a moment, doctor, and just share with our listeners, the viewers on what you have been seeing on the ground right now. You're now in 
 
 Gaza, tell us what you're seeing.
 
NABEEL RANA, AMERICAN SURGEON WORKING AT NASSER HOSPITAL IN GAZA:  Well, I returned here about two weeks ago, and I was here also for three weeks in 
 
 the Summer, in June and July, and so, from that time to this time, it's the same atrocities and devastation we're seeing every single day. 
 
But what's even more concerning is as expected, there's just been tremendous worsening of conditions even since the Summer time. We've shared 
 
 stories, pictures, videos, I don't know what else we can share with the rest of the world. 
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
People understand what's happening here, because there's no western -- we're basically the only voice from any outsiders from the entire world 
 
 that are here. I'm not a journalist, I'm not a reporter, I'm just a physician, but this is our obligation to share. And these stories they 
 
 sound inconceivable and unbelievable, but it's literally what's happening. 
 
And everybody is seeing the same thing. Children are being targeted, women and men, innocent men. It's not -- it's not just women and children, 
 
 innocent civilians are constantly being either targeted or just without care, harmed and killed and destroyed without any kind of effort, where 
 
 they talk about very specific targeting of specific areas, but that's just not what we're seeing every single day. 
 
And this isn't a one-time event. It's literally every day, every night that you're here. It's very hard to keep witnessing and trying to convince 
 
 people of what's actually happening here.  
 
SOARES:  Yes, and we are listening to you, and you're not just physicians, you are physicians, you have an important role. You are our eyes and ears 
 
 as, you all know, journalists -- foreign journalists are not able to be on the ground. We get a lot of our reporting from the very brave journalists, 
 
 Palestinian journalists in Gaza. 
 
But you mentioned you were there before in Gaza, I think you were there in June, July. Can you just compare the situation then, doctor, to now?   
 
RANA:  Yes, I mean, at that time it was pure chaos, the attacks. There were no -- you were very limited on how you could even help in these mass 
 
 casualty events that were very regular. People were already displaced and crammed into just very tight, unlivable areas, in tents with no sewage, no 
 
 water, sanitation, no medication. 
 
And so, all of that was being set up for a disaster from infectious disease standpoint and all these other things that we weren't even dealing with at 
 
 that time. But that's why we're focusing on trauma because everything was damage control. And the difference now is the conditions have significantly 
 
 worsened as expected. 
 
And I think it was orchestrated that way. Everyone is in much worse condition in their -- in their tents. Everything is tattered. Their clothes 
 
 are tattered. People don't have shoes anymore. Kids are drinking water out of sewage puddles on the road. When we talk about aid restrictions, that 
 
 has been going on for months now. And so -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
RANA:  To say let's wait another 30 days, I mean, every single day is catastrophic from these conditions. And so, it's inconceivable to me that 
 
 you can even wait one more hour, they don't -- people don't understand that between now and tomorrow, the same time, I can't even calculate the number 
 
 of deaths, injuries, illnesses, you know, devastation that's going to happen just in that short period of time. 
 
Forget 30 days, I mean, 30 days is comparing from a month ago to now, you can't even calculate it. And so, this really is just posturing. It's not 
 
 really a good bill effort to try to improve anything. In Indiana, if you want humanitarian aid, you have to stop dropping bombs on the civilians. 
 
I mean, that's really what it comes down -- all your vaccines, it doesn't matter about sending aid packages -- humanitarians. I mean, you just have 
 
 to solve because that's the bottom line. 
 
SOARES:  And for our viewers, just add context, a 30 days of course, is this letter that has being handed over to Israel, asking them to meet 
 
 certain conditions when it comes to the humanitarian situation on the ground from the Biden administration to Israelis, saying they've got 30 
 
 days.  
 
Can you just tell our viewers, doctor, just give us a sense, what have you seen in 30 days? Just explain. Because they're saying 30 days, why not 
 
 three days, why not right now? Why not a month ago or even much longer, right? Is the point you're making. So, what have you seen in the period, in 
 
 a time-frame of 30 days? 
 
RANA:  Well, I can tell you what I've seen in 48 hours. And in 48 -- 
 
SOARES:  Tell me -- 
 
RANA:  Hours, I've seen children coming in with meningitis, 140 kids in this pediatric unit where there's only 40 beds, they don't have the 
 
 appropriate antibiotics, they don't have the appropriate treatment. These are just medical conditions. I'm not even -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
RANA:  Talking about the trauma. We have patients coming in who have been untreated for diabetes, which is a very easily treatable disease, who 
 
 haven't been treated for an entire year because they haven't had access to medications, to hygiene, to the actual medical care because it's all been 
 
 destroyed. 
 
And in the last 48 hours, I've seen so many patients with wound infections on their feet that have gotten so bad, necrotic, gangrenous that they've 
 
 had to have limb amputations. I've done more leg amputations for diabetes than for trauma in the last 48 hours. 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
And so, all these things are starting to catch up and at just an exponential pace, everything is going downhill. And from a trauma 
 
 standpoint, I mean, last night at this hospital, there were bombs just within blocks of this hospital on safe zone camps, one family, ten members 
 
 were killed immediately in a residential house in a camp of tents where displaced people are in a safe area. 
 
A bomb went off there, and tremendous number of lost lives just last night. And two days ago, a missile was dropped at Al-Aqsa Hospital on the hospital 
 
 campus -- I'm sure everyone's seen the videos of a son and a mother -- and this is just the last two days, I'm not even commenting on north Gaza, 
 
 which is a thousand times even worse than here with what's happening in Jabalya and the daily massacres.   
 
People are trapped there, they can't leave. They're being told to evacuate. When they do evacuate, we're being told from family members are getting 
 
 messages -- they're shot on the streets, and so, everyone is trapped and doesn't even know what to do. But here alone, the medical conditions is 
 
 significantly worse, we're starting to see basically the sequelae of one year of lack of medical care in these camps and tents.
 
And I've said this before, if even a single bomb was never dropped -- set up for -- to spread is enough to walk -- there's no -- crowded into small 
 
 space -- is create meningitis out -- happening.  
 
SOARES:  And doctor -- 
 
RANA:  Yes, on top of dealing -- 
 
SOARES:  Apologies, I thought -- the signal was a bit faulty, so, I thought you had finished your sentence, so, I apology for interrupting, and I'm 
 
 hoping I can have you for this last question because your letter -- I think was signed by 99 signatories in this letter. You spent a combined -- I'm 
 
 just reading here, 254 weeks inside hospitals and clinics. 
 
And in this letter, you all ask President Biden and VP Harris, "please meet with us to discuss what we saw and why we feel American policy in the 
 
 Middle East must change immediately." I suppose my question is, did you get a response? Did they agree to meet?
 
RANA:  Went to the -- there to speak there -- we've -- single thing we can -- inform -- 
 
SOARES:  Unfortunately, we are losing the doctor, unfortunately, the signals you can imagine, Khan Younis is rather choppy. It doesn't seem like 
 
 he got a response, that letter, of course -- Nabeel Rana, a doctor at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, appreciate, of course, and taking the time 
 
 to speak to us, very insightful, given that he's been there on numerous occasions of course, gives you a better sense of what is happening on the 
 
 ground.
 
And still to come on the show tonight, voters are already headed to the polls in the key battleground state, we'll go live to Georgia where early 
 
 voting is underway. Plus, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris blaze the campaign trail and ramp up attacks on each other as the U.S. presidential race 
 
 enters the home stretch, an update from both camps just ahead   
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
SOARES:  Well, there's only three weeks left in U.S. presidential race that's been unlike any other. As the campaigns enter the final sprint to 
 
 election day, early voting is now underway in the key battleground state of Georgia, where Donald Trump is campaigning later today.   
 
First, he'll hold a town-hall event for an all-female audience before hosting a rally in Atlanta. And Trump's behavior at a campaign stop in 
 
 Pennsylvania on Monday sparked some confusion. It was interrupted twice for medical emergencies in the crowd, at which point Trump ended the Q&amp;A 
 
 session, calling instead for some of his favorite songs and then swaying -- as you can see to that playlist on stage for 40 minutes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Let me hear that music, please -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everyone, let's thank President Trump -- 
 
TRUMP:  Let me hear that music, loud! I sure love -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  God bless you!
 
(MUSIC) 
 
TRUMP:  So, play "Y.M.C.A", go ahead, let's go, nice and loud!
 
(MUSIC) 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  The greatest hits -- well, Kamala Harris is in Michigan today reaching out to black voters. She'll sit down for an interview with popular 
 
 radio host Charlamagne God, then meet with a group of black entrepreneurs in Detroit. Running mate Tim Walz is campaigning in battleground 
 
 Pennsylvania. 
 
And 16 electoral votes are up for grabs in Georgia, I want to bring in our Nick Valencia, who's at early polling station in Atlanta. And it looks 
 
 pretty busy behind you already, Nick, good to see you. But first, talk us through -- before we talk about the voting, talk us through this major 
 
 ruling and what this means come election day.
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Isa, the bottom line here is that we're still getting court rulings even though early voting is well underway here. 
 
 We have been anticipating two court rulings related to certification, and we got one of them earlier today from Fulton County superior court Judge 
 
 Robert McBurney, who ruled on a lawsuit that stem from a Republican board of elections worker in the Democratic stronghold of Fulton County.   
 
Her name is Julie Adams, and she made news earlier this Spring when she refused to certify the results of the presidential primary. But in his 
 
 ruling, Judge McBurney being very clear, highlighting existing Georgia law, that certification is mandatory. Now, early voting has been massive, 
 
 there's been record turnout already, we have five hours left to go and we're 20,000 more voters checking in than all of 2020 on the first day of 
 
 early voting. 
 
So, about 154,000 people as of 1:00 p.m. And they're showing up to something that looks a little different than it did in 2020. For starters, 
 
 there's going to be fewer absentee ballot drop boxes, those were a point of contention, if you remember, they were available 24/7. This time around 
 
 though, they're only going to be available during normal business hours and they will be located inside elections offices or places for early voting. 
 
Also in 2021, a law that some here called pretty silly, you can't pass out food or water within 150 feet of where a ballot is being cast, that has 
 
 gone into effect. But finally, they're expanding early voting, adding two Saturdays and potentially two Sundays as counties see fit. And you can 
 
 already see the enthusiasm from those Georgia voters. 
 
I talked about those numbers, I talked to a voter earlier today, and I asked her what brought her out to early vote?  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SILVIA ROLDAN, FULTON COUNTY VOTER:  Because I want my voice to be heard. I want us to be united, not divided. There's too much division going on 
 
 especially this time. I want us to be united. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VALENCIA:  Fulton County was consequential in 2020, we'll see if it has a similar fate in 2024, and just very quickly here, there was a lot of 
 
 concern, especially among Georgia Democrats, Trump operatives were doing something that we saw evidence presented by Jack Smith; the special 
 
 counsel, creating chaos around the election as we saw happen in 2020, questioning the results of the -- of the votes.   
 
This time around though, we are hearing that voters are aware of that rhetoric, but it's clearly not stopping them from turning out here on day 
 
 one of early voting. Isa? 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
SOARES:  Nick, good to see you, thanks very much my friend, Nick Valencia there for us in Atlanta. Well, we are covering both presidential campaigns. 
 
 CNN's Eva McKend is in Detroit following Vice President, while our Kristen Holmes is in Atlanta where Donald Trump will be later today. Eva, let me go 
 
 to you, what are we likely to see and hear from VP Harris today as she appears at a town-hall with a radio host, I believe. Who is the target 
 
 audience, I should say, and what will be the message? 
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, her pitch really is grounded in her support for entrepreneurs. She thinks that, that 
 
 message is particularly resonant with black men. So 1 million loans, up to $20,000. She's going to talk about that as part of a future Harris 
 
 administration as well as legalizing marijuana and ensuring that black men actually have access to the industry and protecting cryptocurrency assets 
 
 as well.  
 
And really what we're seeing from the Vice President and by extension, Democratic surrogates is that they are arguing -- listen, you know, some of 
 
 these men may feel a kinship with the former President, may be connecting with him largely based on machismo, but it is ultimately her that will 
 
 speak to the policies that will actually enrich their lives. 
 
So, that is why she is here in Detroit with that message for black men and why she is sitting down with popular radio host Charlamagne tha God. 
 
SOARES:  And Kristen, let me go to you -- I believe Trump just wrapped up an interview with "Bloomberg News" in Chicago, would you give us a sense of 
 
 what he said and whether -- I'm keen to know whether anyone kind of asked him about, you know, what we just played there, that kind of impromptu and 
 
 awkward dance party at the Trump rally yesterday. 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  No one asked about that, but he did answer some significant questions. He was actually sitting down for this 
 
 interview and was posed questions that we have been wanting to ask him, that a number of interviewers have been wanting to ask him, but he just 
 
 hasn't answered yet.
 
He hasn't obviously sat down with many in the mainstream media, but on top of that, he usually -- when we shout for the same questions about tariffs 
 
 does not answer them. Specifically, he talked about his economic policy and those tariffs because of the fact that economists across the board have 
 
 said that this would actually add to inflation.
 
So, for the first time he had to push back on that and explain some of these economic policies, now Donald Trump did what Donald Trump does, which 
 
 was, weave in and out of topics, talk about other conversations he's had with foreign leaders or business leaders, not directly answer quite a few 
 
 questions, but he was put on the spot and did answer a few questions when it came to tariffs about how he thought that, that would be implemented. 
 
The other things that he was asked about was whether or not he had spoken to Vladimir Putin since leaving office, he refused to answer that question, 
 
 at one point, saying he wouldn't talk about something like that, but if he did, if he did talk with Vladimir Putin, it would be the smart thing to do. 
 
 So, you can take away what you want from that. 
 
The other thing is, he was asked about January 6th when he essentially said that, that day was about love and peace. Obviously, we know the day was not 
 
 about love and peace. Then he also said there's a peaceful transition of power, something that did not happen when he left office.  
 
So, back-and-forth there, but I do -- I do want to quickly talk about campaigning because we are in the state of Georgia, obviously critical 
 
 swing state, one of the things he is doing -- why you have Kamala Harris trying to reach out to men is, he today is trying to reach out to women. He 
 
 is sitting down with "Fox" for an all women town-hall about women's issues. This is a group, a demographic that is completely plagued him.   
 
They have moved away from him since 2016, and he would like to secure as many female voters as he can. He even publicly has indicated that he feels 
 
 confused as to why women wouldn't want to vote for him, saying, I would be your protector. I would take care of you. Many women don't feel comfortable 
 
 with that language, but he continues to say it.
 
And those who support him find that fine. But this is something that he has really tried to work towards. It seems unclear whether or not they'll 
 
 ultimately move back towards Donald Trump, but clearly, sitting down for an all-woman town-hall, questions on women's issues is something that they 
 
 plan to do, which clearly shows you where they're focused in this final critical stretch. 
 
SOARES:  Indeed, Kris, thank you very much, and Eva, thank you to you both ladies, appreciate it. And still to come tonight, as Kamala Harris and 
 
 Donald Trump fight for swing-state votes, we'll find out what issues are getting Michigan voters to the ballot box. Plus, a stern warning from the 
 
 Biden administration to Israel, what impact will it have though? We'll have more coverage from Middle East just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  Returning now to the Middle East. The Biden administration is demanding Israel improves the humanitarian 
 
 situation in Gaza within the next three days, or it could risk violating U.S. laws governing foreign military aid, suggesting if Israel does not 
 
 comply, it could jeopardize U.S. military funding.
 
Despite the stern warning, one of the U.S.'s most powerful anti-missile systems, the THAAD, is beginning to arrive as we heard from our Jeremy at 
 
 the top of the hour in Israel. A source familiar with the discussion says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has assured the U.S. that any 
 
 counterstrike with on Iran will be limited to military targets rather than Iran's oil or nuclear sites. In response to that report, Mr. Netanyahu's 
 
 office says Israel will consider U.S. opinions, but ultimately, decide its own response.
 
Meantime, inside Iran, mourners gathered for the funeral of a top military figure in the IRGC, Abbas Nilforoushan. He was killed alongside Hezbollah 
 
 leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli attack on Beirut last month.
 
Now, Fred Pleitgen joins me now from Tehran. And, Fred, let me start first with you giving us a sense of what the reaction has been to those 
 
 assurances by Israel in conversation with the United States that will not target Iran's oil or nuclear sites, but military. How is Iran -- What are 
 
 you hearing in terms of how Iran is preparing for what may come?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first of all, I think that the Iranians have become a lot more hard line on all 
 
 this, especially during the course of the last week and in the past couple of days, Isa.
 
On the one hand, they have been obviously on a big diplomatic push here in the entire region, trying to get some of the countries of the region on 
 
 side. At the same time, the message is really crystallized on the part of the Iranians that no matter how the Israelis strike Iranian territory, if 
 
 they hit Iranian territory, there is going to be a reaction and there is going to be a strike coming from the Iranians. So, that's something that 
 
 they say they want to make absolutely clear, whether or not the Israelis target that energy infrastructure or possibly something else, the Iranians 
 
 say they are going to strike back.
 
And you can feel some of that anger on the streets here. You were just mentioning that we were at that funeral procession today for Abbas 
 
 Nilforoushan. And of course, the killing of Abbas Nilforoushan along with Hassan Nasrallah was one of the main reasons why the Iranians struck Israel 
 
 in the first place. They said, leading to this massive tension now in the Middle East. You could feel that on the ground as mourners gathered with 
 
 some pretty choice words for the U.S. and Israel. Here's what we saw.
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PLEITGEN:  The crowds here chanting down with Israel, death to Israel, as tens of thousands of people have come out to pay their final respects to 
 
 Abbas Nilforoushan, who was a Revolutionary Guard commander who was killed in the same airstrike that also killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  As Abbas Nilforoushan coffin made its way through Central Tehran, many handed items to the poll bearers to be rubbed on the 
 
 casket.
 
Along with the mourning, anger at the United States and Israel and vows for continued support of Hezbollah. Fatimeh Karach (ph) joining in the chants.
 
We are one, she says. These geographical distances do not mean that we are separated from Hezbollah, from Lebanon. We are all one and we are all 
 
 enemies of Israel.
 
Abbas Nilforoushan was a career soldier. Among those paying their respects, much of Iran's political and military leadership, including Esmail Qaani, 
 
 the head of the Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, who had been out of public sight since the Nasrallah assassination.
 
Bashir Roshani (ph) served under Abbas Nilforoushan in the Iran-Iraq war.
 
We see it as our legal and religious duty to continue the path of the dear martyrs, he said. The criminal Israelis are killing oppressed children.
 
And then, the deaths to Israel chants begin again.
 
Israel targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah with a massive airstrike in Beirut on September 27th. Abbas Nilforoushan was at the scene as well 
 
 and also killed. Iran hit back several days later, firing almost 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The Iranians now warning that if Israel 
 
 strikes back at Iran, Tehran will retaliate, not ruling out further escalation. Music to the ears of many of the hardliners here.
 
Definitely, we can destroy Israel, she says. Iran is stronger, stronger than Israel can even imagine.
 
Tough words as another senior figure is brought to his final resting place.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
PLEITGEN (on camera):  So, as you can see, they're pretty charged up atmosphere there on the ground in Tehran today. I have to say, as we were 
 
 walking along with that funeral procession that was going on, at the same time, the Iranians have now said that for them, there are no red lines as 
 
 they put it in the defense of the Iranian population, but also their interests they say here in the Middle East.
 
The Iranians, of course, also now warning countries of this region, Isa, not to allow Israel to use their airspace to attack Iran or for attacks on 
 
 Iran, saying that could have detrimental effects for those countries. So, as you can see, the atmosphere here in the Middle East still extremely 
 
 charged up. Isa.
 
SOARES:  Extremely charged. And I wonder outside of this funeral procession, Fred, in terms of what the country is, the mood is in the 
 
 country and what relates not only to this possible retaliation by Israel, but also the war in Gaza, over a year now, and now Lebanon. What are you 
 
 hearing from people in the streets?
 
PLEITGEN:  Yes. Well, I think that people are extremely concerned. I mean, on the one hand, of course, especially the war in Gaza, is definitely 
 
 something that drives a lot of people here in this country as well. They obviously follow that all that very closely.
 
But when we speak to people here in Tehran, of course, in other places also, they are quite concerned, not necessarily about these possible 
 
 Israeli strikes that could happen in the not-too-distant future, but really much more about a possible larger escalation in the greater Middle East and 
 
 at some point that pitting Iran and the United States directly against one another.
 
I think the fear of larger instability here in the greater Middle East is certainly something that drives a lot of people. Worries a lot of people. 
 
 They are quite concerned. At the same time, there is a lot of anger towards the U.S. and Israel, especially as far as that strike is concerned against 
 
 Hassan Nasrallah, but certainly, also against that IRGC general as well. Isa.
 
SOARES:  Fred Pleitgen for us this hour in Tehran in Iran. Thanks very much, Fred. Appreciate it.
 
And still to come tonight, Kamala Harris heads to Michigan as she and Donald Trump fight for swing state votes. We'll have the very latest next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
SOARES:  Well, Kamala Harris, as we told you, is in Michigan today as the presidential candidates dizzying tour of swing states continue. Both Harris 
 
 and Donald Trump, along with their running mates, have visited the state multiple times this campaign cycle, vying for Michigan's all important, of 
 
 course, 15 Electoral College votes.
 
Joe Biden narrowly won Michigan back in 2020, beating Trump with just 3 percent of the vote. The margins even tighter if we go back to 2016, when 
 
 Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just 10,000 votes. And the latest polling shows the state is still, as you can see there, pretty tossed up. The 
 
 Critic Poll showed a Trump lead within, though, the margin of error.
 
Joining us now with her on the ground perspective is Zoe Clark, Michigan, Radio Political Director. Zoe, really appreciate you being with us, trying 
 
 to make sense of these crucial last few weeks. 21 days to go. Just give us a sense of what we can expect here, because we know it's a tight race, but 
 
 what are you hearing from your listeners as to which way the state may go here?
 
ZOE CLARK, MICHIGAN RADIO POLITICAL DIRECTOR:  It is super tight. And what we're really noticing is over the past few weeks, the candidates have been 
 
 here or trying to sort of tell their message, tell their story about why they are looking for maybe undecideds, for swing voters, independent 
 
 voters.
 
But here's the thing, absentee ballots have already started to go out in Michigan and in the City of Detroit. Michigan's largest city early, in-
 
 person voting begins Saturday. So, what we're really seeing is now a shift on the ground from sort of telling the story and the message to it is boots 
 
 on the ground, trying to build up enthusiasm. And what we like to say is GOTV, get out the vote.
 
SOARES:  And do we have a sense on the undecided voters, how many we're talking about here? Do we have a sense of the numbers?
 
CLARK:  We do. It's getting smaller and smaller by the day, which makes sense, right? Michigan, we know, about one in five, some 20 percent of 
 
 voters call themselves independent voters, right? That's different than undecided, but independent voters, but they tend to come home in the end, 
 
 right? They tend to say, well, I don't know, but then they vote Democrat, or I don't know, and then they vote Republican.
 
So, what we're watching right now is very interesting. The latest polling getting very small when it comes to the undecided, some possibly 1 percent 
 
 in one poll that just came out this week. And as the political editor at that paper who sponsored the poll said, at that point, if you're still 
 
 undecided, it's questionable whether you're even going to turn out and vote at this point.
 
SOARES:  Yes, exactly. I mean, it's incredibly narrow, as we just mentioned. And we -- what we have heard, for several months now is that, 
 
 you know, the economy, Zoe, is kind of the one, the biggest concerns for voters. Does that match with what you're hearing? And on that, do we have a 
 
 sense of which way voters may go? Because as we have been hearing for months now, Trump has consistently fared better on the economy, although 
 
 the economy is faring pretty well under the Democrats, but people are not feeling it.
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
CLARK:  Right. It's this fascinating dichotomy where you actually ask voters, right, like, how do you feel about the economy? And this goes back 
 
 to what we're saying in the states, this so-called sort of vibe election, right? The data may show one thing, but how folks are actually feeling when 
 
 it comes to pocketbook issues, feeling when they're paying bills, when they're paying for daycare, looking for affordable housing or trying to buy 
 
 gas.
 
And what we know, as you asked, what we're hearing on the ground is indeed folks are saying the economy, the price of things, inflation, but there's 
 
 this added nuance that I'm really hearing too. And I think this is for voters who maybe are or earlier stages in their life. So, I'm talking 20s, 
 
 30s, 40s, and it's not just the economy of right now in this moment, but it's forward-looking, right, this idea of wanting to build a better middle-
 
 class life for either them or for their current family or a perspective family.
 
And so, when you dig into that question, there's also some voters who say, you know, when we're looking towards the future, that's really what Kamala 
 
 Harris is talking about, that we're not going back, right. But whether or not she can deliver that, we're not going back, and here's what my future 
 
 plans are, that's where I think there are some voters who are still really trying to understand what will her policies versus Trump policies mean for 
 
 me and my family.
 
SOARES:  Yes. And Michigan, of course, just for our viewers just around the world, Zoe, is home to a large population of Arab Americans, as the war in 
 
 Gaza escalates and worsens, you know, for a year now. We spoke to one Michigan voter. I want to play this and we can talk after that. Have a 
 
 listen to this, Zoe.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAMRA'A LUQMAN, COMMUNITY ORGANIZER:  I made the political calculation that I need to vote for Trump, whether I like it or not, in order to effectuate 
 
 accountability for the genocide. With genocide, I think that even if you were to weigh all the domestic policies, the value of human life to me is -
 
 - it outweighs everything. It outweighs women's rights, student debt elimination, economy, health care, everything that I love and espouse and 
 
 have fought for all my life, when I put that against human life, I -- it's nothing. It outweighs everything.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES:  So, is this -- I mean, is this a sentiment? Have you heard similar sentence that you've been hearing from Arab American? Just give us some 
 
 color here.
 
CLARK:  Yes, absolutely. I mean, we've been seeing this since February, the so-called uncommitted movement, right? This was with our presidential 
 
 primary, whether there was a vote between Joe Biden or literally, you could vote, check a box for uncommitted. 100,000 Michigan voters checked 
 
 uncommitted and they were really hoping to show a sign, right? Just make a statement to the Democratic Party of how they were feeling. The fact is 
 
 though, uncommitted is not on the ballot on November 5th. Uncommitted is really not a choice at this point.
 
And so, what you're hearing from some voters is, well, we're going to vote for Harris because we think in terms of what's happening in Israel. And 
 
 again, this is some voters that it's the least worst option. There's others who are saying, like the uncommitted movement, were neither endorsing 
 
 Harris or Trump, but we're fervently anti-Trump there we'll say. Or there's others, like the voter that you spoke with, who is saying, look, we're 
 
 going to take a stand and vote for Donald Trump.
 
And so, this is what the campaigns are really trying to figure out, particularly in the Democratic Party, which is such a coalition government.
 
SOARES:  And very briefly, in one word, I know you said it was a vibe election, who's going to win Michigan?
 
CLARK:  Oh, I have stopped making predictions ever since 2016 in Michigan.
 
SOARES:  Quite rightly so. As we just pointed out, it's way too tight. Thanks very much, Zoe. Appreciate it.
 
And still to come tonight, Sean Diddy Combs faces an array of new allegations. Six new accusers claim they were assaulted by the rapper and 
 
 producer. We have all the details for you after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
SOARES:  Well, North Korea is taking explosive steps to completely cut off its territory from South Korea. On Tuesday, Pyongyang blew up two major 
 
 road and railway links that once connected the two countries. This was mainly a symbolic gesture since the roads had not been used for years. Last 
 
 week, North Korea threatened retaliation over propaganda filled drones. It says the South flew over Pyongyang.
 
Well, music mogul Sean Diddy Combs is facing a raft of fresh sexual assault allegations. At least six new claims have been filed against the musician 
 
 and producer in New York, and they include accusations made by a boy who was just 16 at the time of the alleged offence. Combs' attorney denies 
 
 allegations, telling CNN, quote, "Mr. Combs had never sexually assaulted anyone." Combs remains in federal custody awaiting trial on charges of 
 
 racketeering, as well as sex trafficking.
 
Let's get more on this. I'm joined by CNN Entertainment Correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister. So, Elizabeth, just talk us through these lawsuits, 
 
 and the timing of these, and these alleged assaults.
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. So, you may remember that earlier this month, an attorney named Tony Buzbee came 
 
 forward in a public press conference, and he said that he was representing 120 new accusers that all plan to file lawsuits against Sean Combs. Well, 
 
 these six accusers are all represented by that attorney. So, these are the first six lawsuits to come after that press conference.
 
Now, these are six separate accusers, six separate incidents. These alleged incidents occurred from 1995 to 2021. And these are all anonymous accusers. 
 
 There are four men who filed as John Does, and there are two women who filed as Jane Does.
 
Now, the details are very graphic and very disturbing in all of these cases. case of these complaints. The two women alleged that they were both 
 
 raped by Combs. One of the women says that she was a 19-year-old college student when she met Combs at a party in 2004 when she says that he 
 
 allegedly raped her.
 
And you mentioned that one of these accusers alleges that he was a 16-year- old teenage boy at the time. That accuser, that John Doe says that he had met Diddy at one of his infamous white parties in 1998, and he was excited 
 
 to meet him. He told him that he wanted to enter showbiz, and he alleges in his complaint that Combs said, it is a rite of passage if he drops his 
 
 pants. And that is when he alleges that he was sexually assaulted.
 
Now, I do want to note that Diddy is denying all of these allegations. I obtained a statement from his attorneys, and while they do not I want to 
 
 read you part of their statement. They say, quote, "Mr. Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the 
 
 integrity of the judicial process. In court, the truth will prevail that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone, adult or minor, man or 
 
 woman."
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
So, in that statement, you see they are going beyond the six lawsuits and they are saying he has never in his life sexually assaulted anyone.
 
SOARES:  Elizabeth Wagmeister, I know you'll stay across this. Thanks very much, Elizabeth. Appreciate it.
 
On an exciting development for animal enthusiasts, scientists have uncovered a host of creatures thriving beneath the sea floor. Researchers 
 
 found giant tube worms and snails in hydrothermal vents in the East Pacific Rise.
 
Investigators used remotely controlled vehicles to explore those cavities, which are a mile and a half below the ocean surface. That's about 2.5 
 
 kilometers. Just fantastic what we are discovering.
 
And that does it for us for tonight. Thanks very much for your company. Do stay right here. Newsroom with Jim Sciutto is up next. I will see you 
 
 tomorrow. Have a wonderful evening. Bye-bye.
