ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: At last, the U.S. Senate has overcome one major hurdle to send aid to Ukraine. 
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: "One World" starts right now. An aid package has cleared the Senate, but what happens next could throw a 
 
 wrench into the whole thing. 
 
ASHER: Also ahead, officials tell "The Washington Post" that new COVID guidelines are on the way. We'll explain what they are. 
 
GOLODRYGA: And later, it hasn't happened since the moon landing. How Super Bowl 58 made television history. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm 
 
 Bianna Golodryga. 
 
ASHER: And I'm Zain Asher. So good to be with you. After months of really difficult negotiations, deepening rifts within the Republican Party and a 
 
 rare overnight session that included marathon floor speeches --
 
GOLODRYGA: -- the U.S. Senate has finally passed a long-awaited foreign aid bill, setting up a high-stakes showdown with the House. The $95 billion 
 
 package includes funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. And it passed with 22 Republicans voting in favor, despite criticism from Donald Trump. 
 
 Earlier, the Senate's top Democrat took time to praise the bipartisan process. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHUCK SCHUMER, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER: It's been a long night, a long weekend, and a long few months. But a new day is here, and our efforts 
 
 have been more than worth it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: But, and there is a major but -- the measure faces an uncertain future in the House, where the Speaker is threatening to ignore it. CNN's 
 
 Melanie Zanona joins us now live on Capitol Hill. 
 
So, an overnight session in the Senate. Melanie, some support there given that this was passed and a bipartisan nature, yet you have a speaker who 
 
 has threatened not to bring this up even for a vote. What can we expect to see next? 
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Yeah, well there are some serious questions in the Capitol right now about if and how this foreign 
 
 aid package is going to pass through the House. 
 
As you mentioned, Speaker Mike Johnson put out a statement last night essentially rejecting this foreign aid package because it does not contain 
 
 border security provisions, even though it was Johnson and his House Republican conference themselves who helped kill that Senate bipartisan 
 
 border deal that was put together just a few weeks ago. 
 
Now, Donald Trump has had a huge impact on the politics here. He had encouraged Republicans to reject the Senate border deal, and just over the 
 
 weekend, he put out a statement encouraging Republicans to reject the Senate aid package as well, saying all foreign aid from here on out should 
 
 be provided as a loan. 
 
And even Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator who has long been a staunch supporter of Ukraine aid, is now echoing those comments from Trump. So, 
 
 just a remarkable shift in the politics here in the GOP over the last few years. 
 
Now, Democrats in the House could try to use a discharge petition. That is a tool that would essentially force the aid package to the floor and go 
 
 around Johnson's head. But that would require some buy-in from Republicans. And it is a tricky, time-consuming process. And it's unclear how exactly 
 
 that would play out. 
 
Another option here is for Johnson to put the package on the floor, but to allow an amendment process. But that could also risk some blowback from 
 
 Johnson's right flank, since they don't want to see any Ukraine aid on the floor. So, just a huge bitter divide in the GOP right now over this issue, 
 
 and it's shaping up to be a real showdown between the House and Senate. Bianna. 
 
GOLODRYGA: So, Melanie, we know the challenges that Johnson is facing now. I guess this leads to the question of what, if anything, is his plan? 
 
ZANONA: As of right now, he has not revealed, either publicly or to his own members, what his plan is. If he just ignores this deal altogether, there 
 
 is a risk that some of his own members would team up with Democrats to try to use that tool, the discharge petition that I was talking about. But he, 
 
 right now, really needs to talk to his conference and try to see what the will of the House Republican majority is. 
 
He's very wary of making any moves that are going to put him in the cross here, particularly with his right flank. So, that is going to be a topic of 
 
 conversation in the coming days, but certainly very large questions, as I said, about just the uncertain path here in the House. 
 
GOLODRYGA: All right, Melanie Zanona, thank you. 
 
ASHER: All right, let's talk more about this. Joining us live now is Lulu Garcia-Navarro, journalist at "The New York Times" and a podcast host as 
 
 well. Lulu, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
So, when you think about it more broadly, Republicans here are upset that this bill doesn't include aid or funding for the southern border, but an 
 
 attempt to pair the two things together collapsed last week. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
So what exactly do the Republicans want here? 
 
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I mean, this is a House divided, literally. What we're seeing play out here is that the Republican caucus 
 
 really has two different wings to it when it comes to international aid and they're not speaking with one voice. 
 
And we saw what happened in the Senate where you had these right wing senators led by people like Ron Paul, for example, and others basically say 
 
 that they did not want to spend quote, unquote America's money in these kinds of foreign adventures. 
 
They feel like Ukraine aid is sending good money after bad and they feel like Russia, as one of the senators said, is very powerful. This is their 
 
 neck of the woods and that America should seek to broker a peace as opposed to sending more money to support one side, which is Ukraine. 
 
On the other side of this, you still have in the Republican Party, specifically in the Senate, people who believe that indeed it is part of 
 
 the U.S. national interest to support Ukraine in this and that Russia is not a strategic ally. And so, that anything supporting Ukraine and of 
 
 course our allies in Europe would be beneficial to America. And so, they're not speaking with one voice. 
 
GOLODRYGA: So Lulu, there does appear to be enough votes in the House, even from Republicans, to have this pass if it is brought up for a vote, but 
 
 obviously the Speaker is threatening that will not happen. How likely do you think this maneuver that we heard from Melanie described as the 
 
 discharge petition, how likely do you think we could see that actually unfold? 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, it really is quite remarkable that this is where things are at. Ultimately, because you have Mr. Johnson as the Speaker of 
 
 the House. He has the power to decide what gets put on the floor. And then this would be a kind of end run around that particular power. 
 
I mean, again, the problem here is that you have Donald Trump, who is the likely nominee for the Republican side for the presidency, saying that he 
 
 is against this and all of his allies in the House, including Speaker Johnson, are trying to sort of speak to his will. And so it's unclear at 
 
 this moment really what is going to happen. 
 
This is very high stakes. This is past the Senate, which is a huge hurdle. And it really remains to be seen what will happen in the House. Let's not 
 
 forget, this isn't only about Ukraine aid, though. This is about aid to Israel. Israel is a very popular issue on both sides of the aisle. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, and I'm glad you brought up Israel as well, because it isn't just about aid to Ukraine, it is also about Israel. But you touched on 
 
 Donald Trump there. I just want to get your take, Lulu, on what this really says about his hold over the Republican Party. I mean, you have people like 
 
 Senator Lindsey Graham, for example, who have traditionally always been a hawk. 
 
And now he's done this dramatic about-face, as Donald Trump talks about, you know, sort of packaging these aid plans as loans to allies rather than 
 
 as sort of aid. Just give us your take on that, just seeing people like Lindsey Graham do a dramatic about-face in that way. 
 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: It's not just Lindsey Graham. I mean, it's extraordinary that we've seen the Republican Party almost writ large take a completely 
 
 different tact on Russia, on its geopolitical importance to the United States, and on President Putin himself. And, you know, and excoriating who 
 
 were our allies, you know, in Europe. 
 
So, I think people are now used to it. They do know that Donald Trump has the Republican Party in its grip. Not fully though, and that's why we saw 
 
 what happened in the Senate, and that's why that is quite important. But the House is a different question. And ultimately there are two sides to 
 
 the American system of governance in Congress, and it remains to be seen what happens in the House. 
 
But I think it really does speak to this fact that it is not clear at this moment what the Republican Party actually wants. We've seen this back and 
 
 forth that they wanted aid to the southern border. They couldn't get that through. 
 
They want aid to Israel as a stand-alone. They couldn't get that through. And at some point they are going to have to compromise if they actually 
 
 want to get something done. 
 
ASHER: All right. Lulu, Garcia, Navarro, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it. 
 
All right, South Africa is calling on the International Court of Justice to weigh in on any potential Israeli ground offensive in Gaza's southern city 
 
 of Rafah as top U.S. Qatari and Israeli officials meet in Cairo to discuss the possible truce and the release of hostages who are still being held in 
 
 Gaza. And Israeli military has yet to present a plan for the evacuation of civilians in Rafah if it does ultimately decide on an incursion. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
Some of the more than one million Palestinians living there in desperate conditions are choosing to flee once again rather than live in fear of an 
 
 impending assault. Aid groups and the international community have been sounding the alarm for some time about this possibility. 
 
ASHER: And U.S. President Joe Biden says that he discussed a potential hostage deal between Israel and Hamas with Jordan's King Abdullah at the 
 
 White House on Monday. He's also expressing a lot of concern about the civilians who have been trapped in Rafah. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S PRESIDENT: The major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan, a credible plan for ensuring the safety 
 
 and support of more than one million people sheltered in there. Exposed and vulnerable. They need to be protected. 
 
ASHER: CNN's Nic Robertson is following the developments. He joins us live now from Tel Aviv in Israel. So Nic, the hostage talks, potential 
 
 negotiations happening right now in Cairo, how do those talks complicate Israel's plans to at some point possibly move into Rafah? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, if the hostage talks were successful, as we understand them at the moment, the way it's 
 
 structured is around three phases. 
 
The first phase, which seems to have a broad sense of agreement, not obviously enough to actually push it over the finish line. And the key 
 
 thing is about is it a temporary pause of six weeks or is it something that can substantially get to a permanent ceasefire? 
 
But even a pause of six weeks could make it difficult, you know, for the IDF to be able to pick up again, get the initiative going again, and go 
 
 into Rafah and chase down Hamas. And obviously for Hamas, it would give them an opportunity to move around. 
 
The IDF has been very methodical about what it's doing, moving from the north of the Gaza Strip to the south through the center and Khan Younis 
 
 where it's been basically bogged down going through Hamas tunnels, trying to, you know, route them from there over a period of more than two months 
 
 now, which indicates the difficulty they would face in Rafah. 
 
But that difficulty would be multiplied if there were a pause because it would give Hamas a chance to scatter out of Rafah because the things that 
 
 they're demanding are a pullback of IDF forces for the IDF not to be allowed to use drones, which would give them on the ground an advantage. 
 
And so, even if the IDF, after six weeks, picked up and restarted its military operations in Rafah, and even if the civilian population have been 
 
 able to move from Rafah to other areas to be out of the way of the danger, the chances are Hamas would likely have relocated themselves. 
 
Now, what the IDF is doing, obviously, is blowing up all their tunnels so that Hamas can't go back to those tunnels. But there are other ways and 
 
 places, of course, to hide. Now, I talked with the IDF spokesman just yesterday after that hostage rescue operation to try to figure out if the 
 
 military has a plan to keep civilians safe.
 
Because I think the instructive thing about that hostage rescue yesterday again reaffirmed the widely held understanding that you can't put IDF 
 
 troops on the ground in an -- in a heavily -- in an environment where there are so many people living so close together without getting a huge number 
 
 of civilian casualties close to a hundred people killed yesterday in that operation and many of them were women and children. So, I asked them about 
 
 those plans. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON: We are now in advanced planning about our operation in Rafah. But this is an advanced planning. It will be authorized 
 
 by the cabinet. There are conditions that need to be set in order to do that. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROBERTSON: So, he did not say a lot and give a lot of detail and we talked around this issue and whatever the IDF is considering in detail, they're 
 
 not making it public. They have an instruction to tell the government and they have to wait for the government to give them an order to go into 
 
 Rafah. 
 
But I did put it to him that the methodology that they're using so far isn't keeping civilians safe and he didn't indicate to me a plan that was 
 
 going to be substantially different to what they have already, which is instructions for the civilians to move to safe areas, down safe roads 
 
 which, at times, turn out not to be that safe. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, and Rafah certainly being a key issue that has somewhat in certain regards become a wedge between the U.S. and Israel given President 
 
 Biden's comments. Nic Robertson, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: And coming up for us, COVID is still with us, sadly, but the U.S. may soon be updating how long people who catch it will have to 
 
 isolate. We'll have a live report after this break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:17:35]
 
ASHER: All right, the U.S. is expected to issue new COVID-19 guidelines this spring. "The Washington Post" says the Centers for Disease Control and 
 
 Prevention plans to relax the self-isolation time for people testing positive. 
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN's Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard joins us now from Atlanta. So Jacqueline, Zain and I were just talking. Most Americans appear 
 
 to have either been exposed to COVID, have had it a few times. 
 
ASHER: I have. 
 
GOLODRYGA: I've had it twice.
 
ASHER: Twice, me too, actually. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Or have been boosted. So what is bringing about the possibility of new guidelines at this point? 
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: I think it's that reason right there. We're now at a time where many people have either had COVID-19 or 
 
 they've been vaccinated. So, there is some community immunity. 
 
And these isolation guidelines have not been updated since 2021. So, discussions of these possibly updating this spring means they might be 
 
 updated to reflect where we are today as a society living with this virus. 
 
So, the current guidelines are that if you test positive for COVID-19, you should isolate for at least five days and continue to isolate if you have 
 
 symptoms. What the update might be this spring is that you no longer have that blanket period of isolation.
 
It's more so based on symptoms. If you do not have a fever for at least 24 hours without medication, and your symptoms are generally mild or they're 
 
 improving, then you no longer have to isolate. That's what discussions have been. 
 
Now, like I said, these are not guidelines right now. This could be an update in the spring. The head of the CDC did say in a statement, quote, 
 
 "There are no updates to COVID guidelines to announce at this time. 
 
We will continue to make decisions based on the best evidence and science to keep communities healthy and safe. "But Bianna and Zain, it is 
 
 interesting that these discussions are happening right now. 
 
ASHER: So, the discussions are happening right now. So, this idea of going from potentially, you know, five days in isolation to, you know, 24 hours 
 
 fever free, I mean, that is a significant drop in terms of the number of days you have to be isolated. How does that affect community transmission, 
 
 how people spread the illness, and also just the severity of outcomes, as well? 
 
HOWARD: Right. And there are many health officials and experts who will always have that concern about the risk of community spread. 
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
But the argument that we are hearing from some experts is that right now, there is a lot of community immunity, and that should lower that risk of 
 
 additional transmission. Now, here in the United States, there are some states at a local level that have relaxed their isolation guidelines, the 
 
 state of California, the state of Oregon. 
 
And these potential updates would make the COVID-19 isolation guidelines at the national level more so aligned with what's recommended if you test 
 
 positive for flu or for RSV. 
 
A lot of those recommendations are based on your symptoms, not just a blanket recommendation to stay home for X number of days. So, looking at 
 
 the symptoms seems to be where these conversations are heading as we think about what the guidelines should be. 
 
ASHER: All right, Jacqueline Howard, live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, the Kansas City Chiefs weren't the only winners in the Super 
 
 Bowl. The networks and the sponsors got their money's worth, as well. We'll tell you why a little bit later. 
 
GOLODRYGA: They got a lot of eyeballs watching that game. Then the U.S. Senate signals that it's standing behind Ukraine, passing a massive foreign 
 
 aid package that includes military funding for Kyiv. And it comes at a critical time, as Ukrainian troops face dire supply shortages on the 
 
 battlefield. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is one of the most important things for the Ukrainians to stay in the fight. They're not 
 
 only outmanned, they're also outgunned. And the biggest problem they have is a lack of ammunition. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:25:12]
 
ASHER: All right, welcome back to "One World". I'm Zain Asher. And I'm Bianna Golodryga. Ukraine is keeping a very close eye on what's happening 
 
 in the U.S. Congress right now. 
 
ASHER: All right. That's because earlier the Senate passed a massive foreign aid bill that would provide $60 billion in military assistance to 
 
 Kyiv. Just moments after it was approved, Ukraine's President expressed his gratitude. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: I thank each of the 70 senators who voted in the affirmative. Ukraine appreciates it very much. This was 
 
 the first step. Next step is the House of Representatives and the vote of the congressmen there. We expect a positive decision. We hope for our 
 
 principled support. And we believe that America will continue to be a leader. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: But the path ahead in the Republican-controlled House is uncertain at best. And as CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports, the bill comes at a 
 
 crucial time as Ukraine faces critical shortages on the battlefield and struggles to contain Russia's army. 
 
PLEITGEN: Hi there, Zain and Bianna. Well, the Ukrainians obviously very happy about that vote in the Senate. In fact, the President of Ukraine, 
 
 Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he came out and he believed that this showed that the Senate is in solidarity with Ukraine.
 
That also, additional arms from the United States would help Ukraine possibly turn the tides on the battlefield and also would save, as he put 
 
 it, Ukrainian cities as well, even though of course the Ukrainians also understand that there is still a very long way to go and a lot of 
 
 uncertainty in the House of Representatives. 
 
Now, all this comes as the Ukrainians are somewhat struggling on the battlefields. The Russians certainly are the ones who are trying to make 
 
 gains, especially in the east and the southeast of the country, the Ukrainians suffering from a lack of weapons and a lack of ammunition. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): A German-made Leopard Two tank hitting Russian positions on the eastern front. This video provided by the 21st Mechanized 
 
 Brigade showing, they say, how effective Western weapons are on the battlefield. 
 
VEDMIN, TANK COMMANDER, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES: Every infantry is scared of a tank. Tanks go out and work and they fire frightfully. They fire straight 
 
 into their faces and they don't even have time to think about what to do. 
 
The Ukrainians say they need a lot more Western arms and ammo. But Republicans have blocked U.S. military aid in Congress, and their likely 
 
 nominee for President, Donald Trump, even suggested he might encourage Russia to attack NATO members who didn't meet military spending guidelines. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the 
 
 hell they want. You got to pay. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Those comments literally have Europeans up in arms, now ramping up weapons production for Ukraine and for themselves. Germany's 
 
 chancellor visiting a major arms plant with Denmark's Prime Minister, trying to downplay Trump's comments. 
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: NATO is of essence for the United States, for Canada, for the European countries, and we cooperated so long since 
 
 World War II, and this is really something which is a good alliance for the future. We stick to it. The President of the United States sticks to it. 
 
 And I'm sure the American people will do so." 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): But Denmark's Prime Minister says she has no illusions. U.S. support for European NATO members no longer seems certain. 
 
METTE FREDERIKSEN, DANISH PRIME MINISTER: No matter what will happen in the U.S. in this year, I think the conclusion has to be written already now 
 
 that Europe needs to be stronger, and we need to be able to do more on our own. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): And ammo production is the biggest concern, as NATO allies struggle to help Ukraine make up for massive shortfalls while facing 
 
 overwhelming Russian firepower. 
 
PLEITGEN: This is one of the most important things for the Ukrainians to stay in the fight. They're not only outmanned, they're also outgunned. And 
 
 the biggest problem they have is a lack of ammunition. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): They broke ground for a new ammo plant here, and the company's CEO says they will drastically increase ammo production quickly, 
 
 especially for artillery. 
 
ARMIN PAPPERGER, CEO, RHEINMETALL: They need one million to 1.2 million and if I give them 700,000, I think there are also some other producers in 
 
 Europe who have to give them something. So, 700,000 is at the moment the maximum that we can produce. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): And the Ukrainians say they need the maximum their allies can give, with or without the U.S., to keep their forces in the 
 
 fight against the Russians. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
PLEITGEN: So, as you can see there, Zain and Bianna, the Ukrainians saying that they're putting those Western weapons to good use, but they simply 
 
 don't have enough of them. 
 
And one of the things that we could see as we were traveling along the front lines in Ukraine for the past, a little over a month, was they say 
 
 the biggest problems that they have is a manpower shortage, but then also an ammo shortage. 
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
So, we can see the Europeans trying to alleviate some of that. But again, the Europeans saying without the help of the United States, it will be very 
 
 hard to overcome those shortfalls. Zain and Bianna.
 
GOLODRYGA: Fred Pleitgen, thanks to you. Time now for The Exchange and our conversation with the Chief Diplomatic Advisor to Ukrainian President 
 
 Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Igor Zhovkva who joins us now live from Kyiv. 
 
Igor, it is good to see you. A big sigh of relief, I would imagine, in Ukraine, seeing that this bill passed the Senate. Some $60 billion in aid 
 
 would be the largest infusion, thus far, in this war, but a big hurdle lies ahead, as you know, and that is passage in the House. 
 
The Speaker has said, thus far, that he will not even bring it up for a vote. A lot of concern that means no aid going to Ukraine from the U.S. 
 
 anytime soon. What message do you think that sends to Vladimir Putin? 
 
IGOR ZHOVKVA, DEPUTY HEAD OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE: Well, let's start from the message, which was strong message of the support which 
 
 was sent today by the Senate. And once again, reiterate the words of thanks my President just uttered to each and every senator. 
 
Seventy senators voting for the bill to support Ukraine's security, Ukraine's future, to provide Ukraine's victory. This is really important. 
 
 That's not only instrumental choice because right you are, we need these weapons, we need this ammo, we need to win. 
 
But it's also a huge sign of moral choice. U.S. side is showing today to Ukraine because it would be really difficult to be advocating for not 
 
 giving the financing for Ukraine. 
 
In this case, Ukraine might lose, but it is in the interest of all the humankind, of all the countries, including the U.S., for Ukraine to lose 
 
 rather to win. Certainly, the answer is very obvious. 
 
As far as the next steps, certainly -- if any absence of the further decisions, in which I don't believe -- but if any absence of this decision, 
 
 that will send a huge signal to President of aggressor country. Look, the U.S. is not with Ukraine. U.S. is not supporting Ukraine on this period of 
 
 time when support is really needed. When we are ahead of the very serious things on the battlefield. 
 
So, surely, my President will be working with the U.S. side as he did before. He visited several times D.C. He talked to both representatives of 
 
 both parties, Republicans and Democrats. He talked to the Congress. He talked to the U.S. administration. 
 
And everywhere he heard, or to tell it vice versa, he never heard that Ukraine should not be supported. Because I think each and every American, 
 
 despite any party, believes Ukraine should win. 
 
ASHER: Igor, Zain here. I do want to talk to you about sort of the argument and the rationale behind a lot of Republicans in the House who may be 
 
 opposed to sending Ukraine more aid. Some Republicans in the House say, look, the U.S. should be focused on its own problems. 
 
Look at what's happening on the southern border. Other Republicans say that they think that, you know, Putin's going to win anyway. What is the point 
 
 of sending -- this is their argument, not mine.
 
What is the point of sending Ukraine billions of more in terms of U.S. military assistance when it is clear that Putin will never allow himself to 
 
 lose and that it's going to be very, very difficult for Ukraine to at any point in time, even with more money thrown at the problem, get the upper 
 
 hand? What do you say to those Republicans? 
 
ZHOVKVA: Look, I mean, let's get back our two years ahead -- two years ago during the start of the open Russian aggression against Ukraine. So many 
 
 words and predictions and forecasts we saw that Ukraine would not withstand three days, they're not okay, five days, maybe a week, a month. 
 
Now, we are approaching to this second anniversary of the Open Russia aggression, a very tragic two years which we had. But at the same period of 
 
 time, we managed to get back over 50 percent of the territory which was captured by Russia within these first days and months of its aggression. 
 
We managed not only to withstand, but to have several really unique and very important operations. You know, probably these counter-offensives of 
 
 Ukraine will be taught in the best U.S. military academies worldwide. 
 
So, I would tell to those Republicans, look, if you don't believe in Ukraine, if you don't believe Ukraine will win, you will be in the minor 
 
 side. You will not be on the moral side. 
 
You will be on the side of those who are still killing my nation who are still producing missiles and armor and, you know, battle tanks in order to 
 
 kill Ukrainians day by day, night by night. And it's not like merely not giving the money. It's far more moral consequences of this action. 
 
As far as the money is concerned, we certainly will provide every strict control, every dollar which is spent to military assistance to Ukraine will 
 
 be severely controlled, and we are ready for this control. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
They control in Ukraine, we will be having all the necessary reports of using the highly-sophisticated Ukrainian weapons. So, we absolutely will 
 
 share, we will have this burden of reporting. But again, the world needs Ukraine to win. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, there would be a lot more accountability put to the use of this money if this bill passes in its current form. But let's put names to 
 
 some of those Republicans who Zain mentioned. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin opposes this bill. And here's what he said, I'm not supporting 
 
 Putin. He's an evil war criminal, but he will not lose. He's not going to lose. 
 
And at some point in time, people here need to recognize that reality. He went on to say, Igor, that if you're concerned about the Ukrainian people, 
 
 you ought to do everything you can to bring this war to an end. You have that. You have the former President saying this over the weekend. Let's 
 
 play it and we'll talk after. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: One of the Presidents of a big country stood up and said, well, Sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said, 
 
 you didn't pay? You're delinquent? He said, yes. Let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever 
 
 the hell they want. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: So, Donald Trump is the front-runner now to be -- for the Republican nomination. You have several Republican senators who've thrown 
 
 their support behind him and have made arguments similar to Ron Johnson's. How do you respond? 
 
ZHOVKVA: Well, I respond that, first of all, certainly each and every nation should be stronger. NATO should be stronger. It's absolutely 
 
 important. The U.S. should be stronger. The U.S. was always strong and yours was also given an example to the rest of the world. Now, I think it's 
 
 high time to give additional example, to give even more successful example to the rest of the world. 
 
I think these events, this Russian aggression against Ukraine has given a serious crush test to each and every nation, including to European nations. 
 
 They certainly have to check now their capabilities, their defense capabilities, their expenditures, their ability to produce more armor or 
 
 weapons. 
 
This is mutually beneficial for Ukraine and for European nations. And by the way, we are moving in this direction. We are moving in this direction 
 
 with U.S. companies, as well. You remember, you had a very important conference in D.C. where Ukrainian military industries and U.S. military 
 
 industries were talking together in how to enrich the capabilities and how to start the joint production. 
 
This is certainly beneficial for Ukraine because we need this armor and weapons. But it's also beneficial for the U.S. because this is additional 
 
 working places, this is additional sign of leadership for your country. So, I think, the procedure from this, from this win of Ukraine is mutually 
 
 beneficial for both our peoples. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, as President Zelenskyy said, that this is an investment in world stability. That's what he said when he faced Congress last year and 
 
 that still appears to be the argument for many in this Congress who support funding Ukraine. 
 
But of course, we have this major hurdle now in the House that we will continue to be following closely. Igor Zhovkva, thank you so much for your 
 
 time, we appreciate it. 
 
ASHER: Thank you Igor. 
 
GOLODRYGA: All right, still to come, a powerful snowstorm is slamming the northeastern part of the U.S. A look at where the winter blast is hitting 
 
 the hardest. We'll talk about that after the break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:41:18]
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, right now a powerful winter storm is slamming much of the northeastern United States causing power outages and at least a thousand 
 
 flight cancellations. This is a scene in Pennsylvania where more than 133,000 customers are now without power. 
 
ASHER: And while parts of New Jersey are looking like a winter wonderland, on the coast, people are being told to brace for possible flooding. And 
 
 right here in New York with a city under a winter storm warning, we find Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. 
 
Derek, I have to say I'm dreading my commute home this afternoon. On my way in this morning, I swear I almost got, the wind was so intense, I almost 
 
 got knocked over. But it looks pretty calm behind you. So, maybe I shouldn't be afraid after all. 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah. Things have completely changed from when you went in at primo rush hour. But look at this. I mean, New York's 
 
 finest here, just getting around Central Park on skis. It's something you don't see every day. You know what? This city has been transformed into 
 
 something that New York residents have experienced in over 740 days -- 744 to be exact. That's the last time we had over 6 centimeters of snow on the 
 
 ground. 
 
And that's significant because unofficially we have gotten that amount of snow here. We haven't gotten an update from the National Weather Service 
 
 just yet. But this is significant because that's the most snow in over two years. I mean people have almost yearned for it to happen even though it's 
 
 been an impactful storm, we know that over a thousand flights have been canceled along the East Coast. 
 
And of course, the roadways have been impacted as this heavy, wet snow accumulated. It's just really turned into such a beautiful site for some of 
 
 these larger cities that have been transformed into a winter wonderland, a different site because so many of the East Coast cities have had one of 
 
 their top five warmest winters to date. 
 
And that's saying something now that we're getting into the snowier, colder weather pattern that has transformed things around here. Get to my graphics 
 
 because I want to show you just how much snow has fallen as of 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Central Park, three centimeters but we did an 
 
 unofficial weather check here from CNN weather. 
 
We have at least six centimeters on the ground so that would be, if that does actually confirm that would be the most snow that they've had in over 
 
 two years. But look at Pennsylvania -- over 38 centimeters of snow.
 
I talked about how this was going to be a quick-hitting, fast-punching snowstorm and it certainly was. You can see on the radar that things are 
 
 coming to an end, the back end of that precipitation line, now moving through New York, Philadelphia, Boston, the outer Cape, that area still 
 
 being pounded by heavy snow and strong winds that, Zain, you encountered on your way to work earlier this morning. 
 
You get a little bit closer to that I-95 corridor, a very busy stretch of road that extends from Boston through New York to Philadelphia. That area 
 
 is generally snow-covered, kind of dangerous to get around, but conditions will be improving because the storm is coming to an end. 
 
And we'll say goodbye just as quickly as the storm said hello to us earlier this morning. But definitely winter wonderland at its finest here in 
 
 Central Park. Zain, back to you.
 
ASHER: It is magical behind you. I miss Central Park. Derek Van Dam, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: It really is something to see people skiing and running at the same time. 
 
ASHER: I couldn't stop laughing when I saw that. 
 
GOLODRYGA: You know, you know, the snow's out. Get the skis. Half a day. 
 
ASHER: Only in New York. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Only in New York. Well, speaking of New York, New York voters may have to battle the snow to cast their ballot in a special election 
 
 happening right now. 
 
ASHER: All right, up for grabs is New York's third congressional district. This is the seat that was left vacant after Republican George Santos was 
 
 expelled from Congress just last year. 
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
The special election gives Democrats a chance to further narrow the already tight Republican majority in the House. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Athena Jones joins us from Glen Clove, New York, with the details. Athena, what are you seeing behind you? And is the weather 
 
 impacting any of the turnout that you've seen? 
 
ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Bianna. Well, the weather is definitely impacting turnout. That's what the poll workers tell 
 
 me behind me. And it's also what we've seen. 
 
We were at a middle school early this morning from about six to eight. Only saw a trickle of voters coming in. We've been here since then. And again, 
 
 not seeing very many people coming to line up and vote. 
 
Now, these poll workers tell me that part of this has to do with the fact that this is a special election. The other part is the snow. Schools are 
 
 closed. A lot of people aren't going to be commuting into work, so they're not coming by the voting place on their way to the train to head into the 
 
 city. 
 
And also the fact that so many people voted early, more than 80,000 people voted early. The majority of those were Democratic votes during the nine 
 
 days of early voting. 
 
And just to really drive the point home in terms of turnout, Bianna, I just spoke to a poll worker who said that in the last six hours or so, their 
 
 district, one of these three tables, their district has seen about 40 voters, whereas usually they'd see 400 an hour during the weekday of early 
 
 voting or 1100 on a weekend day of early voting. So, it gives you some sense of how low the turnout is. 
 
The voters I've talked to are splitting pretty much down the middle of this very closely watched race that, as you said, could play a big role in -- is 
 
 going to play a role in determining the margin in the House. There's already a very narrow GOP margin, seven seats. Of course the Democrats are 
 
 hoping to pick up the seat here. 
 
This also could be a good signal for what can be expected in 2024. What party's messaging is going to win the day when it comes to the big election 
 
 in November for the White House and for Congress? I can say this district is so important because this is exactly the kind of suburban district that 
 
 political observers expect to decide that election in 2024, and this district has changed quite a bit just in a few years. 
 
In 2020, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by eight points. Santos lost to Swazi by double digits that same year. But just two years later, in 2022, Santos 
 
 was able to beat his Democratic rival by seven points. So, this district is changing. We know the big issues, immigration and abortion are shaping 
 
 votes here. And so, we'll have to see how it all plays out. Bianna.
 
GOLODRYGA: We'll see. And but one thing we do know is that however this ends, whoever wins, we finally put an end to the very bizarre chapter of 
 
 George Santos in our world, in Congress, taking up a lot of space in our daily life. Athena Jones, thank you. 
 
All right, still to come, was it Taylor? Hmm, or was it that ending? Whatever it was, the Super Bowl crushed it in the -- I think it was Taylor, 
 
 by the way. And that kiss, by the way, people were waiting for. We'll have details of the game's remarkable showing after the break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:50:36]
 
ASHER: All right, to say that this year's Super Bowl was a success would certainly be an understatement. Sunday's big game that saw the Kansas City 
 
 Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers in an all over the time thriller broke ratings records. The broadcast reached 123 million viewers. That is, by the 
 
 way, TV's biggest audience since the moon landing. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Just incredible. Now, contributing to the success, the popularity of the two teams, their performance in the game. And oh yeah, 
 
 having Taylor Swift bring her fan base doesn't hurt either. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PATRICK MAHOMES, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS QUARTERBACK: I think it's been cool, honestly. It's been extremely cool, I mean, to see the support that comes 
 
 with the Swifties and how they really embraced us and Chiefs Kingdom and they kind of combined together. 
 
I'm all about growing football and Taylor's a great role model of someone who is great at her profession and I'm glad that she loves football as much 
 
 as everybody else now. And we brought a new fan base to the Chiefs Kingdom. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ASHER: Our Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy joins us live now with the details. So, it looks as though, yes, of course, Taylor Swift absolutely 
 
 brought female viewership. But really, this does show that live football -- live football is really the main game in town when it comes to cable 
 
 ratings. 
 
OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: That's certainly right. I mean, the NFL is pulling off these impressive ratings. I mean, the Super Bowl 
 
 numbers up seven percent from last year. They're pulling this feat off as the rest of the media really struggles. 
 
You know, you're seeing legacy media struggle right now because streaming has really upended the entire business, whether you're a movie theater, 
 
 whether you're a broadcaster, whether you're even another sports league. 
 
You look at the NBA, the Major League Baseball, they're struggling to stay relevant in the age of streaming. But the NFL is not only surviving, 
 
 they're thriving, you know. 
 
You see those ratings continue to go up and posting numbers that are on par basically with the amount of Americans who watch the lunar moon landing. I 
 
 mean, that is really incredible. It's hard to see how they go up from here. And it shows how sewn into the American fabric at this point, the NFL has 
 
 become. 
 
ASHER: Absolutely. Just looking at those numbers there -- it is unbelievable, since 1969. That is incredible. 
 
GOLODRYGA: And I'm sorry, these two teams have played each other before. And it's not like they've had incredible seasons. So, Taylor's boyfriend 
 
 won. 
 
ASHER: We have to leave it there. Thank you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Well. From Taylor Swift and the NFL to potty training. It is a rite of passage for toddlers. We've been there. But what's a parent to do 
 
 when their child has a potty mouth? 
 
ASHER: Our Jeanne Moos -- I was going to say something, but I just thought, you know what, don't say that. Our Jeanne Moos spoke to a mother and her 
 
 two-year-old with a proclivity for profanities. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRSPONDENT (voice-over): It's the new number one reason for a toddler to go to the bathroom. 
 
UNKNOWN: I'll let you say bad words, but only in the bathroom. So get them out now. 
 
MOOS (voice-over): And the second the door closed --
 
GIANNA AMBROSE, CUSSING TODDLER: Stinkin' ass.
 
MOOS: Gianna Ambrose's mom knew she had a problem when her two-year-old spouted the words to Olivia Rodrigo's song, "Vampire". Actually, we can't 
 
 play the bad words, but little Gianna --
 
UNKNOWN: She took a big liking to that song and when they were driving in the car, she just said the whole thing. 
 
MOOS (voice-over): So, mom tried the bathroom technique she'd seen online. 
 
UNKNOWN: Are you saying them? Get them out. 
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: Stinkin' ass.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Stinking was her favorite. She said it three times. 
 
UNKNOWN: Did you get them all out? 
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: No. 
 
MOOS (voice-over): She softly mouthed an everyday barnyard profanity. 
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: (BEEP)
 
MOOS (voice-over): And finally --
 
UNKNOWN: Say all the bad words you want.
 
MOOS (voice-over): She dropped a nearly inaudible F-word. 
 
MOOS: You're a two-year-old kid, where do you hear bad words? 
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: I go in the bathroom and say them.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Her mom says she's trying to take the seductive, forbidden, exciting feel out of swearing, and it sort of feels like it's 
 
 working. 
 
UNKNOWN: She's asked to go back in the bathroom twice since that. 
 
MOOS (voice-over): She treated her first time cussing in the bathroom like a video blog. 
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: Hi, guys. Today, we're saying bad words in here.
 
MOOS (voice-over): As for her favorite word --
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: You stinkin' -- stinkin' ass.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Turns out Gianna picked that up from her mom's fiance, saying it to their cat when he bites. When it comes to stinking, Gianna 
 
 swears by it. Jeanne Moos --
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: You're a princess. 
 
MOOS (voice-over): -- CNN. 
 
MOOS: Your stinkin' princess. 
 
MOOS (voice-over): New York. 
 
GIANNA AMBROSE: (BEEP)
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER: You're a stinkin' great co-anchor. 
 
GOLODRYGA: You know what, maybe Gianna's onto something. Should we just spend a lot of time in the bathroom? Like, just letting it all out --
 
ASHER: I love that technique. 
 
GOLODRYGA: -- in the CNN bathroom?
 
ASHER: I love that technique of just, you know, go into the bathroom and just get it all out. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Stinkin'. Yeah.
 
ASHER: I don't know if it's going to work, though. But I might, I might try that at home. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Although my kids don't have a potty mouth --
 
ASHER: Thank God. 
 
GOLODRYGA: -- yet. 
 
ASHER: Get young. All right, that does it for this hour of "One World". I'm Zain Asher.
 
GOLODRYGA: And I'm Bianna Golodryga. Thank you so much for watching. Amanpour is next and we'll see you back here tomorrow. Stinking.
