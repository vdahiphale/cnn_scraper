MONIQUE CLESCA, PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST: Once that is done, that means moving forward, there are really huge priorities. But the first two priorities are establishing security and dealing with the humanitarian crisis, because there are about 400,000 people who have been displaced, and last night with the gang activities in Petionville, they are probably more displaced with the gang activities in my neighborhood the night before, they are probably more. And there are people going hungry, there are women, girls who have been raped. 
 
So these two huge priorities, establishing security and dealing with the humanitarian crisis are the first ones of the provisional government that will come. So the next steps then is establishing the political accord with a provisional seven-member commission that will work, as well as a prime minister, whether it is a man or a woman, we do not know yet, because they will have to make a choice. And then moving forward with the emergencies, and then setting up things for at least elections in the long term. 
 
Nothing can happen now before we have at least those immediate steps to move us forward and get us out of the hellish situation, horrible, terrifying situation that we're living. 
 
Imagine the children who haven't gone to school now for the third week in Port-au-Prince and the terror and the scary thoughts that they are having. This is really unimaginable. 
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: That's exactly the word I was about to use. Monique Clesca, thank you very much for that incredibly powerful delineation of what is happening in Port-au-Prince and what needs to happen. It's urgent that the world pays attention to this. Please keep safe and thank you very much for joining us. 
 
CLESCA: Thank you. Thank you for having me. 
 
NOBILO: The first U.S. president to be criminally prosecuted begins to make his arguments for immunity to the Supreme Court, and they include some dramatic warnings. 
 
Plus, all to reveal the happiest place on earth, and it's not Disney World, but rather the nation with the world's happiest people and the other countries that cracked the top five when we come back.

NOBILO: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.
 
The U.S. Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day policy meeting later on today. The central bank will release new economic projections and analysts expect the Fed to keep the interest rates steady. 
 
Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been indicted for alleged fraud. He is accused of ordering an aide to falsify COVID-19 vaccination records. The former president's closest aide and 15 others are also accused of participating in the scheme. But Bolsonaro's lawyer calls the indictment absurd. 
 
And China just launched a relay satellite that enables communication with the far side of the moon. The mission is part of its lunar exploration program. China made history back in 2019 when it became the first country to successfully land on the far side of the moon. 
 
Donald Trump has told the U.S. Supreme Court that if he doesn't receive immunity for trying to overturn the presidential election, it would be, quote, the end of the presidency as we know it. The brief filed by the former U.S. president on Tuesday is part of his defense against special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion charges. Lower courts have soundly rejected Trump's immunity claims and the Supreme Court has arguments scheduled for April 25th. 
 
More now from CNN's Evan Perez. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: This is designed to appeal to the conservative justices who have this expansive view of the power of the presidency. I'll read you just a part of what the Trump lawyers say in this filing. 
 
They say: A former president enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts. Criminal immunity arises directly from the executive vesting clause and the separation of powers. 
 
They go on to say that: The impeachment judgment clause reflects the founder's understanding that only a president convicted by the Senate after impeachment could be criminally prosecuted.
 
During the impeachment proceeding, the Trump lawyers argued that you could leave it for the criminal justice system to take care of this issue that the president was being accused of. And of course now they're arguing the opposite. They're saying that first you have to be impeached and convicted by the Senate before you can actually take any kind of criminal action against the former president. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) NOBILO: Earlier, a former federal prosecutor and legal analyst weighed in on the immunity claims and Trump's strategy. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JENNIFER RODGERS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I think that the court is going to look at his argument for absolute immunity, which is the argument that he has to make here. He can't really make a more nuanced argument about, well, all of these things I did were part of my official duties as president and therefore I should be protected in the way that he could if he, say, ordered a drone strike and some DA somewhere tried to prosecute him or something. 
 
What he did, he did as a candidate for his own personal benefit and his political benefit, not for his job as a president in the country. And that's why he has to go big on this argument for absolute immunity. And he has to raise the specter of, oh, if you do this, you know, everyone's going to be prosecuted after this.
 
Well, no one has been prosecuted before in the history of our country. No one who lives within the bounds of the law while their president will be prosecuted again. This is really about his actions. 
 
And because those actions are outside of any reasonable scope of what the president is supposed to be doing, I think the court will have to set a standard that is below absolute immunity.

NOBILO: A contentious Texas immigration law that raised fears of racial profiling has once again been put on hold. This 11th hour order from the federal appeals court came just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Republican-backed legislation to take effect. 
 
The appeals court judges are set to hear arguments on the law later today. It would allow Texas officials to arrest and detain people that they suspect of entering the country illegally. 
 
Hong Kong has now passed a second national security law with sweeping new powers that critics say will closely align the city with mainland China. 
 
The bill was approved on Tuesday after being rushed through Hong Kong's legislative council and debated over just 11 days. The law, which introduces dozens of new national security crimes, is sparking fears that an ongoing crackdown on dissent will only get worse. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins us now from Hong Kong with the very latest. 
 
Kristie, it's so great to be able to speak to you about this. What are people in Hong Kong saying about the introduction of these laws potentially? And where do you think it would be powerful in practice? 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, there are concerns that there could be a chilling effect as a result of this, this 212- page security legislation that was fast-tracked through Hong Kong's legislature at the behest of the city's top leader, John Lee.
 
This was debated for just over 11 days. Since March 8th, it introduces 39 new national security crimes, adding to the already powerful national security law that was imposed by Beijing in 2020. Watch this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LU STOUT (voice-over): On the streets of Hong Kong we ask a simple question. Do you support or not support article 23?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no idea.
 
LU STOUT: No idea.
 
Yes or no?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah, no. I have to go. I'm really sorry.
 
LU STOUT (voice-over): We ask in English. We ask in Cantonese. No comment.
 
LU STOUT: Article 23 is Hong Kong's controversial new homegrown security legislation. It includes a range of new national security crimes including treason, espionage, external interference and disclosure of state secrets.
 
LU STOUT (voice-over): It carries sentences of 10 years for crimes linked to state secrets and sedition, 20 years for espionage and up to life in prison for treason, insurrection, sabotage and mutiny.
 
Officials point out that many Western countries have similar legislation and say it will fill loopholes in the sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 after mass anti-government protests.
 
JOHN LEE, HONG KONG CHIEF EXECUTIVE: We still have to watch out for potential sabotage, undercurrents that try to create troubles.
 
LU STOUT (voice-over): In 2020 article 23 was shelved after an attempt to enact it drew half a million residents onto the streets in protest. No such scenes of opposition are expected this time around.
 
Beijing's national security crackdown has transformed Hong Kong. Dozens of political opponents have been arrested, civil society groups disbanded and outspoken media outlets shut down. Former opposition lawmaker Emily Lau was among the protesters in 2003. She's no longer marching but has a message for Beijing.
 
EMILY LAU, FORMER OPPOSITION LEADER: I just want to tell Beijing there's no need for such stern treatment. I don't think Hong Kong will go back to the turbulent past and I think people want to look forward to a safe and peaceful and free future. We want Hong Kong to prosper. We are part of China. I've never disputed that but we are different from the rest of China but the difference is getting less and less which is very sad. LU STOUT (voice-over): Critics say the law could have deep ramifications for the city status as a global business hub. The U.S. State Department says it is concerned by the quote: Broad and vague definitions of state secrets and external interference that could be used to eliminate dissent through the fear of arrest and detention.
 
The Hong Kong government rejects that criticism as biased and misleading with Security Secretary Chris Tang pointing out there is strong public support.
 
CHRIS TANG, HONG KONG SECRETARY OF SECURITY (through translated text): We received 98.6 percent support and positive feedback.
 
LU STOUT (voice-over): But on the streets --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translated text): I don't want to answer.
 
LU STOUT (voice-over): -- it's hard to tell.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translated text): We won't discuss things, very sensitive.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
LU STOUT (on camera): After the passage of the law last night, the U.S. State Department expressed alarm about its vague wording. And according to the deputy spokesperson, Vedant Patel, it has, quote: The potential to accelerate the closing of Hong Kong's once open society. 
 
Now Hong Kong's top leader, John Lee, spoke at the Legislative Council immediately after the law's passage. He says it meets international standards. It protects Hong Kong's rights and freedoms. And he called the passage of Article 23 a, quote, historic moment. 
 
And all this comes into effect this weekend. This comes into effect this Saturday, March the 23rd. Back to you -- Bianca.
 
NOBILO: Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, thank you so much for that package and your reporting on this. 
 
LU STOUT: Thank you. 
 
NOBILO: Now to a developing story out of Pakistan, where 12 miners have died after a gas explosion in a coal mine. The chief inspector of mines in southwestern province of Balochistan says that 10 miners were initially trapped underground after the explosion. But the blast caused a partial collapse of the mine, and 10 more miners were then trapped trying to rescue the others. Only eight miners were pulled out alive.
 
Argentina's new president has been in office for just over 100 days now. Javier Milei was elected on the promise of a political era that was new. But a new report shows that for the third month in a row, the nation recorded the highest inflation in the world. And people across the country are struggling to make ends meet. 
 <br>[04:45:03]
 
CNN's Stefano Pozzebon reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: It's still the afternoon when the soup kitchen in Buenos Aires opens for dinner. And for many, including children, this is their only meal of the day. 
 
Walter Torres is a regular. He comes here every night, he says, since he lost his unemployment benefit last year. 
 
Look how many we are. These people had a job or some plan, and now they're queuing for food. Our salary is worth nothing. 
 
This charity was born as a shelter for the homeless, with a capacity for 50 people. But most of the over 200 meals handed out today are taken away and eaten at home. Volunteers are asking for IDs to make sure nobody hoards on food, which is scarce for everyone. Inside, the kitchen is in full motion.
 
Some of the guests are our own neighbors, who would have never imagined they would need a charity, says this volunteer. And next to the kitchen, a clothing bank. 
 
POZZEBON: This is another aspect of the new poverty crisis here in Argentina. 
 
When this service was started, it was mostly for homeless people, adults, when instead here you see the sizes of four years old, four, five, six, seven, eight years old, meaning that the families can no longer afford to buy the clothes for the little ones. 
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): Argentina's poverty rate was already rising before President Javier Milei took office in December. Since then, his focus has been on an austerity drive to bring inflation down.
 
His reforms, like devaluing the Argentinian peso over 50 percent, were applauded abroad, but punished many in Argentina, who have seen their salaries collapse and can no longer afford to pay for food. 
 
Getting today's fare at the supermarket out of the question for this worker. While the analyst's verdict is still open -- 
 
MACARENA MICHIENZI, LEAD SPECIALIST, CEFEIDAS GROUP: I think we have to see how much the people is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and to maybe adjust their budgets.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): Milei's interior minister pleading for patience in an interview with CNN. 
 
GUILLERMO FRANCOS, ARGENTINE INTERIOR MINISTER (through translator): What we want is for people to receive their benefits themselves and stop relying on food kitchens, but changing the system takes time. 
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): Who doesn't have time is Torres, who was able to eat today, but is not sure about tomorrow. For him, change couldn't come soon enough.

NOBILO: Still ahead, the U.S. Defense Secretary gives his assessment of the war in Ukraine. Noting the country's very survival as its stake, while critical funding languishes in Congress.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: The U.S. Defense Secretary says America's support for Ukraine remains resolute despite Republicans in Congress holding up critical funding.
 
Lloyd Austin met with Ukraine's Defense Minister and other partners in Germany on Tuesday. He reiterated that the U.S. and its Western allies will not let Ukraine fail. He also pointed to a number of statistics demonstrating Russia's losses but acknowledged there are challenges, saying, quote, Ukraine's survival is on the line. 
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now to discuss. It's a difficult statement for Lloyd Austin to make to say that the support is resolute when the U.S. is in an election year. There are obvious disagreements, the funding bill is languishing in Congress. 
 
Is that believed? And I guess the bigger issue here is the fact that Russia has, you know, the luxury of time. And the longer the world waits, the more people detach from this as a story, the more that fatigue sets in, the worse all of this gets for Ukraine. 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, I think those words will have, despite the sort of statements of gratitude that we then heard from President Zelenskyy, who is obviously treading a fine diplomatic line here, those words will have rung pretty hollow in Ukraine. 
 
Yes, the U.S. has just provided another 300 million, but that is, you know, a drop in the ocean of what Ukraine needs. And we obviously see from Lloyd Austin, he's also having to tread a fine line. There's always this balancing act, between emphasizing Ukraine's successes, the way it's managed to erode Russia's capabilities.
 
He said just so that he can show the American people and members of Congress in particular that they are getting a return on their investment, while at the same time emphasizing that this is a very fragile moment for Ukraine as another argument as to why they should get support. 
 
So take a listen to some of what he said about this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Regarding a potential Russian breakthrough, what we've seen on the battlefield is a series of incremental gains by the Russians. 
 
These gains have come at significant cost in terms of personnel and equipment. But nonetheless, you know, we have seen some incremental gains. And as I have engaged my counterparts and the chief of defense in Ukraine, they feel confident in their ability to continue to defend their sovereign territory and hold the line. 
 
Of course, they need munitions, they need support in order to be able to continue to do that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: So he does have to choose his words pretty carefully there. We just heard this week from Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister saying that some of their ammunition stocks have plummeted to critical levels. 
 
Meanwhile, Russia is stepping up its attacks, particularly using aircraft drop bombs. President Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of March alone, they've dropped nearly 900 guided aerial bombs. So the situation is critical. 
 
Europe is stepping up, though. This Czech initiative to buy ammunition from outside countries is gaining traction, including at that Rammstein meeting. The prime minister of Ukraine says that he hopes to have what he said would be enough ammunition by the beginning of April. 
 
Whether that will be quick enough to hold the line west of Avdiivka, for example, is another question. 
 
NOBILO: Clare Sebastian, thank you so much.

Just ahead, new reports about who will play James Bond in the next 007 film. Stay tuned. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I admire your luck, Mr. --
 
SEAN CONNERY, ACTOR, DR. NO: Bond. James Bond. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: Oh, it's so good. The legendary Sean Connery in the 1962 film Dr. No, the first of seven actors to play the British super spy on the silver screen. 
 
Now there is rampant speculation over who the next 007 will be. British tabloid "The Sun" is citing an unnamed source and says the role has been offered to Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The 33-year-old is known for films like "Savages" and "Nocturnal Animals." 
 
Other reports say there's no truth to those Bond rumors. CNN has reached out to Eon Productions and Taylor-Johnson's team for comment. 
 
But other names that are being floated include former "Superman" Henry Cavill and Oscar winner Cillian Murphy, as well as Idris Elba, I read the other day, and Theo James from the new Netflix show "The Gentleman." 
 
Police forces in some parts of the world are starting to look a little different these days. Take a look at these new hires. In Spain, police took a robot dog for a test walk through the busy city center. It's designed to help spot traffic violations with remote image analysis and will soon use AI to sniff out danger. 
 
Meantime, in Tokyo, the top brass are hoping this new police chief's reputation will make criminals think twice. Godzilla himself was made Tokyo police chief for a day last week as part of an event to promote traffic safety. But we're guessing it isn't long until he returns to the big screen. 
 
Finland has been deemed the happiest country on earth for the seventh year in a row. The World Happiness Report is based on data from some 140 countries and coincides with the U.N.'s International Day of Happiness, which is today. 
 
The report factors in GDP per capita, freedom, social support and generosity as well. Neighboring Denmark, Iceland and Sweden snagged the other top spots, and Israel came in fifth. The report uses data from the previous three years and is a partnership of Gallup, the U.N. and the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre. 
 
For the first time ever, the U.S. didn't crack the top 20. It came in at number 23, but the U.K. did make the list just at number 20. 
 
Thank you for joining me here on CNN NEWSROOM. I hope you have a happy day. I'm Bianca Nobilo. CNN "THIS MORNING" is up next after a quick break.
