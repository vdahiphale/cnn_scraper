JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: It's 9 AM here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley, and this is "Connect the World". Right now we're 
 
 waiting to discover when Israel's four day truce with Hamas will begin.
 
Qatari officials who have been instrumental in the negotiations are set to hold a press conference any moment now. The four day pause in fighting and 
 
 the release of hostages was originally expected to begin today. Without it in place, Israeli forces have continued ground and air operations striking 
 
 parts of North Eastern and Central Gaza on Wednesday.
 
The White House has said it's hopeful that the hostage release process will begin on Friday and says parties are working out final logistical details. 
 
 Now on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained some terms of the deal.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: The agreement achieved does not include the release of murderers, and it does include the agreement of the 
 
 Red Cross representatives to visit the hostages and transfer medications.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: With this delay of course extending an already agonizing wait for the families of the hostages held by Hamas, but some are remaining 
 
 hopeful that they'll see their loved ones soon. Matthew Chance has more from Tel Aviv.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Israelis await the release of some women and children held in Gaza, a vigil 
 
 for one of the hostages who may be left behind. 22-year-old Alon Ohel (ph) was abducted at a music festival on October 7th. There's an adult male he's 
 
 unlikely to be among those freed under the latest hostage deal. Still his mother Idit (ph) told me she believes her son will eventually be set free.
 
IDIT OHEL, SON HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: I know in my heart that I want my son home. I believe this is just a start you know because if everyone has to 
 
 get home this is just you know it's just starting there'll be more.
 
CHANCE: You're optimistic?
 
OHEL: Very much.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): Israel insists it's keeping up pressure on Hamas, even as the agreed pause in this Gaza war approaches. Under the hostage deal, 
 
 strikes like this one in Han Younis in Southern Gaza will be suspended while Israel freeze Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages are handed 
 
 over.
 
CHANCE: How do you --
 
CHANCE (voice-over): Hostage support volunteers like Orna Dotan tell me they're bracing to cancel dozens of traumatized women and children as they 
 
 return home.
 
ORNA DOTAN, HOSTAGE AND MISSING FAMILIES FORUM: Maybe Sharon (ph) and her daughter were released today maybe because it's a daughter and the mother.
 
CHANCE: Yes.
 
DOTAN: The way they are going to continue is first of all, we have to ask for the permission to go inside and to do the first step together.
 
CHANCE: And of course, there's a possibility that these people could have suffered terrible trauma whilst in Gaza.
 
DOTAN: We are so afraid about the condition that they will come. So we cannot plan the trauma program. Because first we have to meet them to 
 
 understand from the best psychologists, what is the best way to deal with and then step by step with the family as a -- to complete.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): Step by step down a long road. Matthew Chance, CNN, Tel Aviv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Now Israeli forces have confirmed they detained the Director of the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. In a statement the IDF said Dr. Muhammad Abu 
 
 Salmiya is being questioned over evidence allegedly showing the hospital under his management served as a Hamas control and command center.
 
The statement also claimed the tunnel network under the hospital used its power and resources and that there was extensive Hamas terrorist activity. 
 
 On Wednesday, the IDF released video showing a tunnel network under the hospital complex. This video was shot by the IDF and we cannot verify their 
 
 findings.
 
Doctors and health officials in Gaza have consistently denied the accusations. Nada Bashir is in Jerusalem for us. Nada given the accusations 
 
 that the IDF have leveled at the Al-Shifa Hospital on what it was being used for it makes sense surely that they would want to speak to the 
 
 director of the hospital. What more do we know about his detainment?
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look Julia, we've actually been hearing from Mohammed Abu Salmiya the Al-Shifa Hospital Director on quite a number 
 
 of occasions in the lead up to his arrest speaking, giving updates on the situation inside the Al-Shifa Hospital and the situation being faced by 
 
 both medical staff and by patients.
 
And as you mentioned, medical staff and officials, including Hamid Muhammad Abu Salmiya have long maintained that there has not been a Hamas presence 
 
 within the hospital that they are not aware of Hamas using the hospital facility or complex as a command and control center as alleged by the 
 
 Israeli military.
 
Of course, we have seen that evidence according to the Israeli military being released showing tunnel, showing a supply of weapons on the hospital 
 
 complex again, CNN cannot independently verify these claims. But those allegations have long been denied by doctors on the ground by medical 
 
 officials, including Muhammad Abu Salmiya.
 
And of course have been denied by Hamas and again, CNN can't verify either side's claims. We are not on the ground haven't been given independent 
 
 access to the Al-Shifa Hospital. We know of course that the UN has been calling for independent access in order to carry out an investigation of 
 
 its own at the Al-Shifa Hospital.
 
But we are still learning more details around the circumstances of Muhammad Abu Salmiya's arrest. We've heard a little earlier from the Israeli 
 
 military saying that they had detained Muhammad Abu Salmiya in order to carry out questioning as to what he knew about this alleged Hamas use of 
 
 the Al-Shifa Complex as a command and control center.
 
Of course, we have also heard from the Health Ministry in Gaza, which is led by and administered by Hamas, saying that Muhammad Abu Salmiya was 
 
 detained alongside other medical staff and doctors while trying to evacuate the hospital. Now according to the Hamas run Health Ministry that detention 
 
 took place at a checkpoint in Central Gaza.
 
While these doctors like Muhammad Abu Salmiya having to leave via a convoy which was coordinated and led by the UN's World Health Organization and the 
 
 Health Ministry in Gaza has now issued a statement saying that they will be suspending all cooperation with the World Health Organization on this vital 
 
 evacuation of medical staff and patients from the hospital until the UN is able to provide a full explanation a full report as to why this detention 
 
 took place and how it took place.
 
And also until all doctors all medical staff, including Muhammad Abu Salmiya are released from detention. Now of course, we do know that the 
 
 situation facing the Al-Shifa Hospital is deteriorating rapidly. It is already in operation. And so that evacuation of patients and medical staff 
 
 is vital.
 
And like many hospitals across Northern Gaza, there are serious concerns with the long term security and safety of patients inside the hospital not 
 
 least because of the conditions that they are facing with a deteriorating humanitarian situation. There is hope of course that if this truce is 
 
 upheld, we could see vital aid getting in of course getting to those hospitals that are most in need.
 
But as we know, of course, there is still ongoing aerial bombardment and ground fighting around the Al-Shifa Complex and around many hospitals in 
 
 Northern Gaza. And ahead of this truce we know that the IDF has confirmed that it is continuing its airstrikes on Northern Gaza.
 
We are still seeing shelling on the ground in Northern Gaza. This morning the IDF confirming they had carried out operations around the Jabalia 
 
 Refugee Camp area. This is an area we have seen for days now repeated airstrikes. And we have been hearing from people on the ground from doctors 
 
 at nearby hospitals, including the Indonesian hospital as well as civilians on the ground who has told us about the impact of these airstrikes.
 
Many people killed many wounded complete residential buildings completely destroyed as a result of these airstrikes. Again, the Israeli military says 
 
 they are targeting Hamas positions. They believe they have targeted Hamas tunnels Hamas infrastructure over the course of this last day, but as we 
 
 know, this is a densely populated area, highly populated with civilians with children.
 
And while these hospitals are deeply overrun, they are struggling to provide the care needed for those civilians wounded as a result of those 
 
 airstrikes and there are a few areas safe in Gaza for these civilians to turn. Again, that call for civilians to move south to evacuate continues to 
 
 be upheld by the IDF but as we know many cannot evacuate.
 
And what we are learning today about the halting of this evacuation process from the Al-Shifa Hospital will only complicate things more when it comes 
 
 to those most in need, particularly those who require specialist medical evacuations to get out of Al-Shifa to get out of harm's way.
 
 But of course, again, important to underscore and remind our viewers that airstrikes are also continuing in the south where civilians are being told 
 
 to evacuate to and really all hope is resting on this truce that this will provide some respite for civilians on the ground and crucially allow 
 
 humanitarian agencies to get in to get the aid into and provide urgent support that is so desperately needed for hundreds of thousands of 
 
 civilians now internally displaced inside Gaza, Julia.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, so much hope to your point around the region around the world, I think waiting on the announcement of further details on this 
 
 truce. And as I mentioned actually at the top of the show, we are waiting for a press conference from Doha hopefully to give us more details on that. 
 
 But for now Nada thank you for that report, Nada Bashir there from Jerusalem.
 
Now as Nada was mentioning aid trucks are also waiting for that truce. This convoy is lined up at Egypt's border with Gaza waiting to get the go ahead 
 
 to enter the besieged enclave. CNN has been hearing from the Egyptian government too. It says it's not clear what type of aid or how much will be 
 
 allowed into Gaza.
 
And as we wait on news about when a pause in fighting will begin in Gaza, there are calls too, to extend the truce beyond the four days agreed so 
 
 far. The International Rescue Committee says it welcomes any respite in fighting but says four days is simply not long enough to address the 
 
 humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
 
And that's a feeling shared by Palestinians too, like 13 year old Mohamed Khaled who lost his leg in an Israeli air strike. He's now in Egypt for 
 
 treatment, and is hoping for a permanent ceasefire.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHAMED KHALED, LOST LEG IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE: I want them to extend this to a full humanitarian truce. So we can live free and safe. Four days will 
 
 not be enough to even bury the martyrs and even if they are able to do so the tragedies will then resume. I wish they extend the truce and we have a 
 
 permanent ceasefire.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Eleni Giokos is in Cairo with more on the challenges being faced in Egypt at this moment Eleni, good to have you with us. The question 
 
 here, I think the important one is one, whether or not the truce begins as the Egyptians are saying they're not sure what even will be allowed in and 
 
 how much they can get in?
 
And I think critical to this and have been now for many weeks fuel and how much fuel will be part of this convoy if indeed, when this truce begins and 
 
 aid trucks are allowed to cross the border?
 
MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESMAN: They will be 13 in number all women and children and those hostages while from the same 
 
 families will be put together within the same patch. Obviously, every day will include a number of civilians as agreed to total 50 within the four 
 
 days.
 
The communications that took place and the meetings that took place all through yesterday went on until early morning today with the Egyptians and 
 
 the parties of the conflict present here in Doha. Their meetings went very well and in a positive environment.
 
And the results of course was the implementation plan of the agreement which we have always said needed to be something that is concrete and on 
 
 the very ready to create a safe environment for the release of the hostages. This is what I have here information for you right now and I'll 
 
 be taking questions.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible).
 
AL-ANSARI: Two sides do have commitment as far as we are concerned in disagreement, and we have to assume that everyone has got their commitment 
 
 and it is under -- has got interest and of course, we will be communicating with both parties. Of course, they will be responsible for the level of 
 
 commitment, Becky?
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST: What is the process and -- by which the hostages will be transferred out of Gaza into Israel?
 
AL-ANSARI: I'm sorry, Becky, I can't disclose information for security reasons. And as I you know -- we've always said our main objective here is 
 
 the safety of the hostages. So we can't disclose all the information regarding the routes they will be going through.
 
But we will be focusing on making sure that they get there safely through making sure that through our operations that will work with both Red Cross 
 
 and parties of the conflict that all information is in real time and everybody is getting the information the right way. So we can move them 
 
 safely from one place to another.
 
ANDERSON: -- especially if I can.
 
AL-ANSARI: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: The immediate -- track with Hamas for the release of non- Israelis, specifically Americans and all Americans on the list?
 
AL-ANSARI: The criteria on which to prioritize the hostages were purely humanitarian as you know. And our focus was on getting the women and 
 
 children out of harm's way as soon as possible which is basically what we are doing within this agreement.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
And we will be going through hopefully that the momentum carried by this deal would help us get everybody out in time. And at the same time, of 
 
 course, lessen the hardship of the people through their humanitarian project is taking place.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) Tomorrow at 7am isn't going to be the time when we should also expect aid to deliver into Gaza. A follow up question 
 
 if you don't mind, could this give me an opportunity to further expand this deal into something bigger that could pave the way for me --
 
AL-ANSARI: As we talked about, the humanitarian aid is an integral part of this deal. The aid will start going in within of course -- completed, that 
 
 will start at 7 pm -- at 7 am. So we are expecting aid to go in as soon as possible from Rafah crossing.
 
You know, that the aid has been there you know within coordination with the Egyptians and all the international donors. So it's going to be coming in 
 
 through the crossing, as soon as we have that period of calm where, of course, even the aid workers would be safe in going in.
 
It would be a fraction of the need, and has the need is so great, and has that no matter how much aid you're going to bring in, there will be 
 
 certainly more need for aid. But we are hoping to bring in as much as possible, within the confines of the deal.
 
And of course, our aim is for this deal to end with a lasting truce. Right now of course, the confines of this deal are these four days, that are 
 
 subject to a second phase and you know following phases of extending the pause through the formula of getting more hostages out and therefore 
 
 getting more time for the pause.
 
We are hoping that that momentum will carry and that we would find this would open the door for further and deeper negotiations towards an end to 
 
 this war.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- ceasefire other any details regarding this.
 
AL-ANSARI: Of course, it was agreed to have complete cessation of fire during this period from whether from air or land. And this is what the two 
 
 parties have agreed to show that the whole air is completely clear for the hostages to be delivered.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In case of any violation from either party. What will happen? And are there any measures in place to deal with this? On the other 
 
 hand, regarding the Palestinian release Palestinian prisoners who is going to receive them and who's going to deal with and investigate their dealings 
 
 with the Israeli intelligence? Will there be allowance for medical teams to go into Gaza to deal with the tension?
 
AL-ANSARI: The details of the agreement. I don't wish to go into details as I have said before and this is something where I leave it to be implemented 
 
 on the ground. And we hope that there will be commitment from both sides. The two parties of the conflict are committed and they will adhere to the -
 
 - to the agreement in this respect as far as medical teams are concerned.
 
Of course, all the types of aids will be allowed into Gaza. The nature and details of this will -- this NDA agreement including relief personnel and 
 
 then we will talk about details.
 
ANDREW MILLS, REUTERS: Thank you Andrew Mills from Reuters. Dr. Majed Could you please specify whether it's seven o'clock am local time in Gaza? And my 
 
 main question is about the release of Palestinians from Israeli jails. How many Palestinians will be released tomorrow? Where will they be released 
 
 and can you tell us more details about whom they are?
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
AL-ANSARI: So at 7 am local time.
 
MILLS: Local time?
 
AL-ANSARI: As I say is not international timing. So its 7 am local time over there. Regarding the Palestinians, I can't disclose right now 
 
 information about how much you know -- how many of them will be freed tomorrow? But I can tell you that the deal is reciprocal deal. So we're 
 
 expecting a release to happen also on the Israeli side.
 
MILLS: Tomorrow, we are expecting a release.
 
AL-ANSARI: As a result of the release of hostages at 4 pm, around 4 pm in Gaza, yes.
 
MILLS: Thank you.
 
AL-ANSARI: Steven (ph).
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the Red Cross, Red Crescent. Will they be accompanying the hostages out or, you know, 
 
 throughout Gaza? Or they're meeting them at the edge of Gaza? And will they be able to visit the hostages that aren't being released and that was being 
 
 discussed?
 
I mean just to follow on Becky's question. Have specific evacuation routes been set yet? And you're just kind of talk about them? And you know, 
 
 without compromising without sharing too much detail, will hostages be leaving directly into Israel or potentially through Rafah and then -- and 
 
 then home to Israel.
 
AL-ANSARI: Regarding the Red Cross and Red Crescent, they have been designated to receive the hostages, which I can't discuss the details of 
 
 how that will happen or where they will take them. But of course, as I said, there are parts of the operations room that is run from here in Doha.
 
And they will -- they will take the responsibility there. And we appreciate the crux all the work that the Red Cross is doing on this. And they are 
 
 going to taking a rescue with their own stuff in Gaza, but they will be an integral part of handling the hostages.
 
But as I said, I can't get into the details of that. And I also can't get into details of where they will be leaving or where they will be coming 
 
 out. I think a lot of things on the ground will affect this. The important thing is that we maintain a very clear line of communication with everybody 
 
 through the operation.
 
We'll make sure that the environment which the hostage transfer will happen, it will be a safe one that will guarantee the safety of all of them 
 
 to further to be reunited with their families.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)
 
AL-ANSARI: I don't have an update on this right now yes, anyone?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mediation and negotiations today. The truce will last for four days. The question is regarding the Palestinian prisoners. Is 
 
 there any synchronicity between the releases of both sides regarding the extension of the truce?
 
AL-ANSARI: We said that we will use this period of four days in order to have more information about the hostages. And there were about in Gaza, 
 
 which he may before the end of this period lead to another agreement to release more hostages.
 
But we said this is four days extendable dependent on the progress on the ground. The other question, please. Currently, I cannot give you formation 
 
 regarding this matter. However, it is expected that the exchange, it will be within a certain period of time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- from Doha News. We saw this morning the Israel arrested the Head of the Al-Shifa Hospital in Brazil. Was this mentioned in 
 
 today's discussions or are there, is it going to be mentioned in future discussions?
 
AL-ANSARI: I am not aware of this specific case, so I can't comment on it. Sorry.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). And also regarding the ceasefire -- in respect of a comprehensive ceasefire, is it going to be in Gaza.
 
AL-ANSARI: Regarding the ceasefire, it will be comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza, whether North or South regarding the aids will be coming immediately 
 
 as soon as this starts from the Rafah crossing and our brothers in Egypt are also taking care of this, and helping in this respect.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
And we hope that we will have as much help as possible and much aid as possible, all this aids, even their own, if they all come in one day, they 
 
 will not be sufficient for the needs of Gaza. But we will help to continue with this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you walk us through how we expect things to progress from 4 pm onwards? Is there a certain number of hostages who we 
 
 know will be part of that first to transfer, and then what will we, should we expect to see in the next 24 hours after that?
 
AL-ANSARI: So, the first release will be of 13 individuals of -- men and so many women and children. Some of them are elderly women, some of them are 
 
 women, and others, of course, are our children, as we stated. They will be released at approximately 4 pm, I must say, as you might expect, it's not 
 
 exact science to decide on the time itself; it wouldn't have a lot of moving parts on the ground, but approximately 4 pm.
 
And that will be happening every day within a specific window of time where the situation will be much safer for them to move about. They will be, as I 
 
 said, handed over to the Red Cross. And I won't get into the details of how they are dealt with after that. But the idea is to make the transfer as 
 
 safe as possible for all parties.
 
We have to remember, this is a work zone. And we need to make sure and this is why the discussions yesterday, you know went until early this morning to 
 
 make sure that the executive plan for the implementation of this agreement troubleshoots any possible safeguards against any possible problems within 
 
 the release itself.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So each, the releases will be happening at 4 pm each day.
 
AL-ANSARI: I only have the timing for the first day and the number for the first day and then every day will be. So the lists that were exchanged 
 
 today were actually the lists for the first day.
 
ANDERSON: Becky Anderson from CNN, what would constitute a break in this truce, a breaking of this truce? We're talking about a truce on the ground? 
 
 And as I understand it, in the air, so can you just describe what will be seen as a breakdown in that?
 
AL-ANSARI: So I don't think I can get into the technicalities, you know, tactically on the ground. Of course, this has to be handled by the, you 
 
 know, people who are there on the ground. But what I can tell you is that the agreement is about full secession of hostilities within the four days.
 
So obviously, any resumption of hostilities of any kind would be a breach. And I think it's very important that lines of communication remain open, so 
 
 that any possible breach, however it is defined, is communicated immediately to both sides. And there is a way to walk back from it and make 
 
 sure that we continue with it.
 
ANDERSON: Just ask a second question here. Can you just give us some sense about why we have seen delays? Has it been that Hamas or Israel has made 
 
 any further demands further to what was in the proposal that was that was agreed upon 24 hours ago? And are you expecting any further delays?
 
AL-ANSARI: We are hoping that we don't see any delays. And I think we've reached a point now where everything is in place, and we are ready to go on 
 
 the ground. So we are hopeful that as I told you by 7 am, tomorrow, everything will stop and we will have this at the beginning of the 
 
 humanitarian troops, I will pass.
 
When it comes to what delays, what were the reasons of the days, I can tell you that, that the discussions over the details and the schematics of how 
 
 this will happen were very difficult and very detailed. Because we wanted as I said to make sure that nothing would cause harm in the process of 
 
 getting the hostages out.
 
But also that the parameters of the agreement are agreed upon in the operational sense between both sides, and that took a lot of discussions 
 
 between both sides. But we are happy to report that the discussions happened in a very positive environment where both sides showed their 
 
 commitment to the agreement itself.
 
ANDERSON: Sorry if any further demands.
 
AL-ANSARI: I am not aware of any further demands that resulted in the delay, but as I told you the agreement is still as it stands and was agreed 
 
 upon from day one.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). Is Lebanon concerned concern with this truce and it's included in it and also in Yemen? The second question from 
 
 your experience, have you noticed any desire for a continued unsustainable truce?
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
AL-ANSARI: And respect of this agreement that only is only limited to the Gaza Strip and our direct mediation with our partners is Hamas and the 
 
 Israeli authorities. We have not expanded into other parties. This particularly concerned with Gaza and everything in Gaza.
 
Is there any desire from the two? We have seen a high level of commitment from the two parties. But what will happen after this, I don't know, our 
 
 aim is to reach this agreement. And on the hope that this would be an incentive to finish this war case, which everybody suffers from. And this 
 
 cannot be achieved except through building up on what we have achieved already. -- The Arabi TV.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). So it's easy to implement this agreement to stop the airstrikes. But this is in the north. But in the south where we 
 
 have the snipers, tanks and army, has there been any agreement into to stop this? And have you made -- have you defined the borders between these 
 
 people as to where they act, so that no one can cross the borders between one and the other.
 
AL-ANSARI: Regarding the spine aircraft with this, are these going to be in existence through the truce. In respect of North of Gaza, as you know, -- 
 
 we can't talk about any military movement because this is a sensitive topic. And there is agreement to have a comprehensive cease fire regarding 
 
 the reconnaissance aircrafts, the Israeli forces have agreed that there are certain times that the reconnaissance will not be implemented. But there is 
 
 a comprehensive ceasefire agreement.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- from AFP. In the process of making sure that the deal was that the logistics were in the schematics, as you described them were 
 
 completely in place for things to go forward today. Did you feel that things were put in place for as this scheme continues in the way that it's 
 
 been laid out for more releases over the following days? Are you still confident that that will be able to happen?
 
AL-ANSARI: We are hopeful, I don't know if I should say confident, but we are very hopeful. And as I said the commitment we have seen from both sides 
 
 leads us to be very positive to deal with this very positively. We are seeing a good level of commitment over the agreement itself.
 
The details hashed out in the executive plan of this agreement are very sound and robust. And we are hoping that these four days would work as a 
 
 proof of concept for further de-escalation measures, including extending these humanitarian tools but pause, but also getting to a more sustainable, 
 
 scalable truth in Gaza.
 
Of course, I have to remind everybody, and I'm sure that all of you know this uncovering other conflicts around the world; these are not set in 
 
 stone. They are not completely guaranteed anything can happen on the ground.
 
But we are confident that with the signatories of the agreement, and the international and regional partners who are working with us on this set, 
 
 everybody is highly committed for the success of this, this humanitarian pause. And it actually constitutes the first glimmer of light at the end of 
 
 the tunnel of this crisis.
 
And this is why we needed to succeed and we are hoping and working towards it, succeeding the operational -- run from here in Doha. The main purpose 
 
 of having this operation was to make sure that information is relayed in real time. And that any issue that comes up can be dealt with immediately 
 
 and then not allow it to escalate in a way that would have the -- would make the -- collapse. Steven.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. One of the complications of the past 24 hours seems to have been these lists of the small batch for each day. So you've 
 
 received about the list for the first batch. Do you expect there to be similar complications? And, you know, contentiousness around setting the 
 
 list each day. And is there a specific time that's been set each day for OK, to listening to be set for the next day at you know, whatever it is 5 
 
 pm the day before?
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
I didn't quite catch the response on the drone surveillance. We understand that Israeli drone surveillance won't be happening during a certain part of 
 
 the day to allow for the hostage handover to happen. Is that, is it justice -- really surveillance because we also understand that the Americans and 
 
 maybe some of the Europeans are drone -- area.
 
AL-ANSARI: OK, so regarding the lists that are going out every day, it's a day by day process; we'll be receiving those every day and handing them 
 
 over on the Israeli side to the Mossad. And they will handle you know, the list from their side also. So we can give it to the other side.
 
Whenever we have both lists confirmed, this is where we can begin, you know, with the process of getting people out, but there is an agreement on 
 
 the time intervals. So there will be a group each day released and that that, of course is, as I said, expanding the list coming in.
 
But obviously, as we have laid out the timeline and the operational plan, it should go you know, without necessarily any fault in, in getting this 
 
 through. Our teams are working day and night. I can tell you I've been liaising with the team as late as 2 am yesterday and as early as 4 am 
 
 today, they are working on this to make sure that everything happens as quickly as possible.
 
Obviously, it is in nobody's interest to delay the beginning of this agreement that the implementation of the humanitarian truce. Every moment 
 
 that goes by is translated into a life lost. And therefore it is very important for us to do it. But we need to do it the right way. We need to 
 
 do it in a way that would guarantee the safety of the hostages and the success of the truce itself and the sustainability of the truce. Yes, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: -- just confirm are one of those whose names are on the list alive?
 
AL-ANSARI: Those will be released; yes we have confirmation that those who will be released are all well and good. Andrew.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. Beyond this first group of 50 hostages or so that we expect to be released in this first four days, has Hamas provided 
 
 you a more comprehensive list of the hostages that they do have? Have they gathered more hostages than 50? How many hostages do we expect there are 
 
 alive in Gaza now?
 
AL-ANSARI: OK, Andrew, I can't comment in the numbers right now because we don't have information, verifiable information over the hostages and their 
 
 status at the moment. I can tell you that one of the things that we are looking to happen during the four days of pass is to collect more 
 
 information about the hostages.
 
Those who we have been told are not all with Hamas, and to get all the numbers to get all the information. That would help in a second wave that 
 
 we are hoping by the fourth day. We'd have an agreement in place to release more and more hostages. And thereby extend the pause in --
 
I forgot to answer the question -- on the drones. So I'll tell you there's a as you rightly mentioned, there will be a period of time where the skies 
 
 will be clear. And that would allow for the hostage relief to happen in a safe environment. As you might imagine, you know, in the first iteration of 
 
 this, when the mediation secured the release of two American ladies.
 
One of the main challenges was of course the sounds that are coming in you know, the drones flying over or whatever that might be mistook for an 
 
 attack at the time. So of course we need to make sure that the movement happens in a very safe environment. So it doesn't cause any problems with 
 
 the hostages.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)
 
AL-ANSARI: Yes, so clear skies.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)
 
AL-ANSARI: The Red Cross, they've been visiting Hamas, regarding the movement of people in North and South Gaza. This -- I've mentioned about 
 
 this before.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)
 
AL-ANSARI: There is the occupation brink let the aid and help it goes to the south of Gaza. Yes, all the details will come later. I don't have any 
 
 details at the moment. Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)
 
AL-ANSARI: -- from the Qatar News Agency. From the seventh of October, Qatar started communication with all parties of this conflict. And of 
 
 course in the last six weeks there has been lots of communication and negotiation with these parties.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
We have not had any rest. From that point it was continuous efforts. And I speak on behalf of my colleagues and at the top of the pyramid. But nobody 
 
 has actually stopped or spared any effort in order to reach this agreement from day one until today, we have gone through very difficult and very 
 
 serious and critical moments.
 
However, reaching disagreement does not mean that the work stopped. In fact, it work has started from now. And this guarantees peace. But of 
 
 course, we want to exploit -- this in order to create even further atmosphere in order to reach better agreement and extend this agreement.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We understand that Iran's Foreign Minister is going to pay a visit to Qatar. Could this be the moment for further talks? Where is 
 
 it going to be mainly about Gaza? Do you see the potential for more cooperation with Iran when it comes to the need to expand this into more of 
 
 an extended choose that could pave the way to a settlement between the Israelis and Hamas?
 
AL-ANSARI: We have been in constant contact with our entire region and international partners over this, including Iran; the uninformed Minister 
 
 has been in Doha two times already. And this will be his third visit to Doha. We have discussed with the Iranians the prospects of regional -- over 
 
 of this, this conflict.
 
And we have made sure that we relate to all our partners in the region. The complexities that will result from any regional spill over and the need for 
 
 us all to work together to make sure that this conflict is contained. And that we work together also to walk back from some of the left over into our 
 
 return to peace in the region. And therefore, we work with everybody, including the Iranians to make sure that these messages get across. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: So I just confirm again, the full list of 50 hostages, has that been handed over to you? And then you have the 13 names to be released 
 
 tomorrow. Or have you just got the list of 13 for Friday release?
 
AL-ANSARI: The lists of exchange today were of those who will be exchanged tomorrow, within the agreement. And every day will include lists of the 
 
 data.
 
ANDERSON: Because as I understood it, you were anticipating, as part of the agreement getting the full list of 50 hostages being held by Hamas.
 
AL-ANSARI: Yes, we will be getting more information over all of them. And those who will not who are not part of this deal within the course of the 
 
 four days. But right now the lists that are being exchanged with both sides are the rest of the day.
 
ANDERSON: And one other question to you if you don't mind. Benjamin Netanyahu was very keen to point out that the U.S. President had played a 
 
 significant part in upping the number of hostages who will be released and lowering the cost of those releases to the Israelis. Can you just comment 
 
 on the role that the U.S. President has played?
 
AL-ANSARI: Because I can't testify to what the Prime Minister has mentioned. What I can tell you is that we are working very closely with the 
 
 United States over this. And as you know, we had various delegations from the U.S. Administration come here last week, which was Brett McGurk.
 
And before that, of course, Secretary Blinken and we have been in closer contact. You know, President Biden has been calling on the His Highness the 
 
 Emir. And we had constant calls between both sides to make sure that we work together on this.
 
And we appreciate, of course, the work done by the United States to make sure that the deal comes to fruition. And we continue to work with the 
 
 United States over this. I can't speak of the details of how the, you know, the United States was formulated.
 
But I can tell you that of course with the communication that's taking place all across the board, the Americans were very instrumental especially 
 
 in working with Israel -- .
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). Has there been an agreement as to the quantity of the delivery and the shipments from Rafah to Gaza? How many 
 
 fuel trucks because these are very important to the hospital.
 
AL-ANSARI: Regarding the aid, we will basically answer this at the time. This information regarding this, we do not have it at the moment. Regarding 
 
 this, we do not have it at the moment.
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). Has the Iranian Foreign Minister arrived in Doha? Or have you discussed with Iran the northern frontier of Israel? This 
 
 is obviously going to be talked about, and will there be any mediation and disrespect?
 
AL-ANSARI: As I have mentioned before, Dr. Hossein Abdollahian (ph) the Iranian Foreign Minister will come to Doha on scheduled visit, as I have 
 
 explained, and there will be a meeting between the two parties. I do not, of course, have any details about this meeting. As Bryce, I said, all the 
 
 parties in the region, including -- they're trying to get guarantee so that the crisis does not extend.
 
And of course, the seriousness of the issue has been discussed. Dr. Majed just to confirm regarding the Palestinian prisoners that will be released, 
 
 will they have the freedom to go to their homes? Or do they have to go to certain areas and the mechanism of supervising this process?
 
Who's going to supervise this truce and the daily arrest against Palestinians? Will this stop or is this that the truce has not gone into 
 
 this? And what is the fate of these detainees?
 
The truce, as I said, and the agreement was only to do with the escalation in Gaza, the current escalation, and we hope that this truce would lead 
 
 into further discussions. But the scope of this agreement is only to deal with the Gaza Strip.
 
We do not have any information to confirm anything about children, women and children are only going to be released, and from the other side to from 
 
 Israel.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could you give us a sense of -- when it comes to you and the Egyptians mediating this deal? The way you would be monitoring this -- 
 
 setting up an operations room when you're looking at all the aspects, the military security and humanitarian of the deal, the moment you'd have to 
 
 step in to say, no, we have to put it this way.
 
AL-ANSARI: We of course, we are not on the ground, which is always a handicap for overseeing the deal itself. What is happening right now is 
 
 that the operations are going here in Doha has direct lines of communication where the political office here in Doha, Hamas and with the 
 
 Israeli side, and with the Red Cross.
 
And it's all happening in real time, where we are monitoring everything that happens. I think -- that might come in, of any breach and you talked 
 
 about the hostages, any additional information that we can relay between the three sides that we are working with, along with our partners in the 
 
 region, including Egypt and internationally, including the United States.
 
So we can make sure that we immediately jump in to continue our mediation work and to make sure that we troubleshoot any issues that might arise on 
 
 the ground. So the operations room is very instrumental. And working with those parties, I mentioned, it's very instrumental to make sure that, that 
 
 the deal goes through the way it was agreed upon. Yes, Stevens.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You said these 13 hostages would be released. How many hostages will be released tomorrow -- first?
 
AL-ANSARI: I'm not aware of that piece of information right now; we will come to you with it. But as I said, it's a reciprocal deal. So we're 
 
 expecting at least to happen. And this will be announced, you know, in the similar timeframe.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But that list has been --
 
AL-ANSARI: Yes, so the lists have been approved. They have been given to both sides. The Palestinians have the list of those who will be released 
 
 from Israeli prisons and the Israelis have the list. The Mossad has a list of the hostages to be released from -- for the first day.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not sure why the number is unclear.
 
AL-ANSARI: That's the information that was briefed upon. And with the current situation you know, we have to allow some leeway and not knowing 
 
 everything -- .
 
ANDERSON: -- ICRC information that Steven was asking about earlier on, two proofs of concept effectively, the release -- of two female prisoners. So 
 
 four prisoners have been released in two separate releases and the ICRC obviously work operationalized those releases. So I know that you can't 
 
 give us any detail on what's going to happen. You've said that twice now.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
But can we expect that the ICRC's involvement this time will be similar or the same as. And perhaps you can use whichever term you, you think best 
 
 expresses what's going to happen because we have seen this before. So is it going to be similar to the same as?
 
AL-ANSARI: I would assume that as long as it's happening within the same parameters, and in the same conflict, and within same situation that it 
 
 will, of course fall into the same mechanisms. As I said, they are working with us in the operations room in real time.
 
Their people on the ground will be ready to receive the hostages; I will have to stop at that. And that mentioned any details regarding how the 
 
 exchange is going to take place to maintain the success and the safety of the hostages.
 
ANDERSON: Can I just ask you, just on behalf of the people in the room here and journalists around the world? Access into Gaza is limited to a very few 
 
 working journalists at present. This is a humanitarian pause and the possibility of it being extended. I mean, has there been any conversation 
 
 about allowing for journalists to get in on the ground, you've just expressed that you're not on the ground.
 
And that's difficult, in and of itself in this humanitarian pause and affecting the operation of this, of this hostage release. So how about 
 
 journalists getting on the ground if you have any discussions?
 
AL-ANSARI: Well, I know that a lot of your respectable organization that tries to get people out of the moment and get them into safety, which is of 
 
 course something that we are all working towards through the mediation process. I'm not aware that the agreement includes any caveats about 
 
 getting journalists in.
 
We applaud all the coverage that all the brave journalists have been doing inside rather than those who gave up their lives. And we give our 
 
 condolences to them and to their families and to the organizations which they graceful, so many, so longer for time.
 
And the bravery of those who brought us the truth from the field is something that we should all be thankful for. And something that we agree 
 
 is in all instances a level of bravery that a lot of us would not have.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)
 
AL-ANSARI: This is you making this up, I can't comment on this. Don't know what's happening in Rafah. As I said before, now, we are talking about what 
 
 has been agreed upon the lists that of the people that will be released. Until now, I do not have any accurate details about what exactly is going 
 
 to happen.
 
What I can say, the agreement happened between the two parties and what will happen on the first day. This what the agreements covered. Thank you 
 
 very much and goodbye.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK, that wraps up the press conference there from the Qatari Foreign ministry Spokesperson, a comprehensive press conference. The most 
 
 important part of this is that we now have a day we have a time, and we have a number. So the truce begins at Friday 7 am Local Time.
 
So that's midnight Eastern Time. Then approximately his words, nine hours later, the first hostages will be released 4 pm Local, 9 am Eastern Time. 
 
 13 women and children will be released, that list, have names has also been given over to Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence Agency.
 
So it seems that they do know the names now of those that will be released. There are plenty more details to consider. Becky Anderson, of course, my 
 
 colleague was in that press conference pushing hard for more details. We couldn't get further announcements or details over how they will be 
 
 transferred those hostages over but the Red Cross will be involved.
 
Becky pushed again and asked whether or not the process upon which how they will be released will mirror what we've seen with the four hostages that 
 
 were released in the past. My understanding of that was that they went from Gaza, handed over to the Red Cross and then into Israel.
 
So we'll watch for more details on that. He said the critical aspect of this is the humanitarian aid. And hopefully that will be facilitated. He 
 
 wouldn't push or be pushed on the degree of fuel that will be released as a part of that. We know the number of hostages that will be released.
 
What we don't know is the number of Palestinians that will be released. But the list has been given out over to Hamas, he wouldn't again be pushed on 
 
 the numbers. But I guess that will become clear. The expectation is that will happen at the same time as the hostages will be released.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
So we're talking 4 pm Local Time, Friday 9 am Eastern. So that's the time to watch. Becky also pushed on what could potentially break this truce, 
 
 critically important question. He said that this agreement requires the full cessation of hostilities.
 
Any break to that, of course, would be a breach of this agreement. But he said communication lines will remain open to try and clear any concerns if 
 
 anything does happen during that time. Obviously, it's difficult for them to monitor the deal, but they will be doing it. They will have lines of 
 
 communication with everybody involved.
 
And they will hope to jump in at any point that they're required to carry out any form of mediation. But the bottom line here is the truce begins. 
 
 Friday 7 am Local Time, midnight Eastern Time. The hostages will be released 4 pm Local, 9 am Eastern. "Connect the World" begins after this 
 
 break.
