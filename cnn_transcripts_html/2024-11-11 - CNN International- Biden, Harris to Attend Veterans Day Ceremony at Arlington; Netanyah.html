THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[09:00:00]
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, these are live pictures from the White House where this hour President Joe Biden is hosting 
 
 Veterans and Members of the military to mark Veterans Day and preparing for a peaceful transfer of power to President-Elect Donald Trump. It is 09:00 
 
 a.m. in Washington, D.C., it is 06:00 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching "Connect the World".
 
Also coming up in the next couple of hours at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Donald Trump is at work assembling his future government. A short time ago, he 
 
 said he is nominating Elise Stefanik for the role of Ambassador to the United Nations. Then Ukraine says thousands of North Korean soldiers are 
 
 now in combat in Russia's Kursk Region. And as Trump vows to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, again, COP 29 kicks off in Baku.
 
And the stock market in New York opens about 30 minutes from now, and the indications are at least that stocks will have a decent start to the 
 
 trading day, extending the decent period sessions that these stock markets had on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week, of course, in the wake of 
 
 the Donald Trump victory. All right. Well, back there at 09:30 Eastern time.
 
Well, it's Veterans Day in the United States this hour, President Joe Biden, the First Lady, Jill Biden, are hosting Veterans and Members of the 
 
 Military at the White House. Now, later this week, Mr. Biden will meet Donald Trump there to discuss the transition of power. No such meeting 
 
 happened after Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to accept the results. 
 
So, a lot of revolving doors effectively over the next, what two and a half months. Arlette Saenz at the White House for us this hour. And it is a very 
 
 different atmosphere, and it seems a very different process this time. Could this meeting, though be all could, given the circumstances?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It could be Becky, but for President Biden his part, this meeting that he's planning to have with 
 
 President-Elect Donald Trump is really a key step in a symbolic part of his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.
 
As you mentioned Trump when he was President in 2020 and lost to Biden in that election, he completely shunned this tradition, never conceding the 
 
 election or inviting Biden here for a meeting at the White House. Biden is handling things a bit differently.
 
And when these two men, who were once former competitors just in this past election as well, when Biden was still running, when they meet, it will 
 
 give them a chance to talk about some of the most pressing domestic and foreign policy issues at play in the world right now. 
 
One issue of important significance to President Biden is the war in Ukraine. President Biden is expected, in this meeting and in the coming 
 
 weeks, really, to make the case to the American public and the Trump transition team that aid for Ukraine should continue beyond his presidency.
 
Biden has already directed his team to surge as much of the approved aid and weaponry directly to Ukraine, so they have this before he leaves office 
 
 at a time when Donald Trump has really cast doubt about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine going forward.
 
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan yesterday said that one of the arguments that President Biden plans to make during this transition period 
 
 is that not furthering aid for Ukraine would essentially lead to instability, not just in Europe, but could also lead to instability for 
 
 Asian eye allies. So that is an issue that President Biden is hoping to try to exert some influence with Trump on, though it's unclear whether Trump 
 
 will listen.
 
Now, President Biden, a bit later this week, is also set to depart for two foreign policy summits down in South America, the Economic Summit in Peru, 
 
 followed by the G20 Summit in Brazil. And that will put him in front of the many world leaders who are grappling with what a Trump Presidency will look 
 
 like. 
 
But for today's focus, President Biden is focused on Veterans Day here in America, as you mentioned just this hour, the President and First Lady are 
 
 hosting right now veterans, their families, survivors, for a breakfast at the White House. Then they will be traveling to Arlington National 
 
 Cemetery, where President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. 
 
This is the centennial anniversary since that portion of the cemetery was created. President Biden is then slated to give remarks. It's also notable, 
 
 this will be Harris's first public appearance since she gave that concession speech last Wednesday. She's not expected to speak, but she will 
 
 be on hand with Biden there as they celebrate this Veterans Day. 
 
ANDERSON: What is she expected to do? Indeed, what is Joe Biden expected to do after they leave the White House?
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
SAENZ: I think a lot of that is still coming together. I think Biden will return to his beloved Delaware, and they've said that he plans to stay 
 
 involved where he can. In the past, he had some initiatives at the University of Delaware that was focused on domestic policy. He also had 
 
 another initiative set up at the University of Pennsylvania focused on foreign policy. 
 
So those are all realms where Biden could play down the road. For Vice President Kamala Harris's part, it's really unknown what she will do, 
 
 likely returning to California, but it's unclear if she might try to position herself down the road to seek office once again. These are all 
 
 discussions that are playing out over the coming weeks as they prepare for this transition period, not just here at the White House, but also their 
 
 own transition out of public service as well.
 
ANDERSON: Absolutely, it's good to have you Arlette, thank you very much indeed. Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Well ahead of his return 
 
 there, Donald Trump is moving to address what he calls America's quote, migrant invasion. The President-Elect announcing Tom Homan will oversee all 
 
 U.S. borders.
 
Now Homan served as Acting Director of what is known as Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE in the previous Trump Administration. And Trump 
 
 today nominating New York Representative Elise Stefanik as to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. 
 
Meantime, the vetting for key positions goes on at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, with Elon Musk apparently involved in many of the discussions. Musk 
 
 has essentially moved into Mar-a-Lago during the transition period. Well, Steve Contorno connecting us from St. Petersburg in Florida. Let's start 
 
 with these latest appointments, if we can, and what do you make of the names that have been announced?
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Yes, Stefanik is going to be or is being nominated to be the U.N. Ambassador. It's an interesting role, given that 
 
 one of Trump's previous U.N. Ambassadors was Nikki Haley, someone who became, ultimately his Republican rival for the GOP nomination this go 
 
 around, and is not part of his cabinet, he has said going forward.
 
And Stefanik is someone who has grown increasingly close to Trump over the years, even though she had originally sort of emerged as a moderate 
 
 Republican, ultimately became one of his strongest MAGA supporters in Congress, and even was on the short list to be his running mate, though, 
 
 obviously, she ultimately was not the pick. 
 
And then Tom Homan is going to be Donald Trump's Border Czar, which is sort of an unofficial role. It won't have to go through any sort of Senate 
 
 confirmation process. However, he has been very influential in Trump's immigration policies over the years, serving as his ICE Director during the 
 
 first term of in Congress.
 
And he has been a person who has been advising him on immigration policies all throughout his campaign for re-election. Take a listen to what Homan 
 
 had to say just now on Fox News about how he foresees his enforcement mechanisms to take to address the migrant issue in the country.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. IMMIGRATION &amp; CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Under President Trump, he was suing the sanctuary cities. DOJ sue sanctuary 
 
 cities, pulling federal funds, of course, day one, when Joe Biden came in office, he stopped that lawsuit. So that's be put back in place. 
 
And look, I've seen -- I've seen these, some of these Democratic Governors say they're going to stand in the way. They're going -- they're going to 
 
 make it hard for us. Well, I know a suggestion, if you're not going to help us, get the hell out of the way, but we're going to do it. So, if we can't 
 
 get assistance from New York City, and I may have -- you know we may have to double the number of reasons we send in New York City, because we're 
 
 going to do the job. We're going to do the job without you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CONTORNO: Now Homan and others, have clarified that the focus for Trump, at least immediately, will be on deporting those who have criminal 
 
 backgrounds. However, they have also said that there ultimately is no protections that they have planned for people who have come here and have 
 
 lived life criminal, criminally free for decades.
 
Including the children of undocumented individuals who were brought here and may have grown up as essentially U.S. citizens or U.S. residents 
 
 without having citizenship. So those individuals could potentially be at risk as well, even if they have not committed any crimes.
 
ANDERSON: Steve, Elon Musk apparently at Trump's side throughout this process. What is his role? Is it clear at this point?
 
CONTORNO: It's not clear. And we had known going into this that Elon would have some sort of role, helping with cutting spending. That is something 
 
 that both Trump and Elon focused on in the campaigns as sort of a role that he could help out with in a Trump Administration. 
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
But his influence so far has been far more expansive. He was on a phone call with Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. He has been advising the 
 
 former president and now President-Elect, Donald Trump on some of his appointment options, weighing in on who he thinks should get certain jobs. 
 
He has also turned X from being a pro Trump election platform to a pro Trump administration platform, and has been pushing a lot of Trump's early 
 
 movements and trying to rally people around them, and that includes Trump's concerns about how quickly he can get a new cabinet put in place.
 
And Elon has echoed Trump's suggestions that whoever is the new Senate Majority Leader going forward, and there's a three way race for that going 
 
 on right now in the U.S., that that person should do whatever they can to speed up the appointments and confirmation of Trump's nominees, even if 
 
 that means going -- taking the entire body into recess so that Trump can make appointments without having to go through a vote, which is a sort of 
 
 contentious and somewhat problematic approach to appointments that has not been done at that kind of level in the past.
 
ANDERSON: Got it Steve, good to have you. Thank you, sir. Steve Contorno in the house. Well, Israel's Prime Minister says he has spoken with Trump 
 
 several times in recent days. Benjamin Netanyahu says they quote see eye to eye on Iran. 
 
Well, in remarks to his cabinet and confirmed to CNN, Mr. Netanyahu, for the first time, acknowledged that Israel was behind the deadly operation to 
 
 detonate pagers used by Hezbollah. Well, this comes as fresh Israeli strikes killed more than dozens more people in Gaza and in Lebanon over the 
 
 weekend. 
 
Let's get you to Jeremy Diamond, who is in Tel Aviv. Let's deal further into these comments by Benjamin Netanyahu. What can we take from this about 
 
 U.S. Israeli relations, if anything, at this point, especially their shared views on Iran, although we haven't -- we haven't yet had Donald Trump's 
 
 position very specifically on Iran in his next term. What do you make of what we're hearing?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, three conversations between Netanyahu and Trump in just the last several days is a really high 
 
 number, and it speaks, of course, to what we anticipated with a likely second Trump term, and that is more closeness between the United States and 
 
 Israel at a critical time, of course, as Israel continues to pursue this war in Gaza, as well as a war in Lebanon against Hezbollah. 
 
Now it is important to note that we have only heard Netanyahu's side of this conversation so far. We haven't heard Trump's perspective on the call, 
 
 but Netanyahu called it a very good and very important conversations. And he also said that the U.S. -- that he and Trump, quote, see eye to eye on 
 
 the Iranian threat in all its aspects, and with regard to the danger that he said that threat represents. 
 
Now we know, of course, that if you look at the first term that Donald Trump had in the White House, his administration hewed very closely to 
 
 Israel when they ultimately released a peace plan for the region, it basically conceded to nearly every single Israeli demand, even as it did 
 
 offer the kind of fig leaf of proposing a future Palestinian state.
 
But it's clear that this is an administration that in the past and likely in the future, will he very closely to Israel's positions, will have a very 
 
 close public cooperation in a way that will certainly mark a departure, to a certain extent, from the Biden Administration, which has shown very 
 
 strong support, of course, for Israel and commitment to Israel's security.
 
But at the same time, has also been willing to criticize Israel publicly, and that does not appear to be a role that Donald Trump and his 
 
 administration are likely to play. I do think it's important to note, however, that there will be a lot that can happen between now and 
 
 Inauguration Day. 
 
And so, the question is really, how many of these issues that we see right now will still be outstanding when Donald Trump comes into office. We know 
 
 that there are furious efforts currently underway to try and reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Could that happen before Trump 
 
 comes into office?
 
What will Gaza look like? What will Israel's war in Gaza look like by the time Trump comes into office? And a host of other issues, of course, 
 
 including the Biden Administration, which this week is supposed to make a determination of whether or not Israel has done enough to increase the flow 
 
 of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and whether or not they will actually apply any of those consequences regarding U.S. arms sales to Israel in the 
 
 meantime.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
ANDERSON: Jeremy Diamond in the house and more on this next hour. Jeremy, thank you. Well, U.S. official says that Russia is readying tens of 
 
 thousands of troops, including some from North Korea, to assault, to launch an assault on Ukrainian forces in the coming days. Now this is an attempt 
 
 to push Ukraine out of Russia's Kursk Region. Ukraine has held ground there, of course, since August, although that incursion has since stalled.
 
Now this comes as both Russia and Ukraine exchange record numbers of drone strikes over the weekend. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow for us this 
 
 hour. These North Korean troops have we talking about here? And how well trained are they? What do we know about the scope and capacity of this, of 
 
 these troops?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi here, Becky. Well, according to the source that spoke to CNN with the U.S. within the 
 
 U.S. government, apparently, we're talking about more than 10,000 North Korean troops that appear to be on the ground there in the Kursk Region. 
 
 They're speaking of about 11,000 of these troops.
 
The Ukrainians have also commented on this matter as well. They also acknowledge that there's a great number, a large number, of Ukraine -- of 
 
 North Koreans who are on the ground there, fighting on the side of the Russian military, and that there have already been skirmishes and battles 
 
 between North Koreans and Ukrainian forces there, and that the Ukrainians have put it that there have been casualties. 
 
Now the exact number, no one really knows that. The Russians so far have not commented on exact numbers, but it's been quite interesting. Vladimir 
 
 Putin has been asked about this, or the Kremlin has been asked about this. They did not deny that there were North Korean troops on the ground 
 
 fighting on the side of Russia. 
 
And of course, one of the things that Vladimir Putin has said is that relations between North Korea and Russia are very good at the moment and 
 
 continue to improve. So certainly, they aren't denying that North Korean forces are on the ground. The Russians also Becky not denying that 
 
 obviously, they want to take back the parts of the Kursk region that are currently in the hands of the Ukrainians. 
 
However, the Russians have also said that for them, taking back this Kursk region is not necessarily their main priority. Their main priority of right 
 
 now, of course, right now is the offensive that they're conducting in the Northeast of Ukraine, where the Russians have been able to gain a good 
 
 amount of ground over the past couple of months, and Ukrainians have somewhat been on the back foot.
 
At the same time of course, the Ukrainians do hold that area in curse. They say they want to continue to hold on to that or they don't want to occupy 
 
 it forever. They see it as a possible bargaining chip, if and when possible, negotiations come around for them to possibly exchange this area 
 
 for areas of Ukraine that are currently occupied by Russia, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Now there's a lot of possibles in there, Fred, isn't there? Is it clear, as the dust settles, and what was this overwhelming victory by 
 
 Donald Trump? Is it clear yet for people there on the ground in Russia and in Ukraine, what his policy will look like going forward?
 
PLEITGEN: Well, I think folks in Ukraine are quite concerned that Ukraine could be forced into a de facto surrender, and that possibly military aid 
 
 to Ukraine could be cut off. We of course know that there was this phone call between Donald Trump, where he also put Elon Musk on speaker phone, 
 
 and the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
 
But it doesn't seem as though to the Ukrainians. It's clear yet what exactly the strategy is, or the plan is for the incoming Trump 
 
 Administration. Here in Russia, I can tell you, I've actually just come back from the streets of Moscow and asked people about this. There does 
 
 seem to be a lot of optimism about the incoming Trump Administration. There are a lot of people who view Donald Trump very positively. 
 
Obviously, believe that he's positive -- positively inclined towards Russia, and that relations between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have 
 
 been very good in the past. And of course, Vladimir Putin, last Thursday, came out and called Donald Trump courageous, obviously, for the way that he 
 
 reacted after that assassination attempt against him, but also saying that he believes some of the ideas that Donald Trump has, especially trying to 
 
 end the war in Ukraine, are worth listening to, as Vladimir Putin put it. 
 
So, from the Russian perspective, there does seem to be a good deal of optimism about the incoming Trump Administration. On the from the Ukrainian 
 
 perspective, certainly a lot of uncertainty, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, sir. Thank you. Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow for you this hour. Well, as the U.N. kicks off its Annual Climate Summit, the 
 
 warnings could not be starker, but fears loom large about what the U.S. will do or likely not do in the coming year? More on that after this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CELESTE SAULO, SECRETARY GENERAL, WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION: There is still hope for 1.5 and we should keep along those lines, because if we 
 
 move our mark into two, the impacts will be huge.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, a hope, but also pleas for urgency as the U.N.'s Climate Summit opens in Azerbaijan today. The World Meteorological Association says 
 
 or organization says the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius is in peril. Europe's Climate Agency says we've already hit that 
 
 mark. 
 
The Head of the U.N.'s Climate Body putting it this way, although temperatures are rising, the world must work together to claw them back by 
 
 making good on the promises of the Paris Agreement. One major question hanging over COP 29 how will the fight against climate change look with 
 
 Donald Trump back at the White House? 
 
Will Trump pulled out of the -- pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement during his first term, and he has pledged to withdraw again. That's causing 
 
 some anxiety at COP 29. Experts saying this is not the time for the world's largest economy and its second largest emitter of greenhouse gasses to take 
 
 itself out of the equation. Well, the U.N. Children's Agency is spotlighting the harmful effects of climate change on kids. 
 
Joining me now from COP 29 in Baku is UNICEF's Executive Director, Catherine Russell. It's good to have you. Your agency calling for a very 
 
 specific response at this summit the impact of climate change on children. What kind of action would you like to see, and how do you expect the U.S. 
 
 under a Donald Trump will contribute?
 
CATHERINE RUSSELL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNICEF: Well, thank you, Becky. And really, it's the important piece of work that UNICEF is doing here is 
 
 really to make sure that people understand two things about climate in their effect --- the effect on children. 
 
One is that children are impacted directly in a different way from adults. And this is something that a lot of people, even delegates here, don't 
 
 know. And I can give you a couple of examples. One is, you know, they're more susceptible to heat. They're more susceptible to air pollution because 
 
 their bodies are smaller, they're not able to process these things as easily. 
 
They're also more likely to have preterm birth because of the impact of especially air pollution and heat. So, we're making the point here that 
 
 this impacts children directly. It also impacts all the services that children rely on, and children are so dependent on services, so education, 
 
 health care, and we've seen it just recently in Lahore, Pakistan, where schools are closed. 
 
It's because of such high heat, rain, it is all these things that make it very challenging for children. So, our job here is to say to the countries 
 
 and the delegates, there is a special challenge that children face, and we need to make sure that children are at the center of these responses.
 
And that hasn't been the case up till now, and I think we're making some progress. We are getting countries to understand that, and that goes across 
 
 all political sort of divisions and differences, really, to put children at the center of it.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. And you've clearly laid out the impact of climate crisis on children, and that is the job of the agency to ensure the security and 
 
 well-being of kids around the world. 
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
So, you must be concerned surely, about the mood there, where you are in Baku, about the hope of progress going forward on climate, particularly if 
 
 the world's second largest emitter, the United States, is no longer part of what has been this sort of collective agreement about what to do.
 
RUSSELL: Well, you know, the good thing about my work is that you have to be optimistic and you have to be persistent. And I think, honestly, Becky 
 
 when people understand the impact on children, it does change the discussion a little bit. You know, it's not just like changing the 
 
 percentage of carbon and the carbon numbers and all the rest of it. 
 
It's really saying, understand what this is doing to the children of the world in all countries, all countries. And I think when we make that 
 
 argument, people do listen to it. And it really does just really cross all barriers of countries politics. And I'm optimistic that if we continue to 
 
 make that argument, if we show people what is happening to children, people care about that.
 
And I'm hoping that that will help motivate people to do what we're asking, which is to spend more money on children, because right now, only about 2.4 
 
 percent of global spending on pollution and climate has anything to do with children, and that's way too low when you look at the special impact it has 
 
 on children.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. Catherine, while I've got you, I do want to talk about Gaza. UNICEF, sounding the alarm again on a number of fronts, including 
 
 displacement and famine. We know that the humanitarian situation is really worse than catastrophic in some areas, particularly in the north, what are 
 
 you hoping to see with a new incoming U.S. Administration?
 
RUSSELL: You know, I think we -- you and I talked after I visited Gaza last November. And I have to say that the conditions just continue to get worse 
 
 and worse and worse, and it's really devastating for children. I -- you know I've described this as a hellscape, and that really is what it looks 
 
 like at this point. 
 
Almost everything is destroyed. Almost every school is destroyed. Children are displaced. I don't really know how much worse it can get honestly. It 
 
 is so terrible for children there, and I think -- you know we're hoping, and we've been really demanding and pleading that the violence stops and 
 
 that we can move into the next phase, which is trying to help the families and the children there get some sense of normalcy, eventually, get back to 
 
 life, get back to school. 
 
No children are in school. I mean, it's just, you're right. You can't even find the words to describe it anymore. It's just so terrible for children. 
 
 And I'm hopeful that we will move into a new phase soon and stop that fighting, stop the violence, and move into a situation where we can really 
 
 get to these populations, particularly, as you said, in the north. We have almost no access in the north right now, we're worried about famine taking 
 
 hold. It's honestly such a horrific situation.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. And that would be a day after era that we -- that you are sort of laying out there. What does that look like? What the impact will be 
 
 on kids? What sort of support will be provided for kids in those plans? Obviously, hugely important to you and everybody watching this show, 
 
 wherever they are watching around the world. 
 
It's always good to have you. Catherine Russell, thank you so much the Head of UNICEF talking to us today, live from Baku. As Catherine rightly pointed 
 
 out, we have been talking to her agency continually throughout the conflict in Gaza. Thank you. We will be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. It is just after half past six here. You're watching "Connect the World" and we are taking a 
 
 look at the markets for you, which have just opened in New York just after 09:30 of course. And this is the story, and these markets were looking to 
 
 open in relatively good shape. 
 
And it certainly looks at the futures markets were bang on with their indications today, extending that sort of winning streak that these markets 
 
 started on or have been on since the spectacular victory by Donald Trump on Tuesday, of course, or Wednesday, when we got the result, these markets, 
 
 certainly the tech stocks, have done taken a real lift off the back of the results suggestions.
 
Of course, that not just Elon Musk but other tech giants will benefit from a new Trump Administration, although it is not clear how, at this point? 
 
 More on that, as we find out more on policy, some anxious Americans are apparently using their election stress with a little retail therapy doom 
 
 spending, as it's called, is on the rise. 
 
It's how many of us try to cope when anxiety bubbles up. Everything is like politics, the economy of the future generally. But experts say treating 
 
 yourself now may not be great for your long-term financial health. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich joins us now from New York. Doom Spending, this is an 
 
 actual term. What signs are there that people are Doom spending, and how does that election factor in Vanessa?
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this is not a new trend, but of course, it's taken off on social media, and it's become 
 
 a term that's trending now. And essentially, as you mentioned, it's when people are feeling doom and gloom about something. Maybe it's the economy. 
 
They feel like they're never going to be able to afford that house, so instead, they spend on something a little bit smaller a pair of shoes, or 
 
 they don't feel great about the results of the recent presidential election here in the U.S. We heard anecdotally from some people who were doing a 
 
 little bit of shopping leading up to the election just to take the edge off emotionally. 
 
Or there could be something happening in their personal life and they want to distract they feel out of control. Spending is control. It's that 
 
 dopamine hit that people get when they spend to take their mind off of things that are going on. The only problem is, is if you do that regularly, 
 
 you could be putting some of that spending on credit cards.
 
And about 50 percent of Americans report that they're carrying some sort of debt on credit cards, and the U.S. has about a trillion dollars of debt on 
 
 credit cards right now, and that is a record. So, it's really about trying to understand whether or not you're tipping the scales. Can you afford Doom 
 
 Spending in your budget? Or is this something that's going to completely destroy your budget, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Interesting. Thank you, Vanessa. Vanessa Yurkevich with that report. Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on 
 
 our radar right now. And Japan's Prime Minister has survived a critical parliamentary vote to stay on as Leader. Shigeru Ishiba came into office 
 
 just last month, you'll remember, and called a snap election. The move backfired at a scandal ridden coalition lost its majority for the first 
 
 time in more than a decade.
 
Haitian President -- Prime Minister Garry Conille has been removed by the country's transitional Presidential Council less than year after he took 
 
 office. He will be replaced by Businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aime.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
Haiti's previous Prime Minister Ariel Henri, stepped down earlier this year, and amid spiralling gang violence which has persisted since his 
 
 resignation. And Keir Starmer is the first British Prime Minister to attend Armistice Day Commemorations in Paris since World War II. Mr. Starmer 
 
 joined French and British veterans alongside President Emmanuel Macron to one of those who died in World War I, as well as veterans of the more 
 
 recent conflict. Still ahead, thousands of police deploy in Paris ahead of a tense football match between Israel and France. Details on that after

ANDERSON: Well, Israel is advising its citizens against attending sports and cultural events abroad. The move comes days after Israeli football fans 
 
 were assaulted by gangs in Amsterdam. Social media video shows the Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slurs and praising Israeli military attacks in 
 
 Gaza. Well, meanwhile, authorities in Paris will deploy thousands of police to monitor Thursday's football match between France and Israel. CNN's 
 
 Melissa Bell is in Paris with more, Melissa?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Becky, this had been this fixture between the France side and the Israel side on Thursday already one that was likely 
 
 to attract tension, but of course, all the more so after the events in Amsterdam that you speak of last week, where we saw the tension rise on the 
 
 Wednesday as the Maccabee Tel Aviv fans arrived, shouting those anti-Arab slurs. 
 
And then, of course, we heard saw on the Thursday what followed. We've been hearing more details from the Mayor of Amsterdam about an investigation 
 
 that's been launched about the events of Thursday night when Israeli fans were hunted down in hit and run attacks. And what the Mayor of Amsterdam 
 
 has been saying is that there do appear to have been WhatsApp groups dedicated to hunting down Jews speaking to that anti-Semitic quality of the 
 
 attacks on Thursday night. 
 
It is, of course, in that context that French authorities are looking to Thursday's match their fear that now that the events of Amsterdam have 
 
 shown how tense these football fixtures can be, that they become lightning rods for sentiments on all sides to be expressed and with the violence that 
 
 we saw in the Dutch capital.
 
So, French authorities taking no chances Becky, there will be 4000 policemen and women on the streets of Paris, and specifically around the 
 
 state defense, making sure that people are searched, frisked before they get into the perimeter. But many concerns about whether this match should 
 
 be allowed to take place at all. The French Interior Minister announced early on, just after the attacks in Amsterdam, that it would take place and 
 
 that there was no question of bowing down to anti-Semitism Becky.

ANDERSON: It's good to have you. Thank you very much indeed. Melissa Bell in Paris. Amnesty International was called on world football's governing 
 
 body FIFA to hold Saudi Arabia's bid to host the 2034 World Cup unless major human rights reforms are announced. Saudi Arabia the only nation 
 
 bidding for the 2034 event. 
 
Morocco, Portugal and Spain are set to jointly host the 2030 tournament Amnesty, though wants that bid also to be conditional until they develop a 
 
 more credible human rights strategy, and Amanda Davies will have more on that after this.
