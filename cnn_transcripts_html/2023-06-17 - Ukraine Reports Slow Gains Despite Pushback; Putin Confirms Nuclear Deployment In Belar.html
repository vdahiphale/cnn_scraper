LAILA HARRAK, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak.
 
A group of African leaders headed to Russia to pitch a plan to end the war in Ukraine. The latest on their call for peace, and why they're making the trip?
 
The Special Counsel prosecuting former U.S. President Donald Trump in Miami and Trump's attorneys have agreed to rules to protect sensitive information in the case. Who can see what evidence and what they can and cannot do with it.
 
And a Pennsylvania jury finds the man who killed 11 people inside a synagogue guilty on all charges. He could face the death penalty.

HARRAK: Ukraine says its forces sometimes have to fight for every meter as they make slow headway in their offensive.
 
While officials say, Ukrainian troops continue their advanced around Bakhmut without giving details, in the south, they say Russian troops have been pushed back up to one kilometer. But the Ukrainian offensive has been slowed by airstrikes, artillery, and a maze of defensive fortifications.
 
Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin is denying that the offensive has made any progress. But as Fred Pleitgen finds out, Ukraine's gains are small but real.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Ukraine's army continuing to take the fight to the Russians on the southern front. This video shows the 128 territorial defense battalion, clearing trenches after ousting Vladimir Putin's army, the unit says.
 
One of the soldiers, nicknamed the Octopus, telling me, the fighting remains fierce.
 
We're currently launching an assault, he says. Our frontline is moving forward. We've already advanced a lot more than two kilometers. So, now, we're only moving forward.
 
Even after returning from the front line, the troops continue to train, assaulting enemy positions so important for Ukraine's ongoing major counteroffensive.
 
PLEITGEN: The guys here say that the battles that they've had with the Russians have been extremely tough. They've had to fight for every yard, and yet they are confident, they say, that they can make this counteroffensive a success.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Troops we spoke to say the biggest threat to them is Russian air power.
 
This video released by the Russian Defense Ministry purporting to show a Russian attack helicopter hitting a Ukrainian armored vehicle. The 128th's deputy commander acknowledges choppers, planes, and drones are making his forces advance tougher.
 
They work continuously, he says, all day long, either with helicopters or with planes. It's hard to advance like that, but we retake territory. We do not allow them to hit the columns.
 
And the unit says they have managed to capture not only territory, but also hardware from the Russian, including this infantry fighting vehicle.
 
Mechanics now fixing it up to use against the Russians. An angry Russian president complaining about Kyiv's offensive and claiming that Russia is beating back Ukraine's forces.
 
They've suffered large losses, Vladimir Putin says, 10 times more than the Russian army, and that is a fact.
 
The Ukrainians do acknowledge some losses, but also say they've taken out a lot of Russian assets. And these troops vowed to press on and take more vehicles from Moscow's troops as they advance.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Southeastern, Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Well, Russia's president says he now has nuclear weapons on standby in Belarus. And that's where Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago.
 
Speaking Friday, Mr. Putin boasted about the number of nukes Russia has. But some choice words for NATO.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): We have more of these weapons, the NATO countries do. They know that. And they keep telling us to start negotiations on reductions. Well, you know what, they can shove it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, Putin says there is a serious danger of NATO being drawn further into the war by supplying military weaponry to Ukraine. And he says more nuclear weapons will be sent to Belarus throughout the summer, as a warning to the west about supporting Ukraine.
 
For more, Nada Bashir, joins us now live from London. A very combative sounding Putin, Nada, with a warning for the West.
 <br>[03:05:01]
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: Yes, he was certainly combative in his tone, Laila. Though, he was clear in his messaging, that line that we have often heard from President Putin throughout his invasion of Ukraine that for the Kremlin, from Moscow's perspective, this is about containment. This is about Russian state security.
 
Now, as you mentioned that this is only the first batch of tactical nuclear warheads to be deployed to Belarus, of course, a key backer of President Putin throughout his invasion of Ukraine.
 
And that full transfer of nuclear tactical weapons to be deployed to Belarus is anticipated to be completed by the end of the summit. We placed it on standby there as the war rages on.
 
President Putin, once again, reiterating that for Moscow, this is about containment. This is a move that has been designed, developed to guarantee Russia state security in his words. Take listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PUTIN: The use of nuclear weapons undoubtedly is theoretically possible for Russia. For Russia, it is possible if there is a threat to our territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty to the existence of the Russian state.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: Now, at this stage, the U.S. government says it is closely monitoring the situation when it comes to the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus persist.
 
No indication that the Kremlin has any plans to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. No reason for the U.S. to adjust its own nuclear posture at this stage.
 
But, of course, this has raised alarm bells within Ukraine and amongst its NATO allies. We've heard from Ukraine's own ambassador to the United Kingdom, warning that the West should be taking this move very, very seriously.
 
And as you mentioned there, President Putin had his own warning for the West, focusing on the NATO alliance, warning that they could be drawn further and deeper into this conflict through their supply of weapons to Ukraine.
 
Of course, noting that Russia has a larger stockpile of tactical nuclear warheads than the NATO alliance. A reminder or a warning, perhaps, as Ukraine's counter offensive against Ukraine continues. Laila?
 
HARRAK: Nada Bashir, reporting. Thank you very much.
 
A group of African leaders, meanwhile, is expected in St. Petersburg in the coming hours for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Their goal? To pitch their peace plan for Russia and Ukraine, a day after doing the same with President Zelenskyy and Kyiv.
 
While they were there, Russia conducted what the Ukraine called a massive and coordinated airstrike on the Capitol.
 
Still, the African leaders called for negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv. But Mr. Zelenskyy made it clear, that's a non-starter for now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Today, as I said many times, making it very clear that to allow any negotiations with the Russia now while the occupier is on our land is to freeze the war, to freeze everything, pain, and suffering.

HARRAK: Joining me now, Gyude Moore, is a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. He also served as Liberia's Minister of Public Works from 2014 to 2018.
 
A very good day, sir. How was Africa affected by the war in Ukraine?
 
GYUDE MOORE, SENIOR POLICY FELLOW, CENTER FOR GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT: Yes. It's great being with you. Thanks for having me. In a lot of ways. So, the continent imports about 100 million metric tons of cereal annually. Most of that is supplied by Russia and Ukraine.
 
And so, food inflation has affected the continent significantly. The continent also imposed a significant amount of fertilizer from the two countries that's also affected in agriculture and food security on the continent.
 
So, a fuel inflation, food inflation has affected Africa disproportionately compared to other regions. So, there's been direct impact on the continent from the conflict.
 
HARRAK: How would you describe the kind of influence or leverage these countries might have when it comes to Russia's war in Ukraine?
 
MOORE: So, first is that you remember, the Russian foreign minister made his trip around Africa, where he attempted to use a significant number of the countries on the continent to provide some sort of war against western isolation. So, that's one, one point for leverage.
 
Secondly, the South Africans are a part of this delegation, and they've gotten into trouble with the western partners on their stance on Ukraine.
 
The idea here is that because of that they've lost some goodwill and leverage with Russia. So, the hope is that because of the position that African countries have taken, about half of the countries on the continent have not supported resolutions to condemn Russian in action gives them some sort of leverage with their Russian counterparts.
 
HARRAK: South Africa leads this peace mission. How would you characterize its relationship to Russia? I mean, you spoke to it a little bit. And what do you make of criticism levelled at it for, you know, that it's difficult to see how President Ramaphosa's government is objective considering its proximity to the Kremlin?
 <br>[03:10:03]
 
MOORE: I mean, the difficulty here is the position of the ANC-led government is of Africa, is historical. But ANC has historically been independent, and even on the -- on the African continent with conflicts that are closer to home, they've maintained the same position.
 
And so, throughout this entire process, they've maintained that they are neutral. Now, obviously, their counterparts in the United States and parts of Europe do not leave that -- 
 
HARRAK: The African peace mission, which will meet Putin next and South African president will have, you know, quite strikingly a bilateral meeting with the Russian leader, so alone.
 
Will he try and dissuade the Russian leader from attending the BRICS summit in person, because it's putting South Africa in a very difficult position?
 
MOORE: I imagine that. So, you know, that South Africa is also reached out to China and to see if the Chinese will hosted the meeting.
 
So, but I'd imagine that he would probably sue for that, that the Russian leader doesn't personally come like, appears virtually. Although, the Russians have indicated that they still want to appear in person.
 
But I think that there's a list of demands, as they're calling them confidence building measures. So, one of the things they're asking for is withdrawal for Russian troops, the removal of tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus, but also sanctions relief for Russia and the suspension of ICC sanctions or against the Putin.
 
So, I'm not sure if any of these are these measures they're proposing are actually going to be successful.
 
However, this is an indication of Africans having a say in issues of global governance, especially when it comes to the war in Ukraine. So, I think it's good that African leaders are actually suing for this, and that Africa is having a voice on global issues.
 
HARRAK: Well, the Ukrainian president has not been very receptive to those proposals. Let's focus now on how this has been perceived, you know, in Africa, potentially.
 
You know, this Africa peace mission comes at a time when we see this two-month long war in Sudan. Really intensifying, displacing millions of Sudanese. The situation in Darfur is now even more dire than before. Should the focus be of these very influential African leaders on mediating and facilitating talks between warring parties in Sudan, rather than going to Europe?
 
MOORE: Well, I think -- I think you can chew gum and walk, right. I think, because of the impact of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the impact on African economies and livelihoods is really, really difficult for African leaders to ignore that.
 
But to your point, initially, part of the reason African governments were ambivalent about responding to what was happening in Europe was because they had crises closer to them at home, but they felt the West was ignoring.
 
So, it makes sense that if the African Union is going to deploy as much resources as they are on a crisis far away in Ukraine, it will make sense that they will begin to deploy the same at home.
 
But they were involved in the riots in Ethiopia. So, one assumes that the African Union is going to do it. So, because the continent is affected both by crisis at home and away. And African leaders cannot ignore one in favor of the other.
 
HARRAK: So, Gyude Moore, thank you so much for your insights. Thank you.
 
MOORE: Pleasure being here.
 
HARRAK: Well, now, to a deadly attack at a secondary school in Uganda. Police in the East African country say rebels with ties to ISIS attacked the school, killing at least 26 students and abducting six others before setting the school on fire.
 
Authorities believed there could be even more victims inside the burned building.
 
We can get you more on these breaking developments with our Larry Madowo, who's following our developments very closely.
 
Larry, what more and have authority said? LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Authorities said they are in hot pursuit of these rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces or ADF that carried out this attack Friday night in Lhubirira secondary school that's in Mpondwe.
 
Mpondwe is a border town. This particular school, police say, is just two kilometers away from the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 
This attack happened just before midnight, and at least 26 people were killed. Most of them are students, according to our understanding. Though these numbers could increase, CNN has not independently updated our death toll. The local media here are reporting numbers even higher than 40.
 
We're waiting to hear more from what the Ugandan military and the Ugandan police who have both been giving our statements about this attack. Horrific -- the country in a while.
 
Even though the ADF has carried out attacks here in Uganda before, most notably in 20 -- in 2021, when several suicide attacks here in the capital of Kampala were blamed on the ADF. And the Ugandan military and the Democratic Republic of Congo military launched joint operations in the eastern DRC to stamp out the ADF.
 
It's claimed some successes in the past, some defections, some child soldiers were rescued, and were getting rehabilitated.
 <br>[03:15:07]
 
Now, a brazen attack from across the border into Western Uganda, a small town. This is a school that they didn't expect that something like this could happen.
 
But now, some really shocking videos and pictures circulating on social media that too graphic and CNN has decided not to show any of these pictures because we would have to blur everything to be able to bring them to you. But that shows the scale and just the gravity of this attack that happened in a secondary school in the border town between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 
We're waiting to hear statement from President Yoweri Museveni, who has previously said that the ADF is nothing and that the Ugandan military would stamp it out like it has done with other armed groups, but the ADF is one of the armed groups operating in eastern DRC that's been carrying out these attacks across the border, but also terrorizing the eastern part of the Congo.
 
HARRAK: All right. CNN's Larry Madowo, reporting from Kampala, Uganda. Thank you so much, Larry.
 
And the federal criminal case against Donald Trump, even routine court filings are taking an outsized significance. One such bit of legal business took place on Friday when Special Counsel Jack Smith filed for a protective order to prevent Trump and his attorneys from sharing any evidence they receive from prosecutors during discovery. CNN's Paula Reid is in Washington with those details.
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The Special Counsel's Office is asking the judge overseeing the Trump's document case to sign off on a set of rules for protecting sensitive information in this case.
 
Now, according to this request, both sides, both the prosecutors and defense attorneys have agreed to these rules about how to handle the sensitive evidence that will soon be shared with defense attorneys.
 
Now, we're not talking about classified information here, we're talking about the other sensitive information that is part of this case.
 
Now, among the rules that prosecutors are seeking here have to do with the defendants, former President Trump and his aide, Walt Nauta. They are insisting that the two defendants not be able to view any of the evidence that is shared with attorneys without their attorneys present.
 
They also request that they not be given copies of it or be able to take notes and then take those notes. The notes need to be protected and kept safe by the attorneys.
 
And now, prosecutors say in this request that they worry that sharing this information with the public or others could compromise other ongoing investigations, witnesses, or other people who haven't been charged.
 
We know the Special Counsel is, of course, looking at the events in and around January 6th, in efforts to undermine the 2020 election.
 
We also know that many of the witnesses in the Trump documents case, they're also interviewed in the January 6th investigation.
 
Now, when it comes to classified information, they're not quite there yet because the Trump attorneys need clearances before they can handle any of those sensitive secrets that are at the heart of this case.
 
The former president is accused of taking over 30 documents. Now earlier this week, the judge overseeing this case, Aileen Cannon, she told the lawyers to begin that process to get their clearances. She wants an update next week.
 
Now, the lawyer is Todd Blanche and Chris Kise have said they're already in touch with the justice department to get that process started so that they can eventually be able to view classified evidence as well.
 
Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.
 
HARRAK: An outbreak of deadly storms across the southern U.S. Coming up, we'll get a look at the devastation. The extreme weather rots on a small Texas town. And the extreme weather isn't over where we can expect to see triple digit temperatures over the weekend. That's just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:23:14]
 
HARRAK: More than 50 million people in the U.S. are under severe weather threat today, including Perryton Texas, which was hit by an EF3 tornado on Thursday afternoon.
 
CNN's Lucy Kafanov is on the ground there and has more on the devastation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have major damage to town. Oh my God.
 
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Terrifying video of a deadly tornado captured by storm chasers.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my God.
 
KAFANOV: As the powerful Twister leveled much of the small town of Perryton, Texas, killing at least three. Sending up to 100 people to the hospital.
 
JAMIE JAMES, RESIDENT, PERRYTON, TEXAS: That was just barely sprinkling. And all of a sudden, the tornado formed and it just dropped on us. It came out of nowhere. There was no sirens, no time to get to shelter.
 
And there was a time where I thought that I was going to die.
 
KAFANOV: Jamie James' home is still standing. But nearly everything around it is destroyed. The community of roughly 8,000 residents is left in shambles.
 
KAFANOV: And this was an immensely powerful tornado. Take a look over there. That vehicle was flipped completely on its roof, slammed into the building.
 
KAFANOV (voice over): From the brick structures on main street to mobile homes completely flattened.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Total devastation.
 
KAFANOV: This cell phone tower snapped in half. Transmission lines have sustained damage and many power lines are down in the town, the energy company says.
 
BRIAN EMFINGER, STORMCHASER: I kind of feel like it was almost a worst-case scenario.
 
KAFANOV: The weather service gives notice as quickly as it can, but one storm chaser on the ground said this storm didn't look particularly dangerous at first. EMFINGER: I never heard sirens, and the reason why is when they issued the tornado warning, the tornado was already in town doing damage, and the power had obviously been cut to the town.
 <br>[03:25:02]
 
KAFANOV: Xcel Energy says the city's power facilities were shut off for safety purposes. Residents begin to pick up the pieces. Including at the fire station which took a direct hit, but still has trucks assisting in the cleanup efforts.
 
COLE UNDERWOOD, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, PERRYTON HIGH SCHOOL: The loss is unthinkable. I don't -- I don't think you can put it really into words.
 
KAFANOV: James tells us, one of the victims is a local shelter volunteer who was always kind to her. If she survived, she would have been among the first to help.
 
JAMES: She served people. Friendly, hugging people like me who needed it so bad.
 
So many good people in this town.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KAFANOV (on camera): Now, this area is Main Street. This downtown part of Perryton taking a direct hit. Cleanup crews have been out here all day trying to move the debris, the overturn trees the downed power lines, but the emotional scars will take a lot longer to heal from.
 
Lucy Kafanov, CNN, Perryton, Texas.
 
HARRAK: And the weather is pulling a one-two punch on Texas and other parts of the south with blistering heat. Forecast well into next week.
 
CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has that.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, we really switched now from severe weather to very hot weather. Now, don't get me wrong, there will be some big storms around the areas here across parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and even across the deep south on Saturday, but it's the heat that will affect more people for sure.
 
Temperatures are going to be well above 100. And when you add in the humidity, it will be a very muggy day. Heat indexes will approach 115 degrees here. That's Fahrenheit of course.
 
But 100 degrees in San Antonio, 109 in Laredo, and muggy air all the way up even into Dallas. Even New Orleans may feel like about 110 to 115. Excessive Heat warnings posted here across parts of Texas.
 
Air conditioners will be rolling. This will be a very difficult weekend to be outside. And it doesn't end by the weekend. It doesn't end until Thursday. Look at your temperatures for Houston, for San Antonio. Dallas a little bit cooler, but still the muggys (PH) are up there without a doubt.
 
And then, for Houston itself 103 on the thermometer with the mugginess there, feeling like 110 to 115 outside, and that's in the shade. So, keep that in mind.
 
Austin, you're not going to get below 104 until Thursday afternoon. The heat is on.
 
Sometimes we can get thunderstorms in this kind of heat, but we'll just have to see whether that's a cooling thunderstorm or a damaging thunderstorm as they develop Saturday, Sunday, and even into Monday.
 
HARRAK: All right, thanks to Chad Myers.
 
And as the search continues for victims of the migrant boat that capsized off the Greek coast, an E.U. official weighs in on a disaster spawned by human traffickers. Details after the break.
 
Plus, a high stakes diplomatic trip to China with the U.S. Secretary of State is hoping to achieve, and why some are skeptical he will get results.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:32:32]
 
HARRAK: Welcome back to our viewers in the United States and Canada, and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak, and you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.
 
Europe's commissioner for home affairs says the migrant boat disaster off the Greek Coast is the worst tragedy ever in the Mediterranean Sea.
 
Ylva Johansson said European nations must find ways to fight smugglers who were sending people to their deaths. Her comments come as the search continues for the missing. 78 people are confirmed dead, but up to 750 people were on the vessel when it sank on Wednesday, and hundreds are feared dead.
 
Greek authorities are denying claims that the ship capsized after the Coast Guard tried to tow it to shore. And as survivors grapple with a disaster, 71 of them were taken to a registration and identification facility near Athens on Friday.
 
Joining us now is award winning journalist Sally Hayden. She's also the author of My Fourth Time, We Drowned: Seeking Refuge on the World's Deadliest Migration Route.
 
Sally, welcome. You have spent the last five years reporting on the impact of European Union migration policy. What did your investigation reveal?
 
SALLY HAYDEN, AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST: Yes, and thank you so much for having me.
 
Yes, this has been what I've been reporting on. And actually, to be honest, I had to double check the figures again and again today just to, you know, make sure that I was appreciating the horrific scale of the deaths that are happening.
 
More than 27,000 people have died in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014. And I think that the European position on this is often framed as inaction. People think it's just that they're not sending out boats to rescue people. But actually, there is -- there is action happening to try and harden those borders. And that's creating a situation where people are much more unsafe.
 
I know that you just quoted the E.U. talking about the importance of fighting people smugglers. but actually, like, we're living in a situation where a large proportion of the world's population don't have the ability to travel safely and legally. And so, they must resort to using smugglers.
 
The smuggling industry is always going to exist as long as people don't have safe and legal routes. You know, at the moment, they can't get visas, they can't get on planes, they don't have other ways to make these journeys.
 
HARRAK: Now, this is one of the world's deadliest migration routes for all the reasons that you just outlined.
 <br>[03:35:05]
 
And yet people remain determined to try and reach Europe through these dangerous routes across the sea. Why?
 
HAYDEN: Because they're desperate. I mean, they're fleeing, wars, dictatorships, situations, you know, of extreme poverty. And I think, like we talked about economic migrants, but fleeing poverty can also be, you know, the fact that you don't have access to health care, that you can't feed your family, that you -- there's an active risk to your life in that situation.
 
And yes, I think it really shows the desperation of people that, you know, I talk to a lot of people who make these journeys, and they say, they know the risks, you know, there, there might be this misconception that they don't know the risks, but they do. But they just have no other option.
 
They feel like they're in a situation otherwise that they can't survive in.
 
And yes, my reporting has taken me across Africa, and across the Middle East as well. And yes, it's really, you know, devastating to hear the stories and to hear that lengths that people are being pushed to.
 
HARRAK: Now, there is a lot of focus right now on the Greek Coast Guard. What they did and didn't do. What is the track record of Greek authorities when it comes to handling of the crisis in the Mediterranean?
 
HAYDEN: Yes, the Greek coast guard is becoming quite infamous for their brutality, for using violence against people for even, you know, disabling engines, leaving people at sea. And so, we don't know exactly what happened with this boat.
 
Yes. I know that there are conflicting reports, but one of the reports said that potentially the people on board, when they found out it was Greek authorities had said, no, they wanted to continue to Italy, they had refused how.
 
And I mean, I can see why that might have happened because of the reputation of the Greek authorities that actually people would think it was more dangerous to agree to, you know, be technically helped by them. And that actually the results might be more dangerous than the situation they were in even.
 
HARRAK: And so, as the weather gets warmer, do we expect more boats to keep coming? And what ultimately determines who deserves to be in Europe?
 
HAYDEN: Yes, I mean, that's, that's a big question. Yes, I think both are going to continue to come all the time. And who deserves to be there, a lot of the people that I speak to, they -- once they can get on European territory, they can claim right to stay there. You know, they can claim international protection. But the problem is that they can't claim that from abroad, they have to get onto European territory, then, they'll be recognized as refugees.
 
And yes, I mean, that's a kind of maybe a broader debate, but at the moment without those safe and legal routes, this is the only way, the only recourse that people have to do that.
 
HARRAK: Sally Hayden, thank you so much. Greatly appreciate you coming on.
 
HAYDEN: Thank you.
 
HARRAK: The U.S. Secretary of State took off from Washington a few hours ago to begin his long delay trip to China, where he will try to ease rising tensions between the two countries.
 
Antony Blinken says he will hold talks on a range of issues, including the safety of three Americans, who Washington says have been wrongfully detained in China.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: This has been an ongoing conversation with the PRC, and something that, for me is always at the top of my list. That is looking out for the security and well-being of Americans around the world, including those who are being detained in one way or another, including arbitrarily.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK: While Blinken, says his visit is also meant to improve communications with Beijing in order to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict.
 
In February, Blinken canceled a previous trip to China after the country was accused of flying a giant spy balloon over the U.S. to collect sensitive information from military sites.
 
A federal jury reaches a verdict for the gunman accused of killing almost a dozen people in the Tree of Life synagogue.

HARRAK: In Pennsylvania, Robert Bowers has been convicted of carrying out the deadliest attack ever on Jewish people in the United States. The trial now moves to the penalty phase. Jurors must decide whether to sentence Robert Bowers to death or to life in prison without parole.
 
CNNs Danny Freeman reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Silence in the courtroom Friday morning as Judge Robert Colville read the verdicts. 63 federal charges, guilty on all counts. 22 of those charges, punishable by death.
 
The jury agreed with federal prosecutors that the man who killed 11 Jewish worshippers and injured six other people in October 2018 targeted them, specifically because they were Jewish.
 
JO RECHT, PRESIDENT, DOR HADASH: I am feeling a sense of relief that after 4-1/2 years, the world has heard again about the horrific acts on October 27th, 2018. And the shooter has -- is being held accountable for those awful acts.
 
FREEMAN: Throughout more than two grueling weeks of testimony, prosecutors showed how the defendant turned a sacred house of worship into a hunting ground.
 <br>[03:45:03]
 
Body camera video and 911 calls revealed chaos and terror. Jurors heard 84-year-old Bernice Simon's 911 call as she held a prayer shawl to her husband's bullet wounds. We're being attacked. I'm scared to death, she cried out before she was shot and killed while hiding in a pew. The defense did not dispute their client killed the 11 worshippers. But the shooters attorneys tried to argue the attack was motivated by immigration-related conspiracy theories, not by a hatred of Jews.
 
Prosecutors called that argument absurd.

FREEMAN: Community leaders in Pittsburgh say Friday's results was a victory. But the death penalty phase looms large.

STEPHEN COHEN, CO-PRESIDENT, NEW LIGHT CONGREGATION: It's difficult to say the emotions we feel right now. One of relief, obviously, that the jury returned a full verdict of guilty to all 63 counts. But there's also a degree of trepidation because this is just the first third of the trial. And in a sense, it was the least complicated part.

HARRAK: U.S. officials have identified a second federal agency that's been hit by a sweeping cyber-attack. Sources tell CNN that the Office of Personnel Management has joined the Department of Energy as the two impacted agencies.

Saturday is King Charles' official birthday celebration, which means the pomp and pageantry in London will be in full swing. A military parade known as Trooping the Colour is set to draw huge crowds.
 
Outside Buckingham Palace, CNN's Max Foster has all the details.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT: One of the perks of being the king of the United Kingdom is that you get two birthdays. King Charles's official birthday is in June, but his actual birthday is in November.
 
Typically, the actual birthday is celebrated privately. The June Trooping of the Colour celebration is a public celebration, and is held in June, generally, because it's good weather.
 
King Charles will be riding a horse in what is a military parade. Full pomp and pageantry, as you'd expect from the United Kingdom. 1,500 troops, 300 horses, and Prince William will be joining him on horseback in that parade. They will inspect the troops at Horse Guards Parade, hoping not for a rerun of what happened in the rehearsals when some troops passed out under the heat.

But they do have a lot of ambulance support, so they're ready for if it's needed.
 
And generally, what you see happen is the troops will pass out but the parade continues. This is the military spirit, of course.
 
After the parade, they returned to Buckingham Palace. The whole family will appear on the balcony to see the fly pass. A poignant moment yet again, as this will be the first cheapening of the color without Queen Elizabeth II.
