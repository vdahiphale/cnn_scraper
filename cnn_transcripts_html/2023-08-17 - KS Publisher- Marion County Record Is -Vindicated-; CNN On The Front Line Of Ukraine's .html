SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: The publisher of a Kansas Newspaper raided by police says he feels vindicated today because the top prosecutor in his county withdrew the search warrant in the case. There was swift condemnation from First Amendment advocates across the country after the police searched and did a search and seizure at the Marion County Records Office. Computers, phones, and other items were seized. But now, police have to return it all.
 
CNN Law Enforcement Correspondent Whitney Wild is here with us with details. Whitney, what more are you hearing about this? I know that they were able to publish even after all this -- all this searching and seizing all the things, but they start by saying cease but not silence. What's going to happen now with their equipment?
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's been returned. And the next step is to figure out if it was accessed by law enforcement. Law enforcement says they are going to move forward with this investigation independently. That will not include examining or even retaining those devices.
 
But an attorney for the newspaper, Bernie Rhodes, tells me that you must trust but verify so they will have their own forensic expert review that. Here's what the publisher Eric Meyer told Jake Tapper about all of this.

JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Are you thinking of taking any legal action?
 
ERIC MEYER, PUBLISHER &amp; CO-OWNER, MARION COUNTY RECORD: Still up in the air. The -- I think it's quite possible because there needs to be a clear line that this is not allowed. There's a lot of very strange things. They searched a reporter's computer who had been sick all that week and hadn't even been involved in it.
 
They also took her cell phone. She wasn't even in the office at that time. So, a lot of strange things that hint of possible intimidation and attempted bullying.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) [11:35:16]
 
WILD: Here's what the local prosecutor has to say about all of this. The affidavits which I am asking the court to release established probable cause to believe that an employee of the newspaper may have committed unlawful acts concerning computers. Upon further review, however, I have come to the conclusion that insufficient evidence exists to establish a legally sufficient nexus between this alleged crime and the places searched and the items seized.
 
Sara, the attorney for the newspaper tells me they have not been told. They are not subject to this investigation. But moving forward, the expectation here is law enforcement will work with the attorney. And we'll see where this case goes, Sara.
 
SIDNER: Yes, it's really interesting. Usually, in these cases, you get a subpoena to turn things over. You are not raided. So, we'll have to see where this goes. I know you'll be following it all. Whitney Wild, thank you so much. Appreciate it. John?
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right. Growing tensions this morning between New York State and New York City over the migrant situation in the city. Lawyers for Governor Kathy Hochul have sent a scathing letter blasting New York City's handling of the influx of asylum seekers. Now, while the Governor did acknowledge that Mayor Eric Adams had "an extraordinary challenge dealing with the crisis," she didn't know that Adams "did invite all these individuals in."
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval is with us now. Some pretty loaded language back and forth here, Polo.
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And, John, I can save you the reading that pretty lengthy letter in short. Basically, says that Governor Hochul takes issues with many aspects of New York City's handling of the migrant crisis and saying that the city can do more to handle the situation in a proactive, timely, and collaborative manner in terms of working with the city. For starters, the governor lays out a list of about 14 locations in and around New York City that the city could potentially use to house asylum seekers.
 
However, the city has passed on those locations. So, the mayor in the last hour, Eric Adams is saying that they did not ignore any site recommendations. Simply they are not sustainable. And they do not work in terms of the goal to house asylum seekers. Adams is saying this morning that he hopes to sit down with Hochul's team to explain why they didn't take him up on that offer.
 
Also, the governor zeroed in on -- zeroing in on this recent practice of offering relocation for asylum seekers from New York City to other communities Upstate. Saying not only does this practice overall delay the legal process for asylum seekers, but also it makes essential services very difficult to reach. I want you to hear what Governor Hochul told our affiliate in New York One.
 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): Putting someone in a hotel, on a dark, lonely road in upstate New York and telling them they're supposed to survive is not compassion. We are focused on helping find as many sites at considerable state expense in the city and we believe there's still more capacity based on the list we've already provided.
 
(END AUDIO CLIP)
 
SANDOVAL: This morning, Adams said that he doesn't feel that the governor slammed their response so they simply provided -- that she simply provided analysis. But call it what you want, John.
 
If you read through those 12 pages, it is clear that this is -- this crisis is now adding potential tension for those who would typically be seen as political allies. Of course, I'm talking about Hochul and Adams.
 
BERMAN: Yes, tension is one way to put it. Polo Sandoval, thank you so much for being with us. Kate?
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Coming up. CNN has an inside look at the intense fighting on the frontlines in Ukraine as Ukrainian forces are making progress in the East. Officials say troops there are successfully repelling Russian attacks on a newly liberated Village. We'll be back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:43:10]
 
BERMAN: This morning, remarkable new footage from the front lines of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Our CNN team was there as Ukraine retook the town of Urozhaine, a key strategic location on the banks of a crucial River in an area that Russia has occupied for more than a year. Let me show you on the map where this is. It's up here in this region -- down here, I should say, in this region right there. We can push it a little more and you can see Urozhaine right here. And now, the Ukrainians control both banks of this river.
 
With me now is CNN Military Analyst, Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General, thanks so much for being with us. One thing I do want to point out is the Mokri Yaly River which goes right through here, it flows down into the Sea of Azov. And right here and here are two crucial Ukrainian cities that the Russians have held for more than a year, Mariupol and Berdyansk. So, what do you see happening with the counteroffensive as we sit here this morning?
 
MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Some fascinating film, John. Thanks for showing that. And what you're seeing, Urozhaine and Rohatyn, another town that Ukraine has been successful in terms of countering Russian attacks at -- attempts at defending that are both relatively small sound -- towns. But as you said, they're critically important in terms of their terrain features and their ability to go further along to places like Tokmak and other locations that are road junctions, and will get Ukrainian forces down to the coast. The Ukrainians want to cut those supply lines. They want to continue to breach the three lines of defense, which are called this horrific in line. And it's going to be continuously difficult because there are literally tens of thousands of mines in those areas. That film you just showed, that tank going across the country and firing at targets that are about 800 meters away, that is indicative of a close fight and some really tough challenges for the Ukrainian army. But they seem to be doing very well in those areas.
 <br>[11:45:08]
 
BERMAN: So, we're seeing tanks operating in that region. We also got some new video in today of training. This is taking place in Germany. This is Ukrainians being trained on Leopard tanks.
 
Now, Leopards have been deployed in Ukraine for some time now. But what you're looking at here is Ukrainian soldiers being trained on them outside of the country. Why is this significant?
 
HERTLING: You're getting me excited, John, when you're talking tanks. That's -- those tank training is taking place at -- a place called the Klietz troop and bunk plots, which is a German training area, just to the west of Berlin. It is one of several locations where Ukrainian forces have been training. There have been about eight or 9000 tankers trained. It's going to continue to increase.
 
But what you're seeing in this film is a -- is a pair of tanks. This is called the tank section. And what they're doing is learning the tricks of how to maneuver on territory and engage targets.
 
Inside those tanks are a four-man crew, a driver, a loader, a gunner, and a -- and a tank commander. And what they have to do is not only coordinate what goes on inside the tank and firing that 105-millimeter main gun, but they're also having to coordinate with that partner. And you see both tanks in this film right now.
 
They have to engage targets. You don't want to shoot at the same target with two different tanks. So, they're continuously scanning. They're looking for targets downrange. And these tanks, these Leopard 1A5s have been used by the Dutch Army, the German army, and they are very good tanks.
 
They're very fast. They've got good fire control systems, and they can hit targets. This will be a good match. But the most important thing is what the lethal part of this tank is -- are the four soldiers on the inside. They've received the training that they need something that the Russian forces have not been real good at in terms of their tankers.
 
BERMAN: Yes. Spoken like a true tank guy. I could hear your excitement there. General Mark Hertling, great to see you. Appreciate it. Sara?
 
SIDNER: All right. Mick Fleetwood, the co-founder of Fleetwood Mac is now one of the victims of the Maui fire. The wildfires destroyed his famed restaurant and everything in it. Up next, hear how he is responding to his employees who lost everything and preserving the island's legacy and culture. That's ahead.

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's "CHASING LIFE" podcast.
 
Brisk walking. It's one of the easiest and best things you can do for your health. It doesn't require a gym membership, doesn't require fancy equipment, but the results can be dramatic for your body and your brain.
 
In fact, there was this report from Harvard Medical School, which found that walking across the board can help prevent disease better than just about any other activity. And specifically, they found that walking about 22 minutes a day every day could reduce your risk of heart disease by 30 percent. Think of that.
 
If you had heard of a medicine that could do that, and this is just walking. Well, why? Well, maybe a mini walk during the workday just gets you out of your chair. So, right away, you're sitting less.
 
If you walk after a meal, it can help lower your blood sugar pretty reliably whether or not you're a diabetic. And lately, there has been good evidence that walking every day could help stave off dementia. And if you walk with a friend, they're also cultivating those social connections, and that's an added bonus.
 
You can hear more about how to optimize your health and chaste life wherever you get your podcasts.

BOLDUAN: The reality of the enormous loss on Maui is hitting residents hard once again this morning. Nick Fleetwood is among them. The drummer of the iconic band Fleetwood Mac has lived on Maui for decades. He owns a restaurant right on the front street in Lahaina, a restaurant that is now gone. He spoke to our colleague, Omar Jimenez.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICK FLEETWOOD, LAHAINA RESTAURANT DESTROYED IN MAUI FIRES: The Ohana of 120 people who worked at my restaurant that I gathered at some point fairly early on was threatened. And then literally within minutes had gone. All of these things you're trying to sort of assimilate and then immediately clock in -- click in to how to find out who is where, which is the appropriate -- not only the appropriate thing, it's still continuing. There are people missing.
 
I woke up this morning and turn around to my lovely girlfriend who said it's gone. And then you start thinking about it was full of family and funny things that people love to see him. All of that is completely, utterly disappeared. Again, no relevance to the tragedy of losing a life.
 <br>[11:55:07]
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Governor Josh Green has talked about trying to stop developers from buying lands that were destroyed by these fires because potentially they could be redeveloped in a way that isn't quite true to the history and the roots of some of these particular communities. How should that rebuilding process start?
 
FLEETWOOD: This is a huge blow to the history and the legacy of these islands. Lahaina is the old Royal Capital of these islands. And we are and should be reminded of the good graces of culturally what that town means to the Hawaiian community.
 
I consider myself part of these islands, but I am a visitor. And culturally, I haven't traveled my whole life. That's really what this is. The essence and the real backbone of these islands are people who have lived here for a long, long, long time.

SIDNER: Wow.
 
BOLDUAN: He actually says he considers himself one of the lucky ones because he hasn't lost his home.
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
BOLDUAN: He hasn't lost loved ones. But that's the measure of lucky right now there.
 
BERMAN: Got to be so hard. Thank you all for joining us. This has been CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.
