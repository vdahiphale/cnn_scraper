<br>[21:00:00] 
 
JAMAL SIMMONS, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR VP KAMALA HARRIS: -- years as a district attorney. She would sit and meet with families.
 
I saw her do this, we were in Buffalo, New York, after the Tops market shooting. And she sat with the families from that shooting. And she looks them in the eye, and she talks to them. And it's a really personal way that is -- that really grabs the people in the room, and really makes everybody know that she's there for them, and she's going to fight for them, when this is over.
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, ANDERSON COOPER 360: Yes.
 
I want to thank everybody, on the panel, tonight, for being with us.
 
Thanks everybody for watching. I'll be back tomorrow night. I hope you join me.
 
The news continues, right now. "THE SOURCE" with our Kaitlan Collins, starts now.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST, THE SOURCE WITH KAITLAN COLLINS: Good evening. I'm Kaitlan Collins.
 
And sources across the political spectrum, tonight, say the Republican Party has a major problem on its hands, with potential implications for the presidential race and Donald Trump.
 
CNN's KFILE has uncovered a slew of posts made by the Republican nominee for governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. You see him here.
 
In just 48 hours, before Trump is scheduled to return to that critical battleground, he and the rest of us are finding out that the candidate that he endorsed posted dozens of disturbing comments, on a porn forum, between the year 2008 and 2012.
 
Mark Robinson, calling himself, in his own words, a perv, writing that many things that are too sexual in nature, and frankly, too explicit for me to even read on TV.
 
But I will say this, about what Robinson wrote. He said that he enjoyed transgender pornography, despite the anti-trans rhetoric that he's been using lately.
 
And there were also racist and anti-Semitic statements included in that. Like, when Robinson called himself, and these are his words, again, a Black Nazi, in 2010. He also said that year that he supported reinstating slavery, writing, quote, "Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it (slavery) back. I would certainly buy a few."
 
Now, before this report came out, but after Robinson's other offensive comments, to be clear, Trump previously praised him as the Martin Luther King on steroids.
 
Tonight, in response to this reporting, by KFILE, Robinson is denying it all, saying that it's not him, and also saying he won't withdraw from the race.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARK ROBINSON, (R) NOMINEE FOR NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR: This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not anything that is characteristic of me, nor has it ever had -- has it ever been.
 
This is not things that we would ever say or even think.
 
ANDREW KACZYNSKI, CNN KFILE SENIOR EDITOR: How can you deny, with all of these matching details, that this is you?
 
ROBINSON: Look, I'm not going to get into the minutia of how somebody manufactured this, these salacious tabloid lies. But I can tell you this. There's been over $1 million spent on me, through AI, by a billionaire's son, who's bound and determined to destroy me. The things that people can do with the internet now is incredible.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: That man that you heard there was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention, not long ago, with Trump calling him one of the greatest -- great leaders in our country. Trump is not saying that, tonight.
 
And then, actually, the Trump campaign statement doesn't even mention Robinson by name. I will note, his campaign did not invite Mark Robinson to Trump's rally there, on Saturday, despite the Lieutenant Governor being at most, if not all, of Trump's recent North Carolina events.
 
Three senior Trump advisers tell CNN tonight that there have been no efforts, on their behalf, to pressure Robinson to withdraw from the governor's race.
 
My political sources are here tonight. They are:
 
The former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who has endorsed Vice President Harris, I should note.
 
California congressman, and a surrogate for the Harris campaign, Representative Ro Khanna.
 
And CNN's Senior Political Commentator, Scott Jennings.
 
And Congressman Kinzinger, let me just start with you. When you hear what Mark Robinson is saying there, to Andrew Kaczynski, after this report, trying to argue that it's AI or internet-generated. I mean, what do you make of his response to this report?
 
ADAM KINZINGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (R) FORMER ILLINOIS CONGRESSMAN: I guess, in the era of everybody doubles down, nobody admits mistakes or fault, it's to be expected. I hope nobody actually buys that, his argument there. The sad thing is, there are many people that will still probably vote for him.
 
I read one of the -- just before we got on, one of the posts that CNN isn't showing. And I got to tell you, it's beyond anything I even imagined with this, in terms of it's -- how disturbing it is.
 
And so, look, he's, again, he's made the decision to stay in. And I guess he has till midnight to drop out. He's obviously not going to do this. This is devastating, from a campaign perspective. Obviously, he'll lose North Carolina. But the Trump campaign ought to be very concerned, because if there are people disheartened by him, they'll either not show up, or maybe they'll vote for Kamala or whatever. And so, this is -- this is not good for them, for a very close state.
 
And again, really disturbing stuff. This is beyond just sexual behavior. It's, there's stuff that there's a reason that CNN isn't printing.
 <br>[21:05:00]
 
COLLINS: Well, and when you can't say it on cable news, obviously, it's pretty bad. It's just that explicit. And I should note that.
 
Scott, the NC GOP just put out a statement, a few moments ago. And I was curious how they would respond. And they're saying that Robinson should stay in this race.
 
I'm quoting them now. They say, "The Left can try to smear Mark Robinson all they want, but when voters go to the polls on Election Day, they are going to be asking one simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"
 
I mean, this is not a smear by the Left. This is a reporter, who uncovered comments that he made, as a grown man. What do you make of the state party sticking by -- standing by Mark Robinson?
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO MITCH MCCONNELL: Oh, a political party standing by the nominee of a party? I'm not surprised by that. I mean, it would be pretty shocking, actually, if a party decided to throw their candidate off the ballot, although it did happen one time, in one other race this summer that we've covered.
 
I think in the case of North Carolina, what are the questions I have? Number one. Was Mark Robinson likely to win in the first place? The answer is no. He was competitive, but I think not likely to win. This story does not make it any easier, of course, because of what Adam just said. I mean, it's pretty -- pretty rough stuff.
 
Number two. Regarding the issues, will it affect Donald Trump? I would just note, in the last two elections, Democrat won governor, Trump still won the state. I don't think it works that way.
 
And whether this hurts Mark Robinson or doesn't, or hurts him a little, or hurts him a lot, I don't really think it's going to have any impact on Donald Trump whatsoever. He endorses a lot of Republicans. In fact, he endorses most Republicans. And I don't think he owns the oppo file on every single person that he endorses, any more than any other national figure does, when they support the people in their party.
 
So, I think the Trump campaign feels good about what it's doing in North Carolina. They feel good about their apparatus. Robinson may have his own problems. But I really don't think it's going to impact Trump.
 
And I'll just add one other thing. Andy is a good reporter. And all year long, he has been doing lots of reporting, on both parties, including a lot of reporting on Kamala Harris. And people, like me, have come on here and touted that reporting as important. And so, I don't think you can pick and choose. And so, count me as a KFILE believer, until proven otherwise.
 
COLLINS: Yes, we're all -- we're all KFILE believers. They do a great job. Em Steck as well.
 
But Scott, let me just follow up with you on that. Because on the Trump aspect of this, I am curious what is going to happen, come Saturday, when Donald Trump is in North Carolina.
 
Just before this report came out, I want people to listen to what Trump has said about Mark Robinson, previously.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This is Martin Luther King on steroids.
 
I think you're better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.
 
One of the great stars of the party, one of the great stars in politics, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson.
 
I'm a great supporter of his. You're incredible, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson.
 
(CHEERING)
 
TRUMP: This is a hot politician. He's a hot politician. (CHEERING)
 
TRUMP: Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson.
 
A real star. Great guy. Friend of mine. Mark Robinson.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: I mean, Scott, obviously that's more than just an endorsement. That's going above and beyond, to praise him. So, as a Republican, does he need to distance himself from Mark Robinson, on Saturday?
 
JENNINGS: I don't know what he will do. I wouldn't predict it.
 
My advice to him would be do whatever is best for you. Because right now, the highest and most fervent view of most Republicans, in this country, is that Donald Trump be returned to the White House. And he has to run the campaign that he needs to run, to get that done.
 
I love all these other races and everything else down-ballot. But for Donald Trump, and for his campaign high command, if I were in their shoes, I would do only what was best for Donald Trump, in order to win one of the three most important states. It's Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. And whatever they deem is in their best interest, that's exactly what they ought to do.
 
COLLINS: Congressman Ro Khanna, you're our Democrat here. You're seeing the Harris campaign, responding to this report, which had a lot of anticipation building up for it online today, posting these pictures of Trump -- Robinson and Trump together. Obviously, comments like the ones that we just played, will likely be circulated by them.
 
What'd North Carolina voters do here? I mean, would they hold it against Trump if he does try to distance himself from Robinson? What does that look like, given it is -- holding North Carolina is essential to Trump's strategy, to winning in 2024.
 
REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, first of all, let me thank Scott for at least acknowledging the reporting, and the fact-based reporting that CNN did.
 
This is not a tabloid. And it's sad in a democracy that Robinson is not engaging in fact-based argument.
 
What he could have done, and what a candidate in the past may have done, is said, Look, I said things that were completely outrageous, 10 years ago. I've learned. I've grown. I admit my mistake.
 
And the American people are forgiving. But he's unwilling to confront the obvious.
 <br>[21:10:00]
 
And I would say, look, they're not usually reverse coattails. And I've endorsed people, who I regret too. But the question is, what is Donald Trump going to do now? Does he have the courage to say, those were terrible, atrocious remarks that Robinson made, that Robinson should own up to them, that Robinson should apologize? He's going to be judged on how he reacts to the matter now, not being tagged for an endorsement he made.
 
COLLINS: Well, and that's a good point in the sense of it's not just this KFILE report. I mean, Mark Robinson has been a controversial, offensive figure, if you want to put it that way, on the campaign trail.
 
And Congressman Kinzinger, just -- this is just the last few years. I want people to know. Maybe not everyone's familiar with him as a candidate. Listen to what he's said, before this came out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBINSON: If you are a man on Friday night, and you at the mall on Saturday night, you better go to the men's bathroom.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ROBINSON: If you are confused, find a corner outside.
 
So many freedoms were lost during the Civil Rights movement that shouldn't have been lost.
 
There's no reason anybody anywhere in America--
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
ROBINSON: --should be telling any time about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: Adam. I mean, a Republican could win in North Carolina, potentially. But is this a candidate quality issue? What do you see about your party in this moment?
 
KINZINGER: Yes. I mean, you've got to look back at the primary. I forget the name of the person he was running against. But I think it was a female, I don't remember. But was kind of a mainstream Republican, and probably would be really set to potentially win this race.
 
But, in the primary, and we've seen this a lot in my party, is whoever's the loudest, the angriest, the most radical, usually makes it through a primary. And does that work? Sometimes, sure. Sometimes, it doesn't.
 
And so, a lot of this stuff about Mark Robinson, as you just pointed out, which was important was, no, not the details of, like, what we're learning today, which is like, Oh my gosh. But there was a lot of stuff, where everybody -- I mean, he was already significantly down in the polls, in this. And where I don't think it's going to affect Donald Trump, in terms of, people are going to say, well, if Donald Trump supported him, I can't support Trump, I think they can leave Robinson.
 
But what it could do is it could bring down some of the enthusiasm. I mean, this is like a gut punch to anybody that's a Republican, in North Carolina, to learn this. And in a race that's going to be so close, any kind of an attack on motivation can make a huge difference.
 
So, you know, and I do think Scott's right. A lot of it's going to determine, what does Donald Trump do after this point?
 
If he sticks with Mark Robinson, and defends him, and calls him Martin Luther King times two? For God's sakes, by the way. But if he calls him that, then he does own some of what Mark Robinson did.
 
If he is quiet, or actually denounces him, then I think he has a position to say, I didn't know. I didn't know what's going to happen.
 
But there was a lot that was known prior to this.
 
COLLINS: I mean, Scott, do you want to see Mark Robinson just get out of this race, tonight? He has got until midnight, I believe.
 
JENNINGS: I mean, that's his choice. I mean, he did win a primary. And he is the sitting Lieutenant Governor. He has won a statewide election, in North Carolina. And my assumption is, if he tried to get out of the race, Democrats would try to block him, and keep him on the ballot. So, it would probably lead to a protracted fight.
 
I, again, I go back to my initial reaction to this. He was down, I think, unlikely to win in the first place. As a party matter, would a protracted fight, over trying to keep him on the ballot, be in the party's best interest? I don't know about that. So, it's all happening so quickly, there may -- just may not be time for that to happen. And so, you just got to play the hand you're dealt.
 
COLLINS: Well, doesn't sound like, from the Republican Party, that they think he should get out, the one in North Carolina, of course.
 
Everyone, thank you for being here.
 
And of course, thanks to KFILE, for that excellent reporting.
 
Also, right now, on the other side of the campaign trail, Oprah is hitting it for Kamala Harris for the first time. You don't often see her out, touting her muscle, of course, that she has. We're going to tell you what is happening, at this event, after a quick break.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oprah.
 
(CHEERING) 
 
(APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[21:15:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COLLINS: Tonight, Oprah is hosting an event, with Vice President Harris, as you can see here.
 
They are out in a critical battleground state of Michigan. They're hosting what is a virtual rally that it is an event called Unite for America. Turns out to be a star-studded affair. It has Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and all -- Meryl Streep appearing on the livestream, as you can see here.
 
It's also bringing together more than a 140 grassroots groups, ranging from so-called White Dudes for Harris, to Cat Ladies For Kamala.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OPRAH WINFREY, AMERICAN HOST AND TELEVISION PRODUCER: This grassroots, people-powered movement, behind Kamala Harris, has unleashed a unifying force, unlike anything we've seen in politics in a very long time.
 
It actually is hope and joy rising.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
WINFREY: And there's been a--
 
(CHEERING) 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WINFREY: Can you feel it?
 
(CHEERING) 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WINFREY: You can feel it. You can feel it. You can feel it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: I want to bring in Senior Correspondent for TheGrio, Natasha Alford.
 
And former Republican congressman, Charlie Dent.
 
Great to have you both here.
 
And, Natasha, just looking at this, this event with Oprah, out on the campaign trail. Obviously she's someone who uses her muscles, sparingly, but in a powerful way, when she does choose to use it, of course. Everyone remembers her speech from the Democratic convention, or with Obama.
 
When you see something like this, and that 200,000 people, according to the Harris campaign, have signed up to watch, what do you make of the effect Oprah can have, on a race like this?
 <br>[21:20:00]
 
NATASHA ALFORD, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, THEGRIO: Well, when Oprah speaks, people listen. For many of us, we went home after school, she was one of the first people we watched on television. She is somebody who is an artful storyteller and a teacher.
 
And what I saw tonight -- I think I might be having a computer issue. Let's see here.
 
COLLINS: We can still hear you. Go ahead.
 
ALFORD: Can you hear me OK?
 
COLLINS: Yes, yes.
 
ALFORD: OK, great.
 
So, what I saw, tonight, was just her brilliance, her ability to translate what people are feeling on the ground. They talked about economic struggles. They talked about the unaffordability of homes. And they talked about reproductive rights.
 
And so, to be able to have these conversations, do so in a relatable way, and to have Kamala Harris, right there, explaining her positions, talking to people directly. It's that powerful Oprah effect that we often saw, when we watched the Oprah show, again, after school or for all those years in our homes.
 
So, I think, it's brilliant. It's smart. And because she is selective about when she speaks, we know that it has power. And she means it when she says she supports Kamala Harris.
 
COLLINS: Well, and Congressman, obviously, what we're seeing. I mean, Oprah is one of the biggest surrogates, obviously, a campaign could get. We're seeing former President Obama make his way out on the campaign trail soon, in the next few days.
 
Is this the time when you're -- if you're in a campaign, we're seven weeks out from the election, to deploy your biggest surrogates?
 
CHARLIE DENT, (R) FORMER PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN: Well, yes, it's crunch time now. So, of course, you're going to deploy your big surrogates, right now. They need to get the most -- the people who need to be persuaded need to be persuaded now.
 
And I never thought endorsements mean a whole lot. But obviously, Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift, are cultural icons. And this game is going to be won or lost on the margins. So any little bit helps. So, I suspect it's a net positive for the Harris campaign, that these folks are out there, beating the bushes for her, at this critical moment. But it's still going to be very tight race. I mean, it's not going to move that many votes, but maybe enough that'll make a difference.
 
COLLINS: Yes. And there were these moments that are, what do people see? Obviously, not -- there's 200,000 people in this livestream. But what do other voters in critical states outside of Michigan see.
 
And Natasha. There was this moment, tonight, where Oprah was talking about the way when Harris became the nominee, and how she took the top of the ticket. I just want everyone to listen to what Oprah, how she described that moment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WINFREY: Literally, looking at you, at a speech, like the week before, which was a great speech, very nice.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WINFREY: And then, the next week, I saw you walking in the thing.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WINFREY: And I said, What happened to you?
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You know, we each have those moments in our lives, where it's time to step up.
 
WINFREY: Time to step up.
 
HARRIS: Time to step up.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: I mean, Natasha, this is the question here, in the sense of what we saw in the enthusiasm, when Harris became the nominee, but the terms of what Oprah's describing there, what happened in the beginning and stretching that out, and making it last until Election Day.
 
How does the Dem -- how do Democrats maintain that?
 
ALFORD: Well, I think it was brilliant what she highlighted, right? That there was this moment, where Kamala Harris seemed to come into her power.
 
The truth is, Kamala Harris has always been there, right? She's always had many of these strengths, and many of these assets, and she's always been doing the work. But it was up to people to pay attention. And it was also up to the powers that be, to position her, to be seen, and for those strikes to come through. So, I think that framing was really smart. And I think that is what is going to carry her through to the finish line. Right? She has been doing the work behind-the-scenes.
 
I mean, tonight, that moment with the parents, and the family of Amber Thurman, who died because she wasn't able to get the medical care that she needed, in this post-Roe era, people had tears in their eyes.
 
And it was a very tangible, real thing that highlighted that at one point, we had freedoms that we no longer have, and that people's votes can literally save lives. I think that emphasis on saving lives, and the power of the vote to do that, that is going to carry her across the finish line.
 
She's always said she has to earn every vote. I don't think she's taking it for granted. I actually think she's being very humble, contrary to some criticisms. And she's feeling like she's going to earn these votes, and I think that is what's going to make the difference.
 
COLLINS: Yes, well, and this is in Michigan. They're obviously trying to reach voters, outside of Michigan.
 
Pennsylvania is a must-win state for her, Charlie. And you know that better than anyone. And CNN's Poll of Polls shows the two candidates, Harris, and Trump, in a virtual tie there.
 <br>[21:25:00]
 
And I wonder, what is your sense of what's happening on the ground? We're looking at the numbers, every single day. We're looking at polls that are just in these battlegrounds. What are you seeing about what the candidates need to focus on, on the ground?
 
DENT: Well, what I'm seeing, this is coming down to just a simple turnout election. Which candidate is going to be able to really motivate his or her vote and get them to the polls? I mean, we say that all the time, but I really mean it here, because it is so close.
 
And the -- you know, you look at the Philadelphia media market, and the Harrisburg media market. Together, that's probably 58 percent of the vote. I suspect she will drive messages, on women's reproductive rights. I think it'll be more resonant there, maybe than in other parts of the state. In the western part of the state, she needs to talk about the economy and jobs, more effectively. But at the end of the day, it's tight.
 
And there are two counties to watch, Northampton County, where I'm from, in that area, the Lehigh Valley, and Erie County.
 
I'm going to make one prediction. Whichever candidate wins Northampton County, Pennsylvania, is going to win Pennsylvania, and is going to win the presidency. Same is probably true of Erie County.
 
So, if you want to know anything, just watch those two counties. There has been polling done, in those two counties that show it's very tight there as well, with Harris with a very slight lead. So just keep an eye on that.
 
But again, it's all going to come down to turnout. That's what this game is about, right now.
 
COLLINS: You know we love a good prediction here, Charlie. So, we will all be watching Northampton County. I'll be circling it on my map of Pennsylvania.
 
Charlie Dent. Natasha Alford. Great to have you both. Thank you so much.
 
And she helped prep Donald Trump, for his debate that everyone is still talking about. We're actually seeing new polls of what voters thought about that debate. We're going to speak to a top surrogate, for the Trump campaign. Tulsi Gabbard, here next.
 <br>[21:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COLLINS: We have new polling, tonight, that shows voters were impressed by how Vice President Kamala Harris performed in her debate, with former President Donald Trump.
 
The latest numbers show that 67 percent of voters, likely voters, I should say, say that they believe Harris did well. 40 percent said the same of Donald Trump.
 
The numbers hold across demographics. When you dig into this, it's a majority of every race, age and education level, saying that Harris, they believe, did better. Of course, you look deeper into these numbers, and the race itself remains deadlocked.
 
My source, on all of this, helped prepare Donald Trump for that debate, and is now a Trump Transition Team Co-chair, Tulsi Gabbard.
 
And it's great to have you here.
 
TULSI GABBARD, CO-CHAIR, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM, HELPED TRUMP PREP FOR HARRIS DEBATE: Thanks, Kaitlan.
 
COLLINS: When you do look at these numbers. And we talked about Pennsylvania a moment ago. But just overall. We've got 46 days to go before the election. Neither one of them has a decisive advantage. What do you think that Trump needs to do, over these next seven weeks, to change that?
 
GABBARD: I think he's going to continue to stay very focused on reaching out to voters, not taking a single person for granted, and talking to them about the issues that they care about most, that impact their everyday lives the most.
 
This is such a unique situation that we all find ourselves in, where we have two people running for president, who actually have a record. So, it's not just about, you know, are these empty campaign promises. Voters will actually be able to compare the record of President Trump, through his first term in the White House, and the last four years under Vice President Harris and Joe Biden.
 
And there are very clear contrast, between them, on almost every single major issue that Americans are concerned about. Whether we're talking about the economy and the cost of living, something that was drastically lower for most Americans under President Trump than what they've experienced over the last four years. We look at border security. We look at crime. We look at domestic policy and foreign policy.
 
In each of these areas, President Trump will continue to share with voters, his record of success, and remind them about how, overall, the quality of life for the American people was much better, under him, and why he looks forward to coming back into office, to improve their quality of life, once again.
 
COLLINS: You helped prep for the first debate. Do you think a second debate where -- you know, I heard from some advisers, and allies, who thought he did not do a good enough job, drawing that contrast the first time. Do you think a second debate where maybe he did that for would be helpful to him, when we look at these numbers?
 
GABBARD: Yes, Kaitlan, I think -- I think the numbers that you just showed, people's opinions on the debate versus how they're actually going to vote, that the race is still very close, kind of just illustrates, frankly, how these debates have become nothing more than political theater, that political pundits like to focus on, and talk about a lot. And a lot of the mainstream media likes to talk about the debates.
 
But when it comes down to voters, what they really care about most are hearing from these candidates, about their issues and about their record.
 
And so, I've had personal experience with this, when I ran for President in 2020. It was a frustrating situation where you've got, what, 90 seconds, maybe two minutes, to talk about very serious issues that people are impacted by every day.
 
So, President Trump's going to continue to stay focused. He is working hard. He is traveling and going and seeing voters exactly where they are.
 
COLLINS: You talked about a disciplined campaign, and having that. When Trump is in North Carolina, on Saturday, a must-win state. Do you share the concerns that others have about Mark Robinson, and the new reporting that came out today about the candidate, and the comments that he's made? Given Trump has emphatically endorsed him, do you think he should disavow him?
 <br>[21:35:00]
 
GABBARD: Based on what I've seen in the news today, those are questions for Mark Robinson.
 
President Trump is running for president, not Mark Robinson. So, what I know is that he is going to continue to stay very focused, on his mission, and not be distracted from his effort, to try to save our country, from the disaster that would occur if Kamala Harris is elected as our President and Commander-in-Chief. And so, that's what's driving him. That's what he cares most about. And that's what he's going to continue to stay focused on doing.
 
COLLINS: Yes. I just think we've heard concerns about whether it hurts turnout, or how Republicans in North Carolina feel about that, of course, with Mark Robinson at the top of the ticket, of course, underneath Donald Trump, as he's running in that state.
 
But I want to ask you about another issue in this election, because you've very -- spoken very candidly and really personally about a struggle that you've had with IVF, which is something that--
 
GABBARD: Yes.
 
COLLINS: --I think a lot of women can relate to. I know a lot of women can relate to, because we've had many of them on this show.
 
I wonder if you have concerns that the Trump-Vance ticket alienates other women, who may have gone through that, when we are talking about past comments on childless cat ladies, or when Governor Sanders -- Sarah Sanders of Arkansas, is saying her kids humble her, but Harris doesn't have anyone to humble her.
 
GABBARD: I think those things are some of the many distractions away from actually sharing with voters what President Trump's position is on IVF.
 
I spoke to him about this. He didn't know, I was going to ask him a question. He didn't know what I was going through. But we did a town hall, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where I shared with him the struggles that my husband and I went through, in trying to start our own family, and how we went through multiple rounds of IVF, as part of that process. And unfortunately, it didn't work out for us. But it does help so many families.
 
And President Trump shared with me what he has been consistent in all along, is how much he supports people's efforts, who are going through these struggles, how much he supports IVF, even going farther than I think anyone else has, as far as I know in politics, and making sure that we have access.
 
As you know, it's extremely expensive. Even for service members in the military, TRICARE doesn't cover IVF. So, for him to take that action and say he wants to make sure that it's accessible for everyone, even if you don't have money?
 
This is the truth about President Trump's position, on this, as well as a whole host of other issues that Vice President Kamala Harris, and many in the mainstream media, continue to lie about and foment fear about, as though he is not supportive of families and women, who are going through this very tough period.
 
COLLINS: Yes, we've never said that he's not supportive of IVF. I mean, he himself has stated that. But you're the Transition Co-chair. And Trump's plan about paying -- either having the government pay for it or insurers cover it. Is there a plan in the works to develop that? Because Tom Cotton told me, earlier this week, that he had not been briefed on one yet.
 
GABBARD: Well, President Trump is focused on earning the trust and confidence and votes of Americans in this country. As you pointed out, we have just what, 46, 47 days left before Election Day, and that's what he's focused his energy on right now.
 
I know there are people, who are working on the policy front. But he is very much focused on getting out there, and speaking the truth, about his record and Kamala Harris' record, so that people can understand the truth, and not be distracted by all of these other things.
 
COLLINS: Tulsi Gabbard, thank you for joining us tonight.
 
GABBARD: Thanks, Kaitlan.
 
COLLINS: Up next. The Mayor of Springfield, Ohio is now claiming emergency powers, tonight, to deal with threats amid false claims about Haitian migrants there, that have been spread by Donald Trump and, his running mate, J.D. Vance.
 
We're going to tell you what's going to happen there, right after a quick break.
 <br>[21:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COLLINS: Tonight, the Mayor of Springfield, Ohio, has granted himself temporary emergency powers, as bomb threats have upended life for his city.
 
The threats, of course, coming after what we saw happen, on that debate stage, where Donald Trump, followed by his running mate, J.D. Vance, earlier in the day, amplified false claims that Haitian migrants in town are kidnapping and eating people's pets.
 
Two Walmarts and a Planned Parenthood center were evacuated, just yesterday.
 
While Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, has said all of these threats were hoaxes. The impact is very clearly still being felt in the community.
 
Joining me tonight is the host of CNN's new show, "HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU" Roy Wood Jr.
 
And it's great to have you here.
 
Because I think it's, you know, given everything that's going on, in this campaign, it's pretty remarkable that this is still something that's happening for this sustained of a period. I just wonder what you make of how things got to this point. ROY WOOD JR., CNN HOST, "HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU": I think that Republicans know that if they can run on fear, the more fear that they can stoke, then the better off they are.
 
My question is -- and I don't know anything. I'm not a legal expert in anything like that, Kaitlan Collins. At what point is this lawsuit- worthy on some slander and libel, from the City of Springfield, to specifically J.D. Vance?
 
Was it the other night where he said, I'm still going to call them illegal aliens? Even though we've already had a conversation that made it perfectly clear that a lot of these people, most of them, are there, legally, and were asked there by a Republican mayor, on an initiative, way back during the Haitian earthquake.
 <br>[21:45:00]
 
So, how long can Republicans stoke the fire before you start having to hit their pockets on this?
 
COLLINS: Yes, well, and we also heard from Vance, saying that it's up to the media to fact-check their claims. Obviously, the media certainly has, and not found any basis for this. 
 
And The Wall Street Journal published a fantastic report, yesterday. They just dug deep into one of the allegations, where an owner, of a cat that goes by the name "Ms. Sassy," had made this 9-1-1 call, essentially alleging she believed that her cat had been taken.
 
To -- the reporter, who followed up on this, found days later that the cat was actually found safe, in her own basement, and she apologized to her Haitian neighbors, over this. I mean, that's the level that this has gotten to.
 
WOOD JR.: Yes, I think that we're in a place now, where if the Mayor has to take charge, because there's so many bomb threats, and people are in lockdown at work, the kids aren't able to learn and do anything in school, because of this nonsense, either? I think it's at a point where there has to be some degree of legal recourse here.
 
Because this is not -- this is not cool. It's not -- it's definitely not normal. And it's not how politics is supposed to run in the country.
 
COLLINS: Trump has been talking about potentially going there.
 
The Mayor had warned either Trump or Harris, just either of them coming there would add just a further strain, to the city that is dealing with 20,000 new people who live there, and also now dealing with bomb threats at schools, at City Hall, at Planned Parenthoods, at Walmarts.
 
Listen to what Donald Trump had to say about maybe going to Springfield, last night.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I'm going to go there, in the next two weeks. I'm going to Springfield and I'm going to Aurora.
 
(CHEERING) 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
TRUMP: You may never see me again, but that's OK. Got to do what I got to do. Whatever happened to Trump? Well, he never got out of Springfield.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: How do you think people living in Springfield feel about all this?
 
WOOD JR.: I think there's still, sadly, some people in Springfield that will be happy to see the man. I think there's some people in Springfield. The question becomes, is Trump there to stoke the fire? Or is he there to actually try and add some degree of mediation?
 
If I'm not mistaken, it was Trump, a couple of days ago, who was saying, Oh, well, maybe we shouldn't be pushing all of the rhetoric, like he was quasi, kind of, sort of disagreeing with J.D. Vance. And now, he's going to go there and stir everything up?
 
I don't -- I don't think he should go there. I, of all the states where Republicans are struggling right now, I don't think that's the state Trump need to be visiting this week. Now -- maybe swing down to North Carolina, and check on your boy. But leave the people of Springfield alone.
 
COLLINS: What do you make of what's happening, in North Carolina, with Mark Robinson?
 
And he had a litany of offensive comments that he made before KFILE published this report, today, with comments that are so disturbing, you literally, you can't say them on cable news.
 
And I just wonder, when you see this candidate for governor, an incredibly powerful position, in North Carolina, who previously called himself a Black Nazi, supported -- expressed support for slavery. What do you say to that?
 
WOOD JR.: Yes, not just support for slavery. Said he would buy a couple of slaves, like they're sneakers. I think that it's the ultimate hypocrisy. But if I'm not -- at least as of 4 o'clock, this afternoon, I know he released a statement, saying that he was not going to drop out of the race.
 
And when you look at what's happened with J.D. Vance, and everything, in Springfield, Republicans are just going, Yes, the truth doesn't matter. No one cares. People like me. I'm polling decently. So, I'm just going to keep doing this.
 
But so much of what I think -- I think with North Carolina, because there's so much of a religious base there, and you look at the evangelical community being a large part of the Republican base in that state, I don't know how you get by going to a porn site past the voters. I don't know.
 
The most interesting thing I found out about this whole case, with Mark Robinson, is that that site is still active, and people are still posting there. And I was like, goodness gracious, this site is like listening to vinyl. They're like, it's just links. There's no thumbnails. You don't know what you're getting into. I'm not getting into the details.
 
But it's just, it's wrong, it's hilarious, it's terrible. And he's still probably going to come close to winning the gubernatorial seat in North Carolina.
 
COLLINS: Roy Wood Jr., I did not think I would hear a comparison to vinyl, tonight. Thank you for joining us.
 <br>[21:50:00] 
 
And for everyone who enjoyed this conversation, so deeply as I did, you can see Roy. He will be with Amber and Michael, on a brand-new episode of "HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU," this Saturday, at an amazing hour, 9 o'clock, right here, on CNN.
 
Thank you.
 
WOOD JR.: Promise to be less behavioral, on Saturday.
 
COLLINS: Those who have--
 
WOOD JR.: I was very regal, today.
 
COLLINS: OK. We'll tune in to see what you're like, in 48 hours from now, and if Mark Robinson is still in the race. Thank you, Roy.
 
And tonight, up next, we are tracking a story we've been following all week here, on THE SOURCE. That is brand-new developments in that ongoing investigation into Sean "Diddy" Combs. As he remains behind bars tonight, we're learning a federal grand jury is not finished, but they're investigating.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[21:55:00]
 
COLLINS: New information we're learning, tonight, as a federal grand jury is still hearing from witnesses, looking into embattled hip-hop mogul, Sean "Diddy" Combs.
 
We've learned tonight that at least one male sex worker is expected to testify, before that grand jury, in the coming days. And prosecutors have been meeting with multiple people, who worked for him previously.
 
Combs, of course, pleaded not guilty, this week, after he was arrested and indicted, in New York, on Monday night, on sex trafficking and racketeering charges.
 
My source tonight is CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, and the former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig.
 
And Elie, this is so interesting. Because you and I have talked about this, essentially every night since it's developed. And what we're hearing tonight, from a source, is that the allegations from these witnesses, that federal agents have been meeting with, they actually go beyond the scope of the indictment that was unsealed, Tuesday morning.
 
What does that mean for that indictment, and just for his case overall, going forward?
 
ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Well, Kaitlan, prosecutors love to say, we always say, our investigation is ongoing. And the truth of the matter is, sometimes that's just boilerplate. You just automatically say that, when you indict, you're effectively done with your investigation. Not here. We now know that this investigation truly is ongoing.
 
And I've done cases, like this, with major numbers of victims in sex trafficking cases. These first two to three days after the indictment are crucial, for people to come forward, other victims, other witnesses. They see there's been an indictment.
 
And we remember, the U.S. Attorney, when he announced this case, a few days ago, said, If you believe you are a victim or witness, come forward, contact us.
 
So, this tells me that the prosecutors are not done, and they're still looking for, and thinking they're going to find new victims.
 
COLLINS: Have you -- when you were a prosecutor, did you find that after someone had been indicted, if they were held on bail, and -- or if they were held and not -- and did not have bail, weren't out on bail, that it did make people more comfortable coming forward?
 
HONIG: This is one of the hidden reasons why bail is so important.
 
I can't tell you how many times I sat with a victim, sometimes sex trafficking cases, sometimes other cases. Almost always, the first question out of their mouth, Is he locked up?
 
And if you can say to that person, Yes, he's locked up, he's at the MDC? That makes them feel so much more comfortable, so much more at ease, about coming forward. So, there's an enormous psychological effect here.
 
COLLINS: Yes. And we talked to Diddy's attorney. He's being represented by the defense attorney, Marc Agnifilo, about what was in the indictment, where they said that they had about 50 witnesses and victims.
 
This was the day that that indictment came down, after he was denied bail. Listen to what Diddy's attorney had to say to me about this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARC AGNIFILO, ATTORNEY FOR SEAN "DIDDY" COMBS: Yes, I think it's 49 witnesses and one victim. I think if you broke it down. And I say that because count two, which is the sex trafficking count, has victim number one, and there is no victim number two anywhere in the indictment.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: Now, I know you were skeptical of that claim, when he made it that night.
 
Do you think what we're seeing now, this new reporting of other people coming forward, that those numbers could be changing even more?
 
HONIG: Well, I remain skeptical of that claim. I think Marc was doing his job, as a defense lawyer there. I think he was engaging in some optimistic speculation.
 
First of all. If you're a prosecutor, and you tell the judge, as these prosecutors did, we have 50 victims and witnesses, and what that comes out to is one victim and 49 witnesses? You are going to undermine your own credibility. Real prosecutors do not do that. The SDNY does not do that.
 
Also, the indictment already refers to multiple victims in the plural. And all that can happen now with this new reporting is that that number continues to increase.
 
COLLINS: Can these new witnesses testify at trial, if they were not part of the investigation, as it stood, the indictment as it stood, whenever they arrested him, on Monday night? How does that work?
 
HONIG: Oh, for sure. Witnesses can testify even if they come forward during trial. I've had that happen. We sometimes say the investigation doesn't end until the jury comes back.
 
And so, if these are good prosecutors, they're working with a team of professional agents, law enforcement agents, they're going to continue to look for witnesses. They may want to put them in the grand jury now, moving forward, to make sure that the testimony is locked in.
 
But yes, you absolutely continue to build your case until it's all over.
 
COLLINS: Combs is being held at the MDC. It's in Brooklyn. He's been fighting this bail decision. They wanted to get him out the first night. They thought that, because they were just appearing before the first judge, that maybe they'd have a better chance.
 
When he's behind -- when he's being held, can he -- is he making phone calls? What does that look like? Because they were worried about potential witness tampering.
 <br>[22:00:00]
 
HONIG: Yes, so inmates at the MDC, and most federal prisons, can make phone calls. They even have email, nowadays, actually, Kaitlan. But both of those things are monitored. There's big signs up saying, Your phone calls will be recorded, your emails will be recorded as well. So, if he tries to do anything, prosecutors will know about it, and he's taking a big risk.
 
COLLINS: Elie Honig, thank you for that update.
 
Thank you all so much for joining us.
