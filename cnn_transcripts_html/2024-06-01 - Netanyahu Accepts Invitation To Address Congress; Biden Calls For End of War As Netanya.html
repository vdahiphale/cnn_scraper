JESSICA DEAN, CNN ANCHOR: You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hi, everyone.
 
I'm Jessica Dean in Washington.
 
And we have breaking news tonight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying he will address Congress accepting a joint invitation from the House and Senate. 
 
This comes as President Joe Biden on Friday outlined a peace plan for the war in Gaza that he says is from Israel. Hamas has said it views the plan positively, but Netanyahu is insisting that Israel's goals for the war have quote "not changed". 
 
And that's raising questions over its degree of support for the plan as outlined by Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7. That's one of Israel's made objective in this war. It's time for this war to end for the day after to begin.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now.
 
And Priscilla back to the original piece of information here, which is that the prime minister will be giving this address to a joint session of congress. 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Following an invitation by congressional leaders. Now, we don't have timing of when that address will happen, but it will happen after those remarks that happened yesterday by President Biden. That was a notable moment and it could be a pivotal one. The president as you heard there saying that Israel's stated goals have been met and that Hamas has been degraded and then calling for that end to the war as part of this hostage deal. 
 
Now he did outline what those three phases include. Some of these details we have discussed multiple times before and didn't change. But it was interesting to hear him outline and provide a little more meat on the bones here. 
 
So the first phase is similar to what's been laid out. It would include women, the elderly, and wounded -- those hostages, being released for a six-week ceasefire.
 
Now the second phase includes all hostages being released and all of this in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. 
 
And then perhaps a permanent ceasefire to follow. He said ceasefire would continue while negotiations continue.
 
And then the third would be the reconstruction of Gaza. This is not easy, but the president made very clear in his remarks yesterday that this is a decisive moment. 
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: This is truly a decisive moment. Israel's made their proposal. Hamas needs to take the deal. 
 
I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal. We can't lose this moment. 
 
Indefinite war in pursuit of an identified notion of total victory, that will not bring hostages home. That will not, not bring an enduring defeat of Hamas.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVAREZ: Now, as you mentioned, the Israeli prime minister said that he is not going to end the war until Hamas is defeated. 
 
So there's still a lot of questions and over the course of his remarks, the president was really citing his credibility with Israelis and noting that he has stood by them.
 
And also acknowledging that some in the Israeli government, were not going to take well to this deal. But just as we have talked time and time before about the president's conversations with world leaders about this hostage deal, so much of this has played out behind the scenes.
 
And then yesterday we saw the president put that enormous public pressure on Israel and all the parties involved to reach an agreement. And all of that really speaks to the moment we're in and the president wanting to see some forward movement here. 
 
Of course, the devil is always in the details.
 
DEAN: always and it really does seem though like he's trying to put his finger on that pressure point. Will it work? Priscilla Alvarez, thank you so much. Good to see you.
 
Joining us now to discuss this further foreign affairs columnist for "The Washington Post", David Ignatius". He's also the author the new thriller "Phantom Orbit". We're going to talk about that book in just a moment.
 <br>[17:04:51]
 
DEAN: But first, David, thanks so much for being here. Before we get to the book, which I do want to do in one second, I want to ask you about the news that we're just talking with Priscilla about. 
 
The president really trying to put the pressure on everybody to get this deal done. Is it -- is it possible at this point? Will it work?
 
DAVID IGNATIUS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, "THE WASHINGTON POST": Jessica, I know from my own reporting that there is agreement on the basic outlines of President Biden's plan from the military leadership in Israel. 
 
But clearly the Prime Minister himself is not prepared to support it publicly. Members of his coalition who are very right-wing have said they will leave the government if this deal goes forward. 
 
So Netanyahu in effect is caught by his own -- his own coalition. President Biden is trying to break through that logjam. He has support in Israel from some members of the war cabinet to do that. But we're seeing this is going to take a lot more pressure from the U.S. It's probably going to mean breaking up the current Israeli government to move forward. 
 
DEAN: Which really gets at the heart of it because, as you mentioned, Benjamin Netanyahu is really caught between moving forward, potentially moving forward, with some sort of deal while risking his own political situation. 
 
IGNATIUS: So friend of mine, Martin Indyk who was our ambassador to Israel said to me months ago, that the basic U.S. strategy was to make Prime Minister Netanyahu swallow the frog, meaning the basic peace plan we have or choke on the frog meaning his government collapses because he can't accept it. 
 
So I think that's exactly where we are right now. Can he swallow it? Doesn't appear that he can. Will he choke on it and the government falls. 
 
We'll see.
 
DEAN: And you recently wrote a column about what comes when this war is over, which is a looming question that looms over these peace talks. It is -- it is kind of the big question out there and your first line is tell me how this war ends, because it is a big question. And are we getting more clarity? 
 
IGNATIUS: So what President Biden is trying to do, and I think he's doing this with help, encouragement from Israeli military leaders is describe how this war ends, describe the pathway to the end, and the day after. Begin thinking about governance in Gaza. 
 
Those are questions that many Israelis are prepared to address, but some in Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition are not ready to address. And that's the basic impasse here. 
 
You know, this is a vision of how this terrible war that's caused so much suffering does finally come to a close. 
 
And President Biden, I would commend him for pressing that. The problem is there's not yet a consensus in Israel about that path forward.
 
DEAN: Right. 
 
Let's talk about Ukraine, because that kind of brings us also to your book. 
 
How did those -- how does this very current issue now, weave into the book you just wrote.
 
IGNATIUS: So I just so was in Ukraine some weeks ago and I was struck again by the win which the one Ukraine is the first space war. 
 
It's a war in which space weapons provided by the United States, space systems that allow Ukraine to communicate, target the Russians are crucial to them in this war.
 
The Russians increasingly, I think are looking for ways to jam the space systems, disable them. 
 
That's essentially the plot of my novel "Phantom Orbit". It's all about in a Ukraine war kind of situation, these two sides would play with weapons that most of us don't know anything about in space. But that's how this war is going to go forward. And that's how the next war is going to begin.
 
DEAN: Right.
 
And so it is, it is kind of a wild thing because you're describing it, you think this must be science fiction, but it is playing out before our very eyes.
 
IGNATIUS: Well, this is a novel, but its describing the reality that I see on every reporting trip I take to Ukraine, which is that these new weapons of the future that most of us don't know anything about have become decisive. 
 
The Russians know that. The Russians are thinking of crazy space weapons detonating a nuclear bomb in low-earth orbit to disable the systems that allow Ukraine to survive. 
 
And that's (INAUDIBLE) the story I'm trying to tell in this novel, "Phantom Orbit". 
 
DEAN: So let's talk about some of the reporting on the ground and what you've seen. 
 
President Biden has now authorized Ukraine to carry out this limited strikes inside Russia using us defense weapons, which is a change, it is a shift. Will that make a difference? And how much of a difference might it make?
 
IGNATIUS: So I think it will make a difference in the immediate issue of whether the Russians will be able to sweep with large forces towards Kharkiv, take Kharkiv, the second largest Ukrainian city, by some counts and begin to break those Ukrainian defense lines. 
 
Ukrainians have to the U.S., we need weapons that can hit the Russians where they in effect have sanctuary just over the border. 
 
So the weapons that will be used are mainly artillery pieces that are very precisely targeted. The U.S. has very modern artillery. Maybe some short-range rockets.
 <br>[17:09:47]
 
IGNATIUS: What President Biden is not prepared to do yet is give the Ukrainians long-range systems that could go in -- deep into Russia, which Russia would regard as -- as fundamentally threatening to their country.
 
DEAN: But does it still come with some risk if they were to hit accidentally civilians or something of that, you know, some -- 
 
IGNATIUS: So this is an escalatory step and it risks the thing that we all dread, which is a direct confrontation between the U.S. and Russia. 
 
I think in terms of escalation by Russia, the next step would be tactical nuclear weapons and the Chinese have been sending signals. China is a key player in this in that the Chinese have said to Russia, we fundamentally oppose the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Don't do it. And they're reaffirming that view recently. 
 
And I think that's an important caution for Russia. They would -- they would risk losing their key ally and supporter China.
 
DEAN: And other NATO allies are considering following suit and allowing weapons to be used to strike Russia.
 
How does this play into NATO and the broader conversation that we're having about that as well. 
 
IGNATIUS: We'll see. There's a NATO summit coming up this summer here in Washington. The NATO Secretary General was urging President Biden to open the use of these weapons to begin to fire on Russia. I think we have to remember that Europe feels fundamentally threatened
 
 by what Russia is doing in Ukraine. This is a big war -- big, bloody war in the middle of Europe as we get ready to celebrate D-Day we think we haven't seen anything like this in Europe since 1945. 
 
Europeans are frightened by it. They know that Russia is increasingly threatening them. They feel -- threatening their countries. NATO is the alliance that is trying to stop that kind of aggression so I think Americans need to realize this may seem like it's a long way away, but for Europeans it's right next door. 
 
DEAN: It is truly right next door. 
 
And help connect the dots for everyone. Ukraine, what's going on with Israel fighting against a proxy war with Iran and then this -- and then it developed into a direct -- direct strikes back and forth. China, Taiwan -- how does that all start to fit together? 
 
IGNATIUS: So one way to think about this, I think is whether the United States power and credibility is sufficient to deter aggression. 
 
And what we've seen unfortunately, in Ukraine is that we didn't deter the Russians. We warned the Russians. We said that the heavy sanctions, we said we would arm Ukraine, didn't deter them.
 
Israel feels threatened by its adversary, American power backs up Israel. I think there is some deterrence value, but you know, Israel lives in fear that Hezbollah tomorrow could launch a volley of a thousand rockets from Lebanon and wouldn't be deterred. 
 
So I think American power matters in these moments when other countries decide they're going to take, try to take advantage of situations as Russia's done, as Hamas has done.
 
And you know, our credibility matters. People look at our country, I have had a foreign leader just say recently to me. Your country is so uncertain politically. We look at your election coming up. We don't know where you're going. And we worry about that.
 
And that's again goes to our credibility when we make promises.
 
DEAN: Yes. It is, it is really a fascinating moment that is so connected all the way around. 
 
David, your book is "Phantom Orbit". It's a thriller. 
 
Thank you so much for being here. 
 
IGNATIUS: Thanks. Thanks for having me.
 
DEAN: Great to see you.
 
Still ahead, will Trump's status as a convicted felon help or hurt him with voters. We're breaking down the numbers. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 <br>[17:13:28]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DEAN: The likely Republican presidential candidate now a convicted felon. A Manhattan jury finding Donald Trump guilty of falsifying business records in order to influence the 2016 election. 
 
And the big question now, will Trump's status as a convicted felon help or hurt him with voters?
 
CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten -- I'm giving you a new -- a new name -- 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Whatever.
 
DEAN: -- joins us to run the numbers. 
 
Harry, I am genuinely curious to see what the polls say if this matters one way or the other or not really.
 
ENTEN: Yes, Henry Enten's going to answer your question. 
 
DEAN: We love Henry.
 
ENTEN: That's right. He's my alter ego.
 
Here's the situation. You know, we've had at least one poll that came out over the last 24 hours that was taken since the conviction of Donald Trump here in New York. 
 
And what it shows is essentially that there may have been slight movement in the presidential race, right? 
 
Anyone who thought that Joe Biden was going to jump out to a 10-point lead, or Donald Trump was going to jump out to a template late, I'm sorry to disappoint you. 
 
But what we see here is this is according to Reuters/IPSOS, before the New York conviction the race was tied. We have seen slight movement towards Joe Biden in this one particular poll where now Biden's ahead by two. 
 
I will note, I've looked at some other data as well, and it seems to be consistent with this poll. That is that there is slight, and I mean, slight movement towards the current president. 
 
Now, of course, I would say that's notable because the race has been so close as it is. There really hasn't been any movement over the last six months. Nothing has seemed to shift this race at all. 
 
So if in fact we do see even a small movement in Joe Bidens direction, it's something that's certainly welcome, especially if it funnels down to the state-level. 
 <br>[17:19:49] ENTEN: And we're talking about states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, because if you see a movement there of two points in Joe Biden's direction, all of a sudden the electoral college you're looking at a race that instead of tilts towards Donald Trump is really tilting towards nobody and it's a race too close to call.
 
Of course, Jessica, these are early days yet. We'll have to wait and see what happens as more of this new sinks in, one way or the other. 
 
We may see more of movement, but at this particular point, what we're seeing in the initial polling is slight movement, not towards the former president, but towards the current one. 
 
DEAN: And it's been a rough stretch for Trump in New York.
 
ENTEN: Yes. It's not exactly been a great stretch for him in the New York court system. Obviously, 34 felonies is not something you would necessarily want, but of course, there've been civil cases as well, right. E. Jean Carroll, the New York attorney general fraud case, where Donald Trump now has upwards of $500 million. 
 
So Donald Trump likes to call himself a winner, but when it comes to court cases in the state of New York, he is -- there's really only one term for it -- a big, fat loser. 
 
That is what he is in the court system in New York whether you look on the civil side or the criminal side. 
 
DEAN: And what about Rudy Giuliani, the D.C. Law Licensing Board, just recommended he be disbarred. Of course, he was a celebrated mayor of New York and now he's here.
 
ENTEN: Yes, now he's here you know, my father who passed away a few years ago, was reappointed to the bench by Rudy Giuliani here in the city of New York. If only he could see where Rudy is right now.
 
Look, this is a slide I put up occasionally. It's sort of the Mendoza (ph) line of popularity. 
 
Can you in fact beat the percentage of Americans who believed that the U.S. faked landing on the moon or believe that the earth is flat. And Rudy Giuliani is right on that edge of that Mendoza line. Only 16 percent of Americans now hold a favorable view of Rudy Giuliani. That's just above the percentage of Americans who believe that the U.S faked the moon landing and just above the percentage of Americans who believe that the earth is flat.
 
The fact is Rudy Giuliani, who was once America's mayor, who once had a favorable rating a little less than 25 years ago, just after 9/11 of north of 70 percent close to 80 percent -- he has fallen so far from the graces. Most Americans do not want to have to do anything with Rudolph Giuliani. 
 
DEAN: Ok. A quick, a topic change here. 
 
There's some major news -- ENTEN: Yes.
 
DEAN: -- coming in from the soda world. Where are we seeing a shakeup in the race to be America's favorite cola? 
 
ENTEN: Yes. So you know, Coke is still number one, but number two -- 
 
DEAN: I see that there.
 
ENTEN: -- we've gone from Pepsi being a clear number 2, to now, Dr. Pepper has come up in the rankings. Pepsi, the percentage of sales that assigned to Pepsi have dropped by nearly half in the last nearly 30 years. 
 
Dr. Pepper has come up. One of the big things that Dr. Prepper has been doing is doing these viral videos on TikTok and one of the things that they've done is they've taken Dr. Pepper -- I have my diet here, I'm watching my figure. And they've been basically combining it with pickles.
 
They've been combining it with pickles and I decided that I in fact, am going to do a taste test here with you live on the air where I'm going to take some pickles. I'm going to mix it with some diet Dr. Pepper.
 
Let me tell you how it goes. 
 
DEAN: Well, you put it in the cup?
 
ENTEN: This is a very interesting taste, I will tell you that -- 
 
DEAN: I know. 
 
ENTEN: I'm not sure -- 
 
DEAN: -- since your face is like this.
 
ENTEN: I don't think its necessarily the best thing in the world. It's a rather interesting concoction, but God bless Dr. Pepper if they're finding that this is driving sales because for me, it wouldn't necessarily do so. 
 
I give it a C minus maybe, but I love diet Dr. Pepper, ill drink it solo. 
 
DEAN: Yes, solo is very good. I don't know that you need to add anything to it. 
 
Yes, I get that piece out of your mouth.
 
ENTEN: I don't think you need to add -- no, I don't think you have to add anything to it, but you know, I think I'll have a pickle individually.
 
DEAN: Ok. 
 
ENTEN: And mix it downwards from diet Dr. Pepper. That's much better. 
 
DEAN: You want to separate it out. 
 
All right. Harry Enten is getting to the bottom of things for us as always. Thank you very much. 
 
ENTEN: I try. 
 
DEAN: Good to see you.
 
ENTEN: Bye, Jessica.
 
DEAN: Still ahead, Republicans inside and outside MAGA world are reacting to former president Trump's verdict. How the party of law and order is helping undermine, the U.S. justice system.
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 <br>[17:24:07]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DEAN: The first thing Donald Trump did after being convicted in his historic criminal trial was rant against the justice system. 
 
The former president calling his situation unfair, while also falsely claiming that the trial was rigged by Joe Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're living in a fascist state. It all comes out of the White House. Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: The former president's supporters quickly coming to his defense and claiming the trial was a disgrace.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): This is like you're seeing communist countries. This is what I grew up having people in this community tell me about it happened in the days after the Castro revolution. 
 
Obviously those lead to executions. This on the other hand, is an effort to interfere in an election. 
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OHIO): I think this is disgraceful. I don't care what you call it, Wolf -- 
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: -- disgraceful? Is that what you're saying?
 
VANCE: I think this proceeding, this legal proceeding is disgraceful. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) DEAN: Joining us now, a CNN senior political commentator and Republican strategist Ana Navarro and Karen Finney, CNN political commentator and former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Great to see both of you. 
 
Ana, let's start with you. These comments made by Trumps supporters, we've seen them now fan out. We just played a couple of clips. 
 
How do you see this playing out over the next couple of months as we head into the fall?
 <br>[17:29:50]
 
ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, look I think for most of us that are clear-eyed, it's obvious what's happening here, which is that there's people like J.D. Vance, like Marco Rubio, like Tim Scott, who are auditioning to be Trump's VP and they are in a contest with each other as to who can say the most outrageous things.
 
In my view, what Marco Rubio said, comparing the U.S. legal system to the Communist Cuba legal system is one of the most disrespectful, offensive things I've ever heard. 
 
And I say this, Marco was born here. I was born in Cuba. I fled Communism. His family came here before Castro. My family fled it. I know exactly what it's like to live in a country, and I know exactly what those sham courts are like, that did lead to executions.
 
And shame on Marco Rubio, shame on Marco Rubio, for comparing what happened in Cuba, what happens in Nicaragua, what happens in Venezuela, what happens in those countries that he knows only too well, to this, just to curry favor with Donald Trump. 
 
That is the height of the irresponsibility and recklessness and servility. 
 
DEAN: And, Karen, an NPR poll that was taken before the verdict came down, found that 67 percent say the verdict makes no difference to their vote, 17 percent say it will make them less likely to vote for Trump, 15 percent more likely.
 
There is a lot of ink being spilled, minutes on television being taken up of all of us trying to look into our crystal ball and say, what does this mean and who will benefit? Does anyone benefit? 
 
How -- how do you see it playing out?
 
KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: So actually just getting the honest answer is, we don't know and we may not know for a few weeks. Because I think it's going to move to -- remember, we keep saying it but I think it bears saying again, this is precedented. This has never happened. 
 
And so I think Americans probably need a minute or two to absorb this, particularly because most Americans are going about their daily lives. And perhaps, this weekend, as they're checking in with the news about what happened this week, really starting to absorb not just the fact that Donald Trump has been convicted of a crime, but the crime was actually towards trying to win the 2016 election, right? 
 
He broke the law in an effort to help himself for the 2016 election while he's facing charges both trying to impede in the 2020 election and potentially overturn it. Right? So that's a lot for people to absorb.
 
But I think the question will really be, when people go to the ballot box, they're going to have to ask themselves, do I really want to vote for a criminal, a convicted criminal? Is that the person who I trust with my future? 
 
Or do I trust Joe Biden, who's a good, decent man, who I think most people think they may disagree if the job is done, but I think they believe he's been trying his best. 
 
And so I think that contrast is all the more underscored. And I think that's the question people will have to ask themselves. 
 
DEAN: And, Ana, I want to stay with your points from just a moment ago about -- about how some of these Republicans, what they're saying in light of this verdict.
 
I want to talk about how Speaker Mike Johnson, he's accused Democrats of crafts of weaponizing the judicial system. We can play a little clip of what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): We're outraged by it. I think the American people are. What happened to President Trump is lawfare. There's no other way to describe it. They went after him, the Democrat Party, and they use the system of justice to go after a political opponent. 
 
I think that this will probably guarantee that President Trump is re- elected president. And I think their strategy is going to backfire on them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: Ana, if we zoom out, Hunter Biden, the president's son, is about to go on trial. 
 
Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, is on trial on bribery allegations. 
 
Speaker Johnson has said that the Supreme Court should take action.
 
How corrosive is it to try to tell the American people that politically it is the Democrats coming after the Republicans?
 
NAVARRO: One of the -- one of the things that makes America unique around the world is that, in our country, supposedly nobody is above the law. And there is a certain equality of the law. We're all equal under the eyes of Lady Justice.
 
And so what they are trying to do here and maligning, attacking, criticizing, undermining our legal system, I think it's very dangerous and very damaging. 
 
It's also very much of a lie. Because for them to claim -- there's a lot of Republicans out there, I've heard them, I've read them, saying that Joe Biden is behind this. 
 
I don't know how many times we have to say this. This was a state legal action. This had nothing to do with Joe Biden. 
 <br>[17:35:04]
 
Joe Biden's DOJ is the one that actually going to be trying Hunter Biden in the next few days. 
 
But Donald Trump was tried in the state of New York. And he was indicted not by Joe Biden's DOJ, not by anybody having to do with Joe Biden. He was indicted by a grand jury of 12 regular New Yorkers. 
 
He was convicted by a grand jury of 12 regular New Yorkers after they listened to six weeks of legal proceedings and testimony, including from people who like and support Donald Trump, like Hope Hicks, like Pecker, people who are on his side, but who went on there and testified as to the truth.
 
That's why Hope Hicks was crying on the stand because she knew that the things she was saying -- she was saying were true were causing harm to the case of Donald Trump. 
 
So people need to understand that. It was the evidence that led a jury of regular New Yorkers to convict Donald Trump. It was not Joe Biden.
 
I guess -- I'd venture to guess that Joe Biden is actually -- politically speaking, wouldn't have liked for this to be the case and it's not focusing on this as part of the campaign. He is focusing on beating him on the ballot box.
 
DEAN: And, Karen, it's interesting because, in 2016, Trump attacked Hillary Clinton and said she would not be fit for office if she was indicted. 
 
So let's listen to what he said. This is 2016.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If she we're to win this election, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. 
 
In that situation, we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and, ultimately, a criminal trial. It would grind government to a halt.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) DEAN: It's -- it's kind of unbelievable there. It would grind government to a halt. He's kind of describing his own situation. Karen.
 
FINNEY: Oh, yes. I remember it quite well when he said it. And I think the other thing he actually said, I believe, in those remarks was how much chaos there would be if Hillary Clinton was elected president. So just let all of that sink in for just a moment. 
 
Look, I think we have to take a step back here, as a couple of things. As Anaa points out, you're seeing the Republican Party fall over itself, for the most part, to show their fealty to Donald Trump, to undermine our justice system. 
 
And it is very dangerous for the country. But I think it's for us to remember, too, this is what Trump has brought on our country. And it's also the Trumpism that he has brought to our politics.
 
And I agree absolutely with Ana. She's right. Joe Biden wants to beat Donald Trump at the ballot box. And that is the focus. 
 
It will be for others to -- you know, those of us here to comment about what this means. I think that's why you saw the president come out Friday and have a very serious press conference about what's happening in the Middle East.
 
But of course, it's not surprising that Donald Trump isn't -- is an absolute hypocrite. I mean, as President Biden says often, right, you can't just love the rules and then be mad when you don't win. 
 
You don't just love our country when it's convenient. You have to love our country and believe in our democracy when it hurts and when you don't always get what you want. 
 
But I think this is probably one of the first times Donald Trump has not gotten away with, you know, his usual shtick, which he's, frankly, got away with for decades in New York.
 
DEAN: All right, Ana Navarro and Karen Finney, our thanks to both of you. Always good to see you both. We really appreciate it.
 <br>[17:38:56]
 
And we'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

DEAN: The president's son, Hunter Biden, is heading to trial this week on federal gun charges. Hunter Biden had tried to delay the key several times, but jury selection is set to start Monday in Delaware. 
 
The case has nothing to do with his business dealings. That's a topic, of course, of much scrutiny among Republican lawmakers over the last few years. But instead, this case involves a firearm that Hunter Biden is accused
 
 of buying illegally after swearing on a federal form he was not a drug user.
 
It's not clear how long that trial might last, but the prospect of a felony conviction for the president's son as well as possible jail time is not -- certainly not welcome news for the Biden administration as the election approaches in November.

DREW EVANS, SUPERINTENDENT, MINNESOTA BUREAU OF CRIMINAL APPREHENSION: Officer Mitchell was attempting to assist the individual that shot him. And with that, it happened very fast and that he ambushed him.

WILD: Mitchell had been on the force just three days.

Meanwhile, the police officer and the firefighter who were injured have both been released from the hospital.

DEAN: We do want to bring you a quick clarification. In the last segment we showed you the wrong video in that story about a black airman fatally shot in his home by a sheriff's deputy in Florida. We regret that error.
 
New tonight, South Korea is warning the public to watch out for objects falling from the sky after North Korea flew even more balloons with trash and filth over the border today.
 
North Korea is calling it freedom of expression and retaliation for South Korea sending propaganda, food, news, and K-Pop into North Korea. The incoming balloons also raised fears of more serious attack in South Korea first. 
 
Here's CNN's Will Ripley.

WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The failed launch of a suspected North Korean military spy satellite sparking fears of falling debris in Japan, triggering emergency sirens on Okinawa Tuesday morning.
 
(SIRENS)
 
RIPLEY: Tuesday night, in South Korea, blaring cell phone alerts like this.
 
(CELL PHONE ALERT)
 
RIPLEY: 0minous warnings turned out to be overblown. No satellite or missile debris.
 
North Korean balloons, more than 260 of them, raining down trash and fertilizers, South Korea says, on neighborhoods like this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): I have goosebumps. It felt like a childish prank. I was surprised to hear about it. 
 
RIPLEY: Kim Yo-Jong, younger sister of the North Korean leader, issued a statement, calling the balloons a form of freedom of expression, a response to South Korean activists who'd been sending balloons to North Korea for years, carrying leaflets condemning Kim Jong-Un's government. 
 
Herr statement says, "Though South Koreans only see balloons flying south and not the balloons flying north, now the trashy South Koreans are brazenly claiming that their leaflet distribution against us is freedom of expression. And our corresponding actions are a clear violation of international law. 
 
South Korea's government says North Korea, heavily restrictive, but labeling its balloon activity these as freedom of expression is self- contradictory.
 <br>[17:55:05] 
 
The United Nations command in South Korea is formally investigating North Koreas balloon launched, calling it irresponsible and a public health risk.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation); Why are they sending things like this? I'm worried that they might send something dangerous.
 
RIPLEY: Fighters for a free North Korea, a North Korean defector group based in South Korea, vows to continue sending balloons north, telling CNN, they sent leaflets, $1 bill, and during covid, vitamins, masks and Tylenol.
 
They say North Korea sent back filth in response. That's barbaric.
 
On Thursday, North Korea launched something more familiar, what's believed to be a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles. Kim's sister says, more balloons may be coming, dismissing South Korean outrage as nothing but hot air.
