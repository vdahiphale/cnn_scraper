JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: New details just in on the shooting rampage in Louisville, live streamed by the killer. This as we're getting new information about the wounded police officer fighting for his life.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: And, back on the job. A Tennessee lawmaker expelled from the statehouse sworn back into office just days after being ousted. What he now says he refuses to give up. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: A last ditch effort to keep abortion medication pills on the shelf after a federal judge's ruling in Texas. The Justice Department is stepping in. The clock is ticking down to a Friday deadline when those pills may no longer be available to women nationwide. 
 
We're following these major developing stories, and many more, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
BERMAN: I witnessed people being murdered. A manager with Old National Bank in Louisville describing the moment she watched a gunman on video begin shooting her co-workers during a virtual meeting. This morning, at least five people are dead, several others remain hospitalized after a 25-year-old opened fire inside a bank conference room. This was the nation's 146th mass shooting this year. We are now learning new details about the gunman, including that he recently found out he was going to be fired and that he streamed video of the shooting live on the internet.
 
Overnight, CNN also learned more about the victims, including a 26- year-old rookie officer who was hospitalized after being shot in the head. We're going to have much more on that in just a moment. 
 
First, CNN's Adrienne Broaddus in Louisville for us with the latest on the investigation. 
 
Adrienne, bring us up to speed on what you've learned this morning. 
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, John, I'm going to follow the lead of the interim chief of police and only say that shooter's name once, Connor Sturgeon. Investigators say he was still firing that AR-15-style rifle when they arrived on scene. Officers responding within three minutes of the first 911 call. 
 
We know the shooter worked here at the Old National Bank for more than a year, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before he became a full- time employee here, he interned with the bank. Now, a law enforcement source tells CNN the shooter learned he would be fired. It's unclear why he was going to be fired. The source says the 25-year-old shooter wrote a note for his parents and a friend detailing his intentions. Now, it's not clear when that note was found. 
 
And this is also tough news. The shooter livestreamed the shooting or the attack on Instagram. He also streamed it to a Monday morning bank meeting. And that is according to a manager who works here at the bank. This manager says she watched her co-workers be gunned down from her laptop, from her computer. 
 
Physical signs of the shooting have started to disappear outside. We can no longer see the shattered doors here. They've been covered with the - the bill -- not the billboards, but they've been covered. 
 
I want to go back and just think about that manager. She may have not been injured physically, but the emotional scars run deep. She can't erase those images from her mind. She can't put up a wooden board. So, our thoughts are with those people who survived. They may have not been injured, but they survived this shooting. And, obviously, they are dealing with something too, John.
 
BERMAN: It is the names of the victims, Adrienne, as you say, that are important for us to remember this morning. Thank you so much for being there. Please keep us posted/
 
And, Kate, I just have to say, the details are tragic and infuriating all at the same time.
 
BOLDUAN: And while the need for answers in this investigation is urgent and necessary, we know, as you were saying, keeping the focus on the victims is where the community is, as their focus is on their unspeakable and sudden loss now.
 <br>[09:05:09]
 
We are learning more about the five people who died in this tragedy. We want to show you. 
 
This is 40-year-old Josh Barrick. He was a husband and father of two. He coached first and second grade basketball at his church. And I want to play for you what his pastor said about him yesterday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHAYNE DUVALL, PASTOR, HOLY TRINITY CATHOLIC CHURCH: He's a big guy. A big guy. And just had a bubbling personality. And you could tell, he loved his family. He loved his faith. He loved this community. And he just loved life. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) BOLDUAN: And this is 63-year-old Tommy Elliott. He was a senior vice president at the bank. He served on multiple non-profit boards. And we've learned that he was also a close friend of both the Louisville mayor and Kentucky's governor, Andy Beshear. The governor spoke very emotionally of his personal connection and the loss of his friend yesterday. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): Tommy Elliott helped me build my law career, helped me become governor, gave me advice on being a good dad. He's one of the people I'd talked to most in the world and very rarely were we talking about my job.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: So many friends lost. So many lives, so many families, shattered.
 
Forty-five-year-old Juliana Farmer. She was a mother and grandmother who had just moved to Louisville to start her job at the bank as a loan analyst. Her aunt telling local news that this was only her third week on the job. 
 
And 64-year-old Jim Tutt. He'd been working at Old National Bank since 2015. He was a grandfather and served on the downtown Louisville Development Board. He was also known to be a huge University of Kentucky basketball fan. 
 
And 57-year-old Deana Eckert was the final victim to die in this tragedy. She passed away at the hospital last night. 
 
Now, one of the three victims who remain in the hospital today is 26- year-old Louisville Police Officer Nickolas Wilt. He was sworn in just 10 days ago. He remains in critical condition after being shot in the head. But, in a sliver of good news, the interim police chief told "CNN THIS MORNING" that there's hope. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
INTERIM CHIEF JACQUELYN GWINN-VILLAROEL, LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE: Officer Wilt is still in critical condition, but he's stable. But he's looking better. And so we're hopeful and we'll continue to pray. And we just thank, you know, everybody for all of their thoughts that have been sent our way as we deal with this tragedy. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Officer Wilt and two other officers injured in the shooting. They are being called heroes for their quick action in that initial response to the shooting.
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: Kate, with us now to talk about all of this is Keith Taylor, adjunct assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
 
Good morning to you, Professor. 
 
KEITH TAYLOR, ADJUNCT ASST. PROFESSOR, JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE: Good morning.
 
SIDNER: I can't help but ask this. We are all sick and tired of feeling helpless, of being heartbroken, of seeing this happen over and over and over again. I think this is the 16th shooting since just two weeks ago that shooting at the Covenant Elementary School in Nashville.
 
Are we just simply going to have to live with this as Americans? Is that where we are now?
 
TAYLOR: That's actually a two-part question. The answer is, if we do nothing as Americans, then we absolutely will see an increase in these types of unfortunate and preventable crimes. However, it is my belief that there are Americans of goodwill, regardless of their political parties or affiliations, that want common sense solutions that are effective, evidence based, and have the results that we desire. Most western countries don't have the kinds of issues that we have. School shootings, active shootings are a mostly American phenomenon, and we clearly can do much better. 
 
SIDNER: We talk about doing better, but time and again, when it comes to actual legislation, it doesn't happen in a big way and it certainly doesn't happen the way that Americans have asked for it because the vast majority who are polled always say there are certain things they want, like universal background checks. What is it going to take to move politicians forward to do something that is a very helpful legislation to try and stop this, or at least try and mitigate this?
 
TAYLOR: Politicians, as well as other stakeholders dealing with this situation have to look at the evidence. They have to look at the facts. They have to look at different aspects of this problem. It is a multifaceted problem dealing with many different aspects of how guns are used for crime, they're used for killings, many different ways in which this can be addressed. 
 
SIDNER: All right, the gunman had been notified that he was going to be fired. There were clearly some vengeful -- something vengeful that he -- he took part in this. He actually livestreamed this on Instagram according to our sources. 
 <br>[09:10:02]
 
And so what does this tell us about where he was as he is going about doing this -- this horrible shooting?
 
TAYLOR: Social media certainly has -- does play a role in how some of these motivations for notoriety can express themselves. So, social media can be the vehicle, the platform, by which people can show why they are doing what they're doing, and perhaps get others to emulate them as well. SIDNER: It's a really disturbing trend because it's something that, of
 
 course, before there was social media, we didn't see that. There was no vehicle for that. Now there is. Everybody has basically a television in their hand. 
 
I just want to ask you one last question. Was there anything that could have been done here? We now understand from our sources that there was a note that he wrote to his mom and to a friend that he was going to do something like this. We're not sure whether or not they saw it beforehand. But this happened in minutes. 
 
TAYLOR: So, the investigation is going to make plain all the different circumstances and possible opportunities for preventing it. But we have to remember that the adversary is intelligent. And as we create and adapt laws and processes and methods to deal with them, they are going to be looking to actively defeat those. And so we have to constantly be vigilant and consulate work to defeat this type of threat. 
 
SIDNER: Thank you so much. Keith Taylor joining us on this really -- another mass shooting in this country. And we are all sick and tired of it.
 
John. 
 
BERMAN: Sara, thanks so much. 
 
You know, you asked the question, is this something we're just going to have to live with? I want to put some statistics behind what we are living with. It's this new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found 54 percent of U.S. adults have either personally experienced or had a family member experience gun violence. Fifty-four percent. That includes witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or being injured or killed by a gun. About one in five adults say they have been threatened with a gun at some point in their life. About the same percent say a family member has been killed by a gun. One in five that includes suicide. Seventeen percent say they've witnessed someone being shot. 
 
And these experiences are especially common among black adults. They are twice as likely as white adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence. Astounding numbers, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, right -- right there. I mean you can see the evidence of how it has hit every corner of our society in just what you laid out, John. Thank you. 
 
Also at this hour, we are keeping a close eye on the White House, where President Biden will soon be departing and headed for Northern Ireland. The president's going overseas to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which mostly ended decades of sectarian violence. But there are still real concerns about the potential for future unrest. Northern Ireland's terrorism threat level was recently raised to severe ahead of Biden's visit. And just yesterday, masked men were seen throwing Molotov cocktails at police during a pro-Irish republican march in Northern Ireland. CNN's Nic Robertson is live in Belfast as they prepare for President
 
 Biden's visit. 
 
And, Nic, just on this note of concerns over future violence, we're also hearing just new reports of Northern Ireland, police are currently responding to reports of a suspicious device in Derry. What are you hearing about this? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, it's in exactly the same area where that parade took place yesterday. The parade ended in a cemetery. The police have gone into the cemetery where they say there was a suspicious device. That community around there - well, the parade itself was organized by a - by a - the political wing that - of - of the New IRA. That's the police's belief. They style themselves the IRA, the Irish Republican Army, carrying on what they see as the violent struggle against British rule here in Northern Ireland.
 
So, the police have gone into the cemetery there in Derry today. They say they've found a suspicious device. It is a contentious neighborhood for them to go into. They say they are respectful of that. If you're in that neighborhood, as we were yesterday, you see signs that say IRA, you see signs at the side of the road that have a silhouette of a gunman. There are signs of -- saying support the IRA in the cemetery yesterday. One of the speakers said, this is time to recruit to the IRA. 
 
I think as the police are in there, this will be contentious, and it could be a flashpoint. It's not unusual in Derry for the police to find suspicious devices that they would attribute to the New IRA. This is very unlikely to affect President Biden's visit in any way. But there could be trouble in Derry later today. 
 
BOLDUAN: All right, we're going to be tracking this as we are tracking President Biden's important trip to Northern Ireland and Ireland as he's about to depart.
 
Nic, thank you. 
 
Sara. 
 
SIDNER: Thank you, Kate.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
Just days after being expelled from the Tennessee statehouse, one of the two Democrats expelled has his seat back. How it happened, and his message to the Republicans who kicked him out.
 
Senate Democrats are demanding answers about those luxury trips that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failed to disclose. The tips -- the trips, excuse me, were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and paid for by a Republican mega donor. 
 
Also, the DOJ is asking an appeals court to keep a key abortion pill on the shelves after a Texas judge's ruling. We'll have all that just coming up. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER: On our radar this morning, President Biden has signed a bill immediately ending the Covid-19 national emergency. The legislation passed the House and Senate with broad bipartisan support. The separate public health emergency is actually still set to end on May 11th.
 
In Virginia, the mother of that six-year-old who shot and injured his first grade teacher in January has been indicted. 
 <br>[09:20:04]
 
Deja Taylor faces criminal charges of felony child neglect and child endangerment. A special grand jury will also investigate the shooting to determine if additional charges against anyone are warranted in that case.
 
And, a looming strike in Hollywood. Thousands of members of the Writers Guild of America begin voting tonight on whether to authorize a walkout. If they vote yes, they will go on strike if a new deal with the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers is not reached by May 1st. The writers are fighting for higher pay, residuals from streaming, and increased health fund contributions. 
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: So, first, expelled, and just as quickly reinstated. One Democratic Tennessee lawmaker is now back in his seat after being kicked out by Republicans for protesting on the statehouse floor. Nashville city council voted unanimously to return Justin Jones to his seat. He was sworn back in on the steps of the state capitol surrounded by supporters. He was one of the three Democratic lawmakers who had faced expulsion over their protest. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were expelled. Gloria Johnson was able to keep her seat. 
 
CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Nashville for us. 
 
Isabel, Justin Jones, he has -- now has his seat again. So, what's next for him? 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Kate, good morning to you. 
 
Jones says that he intends to file gun reform legislation. And since technically he's a new member, he can file up to 15 bills. He tells CNN that every single bill will have to do with common sense gun reform. And he plans to file those by the end of the week. He doesn't have a lot of time here, though, because summer break for the legislature is coming up here in three weeks. And, Kate, that's why yesterday that council vote to expedite the nomination process for Jones was so important because if that had failed, it would have taken four weeks to put him back in his seat. He would have missed the legislative session. And shortly after that council vote yesterday, Jones delivered a fiery speech, calling for the resignation of Republican Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton, who led the charge to expel Jones and Justin Pearson. 
 
Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTIN JONES (D), TENNESSEE STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Today we send a clear message to Speaker Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge. The people of Nashville have spoken today through their council members. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: And this morning, Representative Gloria Johnson, who survived that expulsion vote, she is also calling for Sexton to resign. 
 
Meanwhile, tomorrow, the Tennessee three could be reunited. Shelby County Commission will decide the future of Justin Pearson and whether to send him back to his seat. 
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Isabel, thank you so much for that.
 
John. 
 
BERMAN: Kate, new fallout over luxury trips Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from Republican mega donor Harlan Crow for years and did not disclose. The Senate Judiciary Committee says it will hold a hearing in the coming days. The panel's Democratic chair and 10 other Democratic members are also urging Chief Justice John Roberts to open an investigation. In a rare statement Friday, Justice Thomas said he was advised early in his tenure that, quote, this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends who did not have business before the court was not reportable. 
 
CNN's Lauren Fox joins us live from Capitol Hill. 
 
Lauren, what does the Judiciary Committee had planned? 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, Senate Democrats simply want answers. The first thing that they are asking for from Chief Justice John Roberts is an investigation into whether or not Clarence Thomas should have been disclosing the trips that he took with that Republican donor Harlan Crow, who Thomas said was a close personal friend and therefore he did not need to disclose those trips. But Democrats say that they also want to see the Supreme Court strengthen its ethics requirements, it's reporting requirements, to ensure that the American the public has faith in the Supreme Court's independence. 
 
And it's very interesting because Senate Democrats note in the letter they sent yesterday to the chief justice that they had requested a similar change back in 2011 when they asked Chief Justice John Roberts to accept and implement the judicial conference code of conduct. At the time, the argument from Chief Justice John Roberts was it wasn't necessary. 
 
Like you said, Democrats are going to hold a hearing on this. They have not released the list of witnesses that they expect to invite to that hearing, but they say it's coming in upcoming days. We expect that this is going to take center stage when lawmakers return from their Easter recess.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: It will be interesting to see where the accountability comes from. 
 
Lauren Fox, keep us posted. Thank you so much. Sara.
 
SIDNER: Right now, several states are stockpiling millions of abortion pills as a fight over the drug's fate now hangs on an appeals court.
 <br>[09:25:01]
 
Plus, a leaked, classified document reportedly reveals Egypt was secretly planning to send rockets to Russia, who is at war with Ukraine. Details ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BERMAN: All right, just in to CNN, new details, in fact, grim, new details about this mass shooting in Louisville. Investigators who have looked at an Instagram video say the gunman in the shooting fired his AR-15 style weapon inside the bank for about a minute.
