COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What`s up sunshine. Welcome to Tuesday, December 12th. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And tomorrow is #YourWordWednesday. So 
 
 follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. Put your unique vocabulary word and definition in the comment section of a most recent 
 
 post. And we`re going to choose a winner that we`ll have to work into tomorrow`s show. Put your school, your mascot and your teacher`s name in 
 
 there too, if you like, because we`d like to show some love to you for helping to bolster our vocab. 
 
We`re five weeks away from the first test of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The Iowa caucuses take place January 15th. And these aren`t 
 
 traditional elections. Caucuses can be more like meetings rather than an occasion where individuals say vote in the booth. Fifteen states and 
 
 territories in the United States use caucuses. Party members and party leaders use them to meet select delegates and show support for a 
 
 presidential candidate by public declaration. Caucuses often help choose delegates for the national conventions that will happen for both Republican 
 
 and Democratic parties next summer. 
 
So why do the Iowa caucuses matter? You may ask. Well, while these aren`t primary elections, a candidate`s performance in Iowa is often viewed as a 
 
 test for their campaign strength. 
 
In the past, the Iowa caucuses have sometimes predicted the outcome of the presidential election. President George W. Bush for instance, went on to 
 
 become president after winning the Iowa caucuses in 2000. The same happened for Barack Obama in 2008. 
 
And if you want to know just how good of an indicator Iowa caucuses are in predicting the next president of the United States, here`s the statistic 
 
 for you. 56% of winners of the Iowa caucuses have gone on to win their party`s nomination for the presidency. 
 
Now, another possible indicator of a candidate`s potential future success? Poll. CNN`s David Chalian gives us an outlook at a recent poll from 
 
 Michigan and Georgia to other battleground states.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Take a look in Georgia here, look at the different matchups between President Biden on this side, and three of 
 
 the different candidates running on the Republican side. So against Haley 49, 43 in Georgia. Haley bests Biden. Trump 49, 44. DeSantis here actually 
 
 -- this is within the margin of error, but he does not perform as well. That sort of damages a bit of his electability argument in the Republican 
 
 primary in Michigan, which Joe Biden won by a little bit of a healthier margin than he did Georgia in 2020. 
 
What you see here, Haley trouncing Biden, 50 to 38. Trump, you showed 50 to 40 against Joe Biden. And again, DeSantis is the one that`s the below 50 
 
 here, but he also is besting Joe Biden in Michigan. 
 
Underneath the horse race, we look at some attributes. So this in Georgia here, we asked the -- does -- which candidates does not have the attributes 
 
 you want a president to have when it comes to temperament? OK, that is Donald Trump`s worst score, 58% say he doesn`t have that quality, 47% say 
 
 that of Biden. But across the other three, understanding people like you, policy positions and sharpness and stamina, which is Joe Biden`s weakest 
 
 point. You see 66% of Georgia voters say that Biden does not have the sharpness and stamina that they`re looking for in a president.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE: In line with our election coverage today, which U.S. state will be the first to hold a primary election a few days after the Iowa caucuses?
 
New Hampshire, Hawaii, Florida, or New York?
 
If you set New Hampshire, ding, ding, ding, you are correct. New Hampshire`s had the tradition of holding the first U.S. presidential 
 
 primary since the year 1920. This year, that will happen on January 23rd. 
 
All right, now we want to highlight someone doing extraordinary things. Our CNN audience voted that the recipient of this year`s CNN Hero of the Year 
 
 Award should go to Dr. Kwane Stewart. He cares for the pets of people experiencing homelessness. Dr. Stewart said that he wanted to be a 
 
 veterinarian ever since he was a kid. Then he started a nonprofit called Project Street Vet more than a decade ago, after helping to examine and 
 
 treat the dog of a homeless man outside of a 7/11, where he used to get his coffee.
 
The dog owner`s words, thank you for not ignoring me. Well, they inspired Dr. Stewart to help more people in similar situations. He started by 
 
 setting up small drop-in clinics to provide free medical care to pets whose owners wouldn`t be able to afford otherwise. And since then, Dr. Stewart 
 
 and his volunteer teams have treated thousands of animals while giving their owners some hope and dignity too. 
 
In his award ceremony speech, Dr. Stewart spoke about what it means to him.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The 2023 CNN Hero of the Year is Dr. Kwane Stewart.
 
(CHEERING &amp; APPLAUSE)
 
DR. KWANE STEWART, 2023 CNN HERO OF THE YEAR: If I, as a child, could dream of doing something that was impactful, then I think I found it, or it found 
 
 me. And I`m so lucky to be doing what I`m doing. 
 
It`s been a wonderful journey, and as I get older, I start thinking about those big questions in life. Why are we here? What defines us? Why are we 
 
 human? And I think the answer, at least for me, the answer is in the question. What does it mean to be human? And I believe it`s humanity. It`s 
 
 looking out for each other, believing in each other, helping one another. And all of these people embody that.
 
(CHEERING &amp; APPLAUSE)
 
This part certainly wasn`t planned, but the $100,000, I want to celebrate with all of you. It splits evenly ten ways pretty nicely, so it is my 
 
 contribution to all of us. I want to say I`m honored to know you and to be a part of this fraternity.
 
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
 
This part certainly wasn`t planned, but the $100,000, I want to celebrate with all of you. It splits evenly ten ways pretty nicely, so it is my 
 
 contribution to all of us. I want to say I`m honored to know you and to be a part of this fraternity.
 
(CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE)
 
I`m here in part because -- I`m here in part because I`ve been willing to share and give throughout my life. There`s no reason to stop doing that 
 
 tonight.
 
I have one last quick thought. I was in the streets one day, and an unhoused man and his pet, after I delivered care, we got to talking. And he 
 
 said sort of nonchalant, he hadn`t eaten in almost two days. And I was due for lunch myself. I returned with a sandwich for myself and for him.
 
He tore off -- it was a sub sandwich. He tore off a corner of it, a piece of bread. He ate it, and he gave the rest to his dog. And they`ve taught me 
 
 a lot, too.
 
I`ll close by saying this. An act of kindness can change your day. Change someone`s day. An act or gesture of kindness can change somebody`s life.
 
Thank you.
 
(CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE)
 
WIRE: Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 it`s one that makes me feel good from my head "tometoes." The mystery of the missing tomato. American 
 
 astronaut Frank Rubio became one of the first to grow and harvest a tomato in space. It was "ultomatoly" his passion project during a record breaking 
 
 stay on the International Space Station. It lasted more than 371 days, longer than any American astronaut in history. But his tomato went missing. 
 
 Colonel Rubio said he probably spent 20 hours searching, but he was unable to catch up with it before he had to return to earth. 
 
Well, eight months past harvest day when Colonel Rubio said he was sure that he had securely Velcro the tomato in a little bag, he got some mighty 
 
 vine news from his former crew mates.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We can exonerate him. We found the tomatoes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: All right. I got a chance to meet Colonel Frank Rubio this weekend at the army Navy game. And I asked him about his mission in space. Full 
 
 disclosure though, I was not brave enough to ask him about the missing veggies.

 as you can see in Lydia are on opposing size of today`s epic rivalry. Colonel, we`ll start with you. What makes this rivalry so special?
 
RUBIO: You know what, it`s the fact that we are absolutely going to go at it today and Army`s going to win for sure. But the other 364 days, we are 
 
 brothers and sisters in arms. We work together and I work with some amazing Navy people out there. And so, yeah, we are best of friends except for 
 
 today,
 
WIRE: Except for today.
