ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT: A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. And tonight, a fast-changing picture in Syria as 
 
 rebels continue to take regime territory, eyeing Damascus, we'll bring you CNN's exclusive interview with the man leading the group that's driving the 
 
 offensive. 
 
Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, this as hundreds of thousands of Syrians get uprooted in just the last few days, I'll be speaking to the U.N.'s regional 
 
 coordinator to find out what people are up against. That's this hour. And brutal crackdowns in Georgia this week highlight the growing threat to 
 
 peace and stability in eastern Europe. 
 
The Estonian Foreign Minister joins me live this hour for a conversation on that. A busy hour ahead. We begin, though, in Syria, where rebel fighters 
 
 have opened a new front against the government of Bashar al Assad after taking key cities in the north. They are now launching an offensive, if you 
 
 look at that map towards the south. 
 
The green areas on this map, you're looking at show the advances they have made so far, and it's all happening rather quickly in the southern province 
 
 of Daraa. Rebels say they've taken over a military base and a border crossing into Jordan, and it comes a day after they claimed control over 
 
 the city of Hama. 
 
That was in the north, anti-government protesters there celebrated the takeover, as you can see, by toppling a statue of Bashar al-Assad's father. 
 
 Rebels now setting their sights on Homs as well as the capital, Damascus. Neighboring Turkey has been supporting rebel groups, even deploying forces. 
 
 Here's what President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said about the advance. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT, TURKEY (through translator): Idlib, Hama and Homs, the target is, of course, Damascus. This march of the opponents 
 
 continues as of now. We follow this from both Intelligence and all media. Of course, I will say that our wish is that this march in Syria continues 
 
 without any accidents or hardship. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: And the leader of the main rebel group says the ultimate goal is to overthrow the authoritarian government. And in an exclusive interview with 
 
 CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani spoke about the rebels objectives and what they've accomplished so far. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Taking Hama after taking Aleppo. I mean, how significant is this for you right now? 
 
ABU MOHAMMAD AL-JOLANI, SYRIAN REBEL LEADER (through translator): From a military perspective, what comes after Hama will not be the same as what 
 
 came before. However, I prefer not to be overly optimistic during the battle. I like to remain cautious and vigilant to avoid complacency and 
 
 ensure we don't suffer losses while believing we are safe. 
 
KARADSHEH: What comes after this? What's after Hama?
 
AL-JOLANI: The course of the battle, as for the secrets of the battle, let's leave them to the unfolding events. You will witness them in reality, 
 
 which is better than discussing them now.
 
KARADSHEH: In a matter of days, you have taken major cities. What's changed? How were you able to do this now?
 
AL-JOLANI: In recent years, there has been a unification of internal opinions and the establishment of institutional structures within the 
 
 liberated areas of Syria. This institutionalization included the restructuring within military factions. They entered unified training camps 
 
 and developed a sense of discipline. 
 
This discipline allowed them with God's guidance, to engage in a battle in an organized manner. The progress and execution of plans have been swift 
 
 with clear communication and adherence to commands. They stop where they should stop and withdraw where they should withdraw. The revolution has 
 
 transitioned from chaos and randomness to a state of order, both in civil and institutional matters and in military operations alike. 
 
KARADSHEH: Some believe this is happening because the allies of the Assad regime, the Russians, Hezbollah, Iran, that they are weakened, they are 
 
 preoccupied with other wars. And this is why we are seeing this happen right now on the Syrian regime itself weakened. Is this what is happening 
 
 right now? 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
Is this why you chose to launch this offensive right now? 
 
AL-JOLANI: As you know, we are still in the midst of the battle and discussing such details at this time is not wise. 
 
KARADSHEH: But you faced more of a resistance in Hama than you did in Aleppo. What do you think happened? Why did the regime withdraw like it 
 
 did? 
 
AL-JOLANI: The seeds of the regimes defeat have always been within it? It has been effectively dead since that time. However, the Iranians attempted 
 
 to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up. But the truth remains this regime is dead. 
 
KARADSHEH: In the last year, it seemed like Bashar al-Assad survived the war. He was welcomed back into the Arab fold and on the world stage. 
 
AL-JOLANI: The Arab countries evaluation of the situation was mistaken. Some Arab countries tried to separate the regime from Iran's project. This 
 
 is impossible. Even if the regime wanted this, it can't implement it. It's a subservient relationship. Iran can disengage from the regime, but the 
 
 regime can't. 
 
To describe the regime as victorious is deeply unjust to the many children, people, women subjected to rape in prisons, displaced individuals scattered 
 
 across the world, those drowning in the seas and those living in tents on the borders of other countries. What kind of victory are we talking about?
 
KARADSHEH: In the past, you have talked about strict Islamic rule. Is that still the plan? 
 
AL-JOLANI: People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly? We are talking 
 
 about something that aligns with the traditions and nature of the region. The most important thing is to build institutions. We are not talking about 
 
 rule by individuals or personal whims, it's about institutional governance. 
 
Syria deserves a governing system that is institutional, not one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions. 
 
KARADSHEH: Many Syrians are happy and will be happy to see the end of the Assad regime, but they're also worried about what HTS rule would mean 
 
 including minorities. 
 
AL-JOLANI: No one has the right to erase another group. These sects have co-existed in this region for hundreds of years, and no one has the right 
 
 to eliminate them. There must be a legal framework that protects and ensures the rights of all, not a system that serves only one sect as 
 
 Assad's regime has done. 
 
KARADSHEH: You know, listening to you speaking, you've gone through quite the transformation once an al Qaeda leader, your group has had affiliations 
 
 with al Qaeda, with ISIS, and now you are projecting this image of a moderate leader and a moderate group. What is HTS right now? 
 
AL-JOLANI: Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is one of the factions in the region, just like all the others. Now, we're talking about a larger project. We're 
 
 talking about building Syria. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is merely one detail of this dialogue, and it may dissolve at any time. It's not an end in itself, 
 
 but a means to perform a task confronting this regime. 
 
Once that task is complete, it will transition to a state of governance institutions and so on. I believe that everyone in life goes through phases 
 
 and experiences, and these experiences naturally increase a person's awareness. A person in their 20s will have a different personality than 
 
 someone in their 30s or 40s, and certainly someone in their 50s. 
 
KARADSHEH: So, are those days behind you? 
 
AL-JOLANI: Sometimes, it's essential to adjust to reality and because someone who rigidly clings to certain ideas and principles without 
 
 flexibility cannot effectively lead societies or navigate complex conflicts like the one happening in Syria. 
 
KARADSHEH: People listening to this are going to wonder why they should believe you. You are still a specially-designated global terrorist by the 
 
 United States with a $10 million bounty on your head. Your group is a proscribed terrorist organization by the United States, by the U.N., by the 
 
 EU and others. 
 
AL-JOLANI: I say to people, don't judge by words, but by actions. I believe the reality speaks for itself. These classifications are primarily 
 
 political, and at the same time wrong. I define a terrorist as someone who intentionally kills civilians, harms innocents or displaces people. If 
 
 we're being honest, many of the wars waged by major powers in Arab, Muslim and even non-Muslim countries have involved the deliberate killing of 
 
 thousands, the destruction of homes and the displacement of millions, even the regime itself is guilty of such actions.
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
KARADSHEH: What the U.S. and others would say is that you were parts of groups that did exactly that. 
 
AL-JOLANI: Personally, I have not done these things. The situation must be understood in its historical context. There was a massive war in Iraq that 
 
 deeply stirred people's emotions, prompting many to go there. The circumstances of that war led people to various places, and my path led me 
 
 to one of those locations, given my level of awareness and my young age at the time, my actions evolved to where I am today.
 
I didn't go to Iraq with those intentions. I went to defend the Iraqi people. When I returned to Syria, I didn't want to bring what happened in 
 
 Iraq into Syria. That's why there were disagreements between us and ISIS. 
 
KARADSHEH: People would be wondering why you've agreed to speak with us. 
 
AL-JOLANI: What is happening in Syria is significant for the entire world. This event has positive repercussions globally because under the regimes 
 
 rule, Syria became a source of concern and trouble for everyone. Stabilizing Syria will bring many people back. Today, in the liberated 
 
 areas, about one-third of the population lives in camps, approximately 1.5 million people. 
 
I believe we can soon reach a point where there are no camps. With the rehabilitation of the liberated areas, people will return to their homes. 
 
 Many refugees in Turkey will likely return as well as significant number of refugees in Lebanon and Jordan. Even refugees in Europe may return to 
 
 rebuild their country. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: Our Jomana Karadsheh with that exclusive interview. And later on this hour, roughly 20 minutes or so, we'll have a report from Jomana on 
 
 displaced Syrians who are now returning to Aleppo for the first time in years. Have a quick preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
KARADSHEH: Did you ever imagine this moment possible? 
 
MOHAMMED ALI JOUDEH, DISPLACED RESIDENT OF ALEPPO: No, actually, no. It -- we have in our imagination that we're going to come back. Actually, we had 
 
 a lot of dreams about getting back to Aleppo, but we didn't actually believe that this moment is going to be true. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: And still on Syria, roughly 20 minutes, we'll get more about the situation on the ground from a senior official at the U.N.'s humanitarian 
 
 agency. You do not want to miss that conversation. Now, to the United States because police in New York tracking new clues in the search for a 
 
 suspect who killed the CEO of a major American medical insurance company, UnitedHealthcare on Wednesday. 
 
As the manhunt enters its third day, detectives have new images showing the full face of their person of interest. Here he is caught on video with his 
 
 mask down, speaking with an employee at a hostel. A police official says his image has been sent to every member of the New York Police Department. 
 
Our Omar Jimenez is following the very latest, joins us now. And Omar, just bring us up to date with the very latest and this possible DNA evidence 
 
 that's been found at the scene. What more are you learning Omar? 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so, as of right now, the medical examiner here in New York is testing DNA evidence that they found at the 
 
 scene, specifically from two sources. So, after the shooting, there was a water bottle that was left at the scene that investigators believe this 
 
 shooter purchased at a coffee shop in the minutes leading up to the shooting, and may have even taken a sip from. 
 
So, again that water bottle was left behind, and some of the swabs that we understand that they are looking at right now could be from, of course, the 
 
 mouth of the bottle as well, but also from a cell-phone that was found at the scene where they are testing potential touch or skin cell DNA if the 
 
 killer handled it. 
 
And we do know on camera that this shooter did appear to be on the phone in the minutes leading up to the shooting as well. But of course, they're just 
 
 pieces in what has been a large investigative puzzle to this point, not just on where this potential -- on where this shooter is, but also who this 
 
 shooter is. 
 
You were just showing on your screen a few moments ago the image of an unmasked person at a hostel on the Upper West side of New York City. This 
 
 is a person they've described as a person of interest, but the images were taken at this very same hostel where they believe the shooter was staying 
 
 for days leading up to the shooting, as early as ten days prior to the shooting, getting to New York City.
 
And during that time, investigators believe he was going to different parts of the city, briefly checked out of this hostel, checked back in, and then, 
 
 of course, after the shooting as well, law enforcement traced a path that he used to flee on an e-bike, on an electric bike north toward Central 
 
 Park. 
 
And then the next time he's seen on video, at least publicly, is exiting the park about 15 minutes later, and about 30 blocks north. 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
So, those are the pieces of where investigators are sort of starting with or working with at this point to try to get closer again. One of those two 
 
 questions, who this person is, and of course, where this person is?
 
SOARES: And Omar, let me just ask my producer, Sarah(ph), to bring up that graphic you had, Sarah(ph), on the suspect's timeline. I think it's 
 
 interesting because I think the first point we had in there is that arrived on a bus to New York. Do you know where he goes? He arrived in New York 
 
 City, checked into hostel using fake driver's license.   
 
Do we know where he came from? 
 
JIMENEZ: That is -- 
 
SOARES: What city he traveled from? Do we have those answers yet, Omar? 
 
JIMENEZ: Not quite yet. What we do know is that the bus that dropped him off in New York City was a bus that went on a route from Atlanta to New 
 
 York. So, essentially, I mean, the full east coast -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
JIMENEZ: Of the country almost. But we don't know at what point in that journey he actually boarded that bus as you can imagine, a lot of stops 
 
 along the way -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
JIMENEZ: But whenever we do find out obviously a huge indicator of where this person might have originated from. 
 
SOARES: Yes, indeed, pieces of the puzzle are coming together. Some big questions though, and it seems that the NYPD is closing in. Omar, as 
 
 always, great to see you. Thank you, Omar. 
 
JIMENEZ: Of course. 
 
SOARES: Still to come tonight, simmering tensions in Georgia where protesters faced brutal beatings from special forces. Demonstrations there 
 
 entering a second week, plus, I discuss the unrest in Georgia, Russia's war in Ukraine and Trump's second term with Estonia's Foreign Minister. That 
 
 conversation just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SOARES: Romania's top court has annulled the first round of the country's Presidential election, the second round of the runoff that was supposed to 
 
 happen on Sunday will no longer take place. Friday's decision is just part of Romania's troubled election cycle, after the same court ordered a 
 
 recount of the first round vote last week. 
 
Far-right ultra nationalist Calin Georgescu won by a narrow margin. The court now says the entire process must be re-run. The decision to cancel 
 
 the election came a day after a large protest in the capital, Bucharest, where hundreds rallied against the far-right for Elena Lasconi. We'll stay 
 
 across this story in the coming days. 
 
And turning to Georgia, anti-government protests in Georgia are taking to the streets for a second week. The country's capital, Tbilisi is at the 
 
 heart of violent crackdowns on the demonstrations. Protests began after Georgia's ruling party suspended talks to join the European Union. 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
One journalist was beaten by police while reporting on the protests. Our Sebastian Shukla has more and a warning, some of the video in his report is 
 
 disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SEBASTIAN SHUKLA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): In the middle of this chaos on the streets of Tbilisi is veteran journalist Guram Rogova. He's reporting 
 
 live on air, the next, he's crumpled on the floor, blood pouring from his face. His assault captured from different angles, including this one, you 
 
 clearly see the black clothed policeman bludgeon him as he backed away. Rogova tells CNN he fractured a bone in his neck, injuries that could have 
 
 been life-changing, he told me doctors said. 
 
GURAM ROGOVA, JOURNALIST: And we don't know how it's possible that you still can speak and move your legs and hands.
 
SHUKLA: Attacks like these have become commonplace over the past week, thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets all over the country, 
 
 furious at the government's decision to suspend talks joining the European Union and perceived closeness to Moscow. The government's response has been 
 
 to quash the protests using force these unmarked men in black. 
 
ROGOVA: They look like criminals and they act a lot like criminals. They catch them, they hit them -- and they saw them.
 
SHUKLA: Another beating by police. This time, two brothers swarmed by dozens of faceless officers. Erkele Loladze told CNN his jaw was broken in 
 
 two places. He could only answer our questions in writing.
 
ERKELE LOLADZE, GEORGIA RESIDENT: They shouted, hit him in the head, kill him, multiple groups have assaulted me, knocking me down 4 or 5 times. They 
 
 kicked me all over my body, and at one point, someone stood on me with both feet and jumped. 
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
SHUKLA: Opposition politicians have also been targeted. Nika Gvamaria(ph), a leader of the Coalition for Change Movement in standoff with more masked 
 
 policemen before they raided his office. Thrown to the ground, beaten unconscious and hauled into detention. The Interior Ministry says he was 
 
 arrested for, quote, "disobedience" to the police. The Prime Minister also accusing the opposition of stoking protests. 
 
IRAKLI KOBAKHIDZE, PRIME MINISTER, GEORGIA (through translator): One thing is confirmed. People were systematically supplied with pyrotechnics and 
 
 other means by the relevant political forces. 
 
(FIREWORKS) 
 
SHUKLA: Georgians fear their country is slipping back into Russia's orbit. These ugly scenes of violence and political repression have more than the 
 
 shades of a Russian-style crackdown. 
 
ROGOVA: We all understand that now we are fighting against Russia. There is war in Georgia now. 
 
SHUKLA: Sebastian Shukla, CNN, Berlin. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES: Important piece there from our Sebastian Shukla. Well, one country closely watching the situation unfolding in Georgia is Estonia. Estonia is 
 
 a member of the EU, part of the NATO alliance and shares a border as you can see there with Russia. I'm joined now by Estonian Foreign Minister 
 
 Margus Tsahkna live from Manama in Bahrain. 
 
Foreign Minister, welcome back to the show, great to have you back. Let me pick up where my colleague just left off with that report there and the 
 
 violent crackdown that we have seen, and I may say political repression too. We have seen in the streets of Tbilisi and beyond. Just your reaction, 
 
 Foreign Minister.
 
MARGUS TSAHKNA, FOREIGN MINISTER, ESTONIA: The mask has fallen from this Georgian dream of the Georgian government. However, we call them and it was 
 
 pretty obvious, already a couple of months ago. But unfortunately, after the elections, everything -- what we see is not that actually the Georgian 
 
 people wants and also the violence against the demonstrations, though this is something we cannot accept.
 
And also as a member of EU three Baltic states, we have risen this problem, and the question already months ago, and we will do it during the next 
 
 Foreign Council. But also the three Baltic states, we have put the sanctions against these persons who are responsible for this violence 
 
 against the peaceful people. 
 
And it started with the oligarch Ivanishvili. But this is deeply concerning, and I totally agree with what the journalist who repeated and 
 
 said that it is obvious that Russia has more influence there, and this is something that Georgian people don't accept. 
 
SOARES: And as you were talking, Foreign Minister, we were just replaying a video just from moments ago, I think we're day nine now of these protests. 
 
 So, these are, you know, people coming out to the streets. This is just moments ago in Tbilisi. It seems that their determination shows no sign of 
 
 stopping. 
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
And we know and I had this conversation with the President of Georgia just earlier this week, and she said, like 80 percent of Georgians support 
 
 European integration. Yet, we heard from the Georgian Prime Minister this week. I think it was the beginning, saying that his country will still aims 
 
 to join the EU despite having its -- halting its accession talks. 
 
I mean, do -- what do you make of those comments? I mean, my obvious thought was if he -- if he wanted that, why didn't he go through with it 
 
 right now?  
 
TSAHKNA: The first thing is that the Georgian people, they have a legitimate leader as a President. And of course, the political movement, 
 
 the party Georgian dream is going to change the President. But the President, he's a legitimate leader supported by Georgian people. And we 
 
 need to take her words very seriously. 
 
The second thing is that the accusations that behind these mass rallies, demonstrations that are like some political movements, it's not true. These 
 
 are Georgian people, and these demonstrations are not happening only in the -- in Tbilisi, but all over the -- Georgia. So, this 80 percent of Georgian 
 
 people who are supporting the way towards European Union, it's true. 
 
And the third thing is that, the Georgian dream leaders and the Prime Minister, they're just lying, and they have lied to European Union. But the 
 
 most important, they have lied to Georgian people, already, a long period. And this is the reaction what we see. So, European Union has halted already 
 
 this process a couple of months ago. But -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
TSAHKNA: You know, the situation as we see right now on the streets is really concerning.
 
SOARES: And you mentioned the fact that Estonia sanctioned individuals, Ukraine, I believe in the last 24 hours, along with other countries have 
 
 also sanctioned, I think Ukraine sanctioned something like 19 individuals. President Zelenskyy said these individuals are, quote, "selling out the 
 
 interests of Georgia and its people."
 
And he said -- I'm just going to quote what he wrote on X. "We cannot afford to lose anyone in this region, not Georgia, not Moldova, not 
 
 Ukraine. We must stand together to defend against Moscow." So, Foreign Minister, for our viewers around the world, just speak to the Russian 
 
 strategy potentially at play here or at play here. 
 
TSAHKNA: Yes, this is something we have been telling already years about Putin's plans, and these plans have been public, I mean, of restoration of 
 
 Soviet empire. And he is doing that. And also, of course, using the military aggression against Ukraine, it is everything what we witnessed 
 
 daily, already more than a thousand days, but also the neighboring countries as Georgia, as Moldova as well as we heard the news today about 
 
 Romania -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
TSAHKNA: To influence unlawful level the elections. So, Russia is aggressive country, Putin is connecting his plan to restore the Soviet 
 
 empire in the meaning and influence as well. And I totally agree with President Zelenskyy's quote that we need to stand together. We need to 
 
 understand that business as usual, as it was maybe years ago.
 
It is not coming back, because Putin has not changed the goals, not only in Ukraine, but also it is already like the global issue. We see the North 
 
 Korean troops fighting in Europe. This is something totally different that we even were imagining like a year ago. So, I agree with President 
 
 Zelenskyy.
 
SOARES: Yes, I know, interesting on Romania. We also heard from the State Department earlier in the week who said they spoke of Russian involvement 
 
 in malign cyber activity, which is -- points to what you have been talking about and those Intelligence documents there that were declassified, of 
 
 course. 
 
Let me focus on Ukraine, Foreign Minister, a discussion that you have had - - you and I have had on countless times here on this show. There's a lot of talk at the moment about what President-elect Trump can achieve in Ukraine, 
 
 whether he can bring peace, of course, as he promised in 24 hours. 
 
Now, he's nominated -- he's nominated General Keith Kellogg as assistant to the President, special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. There's talk of 
 
 halting military aid unless they -- you know, they sit down for peace negotiations. How worried are you about the quid pro quo here? Talk to the 
 
 next level of engagement for Ukraine?
 
TSAHKNA: Yes, I'm not worried and meaning, I'm very practical person. And I was Defense Minister of Estonia at the time when President Trump first time 
 
 entered the office as a President. And there were many speculations what will happen. The truth is, we don't know exactly what is the President's 
 
 plan -- Trump's plan, but he is listening carefully. 
 
He has many conversations with the different leaders as well with President Zelenskyy. And it is obvious that it is not possible to make any kind of 
 
 quick peace with Putin relying on just a long-lasting peace, because there is one important thing, Putin has not changed the goals. Putin is not 
 
 interested about more territory. 
 
He is interested about to take down Georgia as a democratic government as well as a nation. He has said publicly many times that there is no nation 
 
 like Ukraine. But it is not only about Ukraine as well. It's about -- it is about the European security architecture. It's about the gray zones of 
 
 neutral countries neighboring of Russia. So, this is much more wider question. And I do hope that President Trump, together with this 
 
 administration, will hear these analyses and facts and arguments. 
 <br>[14:30:33]
 
And this is not as well the only -- the problem for Europe. It's much more wider. The North Korean troops are fighting in Europe shows it's pretty 
 
 well. And it is not only North Korea. Behind that we can see as well different countries. Iran, China is very silent about this kind of 
 
 development. So, the situation is much, much more wider. 
 
And I can say it again and again, and we are in the year of 1938, I think, what we have in Europe before the Munich meeting. And President Trump has 
 
 an opportunity to become so-called the Churchill of our times, and the U.S. has the capabilities together with Europe and other allies to avoid 
 
 everything what came later. 
 
SOARES: Foreign Minister, as always, thank you for your time. Thank you, sir.
 
And still to come tonight, a rare look inside Aleppo after the rebel takeover. CNN speaks with those who return home after being displaced for 
 
 years. And as the fighting rages in Syria, I'll talk to a U.N. official about the urgent humanitarian needs of civilians. Those two stories after 
 
 this short break. You are watching CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:35:21]
 
SOARES: Welcome back, everyone. About a week after Syrian rebels captured Aleppo, many are now returning to their hometown for the first time in 
 
 years. Some of them spoke about the experience with our Jomana Karadsheh. She is the first Western journalist to report from the city since the rebel 
 
 takeover. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH: Muhammad never left Aleppo. And she says their homes were destroyed. Her children are in Turkey, and she hasn't seen them in years. 
 
 And she's hoping now that the city has changed hands, that this means that she could see her children again.
 
Abdul was in Idlib. He's been there since the start of the war, and this is his first time back to the city. He says they trust the rebels who are now 
 
 returning them to their cities. And he says he's not afraid. Syrians have gone through so much and they're resilient. 
 
Just in the last few days, people have painted over this with the colors of the free Syria flag. And this is something you see around the city where 
 
 people are trying to remove any signs of the Assad regime. 
 
This is the Bassel roundabout named after the deceased brother of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. And one of the first things that people 
 
 did when rebel forces took over the city of Aleppo was topple the statue of Bassel, a symbol of the Assad regime. This is an area where there were 
 
 fierce battles with regime forces. And since then, in the past few days, there's been an air strike that killed many people. You can still see the 
 
 aftermath of that, the blood on the floor here.
 
And speaking to people in the city, this is what they fear. They fear that there will be more Russian and Syrian regime airstrikes, that they will be 
 
 back for the city of Aleppo.
 
Hamad, this is your first time back to Aleppo in 10 years? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 10 years, yes. 
 
KARADSHEH: Did you ever imagine this moment possible? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, actually, no, no. We have in our imagination that we're going to come back. Actually, we had a lot of dreams about getting 
 
 back to Aleppo, but we didn't actually believe that this moment is going to be -- going to be true. 
 
KARADSHEH: But are you worried about what might be coming?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course, we are here. All the people here are worried about what's going to happen because the air strikes always attacked us. 
 
KARADSHEH: But you can imagine living here again. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course, of course. I love -- I love my country. I love my -- actually, all of the Syrian place, the Syrian country, our 
 
 country. We hope it's going to be clear from the Assad regime, all the Syrian, not just Aleppo. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES: And Jomana Karadsheh and team in Aleppo there. Well, even though some people are returning to Aleppo, the U.N. says the recent fighting has 
 
 uprooted more than 280,000 people in northwest Syria. 
 
Here to discuss the situations, David Carden, the Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria Crisis at the U.N. Agency, OCHA. David, 
 
 I really appreciate you being with us. I understand from my team that you were in Syria earlier this week. Can you give us a sense, David, of the 
 
 humanitarian needs, the humanitarian situation on the ground? 
 
DAVID CARDEN, DEPUTY REGIONAL HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR SYRIA CRISIS, U.N. OCHA: Yes, thank you very much. Yes, the humanitarian situation in 
 
 northwest Syria is dire because even though -- even before the conflict erupted just over a week ago, there are already 3.5 million people 
 
 displaced, 800,000 people in tents. And what you got on top of that is additional space when people had to flee their homes, about 100,000 people 
 
 in northwest Syria. I think there's several 100,000 in other parts of Syria, as you mentioned earlier.
 
And the reason why they had to flee -- and I spoke to many of them when I was there -- and the reason why they had to flee is they told me they were 
 
 scared of airstrikes. They saw airstrikes hitting schools, hitting health facilities, hitting a water station, hitting camps. Four hospitals in Idlib 
 
 were hit in one day. And one man told me that he was in a market trying to buy food for his family. And he saw 13 people killed. He was severely 
 
 injured himself. I spoke to him in hospital, and he said he was very lucky to be alive.
 <br>[14:40:12]
 
SOARES: My goodness. So, David, as -- so, as rebels then from what you're telling me -- so, we already had a displacement, you know, during this 
 
 conflict that's been somewhat frozen until recently. But now we have rebels getting close and not just to Homs, taken Aleppo, Hama. I mean, I'm 
 
 guessing more civilians are leaving kind of in mass. What are you hearing? 
 
CARDEN: We are hearing that civilians are leaving, and of course, that means they're significant. And what we need to do is ensure we have 
 
 humanitarian access to them. That involves, you know, negotiating with the different actors on the ground to ensure that we can provide assistance. 
 
 And the United Nations is here to stay and deliver and support the most vulnerable people. 
 
I mean, one thing I would like to stress is the importance of protection of civilians. We urge all actors involved in this conflict to respect 
 
 international humanitarian law, to protect civilians and what we call civilians objects, which is hospitals, schools, you know, and not to shell 
 
 them. 
 
And ultimately, as you say -- and I heard your earlier speaker saying -- I mean, people do want to go home. You know, there have been people who have 
 
 been living in Idlib for many years, and they're desperate to go home, but they also need to be careful. I also spoke to someone in hospital in Idlib. 
 
 And the reason why he was in hospital is he tried to go home to where he lived, in Hama, and he stepped on a landmine. So, this is something that 
 
 they need to be very wary of as well. 
 
SOARES: Let's talk about not just our hospitals, but you mentioned there, David, the humanitarian, the aid distribution here. I imagine you have seen 
 
 how HTS has governed the Northwest. And I don't want to get into the politics of this, I mean, just purely humanitarian perspective. How -- I 
 
 mean, are you worried about the aid distribution in these new areas that have been taken over by HTS? How do you foresee aid delivery to happen in 
 
 new areas of governance that have been claimed by them here? 
 
CARDEN: Well, as you rightly say, I mean, I've been covering Idlib and Northern Aleppo since one week after the earthquake and -- in February 
 
 2023. And basically, what I've observed is that there are systems in place to support the distribution of services and relief items. I mean, when I 
 
 was there earlier this week, for example, we saw people in a reception center and aid agencies had managed to distribute tents, mattresses, 
 
 blankets to help people survive the winter cold, but there was a lack of retreats and other items. 
 
So, I think, you know, the bottom line is, you know, there are systems there to support these people. But one of the problems is a lack of 
 
 funding. And the humanitarian response plan for Syria for this year, we saw just over $4 billion was only 30 percent funded. And we desperately need 
 
 more support to enable us to help these people who have been displaced by this significant escalation. 
 
SOARES: David Carden, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us, David. Thank you very much. 
 
CARDEN: Thank you so much. Much appreciated. 
 
SOARES: Thank you, David.
 
While in Gaza, eyewitnesses say four doctors at the Kamal Adwan Hospital were killed after Israeli forces stormed the compound in the area 
 
 surrounding the hospital. Dozens of people are reported to have been killed or injured. The hospital director says two Israeli messengers enter the 
 
 hospital, telling people to evacuate early on Friday morning. The director also says the IDF of detained a group of healthcare workers and patients 
 
 and destroyed critical medical supplies. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment and still waiting for response. 
 
Still to come tonight, U.S. President Joe Biden is considering new pardons to protect opponents of President-elect Donald Trump -- I should say. We'll 
 
 tell you who he may be considering. That is next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:46:25]
 
SOARES: A source tell CNN Donald Trump ally, Elon Musk, was on a recent phone call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and that the two discussed 
 
 a revival of talks to secure the release of hostage currently held in Gaza. The source says Herzog reached out to Musk at the request of hostage 
 
 families who hope the tech billionaire will be able to apply pressure on all sides to reach a deal. We'll stay across that story if there are any 
 
 more developments, of course, of that conversation. We, of course, will bring it to you. 
 
Well, still in the United States, senior White House aides are considering the possibility of U.S. President Joe Biden issuing preemptive pardons for 
 
 people who may be targeted by Donald Trump. The President-elect and his supporters have openly talked about prosecuting people such as Congressman 
 
 Adam Schiff, former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, and Special Counsel Jack Smith. He's the one, of course, who brought federal charges against Trump. 
 
 But this type of potential pardon is controversial and could set a precedent for future presidents.
 
Joining me now for the very latest from Washington and our Paula Reid. So, Paula, is it just potentially those three? Is he looking at others to 
 
 pardon? And just explain to our viewers why it's so controversial. 
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: You know, well, CNN has learned that senior aides in the Biden White House, they have discussed the 
 
 possibility of granting what are called preemptive pardons or maybe some other kind of legal aid. And these would be for people who might be 
 
 targeted for prosecution by President-elect Trump once he takes office. 
 
Now, Biden's senior aides have been deliberating this for weeks as possibility of using preemptive pardons. This is something that would cover 
 
 people who haven't actually been accused of crimes to protect them for prosecution. But this is controversial because this would be an 
 
 extraordinary step. I mean, the fact that they're even having this debate highlights the concern many Democrats have that Trump will go after those 
 
 he perceives to be his political enemies.
 
We've also learned that several white-collar lawyers across Washington have also been fielding calls in recent weeks from government officials, 
 
 including investigators from Special Counsel Jack Smith's office, who are concerned that they could be targeted by the incoming administration. 
 
But this is also controversial because of the precedent. And Trump advisors have been watching this. They believe that Biden could be setting a new 
 
 precedent in terms of the scope of pardons that Trump could also take advantage of down the line to help his own allies. So, definitely uncharted 
 
 territory. And at this point, it's unclear if the Biden White House will actually fall through on these preemptive pardons. 
 
SOARES: Paula Reid, thanks very much, Paula. 
 
And still to come tonight, a tumultuous week in South Korea could end with an impeachment vote. The political fallout from the president's martial law 
 
 debacle. That is next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:51:41]
 
SOARES: In a dramatic reversal, the leader of South Korea's ruling party now wants the president to be removed from power. The party leader says has 
 
 credible evidence that President Yoon Suk Yeol tried to have prominent political figures arrested during his short-lived martial law declaration. 
 
 Lawmakers are planning to vote in a motion to impeach the president as early as Saturday. 
 
Our Mike Valerio has been tracking every moment of this in Seoul for us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Days later, you can still see damage inside South Korea's National Assembly. In fact, if we look 
 
 through this hole, this is where a door was kicked through during clashes with soldiers. And you see tables, chairs, fancy silvers, pieces of office 
 
 furniture that were used to barricade this door. It would only be a short time later that soldiers left the building. 
 
VALERIO (voice-over): In the aftermath of martial law, a critical question at the heart of South Korea's democracy. Will there be enough votes to 
 
 impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol? For liberal assembly member Cho Kuk, he's confident there will be.
 
CHO KUK, LEADER, REBUILDING KOREA PARTY: I think more than eight conservative congressmen will join. 
 
VALERIO (voice-over): Cho was one of the people who rushed to the National Assembly and voted to suspend President Yoon's declaration of martial law. 
 
 We ask if Cho thinks there's a chance President Yoon declares martial law a second time. 
 
CHO: The possibility is getting decreased -- is decreasing, but it exist because President Yoon is still there. He is not removed. 
 
VALERIO (voice-over): Still on the job is Im Yong-woo (ph) who helped push back soldiers entering the assembly grounds. He took this video of military 
 
 helicopters landing nearby. 
 
We were blocking this door with a big barricade, he told us. Special forces soldiers were making their way into the building as I and other officials 
 
 built a barricade from the inside. The soldiers were barred by the barricade and the people. 
 
The area was sealed off by law enforcement. Kim Yong-gun (ph) shows us how he helped lawmakers climb over a wall so they could get into the assembly 
 
 and vote to end martial law. 
 
I crouched like this. Four of us moved as one team, Kim said. We decided to help the lawmakers get inside the building. Two of us made a distraction 
 
 for the police and I crouched down for the lawmakers to climb over the wall. 
 
President Yoon's office released a statement late Thursday saying he declared martial law within a "legitimate framework in order to regulate 
 
 political activity and confront the forces destroying liberal democracy." As for Cho's message to those across South Korea -- 
 
CHO: My fellow citizens, President Yoon will be removed very soon. Do not worry about that. Keep your conviction. Do not hesitate to remove the 
 
 tyranny -- tyrant.

SOARES: We'll leave South Korea and turn to Japan. Japan is looking to cut down the work week for Tokyo residents by introducing three days off for 
 
 government employees. It is the latest push to help working moms and boosts the country's record low fertility rates that dropped even more in June. 
 
 According to Tokyo City government, the new workweek arrangement begins in April of next year. The governor says it will ensure more flexible 
 
 schedules for working parents without having to give up their career due to childbirth or childcare. Many sociologists attribute Japan's declining 
 
 birth rates to an unforgiving work culture and rising costs of living. 
 
Now, Dolly Parton is looking for someone that can play her on Dolly, an original music. The iconic country star wants to find a cast for the 
 
 forthcoming Broadway show, which means performers of all -- that's right, of all ages are needed to portray Dolly at different stages throughout her 
 
 incredible journey. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DOLLY PARTON, SINGER: Whether you're chasing your dreams from a small town or you've spent years performing on stages across the country, I want to 
 
 give you the chance to help me bring my story to Broadway and maybe even play me. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Run to people. Don't walk. If you want to -- if you want to apply, applications can be submitted at the show site and a select few will get to 
 
 audition in person for the casting director. I'll love to be part of that and to see all the applications. I wish you all the best of luck if that's 
 
 what you are applying for. 
 
Thanks for your company tonight and all this week. Do stay right here. "NEWSROOM" with Richard Quest is up next. Have a wonderful weekend. I'll 
 
 see you on Monday.
