LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. 
 
The final meaning of the January 6th committee ends with an unprecedented action as lawmakers recommend multiple criminal charges against Donald Trump, what it could mean for his political future ahead.
 
Plus, Vladimir Putin wows closer cooperation with Belarus as fears grow that the Russian president could drag Moscow's closest ally into his war on Ukraine. 
 
And the will of the Iranian people only grow stronger. Despite a bloody crackdown, new strikes rise up in Kurdish regions across the country. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Live from CNN center, this is CNN Newsroom with Laila Harrak.
 
HARRAK:  Never in American history has a congressional committee recommended criminal charges against a former president, until now. The House panel investigating the January 6th insurrection has taken that unprecedented step against Donald Trump. They say the Justice Department should charge him with obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement, and aiding or assisting an insurrection. 
 
In their final hearing, committee members focused on Trump's direct involvement in a scheme to overturn the 2020 election, paving the way for the violence at the Capitol in 2021. Vice chair Republican Liz Cheney says Trump is not fit to hold public office.

REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  Orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries. Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority except one. January 6th, 2021 was the first time one American president refused
 
 his constitutional duty to transfer power peacefully to the next.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK:  Well, more Now from CNN's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After a sprawling investigation with more than 1,000 witnesses, in reams of new evidence obtained, the January 6th committee today concluded that Donald Trump was directly responsible for the Capitol insurrection, and recommended that the Justice Department prosecute the former president on four federal charges. 
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass. 
 
RAJU:  The unprecedented developments come after the seven committee, Democrats, and two Republicans, voted unanimously -- 
 
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  Aye.
 
RAJU:  -- to adopt the report and issue criminal referrals against Trump and one of his attorneys, John Eastman. In a 154-page summary of the report released today, the committee also accusing several of Donald Trump's associates like attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Kenneth Chesebro, along with former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, and ex top DOJ official Jeffrey Clark as taking part in a conspiracy.
 
In making its case at a final public meeting, the committee detailed how Trump ignored many of his top advisors who tried to persuade him to acknowledge his laws. 
 
JEFFREY ROSEN, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: He wanted to talk about that he thought the election had been stolen or was corrupt and that there was widespread fraud. And I had told him that our reviews had not shown that to be the case. 
 
RAJU:  Instead, he pressured then Vice President Mike Pence, even berating him on the morning of January 6th as he was set to preside over the certification of Biden's victory.
 
UNKNOWN:  I remember hearing the word wimp.
 
RAJU:  While also uncovering details about his weeks long pressure campaign against state officials to change their election results, as he tried to strong arm the Justice Department to make purposely false statements to keep him in office despite knowing he lost. All culminating in instructing his supporters to march on the Capitol on January 6th.
 
HOPE HICKS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  He said something along the lines of, you know, nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So that won't matter. the only thing that matters is winning. 
 
RAJU:  The committee even accused Trump of spreading false claims of election fraud for the purposes of soliciting contributions in the amount of about $250 million.
 
He outlined possible attempts to influence witness testimony. Potential employment dangled before one unnamed witness and an unnamed lawyer advising a client --
 <br>[03:05:07]
 
REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  The witness could, in certain circumstances tell the committee that she didn't recall facts when she actually did recall them. 
 
RAJU:  The lawmakers also referred House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and three members of his conference, Jim Jordan, Scott Perry, Andy Banks, to be sanctioned by the House ethics committee for failing to comply with subpoenas as part of their investigation.
 
SCHIFF:  We did not choose to make referrals based on the underlying conduct, but rather on they essentially open and shut failure to comply with the congressional subpoena. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAJU (on camera):  Now, Senate Republicans are divided over the January 6th committee's report. Some criticizing the committee is overly partisan. Others saying it's only up to the Justice Department to decide what to do with these criminal referrals and others praising the committee's work. 
 
Now, one comment that got a lot of attention in the aftermath of Monday's meeting was from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who said quote, "the entire knows Trump was responsible from January 6th." He did not use Trump's name, but it was very clear who he was referring to in saying the entire nation knows his responsibility. 
 
Other Republicans did not agree, including Senator Rick Scott of Florida who told me, I have not seen a poll that says that.
 
Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill.
 
HARRAK:  Well, joining me now from London is Leslie Vinjamuri, and she's the head of the U.S. and the Americas Program at Chatham House. 
 
So good to see you, Leslie. Thank you for joining us. 
 
How much added political pressure is there now on the Department of Justice to charge the former president and his allies?
 
LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD, U.S. AND THE AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE:  Well, I think that you know, the visibility of these hearings, especially of yesterday, that decision to refer is very significant. It certainly adds pressure, but I don't think this is the number one, you know, most important fact. 
 
I think the fact that the, that there have been these recommendations that they are recommendations to prosecute matters for the symbolic importance of the hearings. It matters for the narrative that's been told. It gives real weight to the court of public opinion who are, you know, watching these, or many people will be watching them backwards over time, they will be incredibly important for the historical record. 
 
Whether this actually turns into, you know, the needle, the thing that changes the needle that moves the dial on the question of criminal, prosecutions I think is possibly unlikely. It certainly adds to what the Justice Department will already be thinking about. 
 
But again, you know, my very strong view on this is that the significance of Donald Trump as a political force in the United States will be decided very much by public opinion. We've seen what happened in the midterm elections. We've seen his popularity amongst Republican voters diminishing. 
 
And this, these hearings contribute to that very significantly. I don't think it will be the law that will fundamentally be what changes people's opinions. And it's really that ability that he's had over so many years to sway crowds, to get people to buy into the big lie that has been the source of his phenomenal power, which is now again, it seems to be very significantly diminished. 
 
HARRAK:  Now House Democrats, as you know, will hand over the gavel to Republicans next year. Did that play a role in the timing of these referrals? And what do you think, what do you see happening next?
 
VINJAMURI:  Yes. I mean, I think that the fact that those committees won't be controlled by Democrats, that there was a very strong sense that they needed to move, that there needed to be closure, that there needed to be those referrals made, that that, you know, we're going to see their report come out that American people, the world will be able to look at these documents, look at these interviews that fed into this.
 
So that public record will really be confirmed. And I think that we can expect, and I think this is, you know, this is the tragedy. It's been a very significant committee. It's done tremendous work. The tragedy, of course of it is that it has been subjected to partisan politics. 
 
We saw from the outset that, you know, there was a vote against having a 9/11 style independent commission that then Republicans didn't really haven't gotten on board these hearings. And now as the Republican Congress takes over in January, they will start to have their own investigations and hearings, possibly of President Biden, of his family, of any number of things.
 
But I still think that these hearings, remember they've taken place over a very long period of time. The politics in the United States have changed. We've had a midterm elections that simply didn't turn out to be a red wave, that were very negative for many of Donald Trump's endorsed candidates that, that really will impact the nature of voting in the presidential election. 
 <br>[03:10:07]
 
So, history has changed. Politics have changed in the United States. These hearings have contributed to them. But yes, we now face what will be an abrupt change in the U.S. Congress. That will impact, you know, the narrative that comes out of -- out of Washington on these fundamental questions.
 
HARRAK:  Now the January 6th committee has taken this as far as they can. I mean, this is basically the end of the road. As the focus now moves on to the Department of Justice, I'm wondering, you know, how engaged are Americans on this topic? I mean, does this still matter to average Americans? 
 
VINJAMURI:  I think a lot of Americans have wanted to move on from the era of what's been seen as a very unstable, unpredictable, and quite frankly not a politics that they appreciate or like. There have certainly been Americans who haven't wanted these hearings to be so visible, because it's looking backwards. 
 
But I also think that a lot of people have learned things that they didn't know, that a lot of people have gained interest in this. It isn't going to be the front story that the sort of justice is slow. Legal proceedings are very slow. Americans are very forward looking. 
 
But the broader question of Donald Trump's role in U.S. politics is a significant one. It will be a significant question. And these hearings will affect public opinion and they will affect Republicans views of whether this is a candidate, a candidate who continues to lose and now has, you know, had this evidence, these hearings cast against him in such a focused manner, in such a powerful manner, in such a visible manner. 
 
You know, when you look ahead, if you're a Republican in the United States, this is, you know, this is increasingly not the candidate that you think will take America forward in the way you wish it to be taken forward, which is through winning. But there will always be people that stay very much with the president. 
 
I think, you know, again, a big point is though that for generations, Americans, people around the world will look back to this period of history, and it's not to undercut the impact of the hearings on the present, but the historical record is really tremendous. It's not a record that a legal process can create. But the videos, the narrative, the interviews and the official record that will be published are really phenomenally important for U.S. history. 
 
HARRAK:  Leslie Vinjamuri in London, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
VINJAMURI:  Thank you.
 
HARRAK:  Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure has again come under attack from drones launched by Russia. Many of those drones were aimed at Ukraine's capital where a key facility was hit. The latest Russian assault has taken its toll as emergency power outages were introduced Monday across the nation.
 
Despite the damage, Ukraine's president says most of the drones were shot down.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Today's morning in several regions and cities of our country was unfortunately spoiled by the characteristic sound of the Iranian head drones, but most of them luckily did not reach their intended targets, and that made our morning a little better today. Thirty Shahed drones were shot down. A good result. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK:  Well, those drone strikes came hours ahead of a rare trip by the Russian leader to Belarus. During that visit, Vladimir Putin vowed closer cooperation with his key military ally as he held talks with his counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko. 
 
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has more on the visit.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice- over):  Russia's president makes a rare trip to his smaller neighbor Belarus, and the timing has everyone wondering why. Putin tucking into local specially baked bread has always been bigger on the world's stage, demanding his towering Belarusian counterpart come and see him. But was he here? Does he want something?
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We have certain areas of military cooperation and it's not just supplying each other, which in my view is incredibly important. It's also working together and cooperating.
 
WALSH:  As usual, it's hard to decipher what the Kremlin head is actually up to. But his forces have been dropping hints for weeks, endless public exercises along the border between Russian and Belarusian troops. Not the top tier, but at the least designed to leave Ukraine worried.
 <br>[03:14:54]
 
Kyiv's top brass have gone one further and sounded the alarm of a full-scale invasion from Belarus in the weeks ahead. And late last week, accusing Russian planes of flying from Belarus's skies as they dropped the missiles behind this raid, which killed a young boy and three others. 
 
Careful warns a rescuer here as his helmet camera footage shows another child pulled from the rubble. That relentless Russian targeting of Ukraine's infrastructure persisting early Monday. These rare images claiming to show damage to one facility, which as dawn breaks is swamped in firefighter foam. Ukraine's president saying Monday Russia had received 250 new Iranian attack drones. Likely the Shahed loitering munitions. But he was sure to find more emotional reasons why Ukraine needs arms.
 
Ukrainian children in their letters to St. Nicholas are asking for air defense weapons for victory and for them, for all Ukrainians. He said they understand everything our children, let us act. Yet the constant saber rattling to Kyiv's north on the border means even less chance of goodwill for now.

HARRAK:  European Union energy ministers have now agreed to a gas price cap in an effort to curb soaring energy prices. It would send off emergency pricing if gas prices cross $190 per megawatt hour for three straight working days. The cap is the latest measure to try and tackle an energy crisis sparked by Russia's war on Ukraine and made worse after Moscow reduced gas deliveries.
 
According to state media, the Kremlin called the deal unacceptable, saying it violates market pricing. 
 
Here's how one E.U. official reacted to the agreement. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KADRI SIMSON, E.U. ENERGY COMMISSIONER:  While it is important that we have today agreed to limit excessive gas prices, it is equally important that we can now move forward with making joint purchases of gas a reality. We can move forward and accelerate permitting. We can create a new complement rail energy benchmark and we can reinforce our energy solidarity. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK:  CNN's Clare Sebastian is tracking all the developments for you. She joins us now live from London. Clare, E.U. settled on a gas price cap, but I understand not everyone is happy with the end result.
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this was a very controversial measure. It's taken months to come to this agreement. It still needs to be rubber stamped by member states. It's a lot lower than the original cap that they had been discussing of 275 euros per megawatt hour, which many have believed would do absolutely nothing. It wouldn't have even been triggered when we saw the turmoil and gas prices over the summer. 
 
This is much lower at 180 euros per megawatt hour, about $190. But it does come with lots of conditions and caveats reflecting just how controversial it was. And there are fears including from the market operator of the European gas benchmark that it could actually backfire and have a destabilizing impact on markets.
 
Intercontinental exchange, that operator says that it is still concerned about this and is reviewing whether it can continue to operate the benchmark fairly. But this was an example of European compromise they have in a way that perhaps we wouldn't have expected say a year ago, been able to come together and do this.
 
Russia is very concerned about this. They say that it is unacceptable, and that they are considering a response later. 
 
HARRAK:  Clare, in another development, Russia and China are set to begin joint naval drills on Wednesday. What more can you tell us about that. 
 
SEBASTIAN:  Yes, the Russian, flagship of its specific fleet and three other vessels have now set sail from Vladivostok to take part in these drills that begin on Wednesday. A week-long drills. Really a sign of growing cooperation in the military sphere between Russia and China. Both of them perceiving to face increasing threats from the west, now coming together in this way. 
 
Really there are no limits partnership that they signed before the start of the war in Ukraine. Standing the test China has not overtly supported the war in Ukraine, and certainly not provided any military aid or anything like that. But it has not overtly criticized it, and it has stepped in in many ways to fill the void left by western sanctions, buying up Russian oil, things like that. 
 
And now we see this increasing military partnership for Russia. It serves several purposes. One, to show that despite this war it has not been left isolated on the international stage. And secondly, a chance to sort of show off its military which has suffered so much damage both physically and reputationally from the war in Ukraine, Laila.
 
HARRAK:  Clare Sebastian reporting. Thank you so much.
 
And still to come, demonstrators in Iran intensify their protests with a new strategy. We'll have a live report.
 
Plus, a triumphant return for Argentina's football team. Thousands of supporters welcome them home after winning the World Cup. Details on the homecoming like no other.
 <br>[03:20:04]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
HARRAK:  The protests in Iran took a new turn this week as workers and businesses announced a planned three-day strike. Shops were shuttered Monday in Kurdish regions of the country. The strike has been called by protestors, rights organizations, and trade union activists. 
 
Let's get you more now, CNN's Nada Bashir is tracking developments live from London. Nada, what more have you learned about what happened to a famous actress Taraneh Alidoosti?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Look, this is one of Iran's most well- known notable actresses. She is, of course, also a well-known feminist activist, a prominent campaigner as part of the Me Too movement in Iranian cinema. 
 
Now, of course, we have learned of her arrest. She has taken the stand in solidarity with the ongoing protest movement, and most recently shared a post on Instagram protesting against executions in Iran. Of course, executions of people who have taken part in those anti regime demonstrations. 
 
Now of course we are hearing from the festival Deccan calling for her immediate release. They issued a tweet so I can read you just a little bit of that. Saying The Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti was arrested on Saturday, the 17th of December as a result of her support for the movement for freedom in her country. The festival Deccan strongly condemns this arrest and demands her immediate release.
 
Now, of course, we also saw her previously in early December sharing a post on Instagram wearing without the mandatory hijab of course, a clear stand in solidarity with the ongoing protest movement, and we've seen numerous well-known notable figures in Iran now taking a stand against the regime.
 
But of course, we've also seen numerous well-known figures facing that regime crackdown, being arrested and detained often, as an example by the regime as to what the protestors can expect if they do take action in a similar fashion. 
 
We have heard of course from the IRGC affiliated first news agency, they said in relation to her detention that some celebrities make claims without evidence and published provocations, and some have thus been arrested. So clearly, we are seeing an attempt by the regime to quell these protests, but also, to quell any signs of support coming from these well-known figures in Iran. Laila?
 
HARRAK:  And yet they're still struggling and that the authorities to quell the protests that are still ongoing despite a brutal crackdown.
 
BASHIR:  Absolutely. And in fact, yesterday mark the first day of what is set to be three days of strike action in the northwestern Kurdish region. Despite the crackdown, despite the violence, the detentions, the growing death toll we are seeing, that protest movement is not waning. 
 <br>[03:24:59]
 
We are still seeing people taking to the streets, and this is becoming more organized. We are seeing now unions gathering to organize collective strike action. We've seen that of course across several several cities in the Kurdish region. Videos emerging, some storefronts closed, markets closed, streets eerily quiet and empty as part of that strike action. 
 
Perhaps what was most significant is that we have seen video now emerging on social media showing oil workers taking part in a strike. We heard from a union representing oil workers over the weekend they issued a list of demands in relation to working conditions and wages, and they said that they will continue to strike and organize more wide-ranging strike action and protests if their demands aren't met within a week. 
 
But of course, this is a huge concern and will be a huge concern to the regime because this is a core pillar of Iran's economy. So, to see the oil workers now taking part in these strikes is a significant development. Laila?
 
HARRAK:  Nada Bashir reporting. Thank you so much. 
 
Nurses across the U.K. are striking for the second time in less than a week. The walkout last Thursday was the Royal College of Nursing's strike, largest strike, rather, in its 106-year history with as many as 100,000 members picketing. The nurses want a pay rise that's 5 percent above the inflation rate. They also want to call attention to what they say are declining standards in healthcare.
 
Steve Barclay, the U.K.'s health secretary told CNN last week that their demands are, quote, "not affordable." While this strike is among others organized by various sectors in the U.K. during the holiday period. Transportation and border workers, teachers, postal workers, baggage handlers, and paramedics have all either gone on strike already or planned to do soon.
 
In Argentina a homecoming 36 years in the making. For the first time since 1986, the country's football team has returned to Buenos Aires with the World Cup trophy in hand. Well, after landing the players were welcomed by an ocean of supporters as they left the airport. And keep in mind, this wasn't even the main parade. 
 
As Stefano Pozzebon reports, the country has more celebrations in store.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST:  It's a heroes welcome for Lionel Messi and his teammates as they have landed in Buenos Aires in the early hours of Tuesday from Qatar after winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup. 
 
The plane carrying the national team landed here in Bueno Aires at 2.30 a.m. And as soon as the captain Messi emerged from the plane carrying the trophy, he was greeted by a live band and hundreds of fans that have been waiting for him for hours just to welcome him back to his homeland, to the homeland of the, of all the team of course in the early hours.
 
After landing the team jumped on an open bus that will take them to the headquarters of the national football federation where they're expected to rest for a few hours before a parade on the streets of Buenos Aires. 
 
The football federation is just a few kilometers away from Buenos Aires International Airport, but even that short journey was surrounded by hundreds of fans with flags and screaming and just expressing their joy at the return of the team. 
 
Tuesday has been declared a national holiday here in Argentina, so we can expect even more people on the streets of Buenos Aires as the team makes their way with the camp. It's the first time that Argentina wins the FIFA World Cups in since 1986, and it comes at a moment where Argentina economy is in dire straits with inflation at over 90 percent.
 
And the political prioritization is as deep as ever. But this team and this captain, Lionel Messi, were able to really embody the spirit of the entire Argentinian people. And that is why there are truly 45 million Argentinians waiting for them here in their homeland.
 
For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bueno Aires.

HARRAK:  Well, in Paris, the French team also received a heroes welcome after its stellar performance in the final.
 <br>[03:30:00] 
 
The players watched from a balcony as a crowd of thousands gathered to cheer them on. Fans were waving flags, setting off fireworks and chanting the names of their favorite stars. They said, despite coming up short against Argentina, their effort was worthy of a celebration.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  Even if they lost, we must be with them. We'll be with them until the end, and I think they need this, our support. It's magical. Look at the people they've come. It's sweet. I was a bit sad in the beginning because I wanted us to win because winning always feels good. We lost, but we played a good match. Yesterday, I was sad. Today, no more. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  It was extraordinary. We came back from Qatar just after the quarter finals. We had a great time there. They were such good memories. We will remember this forever. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK:  Well, the fans cheered especially hard for the striker Kylian Mbappe. He let the entire tournament with eight goals, including three in the final alone.
 
Just ahead, the January 6th committee wrapped up its historic investigation. We'll tell you how former President Trump is responding to its unprecedented findings. 
 
Plus, former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of sex crimes by a Los Angeles jury. We're following reaction to the verdicts. That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
HARRAK:  Let's get you up to speed now on our top story this hour. The U.S. Justice Department has a crucial decision to make should prosecutors bring criminal charges against Donald Trump. The House committee investigating the January 6th Capitol insurrection
 
 says yes on at least four counts. They say the evidence shows Trump obstructed an official proceeding, defrauded the United States, conspired to make false statements, and aided this insurrection.
 
Well, it didn't take long for the Trump camp to respond, but it is clear that a difference of opinion on the matter has emerged between the former president and his advisors. 
 
Kristen Holmes has a story. 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Former President Trump responded to those criminal referrals by the House to the Department of Justice saying on Truth Social that these folks don't get it. That when you come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. And he added that wasn't -- that what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
 <br>[03:34:56]
 
Now, President Trump, or former President Trump has routinely referred to any sort of legal peril, any investigations as before he was in office, as a witch hunt, as a hoax. And he is correct in that many of these instances, including the impeachment, including even as recently as this summer, the search of his Mar-a-Lago home have galvanized his base and cause Republicans to rally around him.
 
But advisors that I have spoken to say they are concerned that that is not what is going to happen here, particularly after former President Trump launched that 2024 presidential bid. We have seen donors and Republican voters moving further and further away from former President Trump, essentially saying they don't want to deal with his, quote, unquote, "baggage."
 
Now his advisors are concerned that this is just going to add to that baggage. Now this again comes as the former president is launching his third campaign. We are expecting him to start campaigning on the ground in -- in the early the next year, but it remains to be seen, whether or not he still has that support from his base as we move forward.
 
Kristen Holmes, CNN Washington.
 
HARRAK:  The former head of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has agreed to extradition from The Bahamas to the U.S. But it comes after a difficult back and forth between his legal team and prosecutors in The Bahamas. 
 
CNN's Patrick Oppmann has more now reporting in from Nassau.
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Bahamian prosecutor said that they had come on Monday to the courthouse behind me, expecting to finalize an extradition agreement that would allow Sam Bankman-Fried to leave The Bahamas, essentially end his fight against extradition and go to the United States where he's facing federal charges for his alleged role in the meltdown of the FTX crypto organization and trading house. That did not take place as very quickly in the hearing on Monday, prosecutors and Bankman-Fried's local attorney faced off, there was finger pointing and accusations. The local attorney said that he had not been consulted, not been part of this agreement that had been reached. 
 
Apparently, according to prosecutors with Bankman-Fried's U.S. attorneys, there were accusations throughout the hearing and eventually the judge allowed at Sam Bankman-Fried's own request a call to take place between his local attorney and U.S. attorneys to try to work out whatever differences have occurred. 
 
Shortly thereafter within minutes we saw Bankman-Fried be taken away under heavy guard back to the prison where he is currently being held. Some of his U.S. representatives said that he had been eager to leave to The Bahamas and face his charges against some charges that could leave if he is convicted over a hundred years in jail.
 
And one of the reasons behind that change in his legal strategy is that he is incarcerated at the moment at a prison in The Bahamas. That according to the State Department and human rights groups is really unfit for prisoners. There's none of space for enough beds that's infested with maggots and rats, that it's a violent place. 
 
And certainly, one can understand why a billionaire or former billionaire like Sam Bankman-Fried would not want to spend any more time there. But as the extradition -- as the extradition negotiations have broken down here that appears that he will be staying in The Bahamas behind bars for some time longer.
 
Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Nassau, The Bahamas. 
 
HARRAK:  Nothing but silence so far from Elon Musk after Twitter users voted to oust him as head of the social media platform. The chief tweets as he calls himself, said he'd abide by the poll he created, asking if he should step down. With more than 17 million votes cast 57 percent said yes, he should. Forty-three percent said no. 
 
Well, in less than two months as Twitter's boss, Musk has courted controversy with every move including mass layoffs, botched feature rollouts, silencing journalists, and reinstating previously banned accounts. While his antics have even affected his other company, Tesla, which had its stock downgraded on Monday.
 
A Los Angeles jury has found disgraced former movie producer Harvey Weinstein guilty of three sexual assault charges, including rape, but he was acquitted of another charge and the jury couldn't reach a verdict on three others. There were four accusers in all, including the wife of California's governor.
 
CNN's Natasha Chen reports.
 
NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The jury found Weinstein guilty of the three counts that were related to the first Jane Doe accuser. Now, this case involved four women accusing him of rape and sexual assault charges for a total of seven counts, to which he pleaded not guilty, but again, the jury only found him guilty on those three counts related to the same accuser.
 <br>[03:40:00]
 
For the second accuser and the fourth accuser the jury could not come to a decision and those were declared mistrial. For the third accuser the jury found him not guilty on that sexual assault charge. 
 
Now the fourth accuser over the course of the trial was identified as Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a filmmaker, and the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom. The attorney of Jennifer Siebel Newsom released a statement, saying in part, while we would've preferred that those jurors had found him guilty in all counts, we understand that it was a complex trial. Made more difficult by the defense team's argument that a woman who is assaulted must forego her chosen career or be accused of consent after the fact.
 
That attorney also said that you never know how politics may play into things regarding her client's marriage to the California governor. 
 
The attorney for Harvey Weinstein also released a statement, specifically referring to this first accuser, where he was found guilty on those three counts. The attorney said, Harvey is obviously disappointed. However, hopefully, because with this particular accuser, there's good ground to appeal based on time and location of alleged events. He's grateful the jury took their time to deliberate on the other counts, and he's prepared to continue fighting for his innocence. 
 
Now, this Los Angeles jury deliberated for 41 hours, that is far longer than the jury deliberated in New York in his New York trial where he was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. He is appealing that case. And so, what happens in this case becomes very interesting. Now with these three guilty counts, he could be facing up to 24 years in prison on this trial. And the jury is supposed to reconvene tomorrow to hear more arguments about the sentencing and guidelines.
 
Back to you.
 
HARRAK:  Still to come, the U.S. Supreme Court allows a Trump era immigration policy to stay in place for now. But still some border officials say they're gearing up for a massive influx of migrants.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
HARRAK:  U.S. President Joe Biden met with Ecuador's president Monday to discuss efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. Mr. Biden says both countries have made historic strides on migration, and the leaders pledged to uphold their country's respect for human rights. 
 
Their meeting comes as a Trump era immigration policy known as Title 42 has been allowed to stay in place for now. A ruling by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has blocked a lower court decision to end the policy after more than a dozen Republican-led states fought the Biden administration to keep it in place. Well, now the Biden administration and the ACLU representing families
 
 challenging Title 42 will have to file their response to the Supreme Court's ruling by Tuesday evening. 
 <br>[03:44:52]
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Homeland Security Department has a six-pillar plan in place for when the policy ends. It includes hiring hundreds of border patrol, processing coordinators, and deploying personnel from government agencies to the border, increasing holding and transportation capacity for detained migrants, stricter legal consequences for those entering the country illegally. Targeting criminal organizations that smuggle migrants and working with nonprofit organizations and international partners at the border.
 
Well, meantime, the border cities like El Paso, Texas are preparing for a surge of migrants if Title 42 is lifted. Officials say an emergency operations center has been activated to coordinate response efforts to ensure the community remains safe. 
 
CNN's David Culver has more from the other side of the border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Generally quiet here at the U.S.-Mexico border in the early morning hours, but you can see actually just over my shoulder this couple having just crossed over the river, they're now walking up to the U.S. side where we're starting to see some border patrol officials head over to meet them. 
 
And generally, it's a steady flow throughout the day, and certainly they're expecting it to be a potential surge as we get closer to Wednesday when Title 42 is expected to officially end. And the preparation here is that there could be hundreds if not thousands that attempt to cross over. 
 
And you can even see what's relatively new in recent weeks. This chain link fence along the U.S. side of the border seems to be an effort to then funnel some of the migrants to a certain point to then be processed. Interesting to know what we saw here arriving over the weekend, and I arrived on that side, the U.S. side, El Paso, before driving here to Ciudad Juarez. 
 
Let me show you what was inside the airport in the early morning hours of Sunday, late Saturday, just past midnight into Sunday, dozens of migrants camped out on the floor. And I talked to one of the security guards there. They seem unfazed. They say this is something they have seen in recent weeks. 
 
And a lot of those folks had started places like Venezuela making their way up. And many of them position themselves here on this side where I'm standing for several weeks, if not months in preparation to cross over. 
 
And it's interesting to see what was here when we were here just about a month ago, and we can show you from above, hundreds of camps. They were set up tents. This is where a massive encampment where aid workers estimated some 3,000 people at one point were basically living in preparation to cross over. 
 
Now, fast forward to what we saw over the weekend, along this same spot, that same vantage point from above, you can see it was cleared out. And we can show you in late November the clash with police as Mexican officials decided to clear out that camp, evicting many of the migrants who were here and tearing down the tents and having them move along. 
 
We talked to the mayor here in Ciudad Juarez. We want to get a sense of what kind of coordination he has with his counterparts in the U.S. I asked him if he's regularly talking with them. 
 
CRUZ PEREZ CUELLAR, MAYOR, CIUDAD JUAREZ, MEXICO:  We have a lot of communication and we work together. 
 
CULVER:  What is your biggest concern when it comes to Wednesday and what could happen with the lifting of Title 42? 
 
CUELLAR:  The real concern, you know, the real problem that we can have and we have talking with the American authorities is they have to try to process -- process them quickly. 
 
CULVER:  His biggest concern there is that U.S. officials may not process the migrants quickly enough. That's interesting to note. Of course, he doesn't want a backlog on this side, his side, the Mexican side, and he's hoping the U.S. officials are able to get the migrants through quickly. Of course, the strain on resources is obvious on the U.S. side, and right here on the Mexican side.

HARRAK:  Britain's high court has upheld the U.K.'s plan to deport many refugees to Rwanda for processing. The arrangement has been highly controversial since it was announced back in April. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir reports from London.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Another life lost in Britain's icy waters. Another reminder of the dangers faced by migrants attempting to cross the English Channel from Northern France. 
 
UNKNOWN:  More blankets. 
 
BASHIR:  As many as 40,000 migrants have braved the dangerous crossing since the beginning of this year alone. Now the government is doubling down on its plan to tackle illegal migration.
 
RISHI SUNAK, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  When legal proceedings conclude on our migration and economic development partnership, we will restart the first flight to Rwanda. 
 
BASHIR:  It was an 11th hour legal intervention which grounded the first deportation flight in June. Now, after months of deliberation, high court judges in London have ruled that the policy is in fact lawful despite fierce criticism from lawyers and refugee advocacy groups.
 <br>[03:50:05]
 
SOPHIE LUCAS, LAWYER FOR CLAIMANTS:  There are serious concerns around the functioning of the asylum system in Rwanda, as well as serious concerns about political freedom of expression.
 
BASHIR:  Under the government's scheme, thousands of migrants arriving in the U.K. illegally could be deported to Rwanda to have their asylum claims heard there. Among them is Yusuf (Ph), a Syrian refugee whose name we have changed to protect his identity. He was one of the more than a hundred asylum seekers due to be deported to Rwanda in June.
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  I want to live in peace in the U.K. to work and build the future here for my wife and son. It just breaks my heart. There is no future for my son in Syria.
 
BASHIR:  Yusuf (Ph) says he fled his war in hometown of Daraa in Syria in 2017, leaving behind his wife and child in the hope of building a new life for them overseas. Yusuf's (Ph) journey took him from Syria to Lebanon and then onwards to Libya where he says he was detained for eight months before fleeing to Europe. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  We were given very little food or water. They would beat us, torture us. Then after I left Libya, I traveled across the sea to Italy. It was a very difficult journey. We were stuck at sea for about three days. One more day, and I think we would've died.
 
BASHIR:  Like many refugees, Yusuf (Ph) then traveled to Calais in northern France where he spent weeks living in a squalid refugee camp waiting to be smuggled on a small boat to the U.K. It's this very crossing that the government is now clamping down on, despite widespread concern over how effective and how ethical the Rwanda deportation deal really is. 
 
COLIN YEO, IMMIGRATION LAWYER:  There's no evidence that it's putting anybody off. And we're talking about people who've fled really serious problems, civil wars, massive human rights abuses in their own countries.
 
BASHIR:  While the high court has now ruled in favor of the government, the court has also ruled that all potential deportation cases must now be considered on an individual basis. And campaign groups say they are still considering all legal options to appeal the judgment. But for those fleeing some of the worst hardships imaginable, the prospect of being turned away is almost too much to bear.
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  If they send me to Rwanda, then it's over for me. After all the struggles I've faced, long journey I've taken to reach this point, it will be devastating. I would kill myself.
 
BASHIR:  Nada Bashir, CNN, London.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
HARRAK:  We want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of one of our own, CNN senior investigative correspondent Drew Griffin. He died Saturday after a battle with cancer. 
 
Anderson Cooper looks at the incredible legacy Drew leaves behind. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT:  It was so hot --
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  During his nearly two decades at CNN, Drew Griffin was known for his tenacious reporting.
 
GRIFFIN:  Are you worried you'll be indicted before the election, sir?
 
COOPER:  His interviews were unwavering. 
 
GRIFFIN:  I don't think you really understand how votes are cast, collected, and tabulated in this country. 
 
UNKNOWN:  OK.
 <br>[03:55:01]
 
COOPER:  And he gave a voice to those who didn't have one.
 
UNKNOWN:  We don't expect it to be easy. We don't expect the truth to be easy.
 
COOPER:  Drew was a gifted storyteller dedicated to seeking the truth and holding the powerful accountable. 
 
GRIFFIN:  Why do you continue to push the lie that the 2020 election was stolen?
 
UNKNOWN:  It's not a lie. It's a fact. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
GRIFFIN:  It's a lie. You have no proofs. We've looked at all the facts. 
 
UNKNOWN:  You haven't. I'll tell you, --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
GRIFFIN:  You don't have the facts. 
 
COOPER:  Andrew's stories had real world impact. 
 
GRIFFIN:  Well, if Uber doesn't release the number of drivers who are accused of sexual assault. So, CNN decided to count up ourselves.
 
COOPER:  After CNN questioned Uber about a string of sexual assaults by drivers the company made major safety changes to its app and revised its policies. 
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST:  Excellent reporting. Thanks to you and your team. 
 
COOPER:  Drew exposed serious issues at V.A. hospitals across the country. Revealing a broken system, veterans dying while waiting for care. 
 
UNKNOWN:  This particular veteran was screaming, please do whatever you can. Don't let the V.A. do this to another patient or another veteran. We do not deserve this type of treatment. 
 
COOPER:  That led to the resignation of the V.A. secretary and an overhaul of the V.A.'s scheduling system.
 
GRIFFIN:  Gas here in -- 
 
COOPER:  He covered business and terrorism, the environment, and politics.
 
GRIFFIN:  Mr. Birch, Mr. Birch.
 
COOPER:  And there were many people over the years who didn't want to answer his questions.
 
GRIFFIN:  Please talk to us, director. Director Helman (Ph). Did the background checks for those companies not reveal the fact that you were accused of torture and murder? Do you know Alex Bergman, a convicted felon who, apparently runs one of these clinics and has been billing the state of California for several years, despite the fact that there have been complaints.
 
COOPER:  Drew won most of journalism's big awards, but that's not what motivated him. He cared about people and how they were impacted. 
 
GRIFFIN:  Get out, dude. 
 
COOPER:  While he was covering the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, he ended up rescuing a man from floodwaters. 
 
GRIFFIN:  No, don't, don't go backwards. All right, sir. You all right? 
 
UNKNOWN:  Yes.
 
GRIFFIN:  All right. Hold on, hold on. 
 
COOPER:  His job as a correspondent took him all across the country.
 
GRIFFIN:  It wasn't that long ago these wild pointy grasslands were just that. Wild. Now, almost everywhere you look is a gas rig.
 
COOPER:  And to different parts of the world. But his favorite place was home. He was deeply devoted to his family, his wife Margot, and his three children, Ele, Louis, and Miles as well as two grandchildren.
 
Drew Griffin will be missed by all of us.
