VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST: Lava from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano is now threatening a crucial road that connects Hawaii's Big Island.
 
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST: Officials say the molten rock is just around 3 miles away from that highway. Look at these images. It's prompting scores of drivers to pullover to witness this natural wonder. And as a result, safety concerns are rising over the growing number of traffic jams.
 
CNN's David Culver is on the ground in Hawaii. So it's not the, necessarily, the lava that's causing the danger, it's the traffic jams?
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's the sightseeing, essentially. Exactly, Alisyn and Victor. And we're not far from that main highway that you mentioned. It's just behind the camera here, and then it's a little tough to see during the day. I will show you that you can see the big plume, which looks like smoke. That is not smoke. That's been warned by officials to be very toxic gases. And so that's part of the concern here.
 
But then just a little bit farther down, you might be able to see just past what looks almost like another planet's terrain, that is where the lava ends. So that really is about 2.5 miles away from us. And the concern is, it is inching closer, but slowly. Quite literally at a snail's pace, is how it's been described.
 
So, it's headed this direction. They're saying at least another week is what their anticipation is. If it actually ends up getting to that main thorough fare. Right now, though, they're saying they'd able to at least give a couple of days heads up to folks to say, hey, this is going to be closed off. But as far as that fog or volcanic smog is concerned, that's the other thing officials are warning folks, because we've got some wind pushing through.
 
They're saying if it gets to a certain level, then they're monitoring it, then it could become dangerous enough for them to issue some warnings and have folks to remain indoors. And if needed to go beyond that, then it would be rather extreme. But that's what they're saying, the extent of it would be.
 
If you're looking at some of these images, it is night and day and very distinct when you are looking at the glow of the lava in the dark of night versus what we see now. And that's really just the plume in the sky. Those images are so striking. That's what had folks pulling over, wanting to get a feel for what exactly this was like.
 
And it's interesting because you have locals who, some of -- whom haven't seen this in 34 years, some -- or 38 years, some who are younger than that, haven't seen it at all, and they wanted to get a sense of this, too, because for them, it's a spiritual moment. And it's something that as far as not, at least, causing immediate danger to anybody, it's something that they want to take in for a safe distance. Victor and Alisyn?
 
BLACKWELL: David, you've been in a split screen your entire shot and the entire time you've been explaining this, I have been just fixated on these pictures. They are remarkable what we're seeing. And, of course, you say -- 
 
CULVER: It's really impressive.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, at this moment, not a danger, but that could change. David Culver for us there, thank you so much.
 
CAMEROTA: Totally mesmerizing.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes.
 
CAMEROTA: All right, meanwhile, hate speech on Twitter has surged dramatically since Elon Musk took over. We have more just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:38:20]
 
CAMEROTA: New research shows that hate speech is surging on Twitter ever since Elon Musk took over. The Center for Countering Digital Hate finds the daily use of the N-word is up 300 percent from the 2022 average. The rate of slurs against gay and transgender people has also climbed.
 
BLACKWELL: The reports come just hours after Twitter suspended the account of the rapper formerly known as Kanye West for inciting violence. Musk did not specify which post was the problem, but just yesterday, West posted an altered image of the Star of David with a swastika inside. He also praised Hitler during a conversation with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
 
Joining us now, Kierna Mayo, Executive Editor of One World and of Roc Lit 101. CNN Contributor Nischelle Turner, host of Entertainment Tonight, is also with us. And Jeff Gardere, a clinical psychologist. Welcome to you all. I want to start with you, Jeff, because Ye says that he's bipolar, has manic episodes. Not every person with mental health challenges says or does these things. And there are plenty of people who are hateful and bigoted who do not have mental health challenges. How much of our conversation should be informed by his mental health challenges?
 
JEFF GARDERE, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST: Well, I think, certainly a lot of it. There's been a history, according to his family, of bipolar disorder. It's quite obvious to me that this is someone who's been in a manic phase for quite some time. Certainly, we don't know how much of his speech is related to that bipolar disorder, whether it was there beforehand in the bipolar disorder.
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
Being in the manic phase is taking away any kind of filter or whether it's purely from this mental illness. But either way, this is someone who is in deep, deep, deep, emotional trouble and needs an intervention.
 
CAMEROTA: Nischelle, I totally agree. I think it is so uncomfortable to watch him mentally melting down.
 
NISCHELLE TURNER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.
 
CAMEROTA: I mean, in addition, obviously to all of the hateful stuff he's spewing. But it seems that this is a classic manic episode that he's having, which, as we know, people do self-destructive things and he seems to be in the throes of it. Nischelle, here's my question. Where are the people around him, the friends, the family, the advisers, the associates? Why can't somebody box him in and get him some help right now?
 
TURNER: Well, I think that we're seeing some of that play out in front of us. You guys talk about what he's going through mentally and I will let Dr. Jeff talk about those things because I am not one to diagnose. I am just like the rest of us, watching this really sad scenario play out in front of us in six scenario, in a lot of ways, play out in front of us.
 
I mean, we know that his mother passed away. Some people would attribute his start of his real issues once that happened. We've seen him now become divorced, so he doesn't have the support of a wife or that family anymore. We've also, you know, seen a lot of his friends say, we've been trying to stick by you, we just can't do it anymore.
 
I think people were coming to his aid, trying to help him. We've seen different times when he's, you know, lashed out or spoken out. We've seen some of his friends, whether it be a celebrity friends, try to rush to his aid. But now it seems like people are saying enough, because you -- there are things sometimes you can't come back from.
 
And, you know, people, I think they think of themselves and say, I don't want to be associated with someone who is spouting the fact that Hitler is -- there are good things to say about Hitler. So I think at this time, people are just -- whether they're doing it behind the scenes, that's another story, but the public face of it is just, I don't want to have anything to do with him.
 
BLACKWELL: Kierna, I was on our morning call today. I was talking about how not every community, every group is having the same conversation about Ye. His music is still a rotation. People still wearing Yeezys.
 
KIERNA MAYO, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ONE WORLD: Yes.
 
BLACKWELL: Listen, I went back and checked, he got a standing ovation at the BET Awards after he, of course, said that slavery was a choice. So, is this a moment that Kanye gets a pass again or do you think that this is something that is going to stick for his reputation because his music still playing?
 
MAYO: Right? You know, I think that that conversation -- that question might not be nuanced enough. You know, I don't know it's a matter of simply giving him a pass again. I mean, there are a couple of things at play. For one, media at large doesn't give a damn about hip hop culture, generally speaking.
 
Half the people in conversation about Kanye right now couldn't name an album. And yet there are people who are -- who have spent their entire lives devoted to his artistry. So I think in one respect, there's a conversation about his artistic contribution that people wrestle with when it comes to the question of Michael Jackson and R. Kelly and all kinds of folks who have agreed particular groups. And there's a question of whether or not one should really indulge.
 
I think the other thing, though, in my criticism of the media of which I am a part, I think that there's an overvaluing. I've been really thinking about this. I'm like, listen, there are rappers who have clothing lines even, and popular famous wives. There are some that have existed before. Kanye, exists in the world alongside of him, and for some reason, there's a particular amount of attention that we're giving to this story.
 
I'm starting to wonder, is Kanye in and of himself, even the story? Are we somehow contributing to this manic episode and making everyone have to partake in something that's very hurtful for many, many people? And, you know, is he really the headline? I really just had to parse that a little bit this morning, thinking about him. Obviously, he's way out of pocket. This is a very sick person.
 
Marc Lamont Hill tweeted the other day that, you know, he was trash. This isn't just about someone misunderstood, this is someone who was actually trash. And I don't think that any of us can debate that at this point, whatever community you're seated in. But with respect to how you age him, I think it is different for different groups.
 
And I just wonder if the media itself is being a bit disingenuous about kind of chasing and inflating this story, and the importance of someone who's -- how important is Kanye? You know, like, when you really think about it, to the communist, it's like, is it really fair (ph) -- 
 
CAMEROTA: Yes. MAYO: -- smart journalistic for us to do? When we remove Kanye from the social political conversation of 2012, how much is actually lost?
 
CAMEROTA: Yes.
 <br>[15:45:13]
 
MAYO: I think that in some part, we're engaging in a bit of a salacious nature of the sickness.
 
CAMEROTA: Yes. And Nischelle, we -- 
 
TURNER: That's a great question.
 
CAMEROTA: Yes, go ahead.
 
TURNER: Yes.
 
CAMEROTA: Give us your last word.
 
TURNER: No, go ahead. Go ahead, Alisyn. I just -- I'm just taking -- 
 
CAMEROTA: Well, we've had the exact same conversation in our morning call.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes.
 
CAMEROTA: How much oxygen do we want to give this? But when somebody with his amount of following does say something so hateful and vile, are we supposed to call it out? But, Nischelle, go ahead. I'll give you your last word.
 
TURNER: No, I mean, we have the same conversation here at Entertainment Tonight. We had this very conversation this morning and over the past few months, we have decided as a unit here that we do not cover him, that we do not give him oxygen, and that we do not inflame this at all, that we just decided, just, no, we're not going to do it. We're not going to participate in it. We're not going to give it oxygen.
 
And I do feel really good about that decision. I mean, I was wrestling with it today when I got the call to, come on, like, do I even want to discuss him? Do I even want to talk about it? I do understand the value in it, because he does have a following and he does reach people. And we've seen it. We've seen it play out after he says the most ridiculous things.
 
We see people hang banners over the freeway in Los Angeles. There are people who can't parse the difference between what he says and what is reality. So, in a way, I think it is important to talk about it. In another way like, it's just exhausting. He's just exhausting.
 
CAMEROTA: Yes.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, certainly is. CAMEROTA: We really appreciate you all coming on and being willing to have the conversation with us. Thank you very much for all of your perspectives, Nischelle, Kierna and Jeff.
 
BLACKWELL: All right, this just in. Houston police have made an arrest in the fatal shooting of the rapper Takeoff on November 1. They charged a 33-year-old Patrick Xavier Clark with murder. Now homicide investigators say Takeoff was tragically at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SGT. MICHAEL BURROW, HOUSTON POLICE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATOR: The event was a private party. There was a lucrative dice game that went on at the event. There was an argument that happened afterwards outside the bowling alley, which led to the shooting. I can tell you that Takeoff was not involved in playing in the dice game. He was not involved in the argument that happened outside. He was not armed. He was an innocent bystander.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLACKWELL: Takeoff was just 28 years old. He was a member of the multi-platinum selling rap group Migos. Police made another arrest in the incident, charging a man for unlawfully carrying a weapon.
 
U.S. Men's Soccer Team star Christian Pulisic will play in tomorrow's big match against the Netherlands. CNN was at the team's practice today. We're live in Qatar, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:52:30]
 
BLACKWELL: American soccer star Christian Pulisic has been formally cleared now to play in tomorrow's match against the Netherlands. He's coming off a pelvic injury, but he was on the field for warmup drills today. CNN's Don Riddell joins us now. Don, what is the latest?
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, WORLD SPORT: Well, as you say, he's been clear to play, so I think we must assume that he will be playing. I was at the United States training session just a few hours ago, and he was out there running drills. I wouldn't say he was going at it 100 percent, but he was definitely looking pretty good in his distinctive orange soccer boots.
 
And it's just so important to the U.S. that he is back in the team. Of course, he's known as Captain America, even though he isn't captain of this side. It's the side that came into the World Cup with basically no World Cup experience. 25 of the 26 man squad have never played in this tournament before, but they are getting better and better with every game.
 
They need him against the Netherlands because they are the underdogs. They've only scored two goals in this tournament so far. And Pulisic has been involved in both of them. And so, I think the United States are really good to go. And this is a knockout game, it's win or go home. But in these kinds of games, when they're competitive, anything can happen.
 
So I would imagine that an awful lot of U.S. soccer fans will be glued to their seats at the edge of their seats tomorrow for this big game. Back to you, guys.
 
BLACKWELL: You are right about that. Don Riddell, thanks.
 
CAMEROTA: So the January 6th House Select Committee is getting closer to a deadline to finish its final report. We have the latest on their meetings, next.

 <br>[15:58:45]
 
CAMEROTA: We're about one week away from crowning the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year.
 
BLACKWELL: And one of the contenders, Tyrique Glasgow, has been helping to make his community safer after his release from prison.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TYRIQUE GLASGOW, CNN HERO OF THE YEAR CONTENDER: When you run a block, you're the one who -- the community people know. It's a dangerous life, but it's a normal life.
 
Going to jail really woke me up. If our community was going to follow me for some of the negative stuff, I just said, let me see if they're going to follow me for something positive.
 
You can grab what you want.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Make yourself at home.
 
GLASGOW: In 2019, we opened up our community engagement center, which used to be at the community drug house, but now it's a safe place for our children.
 
How many people here got kids?
 
We provide clothing, food, vegetables. We have hot meals on Tuesdays and Thursdays. One chicken.
 
Giving people what they need not only helps them, because it consistently stays safer here.
 
The shootings are down and the hope is up.
 
That's what you're here for.
 
My relationship with the Philadelphia Police Department is cool. Seeing the officers in a different light, it builds trust and it builds confidence. They need to see that all cops aren't bad. It's really about your heart and what you want to do. We're trying to create a safe haven environment for the whole neighborhood.
