KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to all you watching us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.
 
Russia claims Ukraine is behind drone attacks on the Kremlin. What happens next and how will Vladimir Putin use this in the war?
 
The alleged shooter at a hospital building here in Atlanta is captured hours after he killed one woman and wounded four others. Authorities are trying to figure out what set him off.
 
And the special counsel investigating possible obstruction of justice charges against Donald Trump issued a flurry of subpoenas to some of Trump's closest allies, including two men in charge of surveillance videos at Mar-a-Lago.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber.
 
BRUNHUBER: It is 9:00 a.m. in Kyiv where authorities are reporting the most intense air attacks since the beginning of the year. A military official says Ukrainian air defenses intercepted all incoming Russian missiles. It's likely retaliation for Russia claims is a pair of Ukrainian drone strikes on the Kremlin in an attempt to assassinate President Vladimir Putin. He wasn't in the building at the time and Ukraine strongly denies any such involvement.
 
A CNN analysis does support Russia's claim that two drones flew above the Kremlin early Wednesday, but doesn't show evidence Ukraine was behind this. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a visit to Finland says Ukraine doesn't have enough weapons to defend its own territory, let alone attack Moscow.
 
So, for more, CNN's Clare Sebastian is live in London. So, Clare, bring us up to speed on what more we know. And on the reaction to all this. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Kim, I think the key point at this stage is that Kyiv, Ukraine is really on guard for any retaliation. This is what Moscow said in its original statement announcing these alleged drone attacks, that it reserves the right to respond and these overnight attacks on the country, including the capital Kyiv can perhaps be viewed in that context.
 
The Air Force is now saying the 24 Shaheed drones were fired at Ukraine, they were able to shoot down, 18 of them, including all of them over the capital Kyiv. Though an official in Kyiv saying that it's now been hit three times in the first four days of May. The greatest intensities since the beginning of the year. And we are hearing of debris from those drones that were shut down falling on some streets in Kyiv.
 
So, even though they were shut down and there is still some impact. Also hearing of explosions overnight in Odesa, we're getting some video in showing that as well. And under this threat of retaliation, clearly, President Zelenskyy was at pains to distance Ukraine, as much as possible from these drone attacks. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE: We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We are defending our villages and cities. We don't have, you know, enough weapon for these. That's why we don't use it anywhere. For us, that is the deficit that we can't spend it and we didn't attack Putin. We leave it to tribunal.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: Speaking of the tribunal, clearly in reference to the International Criminal Court to which just under two months ago indicted by them and Putin himself for war crimes. President Zelenskyy according to the Dutch public broadcaster is now in the Netherlands having wrapped up his trip to Finland where you saw him speaking there. He will, according to the Dutch public broadcaster, make a speech in The Hague today entitled No justice -- No Peace Without Justice rather.
 
And will in fact visit the International Criminal Court which is investigating those war crimes in Ukraine. Another couple of developments to bring you up to speed with overnight, Kim, is that to separate oil facilities have according to local officials and state media in Russia been hit by a legend drone attacks. One in Krasnodar which is just across from Crimea, one in the Rostov region just near Ukraine's border in the north with Russia.
 
The Ukraine, of course, has not confirmed any involvement in these and they appear to have been relatively minor. But this is part of a spate of drone attacks and attacks on infrastructure, oil storage, train derailment, things like that across the border in Russia that we've seen in the past week or so.
 
BRUNHUBER: All right. Appreciate all the updates. Clare Sebastian in London. Thanks so much. [02:05:00]
 
I'm going to go live now to Canberra, Australia. Malcolm Davis is a senior analysis at the -- analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Thank you so much for being here with us, Malcolm. You like many are skeptical that Ukraine could be behind this? Why is that?
 
MALCOM DAVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE (via Skype): Look, I think the likelihood that this is a false flag operation run by the Russians is consistent with their form in the past, you know, attacks in the past against urban civilian targets carried out by Russian forces to justify the use of force. And I think that President Zelenskyy is right, you know, the Ukrainians have so much to do in terms of defending their own country.
 
They don't have the means to attack that -- at that distance. Certainly, the Ukrainians have attacked inside Russia, but it's a long way from where they have attacks have gone to Moscow. And I really don't think that this attack would have made much sense militarily, in terms of giving the Russians exactly what they wanted, which is a justification to escalate. The Ukrainians are not that stupid.
 
BRUNHUBER: OK. But why would Russia need a justification to escalate -- they could just escalate on their own?
 
DAVIS: Certainly, they could. But I think what Putin is thinking in terms of is using this as an opportunity to potentially declare war, potentially undertake a national mobilization that opens up all sorts of opportunities for the Russians to bring in additional forces to also more importantly, leverage other aspects of Russian industry and society to support the war effort. So, in other words, if they're going from what they're calling a special military operation, to an actual declared war, suddenly a whole set of new operations and roles and opportunities kick in for the Russians that are not there at the moment that they can bring to bear.
 
And I think that the Russians are thinking very much in terms of what happens at the end of the upcoming Ukrainian offensive, which is likely to go well. What the Russians want to be able to do is ultimately withstand that offensive and then come back stronger later this year or into 2024 to sustain the war because the Russians want a prolonged war, they do not want, essentially to see defeat, staring them in the face.
 
The U.S. is analyzing and assessing sort of, you know, who could be behind this. How do they go about finding out who was behind that drone attack? Will the answer come out eventually? I know, you know, Russia has a history of producing false evidence as well. So, they'll be working in parallel, I suppose.
 
DAVIS: Well, look, I think there are three possibilities. First is the most likely possibility is a false flag attack undertaken by the Russians. Second possibility is that it's a Russian dissidents or resistance units within Russia that are opposed to Putin's war. And so, therefore, they're using these sorts of capabilities to try and attack the seat of government. The third possibility is that it's Ukrainians. But I think that third possibility is the least likely.
 
So, I think what the U.S. and other allied governments will be doing is focusing very much on those first two possibilities. There'll be using national technical means to assess the video, to sort of monitor satellite surveillance of the area at the time, even signals intelligence. And I would imagine that they'll find -- eventually, they'll find the reason why this attack happened and who did it.
 
BRUNHUBER: We only have a minute left. But I want to go back to that second possibility that you raised. The possibly that could be Russian dissidents behind this. How likely is that? And if so, how worrying would it be for the Kremlin that they -- that they didn't see this coming?
 
DAVIS: I mean, it's a possibility. You know, there have been an awful lot of explosions in oil storage facilities, train derailments. That sort of thing occurring inside Russia recently, which could be the work of either Ukrainian special forces or could have been saboteurs. I think that for the Russian government, if it is, in fact, saboteurs as opposed to a false flag operation, there would be a worry because it does suggest that there's an active insurgency or an active partisan group that are operating inside Russia, that are opposed to the Russian war against Ukraine. 
 
And I would imagine that the Russian government would then seek about trying to hunt them down and try and putting an end to them.
 
BRUNHUBER: All right. I really appreciate your analysis as always. Malcolm Davis in Canberra, Australia. Thanks so much.
 
DAVIS: Thank you.
 
BRUNHUBER: The suspect is in custody after a shooting in Atlanta medical facility left one woman dead and four others wounded. The woman who has been killed has been identified as 38-year-old Amy St. Pierre who worked with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Police track 24-year-old Delon Patterson for several hours, close to this area about 11 miles or 17 kilometers from the crime scene where he was captured at a gated condominium complex.
 
CNN's Nick Valencia has the details of how the shooting unfolded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[02:10:09]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look at this. They all have shields and giant guns.
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Another deadly mass shooting in America, this time during the lunch rush in Midtown Atlanta.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the middle of the lunch, I just started hearing people say, hey, you know we're on lockdown. There's an active shooter next door. VALENCIA: According to Atlanta police, it happened inside an 11th floor waiting room at Northside Hospital Medical. This couple was on the ninth floor at the time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My son was inside the procedure room when we heard the popping. It was really nothing until we saw everyone locking doors and scurrying through the doctor's office and then they put the television on. And we saw the breaking news on television and they mentioned that it was that address. So, it was surprising that it was in the same building that we were in.
 
VALENCIA: At least one person is dead and four others wounded. The Atlanta Police Department has identified 24-year-old Delon Patterson as the suspect in the shooting, releasing surveillance camera images of him wearing a hoodie and carrying a backpack.
 
ANDRE DICKENS, ATLANTA, GEORGIA MAYOR: Thanks to the highly trained police officers across our region. We are able to bring this suspect into custody without further harm.
 
VALENCIA: A high-level source at Atlanta Police telling CNN the suspect and his mother were at the hospital for a medical appointment for Patterson. At some point he became agitated and allegedly started shooting with a handgun before leaving the building, according to police.
 
CHIEF DARIN SCHIERBAUM, ATLANTA POLICE: we believe he carjacked a vehicle a short distance away and it was able to flee the scene as the law enforcement agencies were just descending on this area.
 
VALENCIA: We've learned the suspect is a former member of the Coast Guard and was discharged in January.
 
DEPUTY CHIEF CHARLES HAMPTON, ATLANTA POLICE: He spent about maybe two minutes inside the building where he then exited on foot. And what we were able to pick up on the camera network system is that he went to a Shell gas station where he coveted a vehicle. That car was pickup truck was left running.
 
VALENCIA: The suspect's mother is reportedly cooperating with police. Atlanta police say all the gunshot victims are women.
 
SCHIERBAUM: Unfortunately, a 39-year-old female has lost her life. And of those that are injured as a 71-year-old female, a 56-year-old female, a 39-year-old female and then a 25-year-old female.
 
VALENCIA: The four injured victims were taken to Grady Hospital. Three are in critical condition. One in stable.
 
SCHIERBAUM: Just feels too soon to know why these individuals were chosen.
 
Nick Valencia, CNN, Atlanta.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) BRUNHUBER: The suspected gunman in last week's mass shooting in rural Texas has been charged with five counts of murder. Prosecutors have charged the man Mexican national with five counts of murder. He's accused of shooting and killing five people including a nine-year-old in his neighbor's house on Friday after they asked him to stop firing his gun in his yard. 
 
Investigators say the suspects longtime partner helped him evade police for days giving him food and clothes and arranging transport to the house where he was later captured. She is now facing a felony charge.
 
And Serbia is also trying to come to grips with a horrific mass shooting. A very rare occurrence in that country. And police say it was committed by a 13-year-old boy who shot and killed nine people in his elementary school in Belgrade on Wednesday. A candlelight vigil was later held for the victims. Officials say the suspect didn't show any remorse after the attack. His motive is still under investigation.
 
As Fred Pleitgen reports, police believe the shooting was planned well in advance.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Horror inside a school classroom. A scene all too familiar in the U.S. but this is Serbia's capital Belgrade. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the country in over a decade. Moments after arriving at the prestigious Vladislav Ribnikar Elementary School, a 13-year-old student took out his father's gun and shot the security guard before turning it on pupils according to officials.
 
VESELIN MILIC, BELGRADE POLICE CHIEF (through translator): There was one girl in her desk, another at the piano. He took their lives. Then he went out into the corridor to the history classroom. He went into the classroom and immediately shot the teacher and the students there from the door.
 
PLEITGEN: According to eyewitnesses, the boys shot the female history teacher as terrified students hid under their desks. She was rushed to hospital along with six injured children according to CNN-affiliate N1.
 
The hospital's director detailed severe brain injuries and gunshot wounds to the legs.
 
The perpetrator was arrested in the school yard and led out in handcuffs after he called the police himself and told them what he did.
 
I asked where's my kid, says one girl's father describing the moment he realized she was in the history class. She escaped but when he found her, she was in shock, he says.
 <br>[02:15:00] The crime had been planned for over a month. The teen had drawn a sketch of the attack that looked like something from a video game or a horror movie according to Belgrade's police chief. 
 
Locals told CNN The incident came out of nowhere.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This never happened in Serbia before, we only heard about this in news from the United States.
 
PLEITGEN: Outside the school, these parents are the lucky ones. Their children made it out alive. But a nation is now in mourning and questions are asked over how this could have happened.

BRUNHUBER: CNN is now learning that Special Counsel Jack Smith is investigating the handling of surveillance footage from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home following a subpoena last year. That we're told has prompted a new round of Grand Jury subpoenas. Sources also tell us that two longtime Trump Organization executives are set to appear before the grand jury in the hours ahead.
 
CNNs Katelyn Polantz has more details from Washington.
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: The Special Counsel Jack Smith, working for the Justice Department investigating Donald Trump has been busy in recent weeks. Just last week, he was personally sitting in to witness some of the testimony of former Vice President Mike Pence at a grand jury looking at Donald Trump and the aftermath of the 2020 election for possible federal crimes. That is not a typical thing.
 
There are many prosecutors that work for Smith that are in and out of the grand jury out of the federal courthouse almost daily. I don't believe anyone has ever spotted Smith there personally. And he was in the room for some of that Pence testimony to witness it himself. Just underlining how serious of an investigation and how substantial a witness Mike Pence, the former vice president was bringing him in under court order under subpoena to testify to that grand jury, potentially about his former boss, Donald Trump.
 
And Smith, like I said has been very, very busy. He's busy in the coming days. We are learning not just related to the January 6th inquiry is bringing in many, many witnesses. He's also having major allies of Donald Trump. People from the Trump Organization at its high levels handling security, the chief operating officer are set to testify to the federal grand jury in Washington on Thursday.
 
Those men, their names are Matthew Calamari Sr. and Matthew Calamari Jr., father and son. They are the people that would be responsible for the handling of surveillance tapes by the Trump Organization and they are of interest right now. We know because the Justice Department Jack Smith and his investigators they are questioning them and others about the handling of surveillance footage that the Justice Department wanted to obtain last year.
 
It ultimately was turned over and showed employees of Donald Trump moving boxes in Mar-a-Lago at the resort out of a storage room. But now the handling of that surveillance tape itself when it was requested by the Justice Department has become an area of inquiry into a possible obstruction case as well, related to Smith and his many inquiries on that side, the Mar-a-Lago documents case.

BRUNHUBER: Fears fighting is continuing in Sudan and a fragile ceasefire appears to have ended even before properly started. We'll look at what Sudan's paramilitary forces are claiming next. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:22:04]
 
BRUNHUBER: The seven-day ceasefire that was expected to go into effect on Thursday may already have been breached. Sudan's Rapid Support Forces claimed the Sudanese army has violated the humanitarian armistice by attacking their forces with artillery and aircraft early Thursday. And the Sudanese army says it repelled a RSF attack in North Khartoum.
 
CNN's Dave McKenzie is following all developments from Johannesburg.
 
DAVE MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Despite ceasefire announcements being made repeatedly on Wednesday, there was still reports from eyewitnesses and CNN reporters on the ground of clashes and airstrikes in Khartoum, in Sudan. The U.N. says that more than 100,000 people have left the country and at least three times that many are stuck within the country displaced.
 
The head of the humanitarian response, U.N. Undersecretary General Martin Griffiths was in Port Sudan. There's a need for everything. He says food, water, medical supplies, and the need is very urgent to get to civilians in Sudan. But he said what is critical is that there are assurances of security for both their staff and for those supplies.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. UNDERSECRETARY GENERAL, HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS: We will still require agreements and arrangements to allow for movement of staff and supplies. We will need to have agreements at the highest level and very publicly, and we will need to deliver those commitments into local arrangements that can be depended on.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: To illustrate his point, he said six trucks of the World Food Program were looted on their way into Darfur. And in Darfur, there's been some of the most chaotic scenes. Eyewitnesses saying that they've been repeated clashes in cities like El Geneina, where all of the hospitals are closed they say. It means that people are streaming across the border into Chad where they are getting help from the UNHCR and others.
 
But if there isn't a meaningful ceasefire in the coming days, you can imagine that this humanitarian catastrophe will get even worse in Sudan.
 
David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg.
 
BRUNHUBER: The U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked its key interest rate for the 10th consecutive time but it's hinting this one may be the last hike for a while. Maybe. We'll explain, coming up. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:28:14]
 
BRUNHUBER: It's fine, earnest efforts to contain the recent string of bank failures. Another regional bank is said to be "exploring its strategic options." Shares of Los Angeles-based PacWest Bank fell more than 50 percent in afterhours trading and that came after Bloomberg reported the bank might be looking to sell itself, splits off up or raise cash to stabilize itself. Like many regional banks, rising interest rates have devalued its loan and bond holdings, prompting depositors to quickly withdraw their uninsured deposits.
 
Pac was reported last week that customers have stopped withdrawing their money and more than 70 percent of its deposits are insured. But despite the bank sectors woes, U.S. Federal Reserve has just hiked its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, its 10th consecutive raise is now at five to 5-1/4 percent. But the Fed Chairman suggested the rate hikes might take a breather for a while now to see if inflation eases even more on its own.
 
Now that uncertainty rattled Wall Street Wednesday. All three major indices ended down less than one percent.
 
All right. Let's turn now to Ryan Patel from Los Angeles. He's a senior fellow at Claremont Graduate University's Drucker School of Management. Thanks again for being here with us. So, Ryan, I want to quote something here. Moody's Analytics' chief economist told CNN, "It's a mistake to raise rates. They're taking a risk that's not necessary." So, is he right? Is it a mistake?
 
RYAN PATEL, SENIOR FELLOW, CLAREMONT GRADUATE UNIVERSITY (via Skype): Well, not according to the Fed Chairman, I think that they've kind of, you know, at this point, they feel like .25 basis points isn't much, you know, if we had the guarantee, which we don't but the markets why they, you know, we saw today is that the markets had priced and rate cuts were going to happen the second half of 2023.
 <br>[02:30:01]
 
And so what Jerome Powell stated and I think he's laying it out, although he's not a firm on it, think there will be no more cut, there'll be a pause.
 
So, that this would be the last 25 basis points that they still feel that the data is still slowing up. And shouldn't really drastically change much, Kim, unless we have see some other variables. So, I don't think, you know, at this point, they've already done it 10 times in a row, an extra 25 basis points. I don't think tips is over unless there's some other variables. But I think the pausing conversation could provide some ease in this conversation moving forward.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes, and then, you know, the other big story, another day, another regional bank, and troubling we talked a few days ago, you and I about first republic, now PacWest Bank more seem inevitable. So, these two stories, the rate hikes and the health of the mid-size banks is I kind of alluded to in the introduction, they're kind of related. So, explain how the rate hikes are causing more stress on these smaller banks?
 
PATEL: Yes, I mean, I think at the end of the day, when you think about, you know, I think, we think of just two words that came up credit, tightening. And when you have less lending, you know, to make more loans. It causes banks to not have that cash to be able to allow to have that loans and they have that deposit. So, that does go into back to the interest rate that Fed does. And it's another part of why the banks are so failing, right? So, with so many depositors withdrawing their money from the mid-sized regional banks.
 
They just have less to lend, and I think that provides a problem in this cyclical piece that the Fed is looking at, and they don't want this, right? This is not something that the regional bank wanted, even Jerome Powell actually thought JPMorgan. He was an exception at Morgan bought the first republic. They're rather -- he would rather have seen a regional bank get that. So, you know, we have all these aspects as interesting. Even PacWest, you know, from their market cap, roughly is down 72 percent this year. So, it's not like it just happens overnight, it keeps taking hit over hit. And you know, when these reports come out, and and it just continues to see the decline. I think in the first quarter of deposits of $5 billion in the first quarter. So, it's interesting to see.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes, and then, you know, adding to all of the uncertainty, I mean, the debt ceiling, fight. I mean, how nervous is that making everybody as we're sort of coming closer and closer to that deadline?
 
PATEL: So, you know, I've talked about this, I think I'm nervous. But when the -- when this Jerome Powell goes and addresses it -- I don't want to say he pleased, but if he has to address it this day, how bad this would come. You know, that is scary, because he has more information than any of us and how it's going. And so, when he's coming out to the public, and stating this, yes, again, I'm just being realistic. That makes me nervous when you have officials looking at each other and going, hey, we can't have this. And this would have an effect came on, you know, how they look at, you know, the June, you know, the June mark. The June meeting, should they -- and again he put it back on the table, that there may be another interest hit later during the year, which he hadn't really stated. So, I think he's leaving his options open. He was kind of optimistic, though, Kim, about the rest of the year. It was the most optimistic I think I've seen him breaking down his interviews. BRUNHUBER: Yes. All right, before we go, we have a minute left. But I want to throw you a little bit of a curveball here. So, President Biden's campaign, it's leaning into an economic message with this, the second T.V. ad, sort of release of his campaign. They're talking about his economic successes based on, you know, all the things that they're touting, I guess. Based on just the economic factors alone. If you were a political operative, would you be more confident if you were part of the democratic A.D. team or a member of the Republican rapid response team that was going to put out an economic attack at?
 
PATEL: I'm laughing because they're both at odds with each other. I don't even know which team I would take, you know, truthfully, because both sides will say one another. But, you know, I'll be very honest too with you, Kim. If they can come together on the debt ceiling, then they both can run together as a campaign to move America forward. So, that would be my answer.
 
BRUNHUBER: Nicely, nicely stepped around that. Appreciate that -- appreciate that. Ryan Patel, always good to talk to you.
 
PATEL: Thanks, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: All right. We'll be right back.

BRUNHUBER: The abrupt firing of Fox News host, Tucker Carlson took many by surprise but newly revealed text messages that Carlson sent to a producer in the hours after the January 6 insurrection. Even indication of what may have driven Fox X its biggest star. Tom Foreman has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): In the turbulent wake of the January 6 insurrection, one incident caught the eye of then, top Fox News host Tucker Carlson, "A group of Trump guys surrounded an Antifa kid and started pounding him. It was three against one at least, jumping a guy like that as dishonorable. It's not how white men fight." That texture producer was redacted in court documents but shared with CNN from the dominion voting systems lawsuit against Fox. And Carlson would later reject the notion of racism in flaming the crowd.
 
TUCKER CARLSON, FORMER FOX NEWS HOST: There's no evidence that white supremacists or responsible for what happened on January 6, that's a lie.
 
FOREMAN (voiceover): But critics have long argued his rise to power was propelled by embracing white nationalist ideas. For example, dismissing the Black Lives Matter movement as a tool primarily for shaming whites.
 
CARLSON: A small group of highly aggressive emotionally charged activists took over our culture. They forced the entire country to obey their will.
 
FOREMAN (voiceover): Saying immigrants will make the country quote, "Poorer, dirtier and more divided." 
 
CARLSON: The great replacement? 
 
FOREMAN (voiceover): And suggestion Democrats want to push aside white voters with a flood of minorities.
 
CARLSON: It's going to overwhelm our country and change it completely and forever. And our viewers should know that.
 
OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: You know, over the years, he has trafficked and anti-immigration rhetoric. He has promoted the White Nationalists as a great replacement theory. And this shouldn't really have come as a surprise, I think to Fox News executives.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is the most prominent vessel in America for white supremacist talking points.
 
FOREMAN (voiceover): For comedians, it all made Carlson an easy target, even as he denied understanding the accusations.
 
CARLSON: White Nationalism, let's be literal for a minute. What is that exactly? I don't even know what white nationalist means. And I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole with you now.
 
FOREMAN (voiceover): Indeed, even up to the end of his time at Fox, he routinely argued for changes he said would help minority communities. And dismiss the whole idea of a rising white nationalist movement.
 
CARLSON: This is a hoax. Just like the Russia hoax. The combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country, were they able to fit inside a college football stadium?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOREMAN (on camera): What he might think about all of this now, we don't know. Neither Carlson nor Fox responded to CNN's request for any further comment about these latest revelations from the court documents. Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.
 
BRUNHUBER: There's a growing feeling around Hollywood that the writer's strike that began earlier this week could go on for a very long time. Late Night talk show host, Jimmy Fallon plans to keep his Tonight Show on the air for now, by paying his writers for week. His network NBC will pay them for two more weeks, but live television shows are only a small part of the entertainment that's affected.

BRUNHUBER: King Charles named Lionel Richie a Global Ambassador for his charity, the Prince's Trust in 2019. The organization supports young people to get into work, education and training. And it looks like it may rain on King Charles this parade. Forecasters expect the chance of rain to increase in London by late morning on Saturday, just as the coronation begins and will continue through the afternoon. Despite that high temperatures in the capital are expected to reach up to 19 degrees Celsius or 66 degrees Fahrenheit. And the coronation ceremony will be Britain's first in seven decades, it'll have all the pomp and pageantry you'd expect, but there will also be some notable differences. CNN's Max Foster has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Not since 1953, that we had a glimpse of this sacred moment. The crowning of a monarch, Queen Elizabeth, then just 27 thrust to the throne, after her father's untimely death. Her coronation, designed to introduce the young queen to the world and give a morale boost to post war Britain. 70 years on, and amidst a cost-of-living crisis, King Charles is coronation will have many of the same traditions incorporated, albeit slightly toned down. Up to 2800 guests in Westminster Abbey, CNN understands versus the 8,000 who gathered for the late queens.
 
ELIZABETH NORTON, ROYAL HISTORIAN: The King has actually ruffled some feathers by not inviting many members of the ancient nobility, including some of the dukes. In fact, if it is said that the king has invited members of the community so, charitable workers, for example.
 
FOSTER (voiceover): A sign perhaps, that Charles wants to make the Monarchy more accessible. Though much of the pomp and ceremony will of course remain. He'll sit on the coronation chair used by monarchs for more than 700 years, and he'll be crowned with the St. Edward's crown, a gold velvet and jewel encrusted piece, weighing more than two kilograms. The coronation is first and foremost a religious ceremony. It culminates in the king's anointing with holy oil, which has been consecrated in Jerusalem.
 
NORTON: It's seen as symbolizing the King's commitment to God because, of course, he's a very religious man himself. He's now the head of the church, and it's a sacred moment.
 
FOSTER (voiceover): His wife, Camilla will also be anointed in crowned. Charles's sons, William and Harry, will be there. Although Harry's wife Meghan will remain at home in California with their two young children. It remains to be seen what role Harry will play in proceedings now that he's set back from his senior role duties.
 
(on camera) For many in Britain, the coronation is about more than just another public holiday. There'll be street parties up and down the U.K. and thousands will come here to Buckingham Palace to witness the famous balcony moment, to see for the first time the newly crowned king and queen.
 
(voiceover) Many more will line the streets for the coronation procession, just as they did for Queen Elizabeth seven decades ago. The king and queen will travel in this gilded carriage accompanied by a huge military procession. Nighttime rehearsals spotted in the streets of London as the Capitol gears up for a moment in history. Max Foster, CNN London
