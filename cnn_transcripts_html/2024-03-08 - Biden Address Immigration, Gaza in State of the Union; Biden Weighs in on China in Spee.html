MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company.
 <br>[00:00:32]
 
Coming up here on CNN NEWSROOM, U.S. President Joe Biden tackles Ukraine, the war in Israel, the border, and his opponent in the November elections in what could be the most important State of the Union address of his presidency.
 
The president also offers a plan to get more aid to the millions of starving Palestinians in Gaza.
 
Meanwhile, Republican Senator Katie Britt goes after Biden's border record in the GOP response. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Michael Holmes. 
 
HOLMES: The U.S. president delivered a high-stakes speech to one of the biggest audiences he'll get before the November election. His State of the Union, a key opportunity to sell his vision to a deeply divided country.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Joe Biden there, entering the joint session of Congress to loud cheers, as you can hear, of "four more years." 
 
He touched on a tremendous amount of contentious issues, everything from funding for Ukraine, to reproductive rights, to artificial intelligence and the crisis in Gaza. With the vice president and House speaker over his shoulders, the president wasted no time reminding Americans that it was only three years ago when, quote, "insurrection stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger at the throat of American democracy."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We must be honest: the threat to democracy must be defended. My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6. I will not do that. This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. 
 
Here's the simple truth: you can't love your country only when you win. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: The forceful speech filled with references to Donald Trump without using his name, President Biden simply calling him "my predecessor." And he accused his predecessor of deliberately torpedoing bipartisan border reforms, because it's an issue Trump wants to campaign on.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: In November, my team began serious negotiation with a bipartisan group of senators. The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.
 
You don't think so? Oh, you don't like that bill, huh? That conservatives got together and said was a good bill? 
 
But unfortunately, politics is -- derailed this bill so far. I'm told my predecessor called members of Congress and the Senate to demand they block the bill. He feels political win -- he viewed it as a political win for me a political loser for him. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Now he went on to say Americans, quote, "owe it to the American people" to get that bill done. 
 
Let's get more now from CNN's M.J. Lee.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: We knew, of course, heading into this evening what the major issues and the themes were that the president wanted to hit on. What we didn't know was whether he was going to actually land the delivery. 
 
You know, there was an interesting moment when he got into the House chamber and got to the podium. And before he started delivering his speech, he said and joked, "If I were smart, I'd go home now." You could easily imagine that some of the aides that were watching the speech probably had that voice in the back of their heads. But what I am told in the conversations I've had tonight with campaign
 
 officials and White House officials is that they were very, very pleased with the way that the president was able to deliver this very important speech. 
 
I'm told that there was applause and cheers both here at the White House and at the Wilmington campaign headquarters where aides were gathering around televisions to watch the State of the Union remarks. 
 
Aides are telling me that they felt like the delivery was high-energy, that the president landed some of his major lines. They appreciated the banter that he had with some of the Republican lawmakers when things got a little bit more raucous as the president was trying to call them out for congressional inaction and some of their policy positions.
 <br>[00:05:06]
 
They also felt like there were no major mistakes throughout the course of this lengthy speech. And one campaign official that I was speaking to said one thing they appreciated was what they felt like was sort of a split-screen moment, and split-screen moments that they saw playing throughout the evening, where the president would talk about some of the accomplishments of this White House and the administration. Things like removing lead pipes, things like taking on big pharma. 
 
And they liked that Republican lawmakers in some of those moments didn't stand up to cheer for some of those policies. That sort of gets to the contrast that, of course, the president and this White House really wanted to use the speech to draw between Democrats and Republicans. 
 
And because this was a speech where the delivery was going to be --
 
LEE (voice-over): -- so important and probably just as important as the actual words that the president said. That was one of the major reasons that I think, both here at the White House --
 
LEE: -- and at the campaign headquarters, aides were feeling really, really good about the president's third State of the Union speech. 
 
M.J. Lee, CNN, at the White House.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
HOLMES: President Biden very aware of claims he's too old to lead, trying to put a positive spin on his age and experience. But it's no coincidence the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate was chosen to issue the Republican rebuttal. 
 
Alabama's Katie Britt, who's 42, said, quote, "Our commander in chief is not in command." And, quoting again, "The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KATIE BRITT (R-AL): Right now, the American dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families. The true, unvarnished state of our union begins and ends with this. Our families are hurting. Our country can do better. 
 
And you don't have to look any further than the crisis at our Southern border to see it. 
 
President Biden inherited the most secure border of all time, but minutes after taking office, he suspended all deportations. He halted construction of the border wall, and he announced a plan to give amnesty to millions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HOLMES: All right. CNN contributor Leah Wright Rigueur is an associate history professor at Johns Hopkins University. She's joining me now from Washington. And it's good to see you.
 
What -- what's your take? I mean, did the president's speech achieve what he needed it to achieve in an election year? 
 
LEAH WRIGHT RIGUEUR, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: The president did everything that he needed to do and more. And I think it's no surprise that Democrats, also independents, his staff, even Republican -- even begrudging Republicans are saying right now that that was one of the best speeches that he's given in his career.
 
You know, the single thing that was most important about tonight's speech was Joe Biden's age. And he actually ran headfirst into that, addressed it, brought it to the table, and used it to make an argument for the future of this country. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, that -- that was the major issue in terms of public perception. Given those questions, how much was the address about how he looked and sounded, versus what he said? And what were your impressions on the -- you know, the issue of energy, mental sharpness, and so on. What did you think? 
 
RIGUEUR: Well, it was a fiery speech. And he came right out the gate with a lot of energy. 
 
You know, one of the things that we've seen about Joe Biden over the last couple of months, is that his energy has been flagging. In fact, that's been a sticking point from former President Trump, who has made that his talking point, even though the two men are barely a few years apart in age. They are, in fact, as Joe Biden pointed out tonight, they are around the same age. They're of the same era. 
 
And so I think jumping into that and say, having Biden come straight out with a lot of energy did a lot to quiet the naysayers, but also to quiet the -- really, the "Sleepy Joe" attacks that former President Trump has been levying at our current president. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, of course, one issue Biden has faced is messaging. You know, he has -- he does -- I mean, by any metric, he's got plenty of good economic news and other good news to point to. We did that in his speech. Crime and inflation are down. The stock market is up and so on. 
 
But his problem is people, or not enough people hearing that message, and the poll suggests they are not. What's your sense of his ability to get around that problem? 
 <br>[00:10:03]
 
RIGUEUR: Well, a really quick CNN flash poll taken at the end of the State of the Union said that 62 percent of Americans now believe that Joe Biden is best equipped to lead this country, based on the content of the speech. 
 
Now what I will say here is that, while I think Joe Biden did a really strong job, there were areas that I think he could have done better. 
 
One of the things that the State of the Union is historically known for, that presidents have done over and over again, is they've set the agenda. And many presidents (AUDIO GAP) this is a big agenda-setting moment. Think Franklin Delano Roosevelt, "Four Freedoms," 1941. Think the war on poverty, Lyndon Johnson, 1964. 
 
And so while Biden, I think, has this idea about the soul of the nation, about you know, the economy being good inflation, we're going to take care of inflation. We're going to address women issues. 
 
It still wasn't enough in terms of the content, the very specific content that certain audiences may need. I think this is especially true of audiences like Latino voters, Muslim voters, and perhaps black male voters. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Young black male voters, as well. 
 
Real quick, back in 2020, in that campaign, Biden said he probably wouldn't be running if Donald Trump wasn't running. He called himself a transition candidate.
 
Four years later, in this election, how personal do you think it is for him to see this through? And importantly, beat Trump, specifically? Trump the man?
 
RIGUEUR: I think this is a very personal election, not just for President Joe Biden, but also for former President Trump. 
 
And that, in the case of Donald Trump, this is about revenge. And not just revenge for Trump individually, but revenge for MAGA, for being -- for feeling like they are wrong. 
 
On the other hand, for President Biden, this is about what is at stake at this country. And I do actually believe that, if Donald Trump was not running for president, Joe Biden would not be running for reelection. 
 
So this is really about the stakes of what Americans believe, but also what are these two men at odds? And I think Americans are going to have to get used to the fact that, you know, this is a rematch. We're right back where we started, where we were in 2020. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Yes. Which message is going to resonate? 
 
Leah Wright Rigueur. Thank you so much, there in Washington for us. Appreciate it. 
 
RIGUEUR: Thank you for having me. 
 
HOLMES: All right. Let's go now to CNN correspondent Kristie Lu Stout. She's joining me from Hong Kong.
 
Always good to see you, my friend. A fiery State of the Union speech for the president. Didn't mince words about China. Tell us more about that. 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: Yes, Joe Biden flexed American might over China in his State of the Union address. He said America is rising. He reiterated that he wants competition with China, not conflict.
 
But he emphasized that the U.S. will, quote, "win the competition for the 21st Century against China or anyone else." 
 
Now as speaking before a joint session of Congress, Biden said America is standing up against China in terms of both trade and foreign affairs. Take a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: We're standing up against China's unfair economic practices. We're standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan straits. I've revitalized our partnership in line to the Pacific. 
 
I've made sure that the most advanced American technology can't be used in China.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STOUT: And then, in a shot at Donald Trump, he said that it, quote, "never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that," unquote. 
 
Now, Biden's comments come right after China slammed U.S. trade and tech policies. This happened on Thursday on the sidelines of the National People's Congress, which is underway this week in Beijing. 
 
And we've heard from Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He blasted the U.S. for, quote, "bewildering level of trade curbs." And Wang said this. Let's bring up the quote for you. Quote, "If the U.S. is obsessed with suppressing China, it will eventually harm itself," unquote.
 
Now, the Biden administration has been curbing China's ability to access sensitive high-end technology like semiconductors, over fears that American technology could be used to bolster the Chinese military. And the U.S. has also slapped sanctions against China over a host of issues, including allegations of human rights abuses over the fentanyl trade, over support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, Wang Yi, he did say that there have been improvements in the
 
 U.S.-China relationship, especially since that recent summit in APEC San Francisco. And we have seen that improvement. 
 
But the fact that we're hearing this strong language in Beijing, in Washington this week only reveals the tension that still remains.
 
Back to you, Michael.
 
HOLMES: Yes, we've only got a minute left, but I'll try to squeeze this in. Biden said the U.S., I think his words were "will win the competition for the 21st Century against China." How does China frame its role? 
 
STOUT: Yes, and that is what we've been hearing this week at the National People's Congress. 
 <br>[00:15:03]
 
China has been projecting this image of peace and stability, despite provocative language and actions towards China and in the South China Sea, which we saw quite clearly on camera, with the CNN team witnessing it. An event -- incident happening between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea. 
 
China this week announced a 7.2 percent rise in military spending, in line with previous years. A NPC (ph) spokesperson said that you compare that to the U.S., and China's defense spending is quite low. But outside estimates suggest that higher actual spending than what those official figures say. 
 
So China is also flexing its own muscles on the world stage, while making these calls, while trumpeting peace and stability at the NPC.
 
HOLMES: Right. Always good to see Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. Appreciate it. 
 
STOUT: Thank you. 
 
HOLMES: Well, it's official. Abandoning its long-held neutrality, Sweden is now the newest member of NATO.
 
In Washington on Thursday, the Swedish prime minister formally handing over accession documents to the U.S. State Department, the last step in the process.

ULF KRISTERSSON, SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER: We are humble, but we are also proud. We will live up to high expectations from all NATO allies.

HOLMES: Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed the Scandinavian country to reconsider its defense policy and become the alliance's 32nd member. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, welcoming the news, calling the addition a win for everyone. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today, it is important to note that one more country in Europe has become more protected from Russian evil.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Russia is apparently setting its sights on new targets, meanwhile, following its recent capture of the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka. 
 
Kyiv says Moscow is now concentrating troops near three more towns in Eastern Ukraine, including Lyman and Chasiv Yar.
 
Ukrainian troops have reportedly repelled more than 20 new attacks near Avdiivka itself. 
 
Russian assaults also ramping up in the parts of Zaporizhzhia region that Ukraine captured during its counteroffensive last year.
 
Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy headed for Turkey on Friday for talks with his Turkish counterpart. Among other things, they're expected to discuss the Black Sea grain agreement, which Turkey has been trying to revive. 
 
Ongoing widespread violence by criminal gangs in Haiti, pushing officials to extend a state of emergency in the capital. We'll have details coming up. 
 
Also, the U.S. president announcing a significant plan to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. We'll have details on the proposal and what it calls for after the break.

 <br>[00:20:01]
 
HOLMES: A nightmare unfolding in Nigeria, where armed men reportedly kidnapped hundreds of school children in the Northwestern town of Kaduna on Thursday morning.
 
A member of the community who confronted the abductors was killed, according to a local official. Reports on how many children were abducted vary, but it's a big number. It ranges from 227 to 287. 
 
CNN cannot independently verify those figures. And as of now, it is unclear who is behind the kidnapping. 
 
Mass abductions from schools aren't uncommon in the country, but early figures indicate this could be the largest incident since 2021.
 
The United Nations secretary-general is invoking Islam's holy month to bring an end to the civil war in Sudan. Speaking at Thursday's Security Council meeting, Antonio Guterres called for a ceasefire ahead of Ramadan.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Now is the time to lay down the weapons. The humanitarian crisis in Sudan is reaching colossal proportions. Fully half the population, some 25 million people, need lifesaving assistance. Over 14,000 people have been killed, although that number is likely far higher.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: The U.N. chief added that Sudan has become home to the, quote, "world's largest international displacement crisis" since fighting broke out in April of last year between forces loyal to two rival generals.
 
And in Haiti, amid widespread gang violence and speculation over whether the prime minister will step down and call for elections, a state of emergency has now been extended until April 3. 
 
Sources telling CNN dozens of people broke into a warehouse at a major port terminal in Port-au-Prince on Thursday, that terminal a major link in Haiti's imported food supply chain. 
 
More on the story now from CNN's Patrick Oppmann.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Haiti's government on Thursday extended the state of emergency in that country for another month. But it's unclear what impact, if any, it will have on the out-of-control gang violence. 
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): Haiti's prime minister, Ariel Henry, still continues to be missing in action as he appears to be unable to return to his own country. He has not issued any public pronouncements. It is believed that he remains in Puerto Rico. 
 
OPPMANN: The U.S. has called on Henry to form a transitional government and say when elections can be held in Haiti. That is a step that Henry has resisted up until now, saying conditions are not right in Haiti to hold elections. 
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): But clearly, he's facing more and more pressure from inside and from outside of Haiti to get out of office, to move out of office and show what the plan of succession for Haitians will be.
 
It is unclear, though, how Haiti could hold elections of any kind while the security crisis continues to worsen and worsen. All eyes on a full course of soldiers in Kenya, 1,000 troops who have -- the government has agreed to send them to Haiti to take on the gangs. But no update, as of yet, when those troops will deploy. 
 
OPPMANN: And Haitians that I have spoken to in the capital of Port-au- Prince say even those who have managed to stockpile food and water are running low on supplies. And they say that Haitians simply cannot wait any longer for help, that it has to arrive now.

HOLMES: Still ahead, protesters demand more effort from U.S. President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza. We'll take a look at where ceasefire negotiations stand now, after a flurry of talks this week.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:26:20]
 
HOLMES: Welcome back. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM with me, Michael Holmes.
 
Returning now to our top story, U.S. President Joe Biden's State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress.
 
In his remarks, Mr. Biden said he's been working, quote, "nonstop" towards a ceasefire in Gaza. He called on Hamas to release hostages, said Israel should increase aid to the enclave, and called for a two- state solution. 
 
Meantime, borders -- reporters say Mr. Biden's motorcade took the long way to the U.S. Capitol Thursday evening to avoid a group of protesters blocks away from the Capitol building. 
 
The president also said Israel had a responsibility to protect civilians in Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Israel has a right to go after Hamas. Hamas entered this conflict by releasing hostages, laying down arms, could end it -- by releasing the hostages, laying down arms and surrendering those responsible for October 7.
 
But Israel has an -- excuse me, Israel has an added burden, because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards. Under hospitals, day care centers, and all the like.
 
Israel also as a fundamental responsibility, though, to protect innocent civilians in Gaza.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: President Biden also announcing a significant plan to try to get more aid into Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BIDEN: Tonight, I'm directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine, and temporary shelters. No U.S. boots will be on the ground. A temporary pier will enable a massive increase to the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: It's not clear when that peer would be up and running or how long it would take to even build it. And of course, it does need Israels buy-in.
 
Israel, for its part, has prepared a new land crossing directly into Northern Gaza. That's according to a senior U.S. official.
 
And it comes as the U.S. and Jordan carried out a third airdrop of food and supplies into Gaza. Thursday, the U.N. welcome these new efforts. So one official called it a drop in the ocean of what's needed.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEORGIOS PETROPOULOS, HEAD OF GAZA SUB-OFFICE, OCHA: Of course, any kind of maritime corridor would be good, but I think we have to be clear that roads are going to be the only solution for the amount and acuteness of hunger that we now have, especially in North Gaza. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Meanwhile, it appears a ceasefire and hostage deal is unlikely to happen before Ramadan begins on Sunday evening. The CIA director is now in the Middle East for more negotiations. 
 
The U.S. had been pushing for a deal before Ramadan, as Israel has threatened a ground offensive in Rafah in the South if there is not a deal in place by then. 
 
A Hamas delegation left Cairo on Thursday after days of talks with no apparent breakthroughs. Egypt's state-run media citing a senior source, saying negotiations are expected to resume next week.
 
Here's how the U.S. ambassador to Israel described the state of talks.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JACK LEW, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: I think if you look at the hostage negotiations, I think it's a mistake to think they're over. There are still conversations going on. There's still back-and-forth. 
 
Everyone's looking towards Ramadan, which is coming close.

 <br>[00:30:07]
 
HOLMES: -- joins us now from Washington, where he was a guest for the State of the Union address. His daughter, Liat, was released in a hostages-for-prisoners swap on November 29. His son-in-law, Aviv (ph), was killed in the Hamas attacks on October 7. 
 
Thank you so much for taking the time. And I know you and your family have been through so much. 
 
Did you hear anything in President Biden's speech that gives you any comfort for the fate of the remaining hostages? 
 
YEHUDA BEININ, FATHER OF FORMER HOSTAGE LIAT: I -- first of all, thank you for having me on. I would like to say that I think the president's speech was an excellent speech. It was mostly directed to domestic affairs. It was a kickoff of his reelection campaign.
 
The -- when he did touch upon foreign policy issues, he started out with Ukraine at the beginning of a speech. He got around to Israel and Palestine somewhere towards the end. 
 
He mentioned his standard position on Israel and Palestine regarding the entrance of humanitarian aid into Gaza. What the administration was planning on doing to facilitate that. His vision for a two-state solution at the end of this war or beginning a process that will lead to that at the end of the war. 
 
He did not mention anything specifically about the hostages other than they need to be returned as part of a negotiated cease-fire.
 
HOLMES: What -- what role would you want the president of the United States to do?
 
BEININ: I believe that the administration is doing everything in their power to facilitate a ceasefire deal to release the hostages. There is -- they work on a daily basis with all of the players on the field in trying to advance the -- a hostage deal that would include the release of hostages and a ceasefire.
 
HOLMES: Your daughter, Liat, as I said, was released; and I can imagine your joy at having her home. Just quickly I wanted to ask you how is she doing?
 
BEININ: My daughter and her children are doing well. Liat has returned to teaching her 12th grade students. They're all together at the Ein Gedi Field School. 
 
And my daughter has also returned to her one day a week job at Yad Vashem as a youth tour guide. And slowly, but very surely, she's putting her life back together and moving on. 
 
VAUSE: It's good to hear that. And then as we said, she's having to deal and you're all having to deal with the tragic loss of Aviv (ph). 
 
You're obviously now how, tragically, because of the circumstances, friends and allies with the families of hostages still being held. Try to give us a sense of how -- how they get through the day-to-day.
 
BEININ: Yes. That's -- that's a difficult question. I -- I feel the frustration and the despair, to a large part, that the -- my friends are feeling. A lot of frustration over how sometimes things are reported in the
 
 media that are not necessarily accurate. So it's, it's always a roller coaster. 
 
I think that people insulate themselves from this by simply disconnecting from the news altogether. 
 
And fortunately, we have discussions with people in the administration here and also in Israel that shed some light on what's going on. 
 
HOLMES: Right.
 
BEININ: And it's a positive thing. It's been -- the administration has been very forthcoming with information for --
 
HOLMES: Right.
 
BEININ: -- families.
 
HOLMES: Yehuda Beinin in Washington, our thanks to you. That's great to hear layouts doing better and -- and sorry for the loss of Aviv (ph).
 
BEININ: Thank you. Thank you. 
 
HOLMES: Still to come, in the midst of a surge in deadly violence against women, organizations in Italy on a mission to support those who've escaped and survived abuse. Our report from Rome after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:37:09]
 
HOLMES: A bill that would require law enforcement to detain any migrant who commits burglary or theft passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday. 
 
All House Republicans and 37 Democrats supported what is called the Laken Riley Act. A hundred and seventy Democrats voted against the bill, accusing Republicans of exploiting the young woman's death for a partisan stunt and targeting immigrants in an election year. 
 
It's not clear whether the Democrat-led Senate will support the bill. 
 
Twenty-two-year-old Laken Riley was found dead after she went jogging on the University of Georgia campus last month. Police say she was killed by a migrant who illegally entered the U.S. at the Southern border.
 
There are troubling signs that violence is growing against women in Italy, especially at the hands of their own loved ones. And as CNN's Barbie Nadeau reports from Rome, efforts are underway to fight it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The
 
 weight of violence against women hangs heavy over Italy. Last year alone, more than 100 women were victims of femicide, when a murder is committed by a family member, a former or current lover, or husband. That's roughly one woman killed every three days.
 
Italy does not have the highest rate of violence against women in Europe but scores very low in terms of gender equality, ranking 79 of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum's 2023 gender parity ranking, falling 16 places from the previous year because of the rise in victims of deadly violence. 
 
One of those victims was Giulia Cecchettin, a college student allegedly killed by her ex-boyfriend, who according to what her friends told investigators, was stalking her. 
 
Giulia's story sparked protests, pushing Italians to confront violence against women. But more than a dozen women have been murdered since her body was found. 
 
Maria Grazia is a survivor. She was able to leave a situation of violence before it was too late. But she says it wasn't easy for her OK. Don't want to be the trinity. 
 
MARIA GRAZIA, VIOLENCE SURVIVOR (through translator): In a situation of violence, you close yourself off and in the darkest solitude, because in the end, there is a prejudice that, if a woman is the victim of a situation of violence, it is partly her fault.
 
NADEAU (voice-over): After her own personal struggles, Maria Grazia co-founded Maison Antigone (ph), an organization that has helped support hundreds of women in need of support.
 
GRAZIA (through translator): After having experienced a situation of personal violence, a very strong experience of violence, and having gone through courts and so on, I personally realize that there is no help, no real help for a woman experiencing these things.
 
NADEAU (voice-over): Hundreds of women in Italy navigate a complicated bureaucratic system when it comes to reporting threats like stalking and abuse. 
 <br>[00:40:04]
 
Another organization tackling violence against women is CADMI, a shelter for abused women in Milan. It is helping women change their narrative from victim to survivor. 
 
The group says it rescued over 600 women from their abusers last year and that it's helped more than 36,000 since its founding in 1986. 
 
The organization not only removes women from dangerous situations and houses them in shelters, they rehabilitate women and prepare them to enter back into society in the workforce, providing legal and psychological support. CADMI head coordinator Christina Corelli (ph) tells us it's very
 
 important for women to be autonomous and economically independent in order to have true freedom.
 
She says their success has not only been through helping women directly, but also through prevention, education, and media campaigns. She says they're observing the influx of many young women to the anti- violence center. When she met women 25 years ago, they were generally women around 40 years old who had told very long stories of violence, she says.
 
Italian women are calling for change. 
 
LORELLA ZANARDO, AUTHOR, FILMMAKER, ARTIST: We have another history. So I think that we have to work a lot. I believe but that we have to start in schools, in how the elementary books are written, how the role of women is represented. 
 
But in the last years, we have moved forward; there are signs of changes. Of course, we don't -- we cannot relax.
 
NADEAU (voice-over): For these young women, change needs to happen faster.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): In the end, after those years, there have been important changes that can be seen. But I think today, the playing field is still not totally complete between the two genders. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In my generation, in educating the generations to come, because we are failing. 
 
NADEAU (voice-over): Women may be on the front lines, but all Italians need to wage the battle against inequality for lasting change.
