ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Police are now revealing the gunman, who killed the teacher and a student at a St. Louis high school, left behind a chilling note. Police say the gunman brought an AR-15 style rifle, more than 600 rounds of ammunition and over a dozen high- capacity magazines to the school. 
 
CNN correspondent Adrienne Broaddus is live in St. Louis this morning. 
 
So, this letter, Adrienne, what do we know about that letter? 
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Erica, good morning to you.
 
Handwritten words discovered in a notebook left behind in the car belonging to the shooter according to police. Some of what was written in that notebook was shared with us, and now I want to share it with you. It said, the note, I don't have any friends. I don't have any family. I never had a girlfriend. I never had a social life. I've been an isolated loner my entire life. This was the perfect storm for a mass shooting. Those words giving investigating insight into what that 19-year-old who graduated from this high school last year may have been thinking. 
 
Investigators are saying there were some prevention methods already in place that slowed the shooter down. First and foremost, locked doors and a quick response from members of law enforcement. But as we know, it did not stop him from getting inside, injuring 15 and 16 year olds, killing another 15-year-old who would have turned 16 next month, and a beloved physical education teacher, Erica. 
 
HILL: And in terms of that teacher, Adrienne, I know you're actually learning a little bit more as well. What more can you tell us? 
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
BROADDUS: Her students loved her and her family is just now finding out how much their mom was beloved by this community. We heard from her daughter, Abby Kuczka, this morning. 
 
Listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABBY KUCZKA, DAUGHTER OF TEACHER KILLED IN ST. LOUIS SCHOOL SHOOTING: When I first heard about the shooting, I had no idea it was my mom. But I know she put herself (ph) in front of the gunfire to save those kids. That was her passion. My mom's a hero. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROADDUS: And we're hearing that Ms. Kuczka died trying to stop the shooter from harming her students. 
 
Yesterday we heard from the principal of this high school who said members of her staff might be mad following the comment she made, but the principal said, Ms. Kuczka was the only one on staff who never complained. 
 
Erica.
 
HILL: Adrienne Broaddus, appreciate the updates from you this morning. Thank you.
 
Turning now to the Justice Department's investigation into January 6th. Sources telling CNN the DOJ now wants a federal judge to force two former Trump White House lawyers, Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, to testify. That move to compel their testimony about conversations they had with the former president is part of a set of secret court proceedings. The former president, of course, has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying before a criminal grand jury about certain conversations. So, what could this change? 
 
Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti is with us now.
 
So, Renato, if Cipollone and Philbin are, in fact, compelled to testify here, do you think this grand jury will actually get answers from them or could they plead the Fifth? 
 
RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I don't see them pleading the Fifth at all. I think that actually Mr. Cipollone, for example, provided a lot of sound legal advice to the former president based upon the testimony that he provided to the January 6th committee. Obviously, Erica, in his testimony to that committee, there are certain questions he wasn't able to answer. And under existing law, I expect that the government is going to be able to -- the Justice Department will be able to get that testimony pursuant to a grand jury subpoena. 
 
HILL: So, if you believe they can get that testimony then, just put it into context for us. In your view, how important is the testimony from these two gentlemen? What could it really tell us? 
 
MARIOTTI: Well, we don't know for sure, but it sure sounded to me like Mr. Cipollone was telling the former president not to have anything to do with the attack on January 6th, not to be anywhere near the Capitol, to try to stop, for example, the insurrectionists from attacking the Capitol, try to warn them or urge them to turn away. In addition to that, it appears that Mr. Cipollone was very skeptical of John Eastman and Jeffrey Clark's attempts to, you know, make false statements and try to push forward the fake elector's scheme or, in the case of Jeff Clark, have the Justice Department make false statements. So, I really think particularly regarding the fake electors scheme, for example, Mr. Cipollone's testimony could be very important in terms of proving the former president's knowledge and intent. 
 
HILL: And so what does that tell you about where the investigation itself may be headed? 
 
MARIOTTI: Yes, I have to say, it really looks to me like they are pushing forward and trying to see whether or not they have charges against the former president, which is really interesting and obviously, you know, could be very important. 
 
HILL: Also interesting, too, if, in fact, they are compelled to testify, what could the impact be on other privilege claims down the line? 
 
MARIOTTI: Well, I think that it certainly suggests to me that, for example, that would set a potential precedent and would make it easier to obtain the claims of others. I also think it may mean that other testimony may be unnecessary. In other words, if the Justice Department has what they need from Mr. Cipollone, they may not be needing to go and try to compel the testimony of others. 
 
HILL: Renato Mariotti, always appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
MARIOTTI: Thank you.
 
HILL: Still to come here, catastrophic flooding in Nigeria has now displaced more than a million people. Hundreds are dead. We're going to take you there live with the latest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:44:02]
 
HILL: This morning, new British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak facing parliament for the first time, warning difficult decisions must be made to restore economic stability. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RISHI SUNAK, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: We will have to take difficult decisions to restore economic stability and confidence. 
 
I am the first to admit that mistakes were made, and that's the reason I am standing here. 
 
Leadership is not selling fairy tales, it is confronting challenges, and that is the leadership the British people will get from this government. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HILL: That face-to-face with lawmakers delivering the usual fire and combativeness. Try saying that three times fast. There was, though, a softer moment from opposition leader Kier Starmer who opened the session by welcoming Sunak, remarking his tenure as the first person of color, the first Hindu prime minister, says it's a reminder of Britain's greatness. 
 
Right now parts of Nigeria are still under water. This is nearly a month after the nation's worst flooding in a decade began. 
 <br>[09:45:03]
 
More than 2 million people have been impacted, hundreds have died as a result of this flooding, and it has put millions more at risk for cholera and food insecurity. 
 
CNN correspondent Larry Madowo navigated some of those deep waters to speak directly with some of the people now trying to figure out what comes next if these waters don't recede. 
 
Tough to imagine so many weeks of this, Larry. What more are you hearing from folks on the ground? 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Erica, we've heard from people who escaped with nothing but the clothes on their backs, who are worried for their kids. Schools have been closed here for at least two weeks, government offices shut because people are just having to deal with this situation. 
 
This state by (INAUDIBLE) southern (ph) Nigeria is the size of Philadelphia. Imagine if most of Philadelphia was under water. That's the reality here. This is one of the major streets in the capital and this is what they've had to live with for at least three weeks. 
 
Across Nigeria, 33 out of 36 states are affected by flooding, more than 600 people have died, nearly 1.5 million people have been displaced. And the warning from UNICEF and the International Rescue Committee (ph) is that people are at a high risk of cholera and other preventable diseases, also a really big risk of food insecurity because they are displaced from what they used to know, they're displaced from their jobs, they can't -- most of the businesses on this street are closed because that's just the reality. 
 
I spoke to one woman where the water is waist high in her house for the last three weeks. She's lost everything. 
 
Listen to what she told me. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UGERE OBI, FLOOD VICTIM (through translator): We have really suffered, she says, tell the government to help us. 
 
MADOWO: Everything you own is here under the water and this your house? 
 
OBI (on camera): Yes. Everything. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: What's been fascinating is how people maintain a sort of sense of humor around this. Many people told me we manage. They feel like the government has abandoned them. That it has not responded adequately. For instance, the Nigerian government has not declared this a national disaster and many people we speak to here tell us they feel it's ineffective the kind of response its been receiving. 
 
But look at this moment across the street there is a business where the first floor cannot operate. Everybody who's living is on the second floor. We met many people who have had to leave their ground floor of their buildings, of their houses, and live on the stairs because they're trying to protect their property, but it's really a devastating situation blamed on poor infrastructure, a dam that's overflowing in neighboring Cameroon, but especially climate change. And some Nigerians say this is not climate change, this is just negligence by the government, Erica. 
 
HILL: It is remarkable, as you point out, that this hasn't been declared a national disaster just based on the pictures that we're seeing. The woman who you spoke with. I mean you're standing there in water up to your waist. I can't even imagine, Larry. Really appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
Still to come here, a Wisconsin jury weighing the fate of the man accused of driving through a Christmas parade, taking six lives. Details about what jurors requested just before beginning deliberations. That's next.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:52:23]
 
HILL: Right know, a Wisconsin jury set to resume deliberations for the man who's accused of driving his SUV through the middle of a Christmas parade last year in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Six people, you may recall, were killed, dozens more injured. 
 
So, these are live pictures from inside the courtroom. The suspect, who's representing himself in court, leading to some bizarre outbursts and clashes with the judge throughout the trial, yesterday he was crying during closing arguments, claiming his actions were not intentional. 
 
CNN security correspondent Josh Campbell has been following these developments.
 
So, Josh, the jury actually began deliberating yesterday, requested to see multiple exhibits. What did they - what did they want to see? 
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Erica, yes, last night they began those deliberations. And shortly after that started, they sent a note to the judge asking to see some of these exhibits. They included video from an alleged domestic violence incident. That's one of the charges that this defendant faces involving his significant other. They also asked to see a photo of the actual parade route itself. Of course, this was a very large crime scene as this vehicle plowed through this crowd at this Christmas parade late last year. 
 
The jury has now begun their deliberations. You can see those live pictures on your screen right now. The defendant has been quiring the judge over certain items of evidence. 
 
Now, this trial has been marked by frequent outbursts by the defendant. It's been a very unusual trial. He is representing himself. The judge showing great deference to the defendant throughout that process, even though he's been very argumentative at times. 
 
But last night we saw the closing arguments and we saw a very different portrayal He was becoming very emotional, saying that he did not intend to do this. 
 
Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DARRELL BROOKS, DEFENDANT REPRESENTING HIMSELF: The theme from the prosecution here has been intent, intent, intent, intent. How can you look in somebody's head and say, this is what they intended to do? 
 
But trust me when I say, no one, outside of the families that had to go through this, no one's heart is more in pieces than mine. 
 
SUE OPPER, WAUKESHA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: When you drive through a parade route and roll over children, children with band instruments, to the extent that your vehicle heaves up and down, your intent is known, Mr. Brooks. It doesn't have to be guessed. It's known. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMPBELL: And lastly, Erica, just to remind our viewers about the charges that the defendant is facing. We're talking about six counts of intentional homicide, as well as 61 counts of reckless endangerment. Again, that vehicle plowed through this very large crowd. 
 
It is now in the hands of the jury. It is worth noting that if he does get convicted of intentional homicide, that carries a mandatory life sentence. 
 <br>[09:55:05]
 
Erica.
 
HILL: Josh, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
CAMPBELL: You bet.
 
HILL: Still to come here, a CNN exclusive from on the ground in Ukraine. What we are learning this morning about an American who was killed there. Stay with us.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Just about the top of the hour here on CNN. I'm Erica Hill. Thanks for joining us. 
 
We begin this hour with a CNN exclusive. The Russian military, we've learned, has returned the body of an American man who was killed while fight alongside Ukrainian troops. A CNN team was there to witness the transfer. This happened in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. 
 
CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward was there. She is joining us now live. 
 
So, Clarissa, what more do we know about this American? What more do we know about what happened? What did you see?
 <br>[10:00:02]
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, Erica, this is the body of Joshua Jones, a 24-year-old from Memphis, Tennessee.</pre>
