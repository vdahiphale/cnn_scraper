THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[15:00:37]
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN HOST:  It is 7:00 p.m. London, 9:00 p.m. in Gaza and 3:00 p.m. here in Atlanta. 
 
I'm Lynda Kinkade. Thanks so much for joining us today on CNN NEWSROOM. Let's get you straight to the news.
 
In just a matter of hours, steps away from the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris will recall the dangerous images of America's recent past. This is part of her message for the country's future. Harris will deliver the final stretch closing argument right here on the ellipse where she plans to draw sharp contrast between Donald Trump and herself. 
 
The ellipse is, of course, when nearly four years ago in January 6, former President Trump rallied his supporters. Prior to the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election defeat both major candidates of fighting an uphill battle in the final week of the election a brand new CNN poll shows no clear leader in Arizona. You can see here Harris is just barely ahead in the critical battleground state. And in Nevada also, no clear leader there. Donald Trump has the slim lead there.
 
I want to bring in CNN's Kevin Liptak, who is tracking the Harris campaign from Washington, D.C. 
 
Good to see you, Kevin. 
 
So just take us through what the expectations are for Kamala Harris when she delivered her speech later tonight? 
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Yeah. The words her advisers are using to describe this speech are hopeful, optimistic. You know, I don't think when we heard that she was going to deliver this speech from the ellipse, from the site of Donald Trump's January 6 speech that those are the words we necessarily would have expected, but I think in talking to people who are around her and people who are close to her campaign. They really do view this speech as something bigger. 
 
This isn't going to be entreaties on democracy, a dissertation on the state of the American republic. They really do want it to be a much more, much broader vision of how she would govern in office, but also to contrast herself and to contrast her vision with that of Donald Trump. And certainly this site will help her do that. It does allow her, of course to reemphasize the chaos that Trump brought to the office when he was president. But it also allows her to try and help people visualize what she would be as president. 
 
And you know, where shell be speaking today. You can see the White House that will be right behind her. It's only about 500 yards from where she will be speaking to the Oval Office, the Oval Office she hopes to assume in January. And I think that is sort of the goal and the objective for her tonight. 
 
It is to help people really kind of imagine her as president because as she enters this final week that I think is her biggest challenge is to help people really understand what kind of precedent she would be number one, but also just who she is as a person, she has been running an extraordinarily truncated campaign. The shortest general election campaign of any candidate in modern history and I think her challenge is still to convince people that she's up to the job and when you talk to her advisors, they do mention this term, the conflicted voter, people who aren't necessarily sold on Donald Trump, who may be very concerned about what they're hearing from him on the campaign trail over the last several weeks, but aren't necessarily convinced of Kamala Harris either who don't necessarily they feel like they have a good understanding of what she would bring to the job. 
 
And so, she has been working on this speech for several weeks. We did hear her yesterday preview a little bit of the themes. Listen to what she said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There is a huge contrast in this election. And I'd ask us to just imagine the Oval Office in three months, okay. So just picture it in your head. So either it's Donald Trump sitting in there, stowing -- stowing over his enemies list, or me with your help working for you, checking off my to do list.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIPTAK:  So, obviously, it's hard to imagine any single one speech being able to convince every undecided voter to go for Kamala Harris, but her campaign certainly does view this as one of the last remaining big tent pole moment in the week before this campaign concludes.
 
KINKADE:  Kevin, we heard from Donald Trump, earlier today again attacking Kamala Harris's character and her history in office.
 <br>[15:05:03]
 
Voters really do want to know more about her policies.
 
What will we hear in terms of details on those policies tonight? 
 
LIPTAK:  You know, I don't think we'll hear anything new specifically. She's not going to be rolling out details, for example, of a tax plan, of an economic plan, of a plan on reproductive rights. But I do expect to hear from her in broad terms how she would approach each of those issues. And so you have heard her talk previously about trying to bolster the middle class, making sure that their taxes don't go up, trying to ensure that wealthy Americans pay their fair share in taxes. I think we'll hear that tonight from Kamala Harris. 
 
We'll also hear her talk about this idea of freedom particularly when it comes to reproductive rights. And I was down at the ellipse earlier, they have enormous banners with the word "freedom" that you'll be able to see on camera when she speaks tonight. And I think she will talk about those things, certainly as she tries to lay out her own vision, but also as a contrast with Donald Trump. 
 
And that is the sort of the balance that she's trying to strike in this speech, is trying to lay out, you know, her vision for these various policy areas, but also to lay out the stakes of the policy areas when it comes to Donald Trump as well.
 
KINKADE:  All right. Kevin Liptak, good to have you with us. We'll be watching tonight. Thanks so much. 
 
Well, Donald Trump is in the battleground state of Pennsylvania today. His campaign is still cleaning up from that mess at Madison Square Garden when a comedian referred to a port of as Puerto Rico, as quote, an island of garbage. He made other vulgar comments about Latinos. In a few hours, Trump is set to rally in Allentown, which has a majority Latino population. 
 
The campaign says one of tonight's speakers will be a Puerto Rico shadow senator, and earlier, of course, Trump spoke to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort where he did not address the sexist, the racist, the vulgar rhetoric from speakers at Sunday's rally. Trump did call the event a, quote, love fest. 
 
CNN's Danny Freeman is in the swing state of Pennsylvania tracking more reaction to the disparaging Puerto Rico remark.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Vice President Harris's campaign wasted little time Monday morning.
 
MAYOR EDDIE MORAN (D), CITY OF READING, PA:  They did us a favor. They woke up. They woke up. They woke us up. They woke us up.
 
FREEMAN:  Assembling a host of Puerto Rican surrogates in Philadelphia.
 
COUNCILMEMBER QUETCY LOZADA (D), CITY OF PHILADELPHIA:  I hope that people are as angry and they turn that anger into -- into vote.
 
FREEMAN:  Pennsylvania has more than 480,000 residents of Puerto Rican descent according to 2002 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That's the most out of any of the battleground states and the Philadelphia metro area is among the top regions with Puerto Ricans outside of New York and Florida.
 
Philadelphia City Council member and Harris supporter Quetcy Lozada knew she had to speak up.
 
LOZADA:  I think that what folks don't realize is that Puerto Rican -- when Puerto Ricans get angry, we turn into action mode very quickly.
 
FREEMAN:  Around Philly's largely Puerto Rican Fairhill neighborhood, voters we spoke with had heard the comments.
 
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
FREEMAN:  He doesn't know what he's talking about. Puerto Rico is a beautiful island.
 
Thirty-two-year-old Christian Hernandez is voting for the first time this year for Vice President Harris. The Trump rally remarks only solidified his vote.
 
You think Puerto Ricans heard those words from last night?
 
CHRISTIAN HERNANDEZ, PENNSYLVANIA VOTE:  Yeah, for sure. A lot -- a lot of Puerto Ricans (ph), they're mad and disappointed.
 
FREEMAN:  Marcos Pagan didn't like the comments at all.
 
When you hear stuff like Puerto Rico is a floating island of garbage, what goes through your mind?
 
MARCOS PAGAN, PENNSYLVANIA:  To be honest, I feel disrespected because they -- he doesn't know what we go through, you know? We've been through a lot.
 
FREEMAN:  But Marcos still is not sure who he's voting for.
 
When you hear comments like that, does that change your perspective about who you might vote for?
 
PAGAN:  No.
 
FREEMAN:  That's not enough.
 
PAGAN:  I'd rather see you to believe it, you know? Everybody (INAUDIBLE) words.
 
FREEMAN:  Fernando Santiago already cast his vote for former President Donald Trump, but now, he and his whole family are mad.
 
What did you think about him calling Puerto Rico a floating island of trash?
 
FERNANDO SANTIAGO, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER:  This -- this must stop because that's my island, you know? I don't want to -- I don't want to people talking like that, you know? This -- this not right.
 
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) FREEMAN:  You think he's not going to go far because of this lack of respect towards Puerto Ricans.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE:  Our Danny Freeman was there, thanks so much that report. 
 
But I want to turn out discussion now to today's panel.
 
Joining me now is politics reporter Maya King from "The New York Times" and deputy Washington editor with "Semafor", Morgan Chalfant. 
 
Good to have you both with us. 
 <br>[15:10:00]
 
I want to start with you, Maya. This time next week is Election Day. Tonight, the vice president will speak in front of tens of thousands of people at the ellipse. This, of course, being a place where Trump gave his infamous "Stop the Steal" speech ahead of the insurrection on January 6.
 
Why is that important that she makes this speech there? And what can we expect?
 
MAYA KING, POLITICS REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES:  Well, I think there are a few things at play here. The first being that this is going to create a really large crowd. And as was mentioned earlier, sort of a tent pole moment for the vice president to make her closing argument to voters. 
 
It's also of course, a very meaning the full site. I think the challenge for her now is to present a contrast in the way that she talks about the events of January 6, not necessarily completely focusing on former President Trump and his authoritarian tendencies that she has talked quite a bit about, in advertisement and on the campaign trail, but also talking about what she offers as a presidential candidate and possible commander in chief. 
 
So there are a lot of different factors at play. I think with tonight's address, but overwhelmingly this is very much a moment for her to create a powerful contrast and a closing argument for her campaign.
 
KINKADE:  And, Morgan, to hear many believed that this election could be decided in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, with just a week to go, what does Kamala Harris need to do to win over those undecided voters, especially those at this stage, you might want to sit the election out?
 
MORGAN CHALFANT, DEPUTY WASHINGTON EDITOR, SEMAFOR:  Well, I think what Kamala -- Kamala Harris is really focused on right now is just hammering home the message about these -- these controversial remarks that were made at President Trump's rally over the weekend by this comedian. Certainly, he's under pressure to respond or to clean up these comments. Earlier today, you know, he talked about the rally in New York as
 
 being a love fest. He's not really addressed those comments at all about Puerto Rico, and given Pennsylvania's robust Puerto Rican population, certainly an opportunity for Harris to win over those voters. And, you know, Trump, again, really the pressure on him to clean up those remarks and we'll see if he does that early -- later today. 
 
KINKADE:  Yeah. I want to play some of those remarks. Trump's New York rally, of course, which was described by a pro-Republican commentators brotastic. Others called defile (ph) and racist. 
 
Harris did hit back with an ad about Puerto Rico. Let's just play that ad.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HINCHCLIFFE:  A floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean, I think it's called Puerto Rico.
 
TRUMP:  Puerto Rico.
 
HARRIS:  I will never forget what Donald Trump did. He abandoned the island and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults.
 
Puerto Ricans deserve better.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  Maya, I want to ask you about this because Trump spoke today, he could have condemned the Puerto Rico comment or any of the others where the vice president was likened to a prostitute, but he didn't, he doubled down. 
 
Could that cost him Latino votes? 
 
KING:  It's certainly possible. I mean, I think my reporting from my colleagues and the reporting that you showed just before this shows that people are really thinking about what the former president said and they really take issue with it. 
 
Here we are just a week until Election Day, early voting is well underway in most battleground states at this point, Latino voters are very, very important constituency that both parties have spent considerable time and money trying to court. And so even if it is through a surrogate or a comedian on a stage as large as Madison Square Garden, now to insult an entire group of people, certainly not a position that you would want to be in so close to voting when people have already cast their ballots. 
 
I think that shows that the Harris campaign is certainly paying attention to this and wanting to take advantage of this moment. That's why she cut this advertisement and why she's been talking so much about this, while so many Democratic Latino no surrogates are talking quite a lot about this in places like Philadelphia and other states. So it's certainly not an ideal position to be and in very well could have alienated a key slice of a voting bloc that both Democrats and Republicans sorely need to be able to be successful in a week. 
 
KINKADE:  Yeah, it's quite remarkable how quickly obtain turn that around into an ad.
 
Trump did speak, as I mentioned, in Florida, a couple of hours ago, I just want to roll some of that sound.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  Bloodshed, squalor to our cities is common and they've unleashed a war and chaos all over the world. You take a look, everything's blowing up or getting ready to blow up.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  So that is Donald Trump painting a picture of life under the Democrats, all very dark. 
 
Morgan, to you, what -- what is his key message a week out from the election? 
 <br>[15:15:02]
 
CHALFANT:  I mean, he's really emphasize this -- this dark imagery and just, you know, kind of emphasizing the economy a lot and attacking Harris in various ways. Obviously, my colleagues and I have done reporting about how Trump's campaign, some of his insiders have been frustrated about the lack of focus and he's focused on the personal attacks against Harris. 
 
But certainly, we see him making comments about the economy, making the argument that Democrats have not delivered a positive economy for Americans. And he does actually lead on the economy in polling. So that's the argument that his -- his allies really want him to make drive home that message, are you better off today, you know, than you were -- than you were under Donald Trump?
 
So, we'll see if he sticks to some of those messages later when he appears in Allentown. It's possible that he will, you know, focus more on those personal attacks against Harris or even make another controversial comment as he does sometimes. I mean, Trump, often creates a media -- media cycle around him with the comments and it's possible we could be talking about something else later today.
 
KINKADE:  That is very teary. This cycle moves very quickly. Donald Trump, as you mentioned, would be speaking in Allentown later tonight and, of course, Kamala Harris speaking at 7:30 p.m. Eastern.
 
Morgan Chalfant and Maya King, good to have you on the program. Thanks so much.
 
KING:  Thank you. KINKADE:  Well, still to come, international backlash over the Israeli parliament's vote to ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. How the decision could effectively shut down life-saving operations in Gaza.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back.
 
Survivors of an Israeli strike in northern Gaza are describing horrific scene as people use their bare hands to dig for anyone still alive under the crushed concrete. Gaza's health ministry says at least 93 people were killed in Beit Lahia, including 25 children. 
 <br>[15:20:04]
 
Witnesses say the strike hit a building sheltering displaced families. The humanitarian crisis will likely deteriorate even further after Israel's parliament voted to ban the U.N. agency that assist Palestinian refugees. UNRWA will no longer be able to work in Israel or even communicate with Israeli authorities. That effectively means it cannot operate in Gaza or the West Bank. 
 
The World Food Program warns that as winter approaches, Gaza may face catastrophic consequences due to the lack of aid. 
 
A UNICEF spokesperson is also sounding the alarm 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAMES ELDER, UNICEF SPOKESPERSON:  If UNRWA is unable to operate, we would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza. UNICEF would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies here. I'm talking vaccines. I'm talking winter clothes. I'm talking hygiene kits, help kids, water. 
 
So decisions such as this suddenly means that a new way has been found to kill children.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  Absolutely dire. 
 
Jeremy Diamond joins us now live from Tel Aviv. 
 
Jeremy, it's hard to believe the humanitarian crisis in Gaza could get any worse, but it appears it will. There was another round of Israeli strikes in Gaza today. Of course, just how much of an impact will it have this UNRWA decision to literally not allow this aid group, this U.N. aid group to work in Gaza or the West Bank?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it could have a pretty significant impact and it's important to know what this law does, and then what it could do as a result of the fallout consequences of it. What this law actually does is it bands UNRWA from working in Israel proper, so not allowing UNRWA staff to transit through Israel, not allowing UNRWA resources, including aid to go through Israeli territory. 
 
It doesn't directly ban UNRWA from operating in Gaza or the West Bank. But this could be effectively one of the follow-on consequences, in part because UNRWA officials will no longer we allowed to communicate with Israeli officials directly, which would cut off a whole range of communication that is necessary for getting aid into Gaza, for example. And of course, the fact that staff and aid can transit through Israel is also going to have a tremendous impact. 
 
And every single actor involved in humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip trip is sounding the alarm about this new legislation would just pass the Israeli parliament overwhelmingly yesterday, including the United States who has made clear that UNRWA is the primary provider of aid in Gaza and at this time when the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is already growing so dire at a time when and the United States is calling on Israel to take a number of steps to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. This really only has the opportunity to make things worse, not better.
 
KINKADE:  Yeah. And, Jeremy, of course, ceasefire negotiations -- negotiators believed that the slain Hamas leader's brother is now the key decision maker. What does this mean for talks going forward if they even happen at all?
 
DIAMOND:  Well, what we know about Mohammed Sinwar is that he is, like I said, the brother of the late Yahya Sinwar, the former head of Hamas, who was killed by the Israeli military earlier this month. And he is believed to be just as hard line as his brother was. And that is to say that Sinwar was viewed as one of the more hard line members of Hamas's leadership. 
 
And there was concern initially when he was elevated to that role of overall Hamas leader about the impact it would have on negotiations. And so now, Mohammed Sinwar, a very similar figure ideologically, is now stepping into that breach so that could be concerning for ceasefire talks, but that being said, at least the negotiators now have a sense of who they will ultimately be dealing with, if not directly then at least who will ultimately be the decision-maker on whether or not Hamas can go for this latest ceasefire proposal.
 
And this latest proposal puzzle is looking at something far more limited rather than the three-phase process that we've seen, that would start with effectively a two-month ceasefire. This is now looking at a one-month ceasefire, according to a proposal that was described to me and my colleague, Alex Marquardt. That's being discussed by the United States as well as by Israel. 
 
It would be one month of a ceasefire. Not clear right now exactly how many hostages would be released during that time or how many prisoners would be exchanged. But really this is aimed at seeing if a more limited deal is indeed possible and whether or not Hamas, which has insisted that any release of hostages, any kind of negotiation would have to ultimately result in clear -- a clear pathway to ending the war in Gaza.
 
Whether or not they would be willing to drop that concession at a time when they are significantly weakened in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar when they no longer really function as a fully functioning, you know, military, militant, or political organization in Gaza, whether or not their red lines have indeed shifted and that remains to be seen. 
 <br>[15:25:09]
 
KINKADE:  All right. Jeremy Diamond for us in Tel Aviv, good to have you live for us. Thanks so much.
 
Well, authorities in Lebanon are reporting some of the deadliest strikes there since the Israel-Hezbollah war escalated last month. The health ministry says at least 60 people were killed and repeated Israeli attacks on cities and towns in eastern Lebanon. One regional governor says, most of the casualties were women and children. 
 
The attacks come as Hezbollah announced a new leader to replace her Hassan Nasrallah.
 
As Salma Abdelaziz reports, it didn't take long for Israel to respond. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hezbollah has a new leader. Naim Qassem has been appointed the group's new secretary general, a role he was already fulfilling acting as the interim chief after his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated by Israel in late September. The killing of Nasrallah, a man seen to embody the Lebanese Shia movement struck a huge blow and left a vacuum inside a group that had already lost much of its leadership as a result of months of Israeli assassinations. 
 
But soon after Nasrallah's death, Qassem issued a defiant statement urging Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire in Lebanon or face Hezbollah's wrath.
 
NAIM QASSEM, HEZBOLLAH SECRETARY GENERAL:  We're not speaking from a position of weakness if the Israelis don't want a ceasefire, we will continue to fight. 
 
ABDELAZIZ:  Qassim was considered Hezbollah's number two, serving as deputy secretary general, meaning second in command of the organization since 1991. He is one of the group's founding members, helping to establish it in the early 1980s.
 
Nasrallah's cousin, Hashem Safieddine, was previously viewed as the favorite to take the helm of the Iran-linked Hezbollah. But he died in an Israeli strike on Beirut shortly after his relative. Since the killing of his predecessor, Qassem has made three televised speeches, speaking in formal Arabic rather than the colloquial dialect that gave his predecessor charisma.
 
Israel says he won't last long and issued this apparent threat: His tenure in this position, maybe the shortest in the history of this terrorist organization. If he follows the footsteps of his predecessors, Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine, the Israeli government's official Arabic account on X posted.
 
His appointment to lead Hezbollah now meant to demonstrate the group can reconstitute and recover even as it fights for its survival. 
 
Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London.

KINKADE:  Our thanks to Salma Abdelaziz for that report.
 
Well, still ahead, the swing state of Arizona could play a key role in this year's presidential election. We'll take a look at what -- what is important to voters there. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:31:21]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade.
 
The state of Arizona has traditionally been a red state, but in 2020, it flipped blue for Joe Biden. Will that hold for Kamala Harris or could it go back to red for Donald Trump? 
 
CNN's John King spoke to voters in Arizona and the challenges that that state faces.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Crunch time in the battlegrounds.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nice to meet you. My name's Meg (ph).
 
I'm with LUCHA, Living United for a Change in Arizona.
 
KING:  One handout promotes the Arizona Ballot Initiative expanding abortion rights. The other promotes Kamala Harris and Democratic candidates for the Senate and the House.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think that your voice has power in this election?
 
KING:  LUCHA canvassers are at 600,000 door knocks and counting. They encourage early voting.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you know where your polling location is?
 
KING:  Many of the targeted homes are Latinos who are registered, but don't always vote.
 
What's the most common question you get at a door knock about the Vice President?
 
CLAUDIO RODRIGUEZ, ARIZONA VOTER AND LUCHA VOLUNTEER:  The most common question we get at a door knock is, why Kamala? Why Kamala? And my answer to that is like, first, she's not a felon. One, she's a strong woman. And as a Latino man, we like strong women and we don't like weak men.
 
KING:  Claudio Rodriguez volunteers for LUCHA and also runs a community farm and food bank. He is upbeat about Harris's chances here. Says encouraging younger voters to turn out is one big need in this final week.
 
RODRIGUEZ:  You do get the folks who are, kind of like feel hopeless, but then you got to bring them back in. You get folks who say like, voting doesn't matter, my vote doesn't matter.
 
And to my response to that is like, whether you believe it matters or not, it still exists. And so why not participate in it? Put your voice in there, your little 2 cents. 
 
KING:  Tucson is in deep blue Pima County. Biden's giant 2020 edge here was critical to winning the state by just 10,000 votes.
 
TAMARA VARGA, ARIZONA VOTER:  Mickey (ph) is one of our biggest sellers.
 
KING:  Tamara Varga is a lifelong Republican who came to Tucson 30 years ago from San Diego. She thought she lived in a blue pocket of a red state.
 
KING:  Did it surprise you in 2020 when Biden won Arizona?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
VARGA:  Absolutely surprised me. I was not expecting that.
 
KING:  Varga owns two candy shops and two food trucks, so she can provide jobs for individuals with special needs, including her sons. She says housing and other costs of living are up. Her gut says Trump is stronger this time.
 
VARGA:  I feel that Trump's ahead, but I felt that way in 2020 as well. So, it's hard to say. You know, I feel that I have had more friends that are open to Trump and are flipping to a Trump vote.
 
KING:  And the local friends who are doing that, do they cite a reason?
 
VARGA:  The border and the economy. Yes, people are having a hard time putting food on their table and gas in their cars, and it's really affecting them. So I think that they now think about their vote and how it will affect their household.
 
KING:  There's no doubt, voter anxiety over the cost of living and the immigration issues give the former president a chance to flip Arizona back to red and win its 11 electoral votes. But Trump's rhetoric and that of his allies sometimes lands wrong and offends two critical voting groups here, moderates in the fast-growing suburbs and Latino voters. John King, CNN, Phoenix.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE:  Well, Michigan has another critical swing state in this election. In 2020, the Democratic stronghold of Detroit was at the center of controversy in the states' vote count. Fears over how long the ballot count was taking lead to chaos at the counting centers. But this year, election officials hope new measures will prevent a repeat of the chaos and even speed up the vote count. 
 <br>[15:35:06]
 
CNN's Marshall Cohen is following this story and joins us now.
 
Good to see you, Marshall. 
 
So how did the methods you were showing differ from last time? 
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER:  Hey, Lynda. We were granted exclusive access to Detroit to election center, where they are already busy at work processing tens of thousands of mail ballots, that's a new feature this year, thanks to reforms in Michigan's election laws, officials started verifying those mail ballots earlier than ever. 
 
And as you just saw in that clip, that's lot of where the problems crept up in 2020, the slow vote count dragged on through election night. Joe Biden eventually overtook Donald Trump. And that's when a crowd of angry, angry Republicans showed up and started pounding on the windows. 
 
This year, a lot of the work is being done ahead of time. We spoke to Detroit's top election official was about how they're dealing with the crush of mail-in ballots and how they verify the authenticity of every single vote. 
 
Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DANIEL BAXTER, DETROIT ELECTIONS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  So today after we received the ballots, my staff go through all of the mail.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  Signed ballots and envelopes are fed into a new million dollars sorting machine that Detroit bought after 2020. 
 
It snaps a picture of each documents, so clerks can compare the signatures to those on file. 
 
Can't get counted without a signature.
 
BAXTER:  Can't get counted without a signature. 
 
COHEN:  Now why does that signature important? 
 
BAXTER:  The signature authenticates the actual ballot. COHEN:  When people out there say there's no verification, your response to that? 
 
BAXTER:  They're wrong. 
 
COHEN:  CNN blurred personal information for the sake of privacy. 
 
ANTHONY MILLER, DETROIT ELECTIONS SPECIAL PROJECTS MANAGER:  This part is the most human part of the process. Now this one --  
 
COHEN:  This one looks pretty different. 
 
MILLER:  Pretty different. This one is a full name and this one is to initials. 
 
COHEN:  So what -- what happens here? 
 
MILLER:  So at this point, returned ballot is rejected for further review.

COHEN (on camera):  So, Lynda, that last ballot in the clip, you just saw that was rejected because the signatures didn't match. That's one of many safeguards in place to prevent fraud and that's why mail-in voting is by and large considered to be safe and secure process -- Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Well, that is good news. Good to have that report from you, Marshall Cohen, in D.C. Thanks so much.
 
Well, you most likely seeing a political ad on television. Those ads are required to disclose who's paying for it. Well, in an effort to reach younger voters, political campaigns are turning to social media influencers, but those closely followed influencers are not required to tell you if they're being paid.
 
Clare Duffy joins us now for more on this. 
 
So clear, why aren't influences required to disclose these political payments? 
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  Yeah. Lynda, it's because there is a regulatory gap here. Influencers are required to disclose those if they've been paid to promote a product or a brand by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Election Commission requires those TV ads that you mentioned to have the paid for by disclosures. 
 
But there is no law that requires influencers to disclose if they're being paid for a political post. And this comes at a time when we know that political action committees, other political groups are shelling out millions of dollars to influencers to help get help spreading their political message just as one example, the Democratic PAC Priorities USA and voter advocacy group Somos Votantes recently announced a nearly $3 million campaign paying influencers to help get out the vote. We're seeing lots of things like that. And yet the problem is that
 
 none of these, you know, a lot of these posts don't include labels, some influencers are labeling voluntarily, but they don't have to. And that leaves users asking questions about whether the post that they're seeing from an influencer is that influencer's genuine feelings, or if there being paid to promote that political message, Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  And so, you know, what are the possible effects?
 
So people that are scrolling through Instagram and the like, a seeing these ads, not knowing that their actual ads, what could be the effects of not disclosing a payment? 
 
DUFFY:  Yeah, I think it's just a question of transparency and whether social media users start to feel confused about whether what they're seeing is genuine or not. I mean, this comes at a time when we know so many people, especially young voters, are really relying on social media for news. 
 
Recent Pew Research report said that nearly 40 percent of younger users are young voters are getting their news regularly from TikTok. And so, I think that for those social media users, there is going to be a question of if you see your favorite influencer promoting a political candidate, is that person just wanting you to vote for somebody they actually like or have they been paid to promote that message, Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Really is remarkable, 40 percent of young Americans getting their news from TikTok. That's incredible.
 
Clare Duffy, good to have you with us. Thanks so much. 
 
Well, still to come: broken pipes is sending water running through the streets of Havana, but there's no clean water coming out of the top. We're going to have a live report on Cuba's growing water crisis, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:43:08]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back.
 
Cuba's energy crisis continues to disrupt the lives of residents. The country has seen repeated island-wide blackouts and chronic problems with the electric grid. Officials say crumbling infrastructure is partly to blame. Meanwhile, there are also food and fuel shortages, and ever worsening clean water crisis.
 
CNN Patrick Oppmann is in Havana, certainly a lot to deal with there right now.
 
Patrick, just how difficult is it for people to find clean water.
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You know, of course, we talked a lot about the power failure that took -- took out power across this island for more than three days. It's largely been restored. Of course, there are still disruptions every day across this island. 
 
But the water crisis, that's been going on for a lot longer, does not have an easy or inexpensive fixed to it. And it's gotten to the point, Lynda, where now, there are hundreds of thousands of Cuba who do not have water sometimes for days, sometimes for weeks. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OPPMANN (voice-over):  Some days in many parts of Cuba, it seems there's water everywhere but actually inside people's houses, like the power grid that crashed across the island for more than three days. Earlier this month, the island's aging, poorly maintained water system is also barely functioning.
 
Enough water spills in the street in some places to even wash your car. The day we first visit this hardscrabble neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana, residents tell us they've not had running water in over two weeks.
 
Some people like Annie (ph) say they walked areas were water does come in, even if only for a few hours to carry back to their homes.
 
We carry water to be able to bathe and cook, she says. I have four tanks for water in my house. But there's not even a drop in them. 
 
Cuban officials blame U.S. sanctions in part for the failing water system, but acknowledged the crisis has grown to impact nearly 10 percent of the population.
 <br>[15:45:11]
 
We have around 1,013,000, 1,018,000 people without water, he says, because of the pumps, energy cuts, high breakages. 
 
The water shortages have led some Cubans to take to the streets in protest, something the government usually does not tolerate. The worsening power situation has a direct impact on the water supply. 
 
Many people, if not most people in Cuba don't get water every day. You might get water for a few hours, every other day, every third day, it's what's known as the el dia de agua, water day. When there's a power cut, you don't get any water that day either.
 
The government says it sends water trucks to help with the problem. But there are not enough to go around. And residents here tell us you have to pay the one of those trucks to actually come. 
 
That's an impossibility for someone like me Annie who says the more frequently the power goes out the less water she will likely have. She says the country's leaders need to remember how poor people like here live. The power doesn't go out for them, she says, they need to put themselves in our place.
 
Just down the hill from Annie's house, a small river of drinking water runs in the street where a pipe is broken. She says residents have reported the problem for years to the local government, but no one has ever come to fix it.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
OPPMANN (on camera):  And, Lynda, of course, standing water is the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. Already over the summer, there been thousands of new cases of dengue and other mosquito-borne illnesses. You know, it's just a domino effect and so is another reason why there can't be water every day is these kinds of diseases that mosquitoes breeding in this water can bring.
 
KINKADE:  Wow, as if they weren't enough problems already.
 
So, Patrick, what kind of help, if any is Cuba receiving from other nations?
 
OPPMANN:  Cuba has requested help and received it from allies like a Mexico, Venezuela, China, and Russia. Those are traditionally the countries that do help when there's an energy crisis, when you have a breakdown of a power plant, but you know, we're talking about billions of dollars to fix the infrastructure problems that we've been talking about over the last several weeks. And there's simply no country that is going to step up and plug those holes. 
 
So people are being told to find their own solutions. But of course, you know, you need water or you need power. And many people at this point on this island do not have those things. 
 
KINKADE:  All right. Patrick Oppmann, thanks so much for bringing us that report.
 
Well, still to come, the Los Angeles Dodgers is just one win away from becoming World Series champions. Our Coy Wire will be next here on CNN with a preview.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:50:28]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade.
 
Fans of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" got what they probably considered to be good news from host Jon Stewart.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JON STEWART, HOST, THE DAILY SHOW:  This is my last show before the election, but not my last show. I'm coming back, baby. We're doing another year.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  Stewart continues on as the weekly host throughout next year. He had originally planned to work through this presidential election. He will also remain as the shows executive producer as other comedians make their way into the hosting seat. The CEO of paramount, which owns Comedy Central, says Stewart is one of the most important voices in political and cultural commentary.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART:  It's very stressful than elections in a week. I only have one week left to decide who I'm going to vote for. It is -- no, no, I just vote for whoever "The Washington Post" endorses. But I'm not an Amazon Prime member.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  So good.
 
Well, as the New York Mets fan, we know this, you probably won't be cheering for the Yankees tonight. And what could be this year's last World Series game? 
 
Well, let's bring out "WORLD SPORT" champ Coy Wire on who he thinks might win.
 
Coy, great to see you. 
 
So, the L.A. Dodgers hoping this year, their eighth World Series championship, the Yankees are three games down. What's going to happen? 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Yankees fans are hoping they can win a couple of games here, send a series of L.A., but maybe L.A. fans are hoping that too, so that they can celebrate a World Series at home, Lynda.
 
This World Series was supposed to be epic but it's been nothing but Dodger domination. And Freddie Freeman has been dominating as well. Last night, check him out here in the first inning. He absolutely crushes the ball off Clarke Schmidt for a two-run home run it completely deflated the fans in the stands there at Yankee stadium. 
 
Freeman had that walk-off grand slam in game one, now homered in every game this World Series. He's five in a row, dating back to when he was with the Braves, ties a World Series record.
 
So Walker Buehler, he threw five shutout innings. Yankees didn't get anything until two outs left in the ninth inning, and that wasn't enough. Dodgers take game 3, 4-2, and a commanding 3-0 series lead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREDDIE FREEMAN, LOS ANGELES DODGERS FIRST BASEMAN:  I guess when it's all said and done, I can look at that, but the most important thing is what you said. One more win, and that's all I care about right now. I don't care how it happens. I just want to get one more win.
 
DAVE ROBRETS, LOS ANGELES DODGERS MANAGER:  We have got to stay focused, stay urgent. I think offensively to be quite honest, we left a lot of runs out there tonight, still found a way to win a ball game and there's just got to be urgency. I just don't want to let these guys up for air.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Dodgers stars have just seemed to continue to shine a rise to the occasion, Lynda, while the Yankees have not. 
 
KINKADE:  So I'm wondering, I mean, can they in keys at least make it a series and send it back to L.A.?
 
WIRE:  Now, the chances are slim to none and slim might vary, be looking to book a trip to the beach each of the Bahamas. No team has ever come back from being down 0-3 in a best of seven World Series. The only team to come back from being down 0-3 in any best-of-seven postseason series were the '04 Red Sox against the Yankees in the American League championship series. 
 
So getting this series back to L.A. for a game six is also highly unlikely. No team has ever been down 0-3 in the World Series and been able to force a game six.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AARON BOONE, NEW YORK YANKEES MANAGER:  We're trying to get a game tomorrow, okay? That's -- that's where our focus lies. So, hopefully, we can, you know, go be this amazing story and shock the world. But right now, it's about trying to get a lead, trying to grab a game and force -- force another one and then and then on from there. But we've got to grab one first. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  Now if they are to make this a series, the Yankees would need their star, Aaron Judge, to turn things around. He's been in a major slump this entire postseason and he's been at his worse in the World Series. Judge was 0-3 with a strikeout Monday night. In the first two rounds that the Yankees won, Judge batted just won 61, but he did still have two home runs.
 
In the World Series so far, he has just one hit, Lynda in 12 at-bats. And this is the guy who is likely going to win MVP again this season. 
 
KINKADE:  In terms the L.A. Dodgers superstar Ohtani, just how cool would it be if he was to take home a World Series? 
 <br>[15:55:07]
 
WIRE:  Yeah, it'll be his first ever fans both in L.A. and all the way across the pond in Japan would be going crazy. He absolutely has been a soldier. He injured his shoulder. He came out with a sling last night, even after he had a couple at bats, he ran off holding his -- his arm in place as shoulder in place, playing through a lot of pain, but that just tells you how much and how badly he wants this one.
 
KINKADE:  All right, so this game is going to happen just after 8:00 pm. It'll start. And of course, that's off to Kamala Harris's speech, which is at 7:30 p.m. with busy night to television. Coy Wire, thanks as always.
 
WIRE:  Good to see you, Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  And thanks so much for joining us today. I'm Lynda Kinkade in Atlanta.
