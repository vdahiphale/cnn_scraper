BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Fear is gripping Ecuador after the disappearance of two gang leaders set off a stunning wave of violence, kidnappings, explosions, and the takeover of a TV station.
 
All prompting the nation's president to declare an internal armed conflict. He's ordered the military to neutralize the country's powerful gangs after a spate of prison riots and high-profile escapes. 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: And one of the most disturbing incidents here was broadcast in real time. This is shocking video that you are looking at. Armed men storming the local television station in the city of Guayaquil during a live broadcast. 
 
Police successfully apprehended the gunmen. They tell CNN that no hostages were killed during the attack. 
 
Let's go to CNN's Patrick Oppmann with an update.
 
Patrick, tell us what you are learning. 
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, just about this time yesterday that armed gunmen came into this TV station in Ecuador's largest city and took it by force, firing shots, forcing some employees to the floor at gunpoint.
 
And saying that they wanted to communicate a message to the president of Ecuador, that he needed to back off his campaign against the gangs.
 
And Ecuadorians are absolutely traumatized by what took place yesterday seeing this not only on live TV but also having attacks at universities, attacks in hospitals, in prisons against police. They've never seen a wave of violence quite like this before. 
 
It's all being fueled by these powerful drug gangs, gangs that are trafficking cocaine through Ecuador to other places in the U.S. and Europe. Ecuador's president has sent troops out in the streets that has
 
 stabilized the situation for the time being.
 
But this was all kicked off when one of the highest-profile criminals in the country, a gang member known as Fito, escaped from prison. And they don't know when or how it took place. 
 
The president of Ecuador saying this morning that they believe officials inside the prison helped him to escape. And they will face charges.
 
But this is part of the larger problem there. The corruption of the gangs is so malignant and so widespread that literally you don't know who to trust in Ecuador and that the gangs have become so powerful that it's not even clear yet whether the government can put a stop to them. 
 
KEILAR: All right, Patrick Oppmann, thank you for that report. Very alarming what is happening in Ecuador. 
 
Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war, the United Nations confirming a short time ago that the special representative of the secretary- general on sexual violence and conflict is going to be heading to Israel and the West Bank at the end of this month. 
 
That envoy, Pramila Patten, plans to meet with survivors and witnesses of the October 7th Hamas attacks to gather information on reports of sex crimes against female and male victims in Israel. 
 
Also today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, discussing a future for Palestinians in Gaza. 
 
Some Israeli officials had talked about expelling Palestinians from their land. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: We talked about the importance of reforming the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian governments, so that it can effectively take responsibility for Gaza that -- so Gaza and the West Bank can be reunited under Palestinian leadership. 
 
What's so powerful in all our conversations throughout the Strip is that countries do see a way forward, a way forward through greater integration that actually provides real security for Israel and guarantees for that security and a pathway to Palestinian state. 
 
Now, to get there, leaders have to make hard decisions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: Joining us now is Mark Regev, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
Ambassador, thank you so much for being with us. We've heard the prime minister, he's been clear, he is opposed to a
 
 Palestinian state. 
 
What is your reaction to Blinken saying that what is so powerful in these conversations he's having with countries on his trip is the path to real security for Israel includes a Palestinian state? 
 <br>[14:35:04]
 
MARK REGEV, SENIOR ADVISOR TO ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: I think when Secretary Blinken talks about this, he is talking about something that is on the horizon, not something that is doable today.
 
And today, we are focusing on the immediate post-war situation in Gaza once Hamas has been defeated. And there I think there is a lot of common ground.
 
We say Gaza has to be post-Hamas, Hamas has to no longer be ruling there, that Gaza will be demilitarized and Gaza will be the deradicalized. 
 
That promises a better future not just for Israel. That promises a better future for the people of Gaza, too.
 
KEILAR: It sounds like what Netanyahu is speaking about is also on the horizon. These are two very different pictures. And obviously, what's on the horizon matters. 
 
If you have Saudi Arabia, for instance, among other countries, open, as Blinken said, to establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, but it would require an end to the war and practical steps. Right?
 
So not a Palestinian state immediately but practical steps, which is something that could come sooner. Are you shutting the door on that? 
 
REGEV: Definitely, not. We have a formula in Israel, which is the Palestinians should have all the powers to rule themselves and none of the power to harm Israel. 
 
That second part of the formula has become especially pronounced since the October 7th massacre. We never want to see Palestinians cross the border like they did on October 7th and rudely attack, rape, burn alive, behead our people ever again. 
 
So, of course, there has to be demilitarization. We spoke about that. But the idea that Palestinians should rule themselves, that is something that Israel has accepted. 
 
KEILAR: Officials in your government, including your finance minister, have proposed Palestinians immigrating out of the Gaza Strip following the war. Quote unquote, "voluntary immigration" is what it was called. 
 
The U.S., of course, adamantly opposing this. There is now a report out of Israel that the proposal is off the table. Is that true? REGEV: Yes, 100 percent. It was never seriously on the table. We have
 
 a large cabinet. Our ministerial staff have close to 40 people and you will get differences of opinion. 
 
But ultimately, decisions taken by the government and by the prime minister is that this has never been seriously entertained. 
 
KEILAR: It's not off the table because of U.S. opposition? 
 
REGEV: No, it's not on the table because it's not serious. At the moment, we are focused on winning the war and on creating a post-war reality, which will be better for Palestinians and better for Israelis. 
 
Obviously, we worry about our own people first. Every country does. But -- gives the Palestinians in Gaza new hope of a new future.
 
Because Hamas has been in power now for 16 years, and what have they brought the people of Gaza, Brianna? Misery, bloodshed, poverty. The people of Gaza deserve better themselves. 
 
KEILAR: Can you tell us more about this visit from the U.N. representative on sexual violence and conflict? 
 
When you read about it in the Israeli press, it talks about an invitation for Pramila Patten to come. She is coming. She's going to be investigating. 
 
But the U.N. is clear, even though she is gathering information, she will be meeting with victims and released hostages, they say that her trip is not intended to be investigative. 
 
Does this go far enough in your view? 
 
REGEV: I think the feeling in Israel, and especially among the women's organizations, is that the U.N. is late to the game here. But I suppose we could say better late than never. 
 
The evidence that has come out of Hamas organized rapes, using rape as a weapon of war, brutalizing women.
 
And one of the tragedies, the horrors of the situation is, my understanding, it's mostly women who were raped, murdered, mutilated and their bodies mutilated. Terrible crimes against women. Terrible crimes against humanity. 
 
And that is one of the reasons I think we say there can't be peace with this Hamas regime. A regime in Gaza that says every Israeli man and woman is a target for this sort of atrocious behavior. 
 
You can't have peace with them. They say themselves they believe in permanent war with Israel, they say themselves they would do October 7th with the rapes and the murders and the beheadings and the burnings alive, they would do all of that again. They say so publicly. 
 
So it's crucial we win this war. This is a war against brutality, a war against an organization committing horrific violence against innocent people. They must be defeated. Their military machine must be destroyed. 
 <br>[14:40:07]
 
KEILAR: But, Ambassador, what do you understand that she is coming to do? And is that an important distinction? Coming to investigate versus coming to gather information as we have seen evidence of these horrible atrocities that happened on October 7th? 
 
REGEV: It's not clear to me. I'm only going by the public statements of the United Nations. But as I said, she should have been here three months ago when this was -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: Do you want her to investigate? Is that important to Israel? 
 
REGEV: I think it's very important. It's important that the U.N. speaks the truth. 
 
And here we've had, unfortunately, over the years, systematic anti- Israel bias in the U.N. structure. Maybe reflected by her late coming now, that it took her so long to come here. 
 
But it's not just the Israeli government that's talked about anti- Israel bias in the United Nations. Two former secretary-generals, both Ban Ki Moon and Kofi Annan, publicly addressed the issue of anti- Israel bias in the United Nations. 
 
Unfortunately, the current leadership of the United Nations, instead of standing up and trying to fight internal biases in the U.N., seems to be embracing it.
 
So it's good that she's coming. But once again, it's late. 
 
KEILAR: Mark Regev, thank you so much. We appreciate your time today. 
 
REGEV: Thank you for having me. 
 
KEILAR: Still ahead, allegations of wrongdoing in the Fulton County district attorney's office that is prosecuting former President Donald Trump. D.A. Fani Willis now being subpoenaed in a divorce case. 
 
We will break down the details of how this could actually impact the criminal case against the former president. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:46:05]
 
SANCHEZ: There are some new developments now that could raise questions ahead of the election interference case against Donald Trump in Georgia. 
 
We are learning that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been subpoenaed to appear as a witness in the Lead Prosecutor Nathan Wade's divorce proceedings. 
 
KEILAR: That's right. This week, in an attempt to get the case thrown out, one of Trumps Fulton County co-defendants claimed in a court filing that Willis and Attorney Nathan Wade had an improper relationship and that they profited from working together. 
 
The document did not provide any evidence of wrongdoing. 
 
We have CNN's Zachary Cohen following this story for us. 
 
Zach, tell us what is happening here and how this could potentially impact the case in Georgia. 
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, in the short-term, obviously, it's already creating an optics problem. Right?
 
Fani Willis has been under fire from political attacks. She's faced violent threats the entire time we are seeing this case. 
 
But right now, we are seeing Republicans and Donald Trump himself jump on these new allegations, really trying to use them to undermine the credibility of the entire case.
 
And as you mentioned, the defendant in this case, Mike Roman, one of Trump's former campaign aides, is trying to get the whole case against him thrown out. It remains to be seen if that will be the consequence here.
 
But in the short-term it's raising legitimate questions about why Fani Willis was not open about this, why she wasn't honest about it publicly. 
 
According to the records we have seen that this has been a relationship, allegedly, that has been going on for a while now and she has been under a lot of scrutiny the entire time.
 
And now this is coming out at a sensitive moment in the investigation where, presumably heading towards a trial here, and the credibility of an ultimate conviction potentially and the prosecution itself does hang in the balance as far as her credibility. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. Part of the allegation has to do with her using public funds to hire him, right? 
 
COHEN: That's right. Her entire team is paid by the taxpayer and that includes Nathan Wade. 
 
The defendant in the case is alleging that Wade though was not only not qualified for that role as lead prosecutor but he is making more money than the rest of the people on the team are making. 
 
So again, no direct evidence though that that is true. That hasn't been produced yet. But the subpoena in the divorce proceedings do provide an opportunity to where we may have to see Fani Willis answer some of these questions and that we may get more details about what is real and what is not real going forward. 
 
KEILAR: Real implications here.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. 
 
Zachary Cohen, thanks so much for the update.
 
Still ahead, pollution is actually diminishing in the United States. Emissions fell to the lowest level in more than 20 years. What this could mean for the climate and the economy, when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:53:07]
 
SANCHEZ: A rare bit of good news on the environment. The U.S. managed to cut pollution in 2023. Emissions fell nearly 2 percent last year. That's according to new data from the non-partisan Rhodium Group. Driving emissions down to their lowest level in 30-plus years, since 1991.
 
KEILAR: Now for context here -- I feel like you are good cop and I'm bad cop here.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
KEILAR: It was still the hottest year on record with the most billion- dollar weather and climate disasters in America. 
 
CNN chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir, is joining us with more. 
 
I'm like Debbie Downer here, Bill. But tell us why this is so important because we like the good news, too. 
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to the club, Brianna. I used to be fun at parties before I started talking about this stuff. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WEIR: You are absolutely right, you have to put it in context. It's better than nothing, 2 percent is better than nothing. 
 
It needs to be about 7 percent to meet President Biden's goals of having admissions by the end of the decade right now. So it has to get a lot faster. It has to get a lot more ambitious. But it's moving in the right direction. 
 
This is the result of retiring very old coal-fired coal plants, which is really low-hanging fruit. 
 
Last year, the United States, exported more oil and gas than any country ever. So now comes the hard part, dialing back on liquefied natural gas and not tapping into oil reserves that we know that are out there. That's what the scientists are calling for.
 
But it does give some credibility to the United States trying to lead coming out of COP28. Now the big test is methane, natural gas. If they can cap that, the easiest one, that's hugely important. 
 
SANCHEZ: So what states in the U.S. are leading the charge? 
 
WEIR: This is really interesting, Boris. If you look at the top solar states, you would expect that California would be on that list. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
But Florida is now adding more solar at a faster clip ever since the governor of those states sided with consumers. The states actually sided with consumers over utilities.
 
Out in California, they are crimping the incentives for solar power there.
 
But Texas is a big solar state, North Carolina and Nevada. And look at the wind states, Texas, Iowa -- we've got a debate there tonight -- Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois.
 
The greenest states in America right now are mostly red. That speaks volumes about the economics of this beyond the politics and ideology. Solar and wind, plus battery storage are the cheapest forms of energy ever in history and it's happening now.
 
It'll be interesting to see if, you know, popular culture, social license follows that trend. Because it's one thing to add a bunch of solar. It has to replace oil and gas over time.
 
And it's the wind down. That's where the big fight is against some of the richest countries in history. 
 
KEILAR: So interesting. I mean, listen, it's a political talking point but money talks here, too, and it's so clear in those interesting statistics that you put up. 
 
Bill, thank you so much. Great to have you on this. 
 
WEIR: You bet. 
 
SANCHEZ: Still ahead, fireworks on Capitol Hill. Hunter Biden making a surprise appearance in front of Congress, then making a swift exit. 
 
We will break down what is next in the House investigation of Hunter Biden, how the White House is responding, and why some lawmakers are now protesting against House Speaker Mike Johnson over a proposed budget. 
 
We will be right back.
