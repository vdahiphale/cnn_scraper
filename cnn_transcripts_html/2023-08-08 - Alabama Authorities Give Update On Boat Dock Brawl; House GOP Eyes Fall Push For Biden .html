(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: Any moment here on CNN, we'll have an update on that Riverside mayhem in Alabama where a group of white boaters attack a black dock worker. Authorities are about to update us on their investigation. And we are live in Montgomery next.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Also happening this hour. President Biden is expected to announce a new national monument at the Grand Canyon that will block, among other things, uranium mining. And senior Western officials tell me that the updates on Ukraine's counteroffensive they are receiving are more and more sobering. We're going to tell you what's behind the slow progress on the battlefield.
 
We are following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
KEILAR: Here in moments, we are going to hear from law enforcement in Montgomery, Alabama for an update on their investigation into that ugly waterfront brawl that went viral on social media. It started on Saturday when a group of white boater -- of vote -- boaters appeared to attack a black dock worker over a boat -- their boat that was parked in the wrong place. And this led to a huge fight there on the dock.
 
Disturbing footage of the incident like the video that you're seeing quickly spreading online. And police issued multiple arrest warrants following that.
 
We have CNN's Ryan Young at the news conference, which is going to begin any moment. He's joining us now on the phone. Ryan, any idea what we're about to hear?
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Yes, any moment now, the mayor and the police chief will be stepping into that podium right there to have that news conference. They'll be addressing all the rumors that have been out -- come out on social media. They also had help with the FBI as well in this case. In fact, they are walking for that podium even as I speak.
 
We're hoping to learn from their investigation exactly what they were able to learn the last few days and the arrest they expect to make. In fact, the mayor is just up to the podium, so I'll let him take over at this point.
 
KEILAR: All right, Mayor Steven Reed. Let's listen in to this.
 
STEVEN REED, MAYOR OF MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA: Good afternoon. Well, all of you are here today to join us. One thing all members of the City Montgomery, Montgomery police department, Montgomery Fire and Rescue, all of our employees as well as everyone in our community that has been so helpful regarding the situation that brings us here today.
 
As you all know, we had an unfortunate event to take place over the weekend in downtown Montgomery on our riverfront, something that was brought on by reckless individuals who did not use good judgment and calls in an event that certainly was avoidable. That said, the police department reacted very swiftly, very intentionally to address that matter, as did other citizens in the community. And so, at this time, we wanted to bring forth some information that we did not have as our investigation continues to report to the public.
 
And so, I have with me Chief Darryl Albert, the chief of the Montgomery Police Department, who will update you on the status of this event and how things are going in the investigation at this point. But again, we want to thank all the members of the public, all of our first responders, and everyone who has been helpful. Witnesses in bringing forth the information that we have. So, this time, I'll turn it over to Chief Albert. Chief?
 
DARRYL ALBERT, CHIEF, MONTGOMERY POLICE: Good afternoon. Again, Chief Darryl Albert, Montgomery Police Department. Now, I kind to lay out the facts as we know them now regarding the incident that took place on Saturday, August 5, 2023, at 7:00 p.m.
 
There were several events taking place on our historic Riverfront. Positive feedback regarding a school event hosted by Montgomery public schools and Hyundai was taking place at the amphitheater and nearby train shed. The Harriott II river cruise ship was fully operational. Operating from a designated docking space along the river.
 <br>[14:05:03]
 
The Harriott takes passengers on two-hour tours up and along to Alabama River throughout the day. On this day, there were 227 passengers aboard that vessel. The incident occurred between the co- captain of the Harriott II vessel and a private boat owner and his family.
 
As the Harriott attempted to dock in his designated space, designated and reserved, due to the gangway access, as well as the mooring requirements, the private boat was docked in its space, prohibiting safe docking of the Harriott. The captain of the Harriott remained away from the dock for nearly 40 to 45 minutes as he attempted to contact the operators of the private boat via the PA system. They will only respond to -- with obscene gestures, curse words, and taunting.
 
The co-captain was then picked up by a separate vessel and brought to the pier in an attempt to have a conversation with the private boat owners and or have those boats move so that the Harriott could dock. A confrontation ensued between the co-captain. And Mr. Pickett, the co- captain being attacked by several members of the private boat. Several members of the Harriott II came to Mr. Pickett's defense engaging in what we all have seen since on social media.
 
I'll give you a timeline as to where the calls came in and the Montgomery Police Department's response. The original call came in at 7:00 p.m. as a typical disturbance. The caller, who was the captain of the Harriott, was very calm and not in distress.
 
As additional calls were received at 7:15 p.m., the call was dispatched to the Montgomery Police Department. 7:18, the first units, four of the Montgomery Police Department officers arrived on scene with three shortly thereafter. 13 individuals were detained and brought to police headquarters for questioning and interviews. Those interviews lasted several hours.
 
At that time, all parties involved were released pending further investigation but were all given instructions on how to secure warrants on combatants. We have since consulted with and are continuing to work with the Alabama law enforcement agency, our state police agency, the Montgomery's DA's office, and the local office of the FBI. This investigation is ongoing and more charges are likely.
 
We encourage the public to continue to send us additional videos or evidence relating to this case. Those can be sent to the star center at montgomeryal.gov, or at our secret witness 334-625-4000. The victims in this case, the Co-Captain Mr. Damien Pickett, a black male, and a 16-year-old white male juvenile who was struck by the owners and operators of the private boat.
 
The suspects thus far have been identified as Richard Roberts, White male 48 years old, with two outstanding warrants for assault third degree. Allen Todd, White male, 23 years old, one warrant for assault third degree. And Zachary Shipman, White male, 25 years old, one warrant for assault third degree.
 
We have instructed those individuals to turn themselves in to law enforcement. And as of this time, one is secured and in custody. The other two are set to turn themselves in within the next hour.
 
We'll also be asking for Mr. Reggie Green, the Black male, 42 years old, who was seen wielding a folding chair to contact the Montgomery Police Department for further interviews. And as part of this investigation. As the Mayor said a minute ago, this investigation is ongoing and more charges are likely. We want to thank the public and the media for supplying much-needed evidence and video surveillance that we've received and then helped us to determine the facts as they happen.
 <br>[14:10:00]
 
Keep in mind. When the incident took place -- when it initially took place, the police department didn't have the luxury of the videos that we all have seen now. The police department was acting on statements and witness statements that occurred as we arrived. Now, that we have more information, again, more charges are pending. I am available to answer your questions, but that sums up where we are at this time. Sir.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. (INAUDIBLE) CBS 42 Birmingham. Can you identify who has themselves, Sir?
 
ALBERT: Not at this time. We know one individual has turned himself in. He is in the custody of the Selma Police Department. Again, I've worked with the Selma police department and we've been working very closely with Chief Fulford over there. And Chief contacted me just prior to this press conference and say one individual has turned himself in and the other two are set to turn themselves in a little bit later.
 
Now, the issue is, we had multiple addresses in Selma and in Orange Beach. So, locating these individuals were a little bit challenging, but now we've made contact. We should be and we'll be bringing those individuals here for justice. Sir.
 
RANDY SCOTT, REPORTER, APTV: Chief, Randy Scott, APTV. Saturday night, there were some videos that show some individuals being led away in handcuffs. Were those folks detained, or were they released a little late after they were detained?
 
ALBERT: So, on the night of the incident, the Montgomery Police Department detained 13 individuals for questioning and for further investigation. Those individuals were transported to police headquarters, in which at that time, we were able to gain a much- needed information we need. And provide them with information on how to secure warrants for -- information and for the acts that you saw live on TV.
 
YOUNG: (INAUDIBLE) What can you tell us about the resistance -- (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you identify yourself?
 
YOUNG: Ryan Young from CNN.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.
 
ALBERT: Well, thank you. Yes. So, the co-captain -- again, as a co- captain approached the dock and attempted to peacefully move the boat over just enough so that, that Harriott could park, the owners of the boat confronted him in a very hostile manner. There was words exchanged, and then it turned into a fistic encounter that you've all seen.
 
So, the co-captain was doing his job. He was simply trying to move the boat in just enough to where the cruise ship can park safely in its -- in its identified location. However, it quickly escalated into a fistic encounter.
 
YOUNG: Anything of a racial mention at that point as when you -- as when you move right along? ALBERT: So, as it relates to racial epithets in conversation and names being called, while the Harriott was still out in the water, there was a lot of -- I've seen finger gestures and comments and innuendos made at a distance. Of course, when the co-captain approached that will -- that continue. But again, working with the local FBI, we did examine if there was enough to file hate crimes charges on this case.
 
And again, we rely heavily on advice from the FBI. We've also looked at you know what it takes to elevate this to a riot, inciting a riot. We've worked with our local District Attorney, and they didn't fit the criteria for that. So, the charges that we have pending on, assault third, at this time, are appropriate charges for what we've seen in the behavior that we've seen on the -- on social media.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Chief -- (INAUDIBLE) A point of clarification. The four that you mentioned, are they also seated with the pontoon boat in the initial attack on the co-captain?
 
ALBERT: Yes. So, the full warrants got secured all members of the pontoon boat -- with the pontoon boat and attack on the co-captain. And there was an attack on a 16-year-old employee of the smaller vessel that took the co-captain from the -- from the Harriott to the dock.
 
That 16-year-old was assaulted by one of those members of that pontoon boat. His mother actually went sign warrants on one of those individuals. That individual was a 16-year-old, White male employee of the smaller vessel that was operating in the river at that time as well.
 
ROSANNA SMITH, REPORTER, WSFA: Chief, Rosanna Smith of WSFA. Can you please provide us with the names of those suspects -- (INAUDIBLE) for us? I mean are these misdemeanors charges or what's the right -- 
 
ALBERT: Yes. So, assault third is a misdemeanor charge by statute. And the names of the individuals that's what it is -- I'm sorry. Richard Roberts, R-O-B-E-R-T-S. He's a White male, 48 years old. He has two warrants pending for assault third.
 
Allen Todd, T-O-D-D, 23-year-old White male. Has one warrant pending. And Zachary Shipman. S-H-I-P-M-A-N, White male, 25 years old. He has one more pending.
 <br>[14:15:08]
 
SMITH: Excellent. Also, we've been hearing that there was also possibly previous incidents with these boaters that you need knowledge. Was there any previous incidents with these boaters and the river crew -- river boat crew?
 
ALBERT: We have no knowledge at this time that this was something that was continued from prior incidents. This was a standalone incident again, that was brought to our attention and we acted on information we had.
 
SMITH: (INAUDIBLE) Sir, there's a lot of videos at WSFA here in Montgomery. I just want to move to the fact -- (INAUDIBLE) you can't say you're -- that this was racially motivated at all or is there anything we need -- you guys could believe that this may have been something racially motivated?
 
ALBERT: I can tell you. We looked at every avenue. There was no stone unturned. We examined this over a period of time not only that night but since that night. At this time based on where the statutes read and the way the laws are crafted, we were unable to present any inciting a riot or racial -- racially biased charges at this time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, Chief. When you said this morning -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good morning, Chief.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- you clarified that that was not the pontoon boat, that was a different boat.
 
ALBERT: I'm sorry.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you said this morning, the vessel -- 
 
ALBERT: OK. So, the smaller vessel I mentioned, in which the co- captain was moved from the Harrier -- Harriott to the dock was moved by a smaller vessel. The smaller vessel operated independently in the river and was able to pick up the co-captain and bring him to the dock so that he could work on moving the boats that were impeding the docking of the -- of the Harriott.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) ABC News. Can you take us to which defendant has turned himself in -- 
 
ALBERT: I do not have the information on the defendant that turned himself in. We do know that one has since been taken into custody by Selma PD. And the other two are en route to Selma now to turn themselves in. And, of course, the Montgomery Police Department will do that transfer of those suspects for -- to be transported here to the City of Montgomery.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you just -- can you just describe the signage at the dock there? Is there signage saying do not park -- (INAUDIBLE) parking area?
 
ALBERT: So, there was no signage at the time. However, the mooring area for the Harriott is well-defined by the dock itself. The area that's cordoned off, as well as the large poles that the boat ties off to.
 
And you know, what we do is that Harriott is parked there all the time. That boat is out there all the time. Individuals that utilize that river and that dock are very familiar with where that larger vessel is required to dock because of the mooring that is set up as well as the gangplank areas that needs to be utilized to get those passengers on and off the vessel.
 
KEILAR: All right. You're listening there to police Chief Darryl Albert talking about this for all that we saw happen at -- in Montgomery, Alabama there on the dock. And explaining what had happened which has now been pretty well reported. But this was really the beginning of the violence of it.
 
These are private boat owners and the family members attacking a boat co-captain. This was a boat co-captain who had gone from a steamboat that is normally parked there and traverses the Alabama River frequently. I -- we did learn though, Jim, is that there are no hate crimes at this point that they are pursuing.
 
SCIUTTO: Right. Three men were charged with assault. No hate crimes. And also he said it did not meet the standard for that. The threshold, nor for incitement to riot, which were other charges they said that they considered.
 
KEILAR: That's right. So, let's bring in Joey Jackson, our legal analyst to talk a little bit about this. Joey, what do you think?
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes. I thought that the police apparently are at the initial stages in my view of investigating and making assessments as to what's what. I glean that from the notion, Brianna and Jim, that they're asking if there are additional videos or any other information out there. At that time, they'll assess based upon the videos and what they show in terms of conduct whether anyone else should be brought to justice.
 
I've also gleaned from it that there are three people being charged with the assault in the third degree. What does that mean? In Alabama like many other states, you rate the degree of assault predicated upon the conduct shown. As the police captain noted, Brianna and Jim, what had occurred with the assault three is that assault three is a misdemeanor. That means it's punishable by up to six months in jail.
 
Generally, an assault three means there are no weapons involved, but you do intend to cause physical injury. And physical injury indeed, has been caused. And so, I think at this point, they also alluded, my third takeaway, is what you both spoke about. And that is not -- no hate crime at this point.
 <br>[14:20:09]
 
In order, obviously, for there to be a hate crime determination, it would mean that they were able to assess that this was motivated by some type of hate based on race, right? That would be a critical component. They have not yet made that assessment.
 
As it relates, of course, to the issue of not only hate crimes, but the issue of inciting a riot, the final piece of this is that they've made an assessment that no one at this point engaged in conduct that shows that they were intending, commanding, and for tuning, people get involved in a situation that would involve grave danger to others. That is there was not a ring leader they can point to at this time that had the purpose, right, and the objective of causing that.
 
So, at this point, they have the people in custody that they do. I assume that they'll conduct a further investigation. And if there's any other people that need to be brought to justice in conjunction with the prosecutor's office, they'll bring those people to justice and charge them appropriately with facts that fit the crimes.
 
SCIUTTO: The police chief, Albert, of Montgomery police, he noted that I believe at least one of the suspects have turned themselves in. If you were representing these people, would you recommend, I imagine, that they turn themselves in?
 
JACKSON: Well, I'll tell you why that's important, Jim It's important because it goes to the issue of bail.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
JACKSON: You know, in a case like this, certainly, if they're misdemeanor charges, you're not going to generally be held on a significant amount of bail or bail at all. But if you are wanted and you are a fugitive from justice, not that they are, you are given an opportunity to turn yourself in. It, from an attorney's perspective, you cannot argue if you don't voluntarily turn yourself in and the police have to get you that you're not a flight risk.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
JACKSON: And so, yes, I think that charges, you always when you turn yourself in, have the ability to hire counsel, have the ability to move forward with the charges and make whatever defenses you think are appropriate, including self-defense or anything else. But I think it's important not to be a fugitive, not to run away, but to face the charges head-on. And our courts in any state, this being Alabama, entitle anyone to due process. And that due process is indicated in a court of law.
 
SCIUTTO: Joey Jackson, always good to have you break it all down. Thanks so much.
 
Coming up. Many House Republicans are pushing for an impeachment of Joe Biden, at least, an inquiry this fall despite the House speaker saying no decisions have yet been made. We are live on Capitol Hill with the latest. You are watching CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:26:27]
 
SCIUTTO: In front of the cameras, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says Republicans have not yet decided whether they will pursue an impeachment inquiry against President Biden. But behind closed doors, in private, it's a different story. GOP sources tell CNN it is already a done deal. Any formal vote on the matter could come next month.
 
CNN Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox is tracking the latest developments. Lauren, sounds like we're going to see another impeachment inquiry.
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has gone to great lengths publicly to make it clear he has not announced an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden just yet. But he has walked right up to that line a number of times. And behind closed doors, a number of Republicans are telling CNN that they expect this is inevitable. One Republican saying. "Once the barn doors are open, so to speak, the horses are out."
 
Here's the challenge though, for Republican leaders over the course of the next several weeks. They have to convince a number of their members who won in districts that Biden won back in 2020 that this is a smart electoral move for them. Because usually, when you open an impeachment inquiry, you have a vote on the House floor into that matter. And the House Republicans have just a narrow majority, which means McCarthy is going to have to convince his members to get behind this push.
 
One of those members who won in Biden's district back in 2020, Don Bacon, had this to say. "Did the president committed high crimes and misdemeanors? The committees need to do more digging to clarify this. There's tons of smoke, but let's verify what's beneath it all."
 
Now, many House Republicans who support this effort say opening an impeachment inquiry gives you more tools to get documents, to get witnesses, to get information, where they will try to directly tie President Joe Biden to his son Hunter Biden's business dealings abroad. So far, both investigations in the Oversight and Judiciary Committees have not been able to find that direct link, but their argument is an impeachment inquiry gives you more power to do that. Whether or not that is a convincing argument for some of those more moderate members, that remains to be seen, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: That is the key. How many moderate members specifically are we talking about here who are considered swing votes on this among Republicans?
 
FOX: Well, the number of swing votes varies, but there are 18 House Republicans who won in districts that Biden won back in 2020. So, that just gives you a sense of how many members might be really thinking through this decision of whether or not they want to vote for that impeachment inquiry to be opened up, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: We'll be watching. We know you will. Lauren Fox, on the Hill, thanks so much. Brianna.
 
KEILAR: And still to come. A special election in Ohio has put the abortion rights debate front and center even though it's not on the ballot. We'll have details from Columbus. Next.
