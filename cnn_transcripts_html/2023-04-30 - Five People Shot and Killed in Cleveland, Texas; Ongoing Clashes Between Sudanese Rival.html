BRUNHUBER: Why New York Mayor Eric Adams is taking on a federal agency about money it's giving out to other cities while it all has to do with the migrant crisis and an explosive start to the NBA playoff semifinal series. CNN's Coy Wire joins me live to break down the highlights of Saturday's game. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber. 
 
BRUNHUBER: A manhunt is underway in Texas after a man allegedly opened fire on his neighbor's killing five people including an eight-year-old child. Police say the shooting occurred after a family asked the man next door 38 eight-year-old Francisco Oropeza to stop firing a rifle in his front yard because their baby was trying to sleep. 
 
This latest mass shooting happened in town of Cleveland, Texas. The five victims were all from Honduras and some had just recently arrived at the home from Houston. The Honduran Foreign Minister is demanding that the full weight of the law be applied to those responsible for the crime. Police described a horrific crime scene.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GREG CAPERS, SAN JACINTO CO. TEXAS SHERIFF: When they got here, well, they found four people deceased inside of the residence. And there was an eight-year-old that had been shot. Everybody that was shot was shot from the neck up, almost execution style and basically in the head. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Authorities are urging caution since Oropeza is still at large. CNN's Ryan Young has more on the shooting.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The all-out manhunt continues in Texas. This city is about 45 miles outside of Houston, Texas. Police in the FBI are looking for Francisco Oropeza. He's the man that sheriff's deputies say neighbors asked to stop shooting his gun from his front porch because they had a young child. They wanted to be able to go to sleep. And according to the sheriff's deputies, he then walked over at some point shooting and killing five people in a home including an eight-year-old, all execution style, all shooting them above the neck and shoulders. And so right now deputies are hoping to find this man. They were tracking device at some point. But that device has been found. The man has not -- listen to the FBI about this search. 
 
JAMES SMITH, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, HOUSTON FIELD OFFICE: We considered armed and dangerous. And we're not going to stop until we actually arrest him and put him into custody. But he is out there and he's a threat to the community. So I don't want anyone to think that -- that that's something different than that. He is a threat to the community. And we need the community's help to hopefully locate him soon and take them off the streets tonight. 
 
YOUNG: Your special agent James Smith was telling anyone who would listen that they believe this man could still be armed and could still be dangerous. Obviously, as he knows he's on the run after shooting and killing these five people. Two of the women who were found dead inside his home are found covering two smaller children who were not harmed in the shooting. But obviously they were 10 people in their home could imagine the emotional impact of his entire community tries to figure out exactly what goes on. But when you put this picture up on the screen, that should help sheriff's deputies and the FBI give some more tips, some more calls in hopes of catching this man. Ryan Young, CNN, Atlanta, Georgia.

BRUNHUBER: Well, as you just heard, the suspect is still at large and police believe he fled into a wooded area CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey explains how authorities will likely approaches capture.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: They have to be very careful as they go through there. They'll be using dogs. They'll be using helicopters equipped with flares, which is a heat seeking type of instrument to look for body heat to determine whether or not he is in that particular area. 
 
So they'll be using a lot of technology to try to pinpoint him but it's going to boil down to them actually combing through those woods, which is dangerous. There's no question his intent was to kill. I mean if all the shots were either headshots or to the neck with an AR-15 I mean, you know, the damage inflicted from that type of weapon to your body is just absolutely incredible. And so his intent was to kill there's no question that shows a great deal of rage. There were 10 people my understanding in that house why he didn't kill all 10. I don't know he probably could have. But he did kill 5. 
 <br>[05:05:10]
 
Thank God, he didn't get the rest of them. And those two kids that were shielded by their mother or other women in the house are certainly very, very fortunate. But I mean, look at the trauma that everyone involved in that is -- has to go through now. But this is just absolutely incredible. But it's just one more example of the senseless violence taking place in our country. And it makes no sense at all. And nothing's going to be done to really put a curt to it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Oh, yeah, yet another mass shooting in the U.S. according to the gun violence archive, there have been at least 174 mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year. 
 
Despite a true struck by both sides, a third week of fighting has begun in Sudan between the country's army and the paramilitary Rapid Defense Force. Witnesses tell CNN that gunfire can be heard near the Presidential Palace in central Khartoum early Sunday. And this comes after heavy fighting Saturday in and around the Capitol with airstrikes and heavy artillery in use. More than 10,000 Sudanese families have left Khartoum for small towns to the north. Locals have organized food, housing, medical care for them. 
 
In the meantime, a convoy of American evacuees organized by the U.S. government reached Port Sudan on Saturday after an overland journey from Khartoum, CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann has details on the journey and what's next for the evacuated Americans.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: This convoy for private American citizens out of Sudan comes with growing pressure on the administration and on the State Department to do more. Some of those American citizens in Sudan who have spoken with CNN have described a feeling of frustration and anger at what they see as a lack of action from the administration to get them out. And that's compounded by the fact that we've seen so many other countries go into Sudan and either into Khartoum or near Khartoum to get out their citizens and some American citizens. 
 
It was last weekend that we saw the U.S. send in military helicopters to get out U.S. embassy staff, family members, and some other nationals. But since then, the administration has maintained that it's simply too dangerous to go in, and the situation isn't stable enough. 
 
Now we see the U.S. arranging this convoy. It's not run by military personnel, and there's no U.S. military going in, but it is contracted through the Defense Department with overhead surveillance from DoD and run through the State Department. 
 
State won't say how many people were on this convoy. But they do say that over this convoy, other countries convoys and other military aircraft, hundreds of U.S. citizens have evacuated the country. So they were taken from Khartoum to Port Sudan, hundreds of miles, there are U.S. Navy ships in Port Sudan. And then those American citizens were taken to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, where they'll get assistance continuing on their way.
 
The process played out over several days. On Thursday, those American citizens in Sudan who were looking to leave and were in touch with the embassy and had valid travel documents were told to essentially be ready. On Friday, they got the heads up, have some food ready, some water and one travel bag. And that's when the convoy left later, to try to get all of these -- some of these American citizens out. 
 
There are of course thousands of other American citizens in Sudan. It's unclear how many of them want to leave at this point. But the State Department says if you are an American citizens in Sudan and are looking to get out of the country get in touch suggesting there may be more efforts like this. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.

BRUNHUBER: We have more on this. I want to bring in Senior International Correspondent David McKenzie is joining us from Johannesburg. So David while the fighting continues, foreign nationals and Sudanese are trying their best to get out?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right. And just this morning that there has been an extended ceasefire. There's been multiple reports of fighting happening in Khartoum, the Sudanese armed forces also saying that there are columns of the Rapid Support Force that paramilitary group heading from the west of the country towards the Capitol. They say they've struck several of those columns impossible to independently verify that information. 
 
Just this morning, you had South Africans arriving here in Johannesburg after a harrowing trip organized by the Department of International Relations to get out of the country. Here's one South African. What do you have to say?
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RICHARD VAN HUYSSTEEN, EVACUATED SUDANESE MINING PROJECT MANAGER FROM SOUTH AFRICA: That is paramount now is to get things back to normal. We think about the people that are still left behind. They've lost everything. They really, really a tremendous situation for the Sudanese people themselves, as expensive been looked after. And we've been brought out but they haven't.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: Many, many nations have helped their citizens go out to the thousands of people exiting Sudan either through Port Sudan, through the Egyptian border or directly from an airstrip north of the capital out of the country. 
 
Of course, those left in Sudan, as that man mentioned, are facing extremely difficult scenario. One bright spot and to show how the communities have pulled together under 100 miles north of Khartoum in the city of Shendi. 
 <br>[05:10:08]
 
We spoke to people there who are assisting thousands of families who have fled the capital towards the north. They put some intense, giving them food. They say medical assistance, and some are living with other families that shows both the level of support and the lack of international NGOs and the U.N. supporting people within the country at this stage. Here's one community organizer.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We are sheltering victims of the indiscriminate shelling and indiscriminate war in Khartoum. Residents of this city have full heartedly decided to receive all groups coming from Khartoum. Those who have connections with the city, and those who haven't, all the people of Sudan.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: Now, there are large parts of the country that haven't seen direct fighting, also the rapid support forces not in control of any one city. You've also had reports in recent days of significant violence in the west of the country, and people streaming over the border into Chad. As this drags out, Kim, you will see even more dire humanitarian situation and the questions being asked is people getting their citizens out, but what about aid flowing in? Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, so all this is happening all this fighting while there's a suppose a truce, any hope of a roadmap to peace here?
 
MCKENZIE: I think there's no roadmap at this stage. The many different nations and regional bodies have tried to pressure the two generals, General al-Burhan and General -- well-known as Hemeti of the Rapid Support Forces. A lot of that pressure has come from African nations, including Kenya, Ethiopia and others. The East Africa bloc has proposed discussions to start in South Sudan. That's something that at least tentatively the military leader of Sudan has said he would be interested in, but you're not really getting any concrete steps, let alone for a peace deal, but even just a stop of the fighting in any meaningful sense. And with those columns coming from the west of the rapid support forces to presumably bolster their fighting forces, you can only see this getting worse in the coming hours, not better. Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: All right. So appreciate the update David McKenzie in Johannesburg, thanks. 
 
Well, the World Health Organization warned of a huge biological risk after a laboratory that contained pathogen samples was seized by Sudanese paramilitary forces on Tuesday, samples of measles COVID-19, tuberculosis, cholera and polio were kept at the site of WHO Director said the people occupying a lab are most at risk of exposure to these pathogens.  I'm going to ask epidemiologist, how concerned we should be that harmful pathogens might have escaped this lab? Here she is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. ANNE RIMOIN, PROFESSOR, DEPT. OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, UCLA: These are diseases that are common in Sudan. So in the region. So I think that the real concern here is that, you know, we may see these soldiers that are taken over the laboratory, they may become inadvertently exposed to some of these pathogens. They may also become exposed to, you know, their chemicals in the laboratory. There's also a lot of gas and helium in certain parts of those labs. And so if firearms are going off, you know, that can create a potential explosion.
 
I think the other thing is, is you're going to lose any banked samples that they have with cuts to the electricity, with people not handling these samples appropriately. I think that that's one of the real concerns is they're going to lose all of the samples that may be useful for research in the short and the long term, as well as all of the materials that are in there that are temperature sensitive.
 
I it's going to be really important to be able to resecure that laboratory as soon as possible to be able to make sure that the -- that there are access to diagnostics to be able to understand what's happening in the country. Also to protect the samples. It also apparently the blood supplies is linked to this laboratory as well. And so I think that that's going to be critically important. 
 
You know, this brings up to me the issue of biosecurity in the context of an emergency, and in conflict. And I think that we're going to have to really reexamine how we manage biosecurity and if peacekeeping missions, we'll be able to also have bio containment associated with them.

BRUNHUBER: More than 35 million people are at risk for severe storms, damaging winds, hail and tornadoes today. A Tornado Watch was just posted for much of the Florida peninsula until 2 o'clock this afternoon. Heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms are possible up and down the East Coast Florida and the Mid-Atlantic states are in the crosshairs. 
 <br>[05:15:11]
 
And that sounds like a broken record while you're right Saturday was the third day in a row of severe storms in Florida. And the National Weather Service says a survey of the damage is underway after a tornado touchdown in Palm Beach Gardens Florida on Saturday. The twister flipped over cars and knocked down trees and powerlines and left debris scattered. Police say some roads were blocked for time. Fortunately, there are no reports of injuries. 
 
And Texas has seen its share of severe weather as well, have a look. Gusty winds and hail spread across parts of the state Friday and early Saturday along with heavy rains and dangerous lightning. Some 40,000 homes and businesses are still without power according to poweroutage.us mostly in the southern part of the state. 
 
All right still to come, U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he hasn't heard a peep from the White House on the Republicans debt ceiling bill. We'll explain why the two sides aren't talking. 
 
Plus, President Biden somber message as Washington's political and media leads gather for the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. We details ahead. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: San Francisco based First Republic bank is facing a financial earthquake, but federal regulators are hoping to resolve it before markets open Monday. The bank stock has fallen 97% Since March 1, it fell to as low as $3 a share on Friday after the bank revealed depositors withdrew $100 billion during the first quarter. Some of the nation's largest banks tried to throw First Republic a $30 billion lifeline. Now report say JP Morgan Chase and PNC Financial are in the process of bidding to buy First Republic. University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers says a deal could benefit both parties.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTIN WOLFERS, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: A real problem that arises for a very small number of banks, Silicon Valley Bank was among them. And of course, First Republic was as well. These are banks where they're mostly catering to very wealthy depositors. Deposit insurance only covers the first $250,000 of your deposit. So these are banks that aren't covered by our usual deposit insurance. And that means if people get a little bit nervous, they start to pull money out. And that means that they can be caught without enough cash in the vault. And that's really their problem. It's not that this is a completely unprofitable bank. It's not that it doesn't have assets that it doesn't have enough cash in the vault. And one of the best ways of resolving that, the worst way would be a bank run. The best way would be if another bank just came and took it over and said, hey, we got an even bigger volt. Plus we like owning profitable businesses.

BRUNHUBER: U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he hasn't heard a peep from the White House since the Republican controlled House passed its debt ceiling bill last week. The clock is ticking on Congress and the President to raise America's boring limit and avoid a financial catastrophe. The House bill includes deep cuts to Biden's agenda and it has almost no chance of passing the Senate or getting the President's approval. But while McCarthy says he won't cut a deal, he and a few Democrats still think Biden needs to talk to him. CNN Alayna Treene has details from Washington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: This is a very consequential week for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and a huge test of his leadership capabilities. McCarthy has teed up a vote on his bill to raise the debt ceiling this week. Now, this vote will not be easy, especially given Republicans slim majority in the House and the divisions within the party. Kevin McCarthy talked about this on Sunday. Here's what he had to say.
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: We do have a very small majority, only five seats, one of the smallest we've ever had. But I cannot imagine someone in our conference that would want to go along with Biden's reckless spending. We will hold the vote this week and we will pass it on we will send it to the Senate.
 
TREENE: Now despite McCarthy's confidence, the key question is whether he can convince enough conservatives to get on board with this plan. As of now, many conservatives like Congressman Andy Biggs tell us that they're just not there yet. 
 
As for the White House, they're insisting they will simply reject this measure outright. But going into next week, the President is facing pressure from some Democrats who think negotiations with Congress need to begin immediately. 
 
And now to just quickly break down what's actually in this 320-page bill, it includes a series of cuts to domestic spending, including a plan to block Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Program and rescind new funding for the Internal Revenue Service. 
 
But the bottom line to focus on here is that Congress is running out of time. Current estimates put the deadline for when a deal must be reached at some point this summer and that has many members on both sides of the aisle on edge. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington.

BRUNHUBER: And U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy traveled to Israel this weekend to mark the 75th Anniversary of Israel becoming an independent state. McCarthy is scheduled to address Israel's parliament, the Knesset. He's only the second House Speaker in history to do so. But McCarthy's visit comes amid a deep political and social divide in Israel. Take a look (ph).
 
Anger and other emotions boiling over in Tel Aviv Saturday, the 17th week of protests against the government's plan to overhaul the judicial system. Tens of thousands once again protested legislation they say poses a threat to democracy and will weaken the Supreme Court. It comes two days ahead of the start of the summer session for the country's parliament, the Knesset on Monday. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters say the judicial overhaul is necessary to check activist judges. 
 
President Biden use the annual White House Correspondents Dinner to call for the release of Americans held abroad. He acknowledged the family of Wall Street Journal Reporter Evan Gershkovitch, whom the U.S. says is wrongfully held in Russia on espionage charges. Another American reporter Austin Tice is imprisoned in Syria. Here's the President.

JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: Tonight, our message is this, journalism is not a crime. Evan and Austin should be released immediately along with every other American held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad.

BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom. 
 
A massive blaze allegedly caused by Ukrainian drone strike in occupied Crimea is now under control. Pro-Russian officials say the fire burned for fuel tanks to the storage facility in Sebastopol and they're pointing at a drone strike as the possible cause. 
 
Meanwhile, emergency crews are no longer looking for survivors after a Russian missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Uman. President Zelenskyy is making it clear our Ukrainian counter offensive isn't a question of if but when. Some military analysts are warning they'll face a tough fight ahead. Salma Abdelaziz joins us from London with more.
 <br>[05:30:04]
 
So Salma before we get to that counter-offensive I just want to start with a new attack in northeastern Ukraine. What more are we learning?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we just got information just a short time ago, Kim, about an attack on Kupiansk by Russian multiple launch rocket system. So rocket artillery rather striking the center of Kupiansk. This is just north of Kharkiv. So an area very much along those front lines very much a flank -- a flashpoint rather.
 
Ukrainian officials saying that a home garish, some cars were struck and that a fire broke out. But fortunately, there were no casualties. And this comes just one day of course, after that horrifying strike on an apartment block in Uman in central Ukraine, the deadliest attack on civilians seen in months, some 20 -- over 20 people rather killed in that early morning attack happened about 4 a.m. local time. 
 
So you can imagine families were of course sleeping. Children were sleeping. And of course, among the dead are several children. Ukraine saying yet again, this shows that Russia is intentionally targeting civilians. And President Zelenskyy has vowed to respond.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Let's be honest. First, there will be a counter offensive. We are preparing for it, it will happen. I really believe that it will be successful, and we will be able to de-occupy our territories. I am not ready to say in detail when it will happen and how. But I will say yes, many things depend on us. But there are many nuances in the supply of certain weapons.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ: Apologies there, Kim, it seems that we rolled the wrong quote, but you hear their President Zelenskyy speaking about the counter offensive and that was the second point I was going to bring to you. You see Ukraine very much almost fighting a two front war here. You have civilians being attacked in areas that are far, far from the front lines. Meanwhile, Ukraine is preparing for a push to reclaim Ukrainian lands along that Eastern front. 
 
We were earlier describing this as a spring offensive. But as we head into the summer months, there are serious questions being asked as to when this counter offensive would take place. There's been months of preparations. NATO has been pouring weapons in. There has been this lightning speed training process to get Ukrainian troops trained up on those NATO weapons, tanks have been coming in, as well. NATO saying that 98% of the defensive vehicles promised have made their way to Ukraine. 
 
But it's not enough just yet. As you heard there from President Zelenskyy. There are major challenges just as Ukraine has been preparing for this counter offensive, so has Russia. We have satellite images to show you of what that looks like, particularly in the south where this counter offensive is expected to begin Russia building up its defensive, building up anti-tank obstacles, minefields, pouring in troops, creating trenches for this troops.
 
Look, regardless of Ukraine's ingenuity, its motivation which has been -- which has been praised time and time. Again, during this conflict, they're absolutely facing at least quantitatively a much larger Russian military, one that has the air superiority. So there are still huge obstacles here before this counter offensive begins. Kim?
 
BRUNHUBER: An uphill battle for certain. Salma Abdelaziz in London, thanks so much. 
 
Ukrainian refugees are among those whom Pope Francis is bringing a message of hope while in Hungary this weekend. This was the scene in the capital Budapest moments ago as the pontiff concluded an open-air mass. Earlier it was a relatively more personal setting. Some 600 refugees, poor and homeless people gathered with Pope Francis inside a church with another 1000 in the square outside. 
 
The Pope heard one refugee story of fleeing to be pro with his family a year ago, saying he made a new home in Hungary because of the war. The country has angered allies since the war in Ukraine began refusing to back military aid for Kyiv while maintaining relations with Russia's Vladimir Putin. 
 
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry delivered notes of protest to polish and E.U. representatives in Kyiv objecting the bans on importing Ukrainian grain. Several European countries have already banned grains and other food products from Ukraine. The bans were implemented after a surge of cheap goods entered their markets. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry seeks what it calls a balanced solution based on E.U. legislation that says that would count for the Russian war effort and strengthen the E.U. single market which Ukraine hopes to join. 
 
The president of the Czech Republic sent a blunt message to Moscow during his visit to Ukraine on a Ukrainian military vehicle in the City of Dnipro. He wrote Russia on go home. In a follow up tweet he said Ukrainians will avenge the people they lost and regain their freedom. 
 
On Saturday, President Petr Pavel also met with Ukrainians who lost their homes in the fighting and pledged to send more aid. Pavel also promised to make a new push for Ukraine's membership in the E.U.

All right still to come, U.S. official brace for a surge in migration at the southern border as COVID era restrictions are set to be lifted. We'll get why New York City is asking for help to cope with the crisis, that's coming up. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
BRUNHUBER: American officials are bracing for a surge in migration of the U.S.-Mexico border. It comes as the federal government gets ready to lift pandemic era health restrictions on U.S. entry. That means border authorities will no longer be able to quickly expel certain migrants. 
 
Meanwhile, New York Mayor Eric Adams wants the federal government to stop sending emergency relief money to cities whose leaders are busing migrants to his state. CNN's Polo Sandoval reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Officials here in New York City are preparing for the realities that may come in a post-Title 42 world that is the public health authority that's been in place since the pandemic that's restricting the ability for some migrants to actually cross into the United States, says it is set to expire in mid-May. 
 
The concern amongst city officials is the average daily rate of asylum seekers arriving here in New York about 200 is likely to potentially increase as we begin to see many of those migrants finally crossing into the U.S. And with that, concerns of that increasing price tag over the last year, city official saying that the migrant crisis here in New York City has already cost them at least $817 million in order to care for and house for these migrants. 
 
The projections are that this -- that number could potentially reach 1.4 billion by the end of June. And that is why what we've heard since last year's New York City Mayor Eric Adams really calling on his fellow Democrat in the White House to do more to assist New York City in managing the situation. He is calling for any potential executive action on behalf of President Joe Biden to expedite the application process for many of these asylum seekers that time and time again have shared with us that they simply want to work legally in order to pay their way into housing versus relying on the strained homeless shelter system here in New York City. 
 <br>[05:40:20]
 
But the mayor also calling for more government workers to be able to expedite those applications. CNN has reached out to the White House for further comment, as we continue to monitor the potential increase in asylum seeker arrivals here in New York City. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.

BRUNHUBER: And for more on this, I'm joined by two frontline workers Jamie Powlovich, Executive Director of the Coalition for Homeless Youth and Power Malu, Executive Director of Artists, Athletes, Activists.
 
Thank you so much both for joining us. I mean, we really, you know, we're following the story last year, it was all these buses, you know, basically dumped all these migrants from states like Texas, into cities like New York where you are, but then as the media deal, we've sort of moved on to other issues. So Power, I'll start with you, give us an update on what happened to all of these migrants. Did most of them stay there in New York? POWER MALU, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ARTISTS, ATHLETES, ACTIVISTS: So a lot of the migrants that have come in are in New York and in other parts of the country. Basically, what we do when the migrants come in, is we triage them, we support them or critical services. And the most important thing is reuniting the family. So the family is here, we connect them with family here, or what we were doing is connecting with grassroots organizations and other states, and trying to get the migrants to head out to other states where family members and friends are so that they can reconnect with their family members of their.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, just staying with you, I mean, being undocumented and in a strange country, if you don't have family, especially -- and especially for those unaccompanied minors, there were many of them coming to New York. What kind of challenges are they facing now?
 
MALU: So we're facing a lot of challenges with unaccompanied minors. And of course, Jamie can attest to that, and speak a little bit of on that. But what we're doing is we're making sure that we don't leave them stranded and abandoned. Just everyone that comes in to New York City, we welcome them with love and dignity. 
 
And we try to let them know that they are welcomed here in New York. They are welcomed here in this country. Frankly, no one really wants to leave their country, if there's things that are going on, that forced them to leave, we want to make sure that they feel that they are welcome here, and they have the opportunity to seek asylum. 
 
And that is our duty as New Yorkers, that is our duty, as people that really care. And we want to spread that love and dignity and understanding to the rest of Americans and to the rest of the world to let them know that we shouldn't be treating them as if they're outcasts, or rather open arms, welcoming them and listening to their stories, because all of them come in with stories, and we should be a listening ear and a lending hand.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, I mean, you know, love is great. But of course, you know, in order to support them, you need money. And, Jamie, I'll turn to you. You know, how much support have you got from the city? Are you getting what you need?
 
JAMIE POWLOVICH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COALITION FOR HOMELESS YOUTH: Um, good morning. No, I mean, we're not -- we don't take government funding. And so support is not something that we're looking for. But I do think for groups like Power's group that are on the front lines when the buses are coming in, or the planes are coming in, right, and the migrants are first entering New York City support is very much needed. 
 
But I think, in addition to the call for support for the grassroot -- grassroots groups that are on the ground doing this work, I think that what we also need is coordination. I think that for New York City, at least what we're seeing, right is that it's been very much a narrative perpetuated of governments doing all the work and the grassroots organizations are getting in the way, when that's just not true. 
 
And so I think in addition to funding, right, we need government to work with the nonprofit organizations and the grassroots activists on the ground, that are welcoming the migrants into the city to make sure that once they're here, that services are comprehensive, and that they're targeting their unique needs.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. But I mean in -- you know, less than two weeks, those COVID restrictions will lifted as we were just reporting, which may allow a new influx of migrants and you can imagine, there might be, you know, more buses headed your way. So Jamie, how ready are you if you have to deal with a huge number of people coming in?
 
POWLOVICH: So, we're not ready, right? And I just want to be real about that. And I think similar to what I was saying earlier, I think that that's because although you know, New York City is definitely facing an unprecedented number of new New Yorkers coming into the city and that's definitely not lost on that -- on us. The fact that they've done nothing regarding coordination specific for a -- specifically for youth and unaccompanied minors has made this somewhat of a crisis, right?
 <br>[05:45:09]
 
We have no policies in place in New York City, specifically addressing the needs of unaccompanied migrants in youth. There's no coordination with our runaway and homeless youth shelter system, which is separate from the adult shelter system that I think gets talked about more often. And so with the influx that we've already seen to date, right, the system, all their calls for support and coordination have gone unanswered. And so the reality that the numbers are only going to be increasing, I think, is causing a bit of anxiety around what is going to happen, given the fact that the support hasn't been there, even thus far.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, and you know, complicating all this, as we were just, you know, talking about, I mean, a lot of these folks are -- are unfortunately, prisoners of national narrative power by now, they must be aware of the political stakes involved in their busing by Republican governors to these blue cities. I mean, how do they feel being essentially pawns in this political theater?
 
MALU: Yeah, it's quite sad, because not only actions like that, but also words that have been said, I mean, they listen, they have a big community that spreads the word. And it's -- the worst thing is for you to feel unwelcomed in a place where you feel alone, and you feel targeted, and you feel blamed for situations that are going on. 
 
Frankly, they helped us shine a light on a system that has already been in shambles. And I tell them that when they get off the bus. I tell them that when it comes in planes, one thing that people don't realize is that there has been a consistent flow of migrants coming in via the airports.
 
Artists, Athletes, Activists are in all ports of entry. And we pick up migrants from the airports, so that they're not stranded on the streets of New York, and we try to get them to shelter safely. We try to get them all the critical resources that they need. And we want to make sure that they feel welcome. A lot of times when they hear things on the television, or they hear
 
 people talking about it, inside the shelter system or on the street, they get bad looks. They get blamed, and they feel alone. And the mental health part of it is very important. We've been trying to pair them with mental health therapists, because people say, oh, they got it good. They're in hotels. They're in shelters, they should be happy to get three meals. But what they don't realize is that these people are not here to sit in a room where they can't get out. They can't -- they don't have funds to pay for metro cards to get around the city. A lot of them are getting tickets because they're having to train to get to appointments to try to find work. They don't know how to navigate the system and the system wasn't built for them. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah.
 
MALU: So we do our best to try to help them survive.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, there's so much need out there and just want to thank you both for the tremendous, tremendous work, both your organizations are doing. Jamie Powlovich and Power Malu, thank you both, I appreciate it. 
 
POWLOVICH: Thank you. 
 
MALU: Thank you.
 
BRUNHUBER: Meanwhile, Haitian migrants arriving in Boston had been sleeping overnight in one of the city's major hospitals. About 55 people mostly from Haiti spent Wednesday night in the lobby of the Boston Medical Center. Hospital spokesperson says this dramatic increase in the number of migrants arriving in recent weeks has stretched resources. So far this year, the center is sheltered more than 400 families mostly from Haiti for overnight stays. 
 
All right, still ahead the Denver Nuggets were red hot in last night's game against the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Playoffs. CNN Sports Coy Wire will be here with the highlights. Stay with us. Well, there he is, just right on cue. How are you doing?
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Good. How are you?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:52:42]
 
BRUNHUBER: What a blockbuster game last night with the NBA Playoffs. The Denver Nuggets beat the Phoenix Suns in game one of the NBA Western Conference semifinals. So with me now CNN Sports, Coy Wire. So, Coy, you know. so many stars around but it was really Denver's that shine the brightest, right?
 
WIRE: Yes build us out, this game between two of the best players really, that we've ever seen in the NBA. You have Kevin Durant besides of Nikola Jokic for the Nuggets and they went toe to toe from the get go in this one. Durant, DN joker watching block his shot but joker there, he doesn't give up. He gets his own rebounds, if you will. And gets the hoop and the foul, the second effort. Jokic had a 24 points, Durant had 29 but story and this was Jamal Murray looking them in the four, slipping and sliding past the defenders for the lay in. 
 
Durant was asked afterwards if he was surprised how well the Nuggets played. He said beep, no. They're the number one seed through a Krista Reuter (ph) too in there. Murray had 6, 3-pointers on the night, 34 points on Nuggets, cruise 125-107 Game 2 Monday night. Sunday slate starts at 1:00 Eastern with the heat and knicks opening their series. Then Steph Curry in the Warriors had to Sacramento to face the Kings in what could be a Game 7 for the ages. 
 
Now, let's talk hockey. Toronto fans buzzing this morning. The Maple Leafs playoff drought is finally over. John Tavares spins, shoots and scores the game winner. This is in overtime. Of course their bench goes crazy. But how about the fans Toronto winning a playoff series for the first time in 19 years. They had lost 11 straight elimination games before Tavares' game winner, the lightning heading home after three straight Stanley Cup Final appearances.
 
Another Canadian team, the Oilers into the second round taken down the Kings and it was the shortest guy on the ice score and the biggest goal of the night, 5-foot-8 Kailer Yamamoto putting it in with just over three minutes ago given them it's in the 5-4. Yamamoto lived in L.A. for three years, played youth hockey for the Junior Kings and now here he was sending the Kings home for this summer. 
 
And what can be better than a Game 7? How about two of them. The Boston Bruins had the best regular season in history. But they find themselves in an elimination game with the Panthers that followed by the defending champion Avalanche trying to keep their repeat hopes alive against the Kraken.

WIRE: I don't know about you, Kim, got a little teared up on, that was so much emotion in that room. Everyone is going to remember that for the rest of their lives were part of that. Chris said that his dad's -- his son Deuce Vaughn, he's just 5-foot-5, 175 pounds but he's the hardest worker he's ever met, just happen to be his dad.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, so much hard so you can tell they were just trying to play it cool there but -- 
 
WIRE: That's right.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, like they couldn't hide it. Listen, but before we go, I just want to share you -- share something with you here. Jack is back. Oscar winning actor and Los Angeles Lakers superfan Jack Nicholson returned to his courtside seat for Game 6 of the Lakers- Grizzlies playoff series On Friday. You chatted with Lakers superstar LeBron James for a few minutes and according to ESPN, it was the 86- year-old actor's first time back in his regular spots since last season's opening game.
