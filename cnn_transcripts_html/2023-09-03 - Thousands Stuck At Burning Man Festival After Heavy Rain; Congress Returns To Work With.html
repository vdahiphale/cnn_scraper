RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN HOST: Hello. And thanks for joining me. I'm Rahel Solomon, in today for Fredricka Whitfield. 
 
We begin with tens of thousands of people stranded in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. That's after two to three months' worth of rain fell in just 24 hours swamping camp sites at the popular "Burning Man" Festival. 
 
Take a look at this video. Thick, ankle-deep mud making it impossible to drive and even walk in some cases. 
 
Attendees have been told to shelter in place and try to conserve food, water and fuel. Officials were forced to close the gate stopping anyone from coming in or going out with the exception of emergency vehicles. 
 
though some festival goers have trekked on foot to reach main roads. And that includes comedian Chris Rock and D.J. Diplo who described on social media hiking four miles before they were able to hitch a ride from a fan. 
 
Gillian Bergeron joins me now. He also managed to leave Burning Man. She's now back in Charleston, South Carolina. Gillian, good to see you with a smile on your face. How did you get out? 
 
GILLIAN BERGERON, BURNING MAN ATTENDEE: It was kind of a crazy thing. But I hitched a ride with an ATV that was heading out that needed to get somebody more important than me out to the front area. They were willing to let me sit in the back and so got a ride out to the main road. 
 
And then when I got out there, I immediately found a guy who was towing a vehicle that had gotten in some type of accident and asked him if I could hop into the crashed vehicle on his trailer and catch a ride to wherever he was going. 
 
And he got me to Fernley, Nevada, and then from Fernley, I grabbed an uber to Reno and I headed to the airport. 
 
SOLOMON: So how long was that entire ordeal, getting out of Burning Man to ultimately getting to the airport at reno? 
 
BERGERON: To be honest, it wasn't that bad. I mean it was a few hours. It was probably like maybe a total of four hours or so. 
 
So all in all, pretty painless compared to what I think a lot of other people have had to go through. 
 
SOLOMON: You told us this was your eighth time at Burning Man, clearly you enjoy the experience. What were you thinking when the rain came down and you're look at the sand that looks like clay and mud? I mean what was going through your mind? 
 
BERGERON: Mostly just I was feeling sad for a lot of the artists and the folks that have put so much work, the staff, you know, the people that have put so much work into putting this really fantastic special event on. 
 
Just that a lot of them, you know, weren't going to be able to follow through on their plans or things were going to get moved around. 
 
And then I was, of course, feeling for folks that were in a tough spot. You know, there were people that missed flights. There are folks out there that may only have like, you know, so much medication to get through the time they're there or they're older and have maybe some type of disability that they can't get around as easily.
 
So -- but, you know, for the rest of the folks that were there, I mean, you know, you're signing up to go out to the desert for a week, and you need to know some crazy things are going to happen. 
 
So yes, it was kind of a crazy adventure. But yes, I was mostly bummed out for the folks that I knew had put a lot of work into stuff that they might not be able to follow through on. 
 
SOLOMON: Yes. So much work. But what was morale generally like? I mean from what you could tell, were other people panicked? Were they calm, or was there sort of, you know, we're out here, we'll make the most of the moment? 
 
I mean I've been seeing different things on social media. What was morale like? 
 
BERGERON: I think it kind of depends on who you ask. I'll say most of the seasoned folks that have been out there, you know, a number of times had really positive attitudes. I mean we all know we're signing up for something that anything can happen. 
 
I've been out there during a hail storm. I've been out there during rain. I've been out there when it was like too hot to function. And so, it was -- I really -- you know, I felt like overall it was pretty manageable. 
 
But there were certainly some people that were, you know, absolutely beside themself and that were asking if their tickets could be reimbursed or if they get tickets for next year. 
 
They were missing flights which I know was obviously super inconvenient and frustrating for people. But it kind of just depended I think on their level of experience out there, and their level of comfort out there and then potentially wherever they had to be, you know, come Monday or Tuesday morning. 
 
And so it really varied. But most of the folks I know out there that go out somewhat regularly, they certainly made the best of it. Everybody was being really wonderful. 
 
It's a great community. People were helping each other, offering food and water and shelter to those who needed it. And if anything, I think it probably made the core community a lot stronger. So, yes, just kind of depends on who you ask. 
 <br>[14:04:57]
 
SOLOMON: We know that more rain is in the forecast today which is not what that region needs at all, at least for the folks that are there.
 
Did festival organizers give you or anyone who's still there that you've been able to talk to, any indication as to when people will be able to drive out of there, get out of there? I mean what's the timeline as far as you know?
 
BERGERON: You know, We're all at the mercy of Mother Nature with this one and the playa, as we call it out there. And so they can tell us things -- they were really good about not wanting to set any false expectations. I was super impressed with the organization, all the staff I interacted with, everybody. 
 
They had plans. They have plans for this. It's a big, sticky situation, literally. So they're trying to be very honest with people about the reality of it. You know, if we get direct sun on that playa for a few hours, people might be able to get out of there within a day. 
 
It's just very unlikely that that's going to happen. If we continue to get rain, people might be there longer this week, midweek, end of week. I'm sure there will be a number of folks there that will be there much longer. Maybe some of the artists, certainly a lot of the staff that maybe didn't intend to be there as long. 
 
So, you know, again they're being real about what they think is going to happen, but we can't control the weather out there. So we've just kind of got to wait and see. 
 
SOLOMON: Gillian, before I let you go, I mean to keep it real with us. I mean would you go back? Do you plan to go back? 
 
BERGERON: Absolutely. Absolutely. And everyone I've talked to that been out there -- most of the people I talk to feel the same way. I don't know if I'll be back next year. Burning Man will still be there. 
 
I think probably if I don't make it back, but overall I fully intend to be back out there. It was honestly one of my favorite years I've had out there. It just ended in kind of a crazy way. 
 
SOLOMON: Yes. That's to say the least. Gillian Bergeron, we appreciate you being with us today. thank you. Glad you're back home. 
 
BERGERN: Thank you. Bye. 
 
SOLOMON: And meteorologist Allison Chinchar joins us now from the CNN Weather Center. 
 
Allison, really crazy story. We know that more rain as we said is expected there. I mean how much more rain is that Burning Man area expecting? 
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: All right. The good news is not a lot. But as we learned, it doesn't really take much more rain to really cause some problems. 
 
And yes, when we look at the radar right now, you can see there are a lot of showers and even some thunderstorms in the vicinity of northern Nevada. 
 
Now, when we zoom in a little bit closer to where that area of the festival is, it's just north of this area where you can see (INAUDIBLE). And again, you can see a lot of these showers and thunderstorms very much centered right around that area. 
 
So it is very likely that they're going to get some form of rain. The hope is it's not very heavy. They don't have the thunder and lightning to accompany it. 
 
But Even around this area, we are expecting some heavy rain. That's why you've got four of the western states they are under a flood watch in anticipation of those additional showers today. 
 
A lot of this rain is going to continue not just this afternoon, but into the evening. But as it progresses, it's going to shift eastward, away from the festival but into some other areas. And that's why you're going to continue to see that rain threat there, just a little bit farther off to the east as we go through the evening and the overnight hours. 
 
As we mentioned, again, we're not talking a tremendous amount of rain. Most of these areas likely to get less than 1 inch total. But again, Rahel, as we saw what happened, it doesn't take much, a quarter of an inch, even a half of an inch can cause significant problems for that area. 
 
So yes, it may not be much, but it could be just enough that could end up leaving some folks there a little bit longer than they have anticipated. 
 
SOLOMON: Oh, boy. We'll wait to see. Allison, I like your skirt? I like the suns. 
 
CHINCHAR: Thanks. Thank you.
 
SOLOMON: Very nice detail. Attention to detail. Allison Chinchar, thank you. 
 
All right. Still to come, members of Congress are heading back to D.C. with a lot on their plate. Among the key issues they're facing, avoiding a government shutdown and also funding FEMA. 
 
Plus, growing questions about the health and future of one of Washington's most powerful men. That's after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell froze in front of the cameras again.
 
We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:12:59]
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back. 
 
Congress is preparing to return from their August break. And lawmakers are facing several critical deadlines and a dwindling number of days to get it all done. 
 
Senators are back in D.C. on Tuesday, followed by the House next week. And President Biden has two priorities as lawmakers return to Capitol Hill. The most pressing is preventing a possible government shutdown. 
 
The Biden administration is urging lawmakers to avoid that by passing a short-term spending bill. The president also wants Congress to provide more money for FEMA to try to help communities that have been ravaged by a series of natural disasters. 
 
Let's bring in CNN White House reporter, Priscilla Alvarez. She joins us now from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. That's where the president is spending the Labor Day weekend.
 
Priscilla good to see you. So on the short term spending bill, could be a tough course. I mean what is the White House doing to try to help make that happen? 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, and it's also going to be a sprint to the finish line here with that funding ending in September when the fiscal year ends. 
 
What the White House is doing is really urging Congress to pass that short-term funding bill and at least notifying them of any technical assistance they may need. 
 
That means, for example, what they need to do to keep government services going and to keep continuity of government. And all of that is done to prevent any disruptions and also make sure that the key assistance that Americans need, that they're receiving it. 
 
For example, the women, infant and children nutrition program is among those programs that the White House is urging Congress to make sure that there are funds to make sure that there's continuity there. 
 
Now, there is a likelihood that a stopgap funding bill is passed that would go until early December. But that is mostly just buying time for members of Congress to work out some of the thorniest issues. 
 
But at least for now the White House is asking that at the very least they pass this short-term spending bill so they can at least keep continuity of government and services for Americans. 
 <br>[14:14:55]
 
SOLOMON: Priscilla, on the FEMA funding, Biden has been calling on Congress to provide billions more for FEMA to try to help communities such as those in Florida and Maui recover from natural disasters. Where does that push stand? 
 
ALVAREZ: Just now we heard from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy who said and assured reporters that the FEMA funds would be replenished. So we are starting to see indicators that that funding can come through. 
 
And it's important, Rahel, because right now FEMA is working under -- or at least putting funding toward immediate needs. So that is any sort of response that needs to happen right now and pushing off recovery. But they do both. They do response and recovery. So that is a critical part of their function and also why they need that additional funding. 
 
Initially the White House asked for $12 billion more in funding. And then just this week they asked for $4 billion in addition to that, making the whole sum $16 billion. So clearly this is a critical need. 
 
President Biden using yesterday in Florida to urge Congress to work together on this. 
 
SOLOMON: Yes, hurricane season just really ramping up. 
 
Priscilla Alvarez, live for us there in Rehoboth Beach. Priscilla, thank you. 
 
And as the Senate returns to Capitol Hill this week, all eyes will be on Mitch McConnell. There are growing questions about the health and the future of the 81-year-old GOP leader after he froze up for a second time at a news conference last week. 
 
The latest incident has some Republicans asking how long he can continue to lead. This morning Republican Senator Mike Rounds told my colleague Dana Bash that he spoke to McConnell just yesterday and is confident he can continue to lead Senate Republicans. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD): He was in good shape. He was direct. He said, you know, I had that concussion. And he said they warned me that I would be light headed in the future. And that I've got to be aware of. So it happens like he said, you just saw it happen, I'm doing it in front of reporters. 
 
DANA BASH, CNN HOST: So you're comfortable with him staying on as leader? 
 
ROUNDS: Oh, yes. No question. 
 
And look, there's a lot of folks out there that would like to see him go, but that's because he's a very capable leader. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON: With me now to talk more about McConnell is Ryland Barton. He is the managing editor of Kentucky Public Radio and Ohio Valley Resource. Ryland, thanks for joining us this afternoon. 
 
RYLAND BARTON, MANAGING EDITOR, KENTUCKY PUBLIC RADIO: Thank you. 
 
SOLOMON: A Capitol doctor, as you know -- good to have you -- has cleared McConnell to return to work. We just all heard from Senator Rounds saying that he talked to McConnell, that he is confident that he can continue leading the GOP.
 
But what about the people of Kentucky? I mean how are they responding to these freezing episodes that are being caught on camera? 
 
BARTON: Well, I think a lot of Kentuckians have been disturbed by this. It's been a strange thing to see this on our local airwaves and also national air wavs. The Senate Republican leader freezing. This person who has been in office in Kentucky, at least our U.S. Senator since 1984. 
 
You know, I think that this is the first time that really even among Republicans there's, you know, some talk, some wondering how much longer he has. 
 
This also takes place in the middle of a critical race for governor here. We have an odd year governor's races and you know, the governor's appointment power in filling that vacancy is somewhat in question, or at least how he would go about doing that. 
 
So there's a lot of talk about this. Again, just the image of seeing him freeze up twice in a little bit over a month is I think really front of mind for folks that pay attention to politics in Kentucky. 
 
SOLOMON: What do you think McConnell would need to do to assure Kentuckians that he's healthy and capable of continuing in his role. 
 
You know, I spoke with another reporter yesterday. He's been following McConnell for nearly forty years as you pointed. He said, they would like the senator to be more forthcoming. What would that look like to you? 
 
BARTON: I think what that will look like is just him performing his duties without another one of these episodes taking place. We saw this a little bit after the late July freeze where he appeared a couple weeks later at a big raucous political event in western Kentucky. It's an outdoor event, very hot. 
 
It's one of McConnell's favorite events to attend. So he showed up. I think everybody was very surprised for that to take place so soon. And I think it did kind of assuaged some of those concerns that people had. 
 
So I think for that to happen again, that's got to happen again. There's got to be some showing of him being able to handle, whether it's public appearances or just being able to continue to perform his job. 
 
SOLOMON: You know, as someone who has covered McConnell for some time now, why do you think he's choosing to continue serving as GOP leader despite all these issues? I mean he's been in this leadership role for 16 years, longer than any Senate leader I think in history. What do you think the why is? 
 <br>[14:19:51]
 
BARTON: I mean I can only imagine that it's because there's so much at stake. You know, being the -- being the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is a big deal. And he wants to make sure that there's not, you know, a big scramble and a show of division in the party at a critical point, like trying to come up with a new spending plan. 
 
Obviously as I was talking before, some of the questions over -- you know, we have a Democratic governor for most of Kentucky history, the power has resided in the governor to appoint replacements for vacancies. 
 
But the Republican-led legislature recently changed the state law requiring that replacement to be of the same party. But there's some question as to whether or not the governor would follow that and maybe even try to challenge that new law. 
 
I think that you know, just plain thinking about what his thinking might be, yes, he might not want to be throwing that into question at this point, to make that big vacancy. 
 
But you know, a lot of his -- you know, as he wrote in his biography a few years ago, he thinks a lot about the long game and what this all looks like. I think he's still trying to cement his legacy. 
 
SOLOMON: I know you said that there's some confusion about what the Democratic Governor, Andy Beshear would do. He said this week that if he -- he wouldn't say, rather, if he were to appoint a Republican to replace McConnell if he decided to step down. 
 
What's the sense of where that might go? I mean do you think it's possible that he could appoint a Democrat? I mean what's the thinking? 
 
BARTON: I think it's possible. And I think that you know, he's really avoiding trying to show his hand at all at this point. I think he doesn't want to make it political. I think he doesn't want to show this as any sort of power grab, which I think some of his political opponents would attempt to do if he were start to floating the idea of appointing a Democrat.
 
But there are election law attorneys, I think especially Democratic election law attorneys here who are kind of encouraging him or expecting him to do that. And so there's really no saying which way he's actually going to go, but, you know, because this is such a new law, he also vetoed this bill when it passed out of the legislature in 2021 suggesting that it was unconstitutional. 
 
So if there's any sort of indication as to whether or not he thinks that there might be play at this in court, he at least showed his hand at that point but that's, you know, about two years ago just after he became governor. 
 
SOLOMON: A lot more to watch. We'll certainly be watching very closely when we see the Senator back on Capitol Hill this week.
 
Ryland Barton live for us there in Louisville. Thank you, Ryland. 
 
BARTON: Thank you. 
 
SOLOMON: Coming up for us, as Russia's war on Ukraine drags on, many Ukrainians are turning to the famous sandy beaches of Odessa as a distraction from the war. We'll take you there, coming up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:26:59]
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back.
 
Two people were injured in overnight Russian attacks in the Odessa region. That's according to Ukrainian officials. 
 
The target of the attacks appeared to be infrastructure in the port area. Odessa firefighters battled fires started by those attacks. Ukraine says that 22 of 25 drones launched in the attack were destroyed. 
 
And even as Russia continues to target Odessa, some Ukrainians are now heading to its beaches for some temporary relief from the war. 
 
CNN's Christiane Amanpour has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: In the waning days of a second summer at war under the blazing Black Sea sun, you find, well, people at the beach. 
 
It's actually the first time some of this Odessa coastline has been open for business since the Russian invasion. 
 
And while Olga has brought her family for a change of scenery, there is no getting away from it. 
 
Here, can you forget the war for a little bit? 
 
OLGA (through translator): Sirens at night don't let you forget. No, we don't forget. At least I don't. but I hope my kids and parents get distracted a little bit. 
 
AMANPOUR: Still, those who can, make the most of it. Life goes on even in wartime. 
 
Here at the Caliton Beach (ph) club, it's somehow comforting to watch parents slap protective gear onto their infants as if sunburn is the worst that can happen. But of course, it's not. 
 
So is that -- does that mean orthopedics or anything? 
 
15 minutes away in the center of town is a modern private recovery and rehabilitation unit, one of ten set up around the country by a Ukrainian philanthropist. 
 
Here in a full-body sling, 41-year-old Vitali tells us that he volunteered for the front as a de-miner until he was blown up by an anti-personnel mine eight months ago in Kherson. 
 
"The first wave hit my face because I was bending down," he says. "And shrapnel entered my eye, another bit hit my finger, and three of my toes were blown off."
 
On the rehab bed next to him, 43-year-old Ruslan's injury is less dramatic. Spine and back problems from suddenly having to haul heavy gear around. 
 
Do you need to get into better shape? 
 
"If I was 20," he tells me, "it would be different. But I'm 43 and so it's difficult."\
 
He wants to go back to the front like Vitali does just as soon as they're patched up. Still motivated, still sure of victory. 
 
Then the talk suddenly turns. 
 
Vitali, what do you think you need? 
 
Immobilized and thrown, he's crystal clear. "We need more weapons and jets to close the sky from the Russian missiles," he says. "When a soldier is fighting there and his family is here unprotected, what do you think goes through our minds?"
 
AMANPOUR: Andriy (ph) tells me his psychological trauma is worst than the shrapnel to his hand because he, like all of them, want to be back at the front with their comrades to fight for their country and their family. 
 <br>[14:30:11]
 
I have a mother, a father, a wife and a cat, he tells me. 
 
Back at the seaside, Sergei (ph), a 59-year-old conscript based in Kherson, defends his beach time break. 
 
In the middle of war, you don't -- you don't feel strange? 
 
SERGEI, UKRAINIAN CONSCRIPT: Yeah, it looks like it is a bit strange, but we need some relaxing. AMANPOUR: He'll be back in arms after his 15-day furlough. But he
 
 insists their counteroffensive is going according to plan. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOLOMON: Our thanks to Christiane Amanpour there.
 
And coming up for us, after a three-year freeze, federal student loan payments will resume in October. What borrowers need to know when we come back.

 <br>[14:35:01]
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back. 
 
President Biden is vowing to help Florida communities rebuild from the devastation caused by Hurricane Idalia. He and the first lady toured areas yesterday that were hit hard by the storm. But the visit was clouded by politics after Republican Governor Ron DeSantis who is, of course, running for president skipped the meeting with Biden. The president said he was not disappointed by the snub and instead focused on recovery efforts, urging Congress to make sure there's funding to respond to this and other natural disasters. 
 
Now, natural disasters like this have caused insurance prices to soar in states like Florida. In fact, Farmers Insurance announced in July that it's pulling out of the state. 
 
CNN's Camila Bernal explains how homeowners in states like Florida and others are struggling to find affordable coverage. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Devastating fires, powerful hurricanes, and unexpected earthquakes. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Disasters are getting to be part of our normal. 
 
BERNAL: And in this new normal, home insurance is only getting pricier and harder to obtain. 
 
GABRIEL ALBARIAN JR., HOA PRESIDENT, WESTLAKE POINTE: One of the embers from local fires came in and settled on a rain gutter. 
 
BERNAL: Gabriel Albarian, Jr., the HOA president at Westlake Pointe in southern California, has lived it firsthand. It's a high risk fire zone and in 2018, four homes in this community were lost to the Woolsey Fire. He says they were all insured through the HOA until it became impossible. 
 
ALBARIAN: We went to many insurance coverage companies, State Farm, Allstate, Farmers was the one who denied us and dropped us. All of the primary insurance companies were not providing us coverage. BERNAL: In states like Florida, Louisiana, and California, some
 
 insurance providers are no longer issuing new policies. And in areas where insurance is becoming tougher to find, double digit rate increases are common. 
 
PETE MORAGA, SPOKESPERSON, INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE: You have increased costs and constructions, labor. You have what's called a cost surge where everything goes up because you have so many claims in one place. It does become difficult. 
 
BERNAL: Pete Moraga, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, says insurance companies can and will pay claims after natural disasters. The problem comes when renewing a new policy or buying a new home. 
 
MORAGA: In many cases, many of the homeowner insurers are actually losing money. 
 
BERNAL: How much was it to rebuild and how long did it take to rebuild? 
 
ALBARIAN: Yeah, curious question. $6.8 million was allotted for these four properties. And it took roughly four years. 
 
BERNAL: The community has since switched from an association insurance to an individual homeowners insurance. But it's still not easy. 
 
ABARIAN: We are seeing premiums go up, and our renewals are coming up in December. And to be quite honest, I'm quite concerned about it. 
 
BERNAL: According to the latest data from the California Department of Insurance, about 13 percent of policies were not renewed in 2021. And recent decisions by major insurance companies to drop policies in California could increase that number dramatically in 2023. 
 
ALBARIAN: The long term solution probably will take some serious rethinking of the entire insurance industry in the face of new realities. 
 
BERNAL: But in the meantime, at Westlake Pointe, they are implementing mitigation measures to make their homes more fire resistant. 
 
ALBARIAN: We're taking measures into our own hands and saying, we are making themselves more fire safe. And that to me is powerful. 
 
BERNAL: They believe they won't just protect their homes but also lower their insurance prices. 
 
ALBARIAN: We are a living example of what happened during that fire. It would be a shame for me to put a blind eye to that.

SOLOMON: Our thanks to Camila Bernal there.
 
Starting next month, federal student loan borrowers will be required to start making payments again for the first time in more than three years. That's when the pandemic-related pause will officially expire after being extended several times by both the Trump and Biden administrations since March of 2020. Interest on those loans started accruing again on Friday. 
 
Now, right now, more than 43 million people have federal student loans. That's about 13 percent of the American population. 
 
Joining me now to discuss is "Washington Post" syndicated personal finance columnist and author of "What To Do With Your Money When Crisis Hits: A Survival Guide," Michelle Singletary. 
 
Michelle, good to see you. So, you know, a lot of people -- tens of millions are going to get this bill for the first time next month after three years. And some will be getting a bill for the first time ever if they've just recently graduated from school. What's your expert advice on what to do if you are concerned or feeling anxious about this? 
 
MICHELLE SINGLETARY, AUTHOR: So, the first thing you should be doing is contacting your loan servicer. That's the company that services your loan. In fact, get onto the phone with them right away next week, find out what your payments are going to be. Make sure they have your address and all your information so they can reach out to you so that you know the options you have when those payments kick in next month. 
 
So, that's really key. 
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
Call your loan servicer so you have a plan to start paying in those loans. 
 
SOLOMON: And for some, they may see a new plan that hadn't been necessarily available the last time, the save plan. You've said recently in a column of yours that it's a game-changer. 
 
Why do you say that? And explain how the program works. 
 
SINGLETARY: Well, basically, it allows people who are not making a lot of money to, in some cases, have a zero loan payment every month. And so, that's one of the big benefits of this. And additionally, one of the reasons why people's loans have increased over the years is that they're not making -- their payment doesn't cover all their interest. So, then, the interest is tacked on to the principal of the loan and that interest is charged on that new balance. 
 
And under the save program, which is a game-changer, if you make your payments on time when you're supposed to, if all your payment doesn't cover the interest, the rest of that interest is forgiven. You don't have to pay that, so that you don't see your loan increase even though you're making payments. And for a lot of people, that's going to be huge. 
 
And so, that's why it's important to contact your loan servicer so you know whether or not you qualify for the save program. SOLOMON: Yeah, and talk to me a bit more just in terms of budgeting. I
 
 mean, if you're looking at your budget and you're like, I've got a $500 student loan payment. You're thinking about, do I make it, do I defer, do I forebear? I mean, walk me through some of the options that people should be thinking about, options people should be thinking about? 
 
SINGLETARY: So, key is those income-driven plans. And if you're not -- because you hear a lot of people saying I've got to choose between food and my loan payments. But if you're not making a lot of money, you're actually in a good position if you apply for one of those income-driven plans. 
 
But if you are -- the payment is what it is, you apply and it's still going to be a hit on your budget, you've got to look at where else you can cut. Maybe you get a roommate. You know, there are all kinds of things you have to do to make sure because what you don't want to do is default on that loan, because the government has a lot of power in trying to collect those payments. 
 
So, you got to comb through your budget. Cut as much as you can to try to make those payments. 
 
SOLOMON: And not that we're necessarily encouraging people to not make payments, but we should perhaps say that the Biden administration has sort of created now more of an on-ramp so if you do not necessarily make your payments, it won't be reported to the credit reporting agencies as soon as it have been in the past. 
 
SINGLETARY: Yeah. It's definitely a benefit from some people who maybe need a couple more months. But, you know, honestly, if you're not in a plan that doesn't forgive that interest, that loan is just going to grow over that year. And so, as much as you can, get into the practice of paying that. You know, even this month you've got one more month, see how it fits in your budget. 
 
Again, I can't emphasize this enough, to contact your loan servicer. And if you need that year, okay, go ahead and take it. But during that time period, figure out where the money is going to come from for you to make those loan payments. 
 
SOLOMON: It's important advice, Michelle. I don't know how it's going to be received, your advice to get a roommate because some people might not -- some people might not like that, but great advice nonetheless. 
 
Michelle Singletary -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SINGLETARY: I advise a lot of people, if you can. It's not -- you know, everybody can't do that. Stay at home, especially if you're already home and you're thinking, well, I want to finally get out of my parents' house. Don't if you can't afford this loan. If they will allow you to stay, stay. All three of my 20-somethings are living with us. And we don't have --
 
 they don't have any student loans. But they're saving their paycheck --  
 
SOLOMON: Yeah.
 
SINGLETARY: -- and trying to pay for rent. It works, it really does, if you can do it. 
 
SOLOMON: All right. Michelle Singletary, great advice. Good to see you. Thank you. 
 
SINGLETARY: You're welcome. 
 
SOLOMON: All right. Coming up next, how Louisiana's controversial anti-LGBTQ legislation forced one of the state's only pediatric cardiologists to leave the home he loves.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nice!
 
TIFFANY FITZGERALD, FOUNDER, BLACK GIRLS GOLF: I get so much out of golf. 
 
Look at that. I came up with Black Girls Golf really because my own experience learning to play golf. I found out pretty quickly once I entered corporate America that golf was the one thing that other people were doing that I wasn't. But once I got better, I started enjoying the game more. 
 
DR. JACQUELYN TURNER, PROFESSOR, TULANE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Many studies have shown that golf can increase your life expectancy when playing routinely. Walking 18 holes can burn up to 2,000 calories. Golfers tend to have higher HDL, which is the good cholesterol. It also increases your core muscles. You're getting a full rotation. 
 
FITZGERALD: Golf can be a huge stress reliever. We're here with friends. Most golf courses are so beautiful. And it helps calm you. 
 
TURNER: When playing golf, you release hormones that are great for your mental health. 
 <br>[14:45:05]
 
FITZGERALD: It is more about mental endurance and skill, so you can play golf for a lifetime. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There it is.

SOLOMON: Since 2021, lawmakers in more than 20 states have introduced or passed bills similar to the so-called don't say gay law in Florida. That's according to Education Week. Louisiana has its own version of the bill and now a prominent doctor there says that it's the reason that he's taking his family and leaving the state. 
 
CNN medical correspondent Meg Terrill reports from New Orleans.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TOM KLEINMAHON, LEAVING LOUISIANA: Yes, I mean, this is what we called it, our wall of love.
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When Jake and Tom Kleinmahon moved back to New Orleans, the city where they met and fell in love, they planned to raise their two kids and retire here. 
 
T. KLEINMAHON: We built this house honestly to live here forever.
 
TIRRELL: A pediatric cardiologist, Jake returned to be medical director of the pediatric heart transplant program at Ochsner Health. The only program like it in Louisiana.
 
TIRRELL: What do you love about being here?
 
DR. JAKE KLEINMAHON, PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST: I feel like I really make a difference here. And before I came, any complex patients were having to be sent out of state for heart transplants. And I felt like the kids of Louisiana deserve to stay in Louisiana.
 
TIRRELL: But now Jake and his family are leaving the state after a set of bills passed the legislature this summer that they say make them feel unwelcome.
 
J. KLEINMAHON: The part that really solidified it for us was when we were watching the Senate education committee hear the -- about the don't say gay bill.
 
DODIE HORTON (R), LOUISIANA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: HB 466 prohibits teacher-led discussions on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.
 
J. KLEINMAHON: To think that if our kids went to public school and they were made fun of because they had two dads, a teacher would not have been able to step in and make a learning experience about different types of families. TIRRELL: HB 466 and another bill, which sought to require permission from parents for school employees to use certain names or pronouns for students were vetoed by Louisiana's governor in June. And a third bill banning gender affirming medical care for most minors overcame the governor's veto and is expected to take effect in January.
 
J. KLEINMAHON: I'm really sad to leave, but I feel like I don't really have a choice. But the way that the political landscape in Louisiana is going, it's pretty clear that these laws are going to pass eventually.
 
TIRRELL: Jake's departure doesn't just mean there's one fewer specialist like him here in New Orleans. He says it leaves just two heart transplant cardiologists for kids for the whole state of Louisiana.
 
J. KLEINMAHON: There is going to be a hole that's left when I leave.
 
TIRRELL: How much is that weighing on you?
 
J. KLEINMAHON: By far, the hardest part of this decision was thinking about my patients.
 
TIRRELL: The Kleinmahons will move to Long Island, New York, where Jake will start a heart transplant program, and the whole family will start a new life.
 
J. KLEINMAHON: We teach our children about kindness, about celebrating differences, and we hope that they recognize this as us doing something so that they can live in an area where they can be free, they can be kind, they can celebrate our differences, our different type of family.

COY WIRE, CNN SPORPTS ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Rahel.
 
When Deion Sanders got to Colorado, cleaned house, 86 new players, people criticized his tactics and he said he was going to get rid of what he called baggage. He said, quote, I'm bringing my own baggage and it's Louis, as in Vuitton. 
 
And in Fort Worth, Texas, it was on. His Buffaloes playing in a high end fashion in their opener. Coach Brian brought several young men with him from Jackson State, including his own son. Record setting performance from Shedeur Sanders, 510 yards, that's a school record, four touchdowns, this against TCU, last year's runner-up for the national title. 
 
They also have one of the most exciting players in the nation, Travis Hunter, playing defense, coming up with a spectacular interception, but he plays offense, too. Eleven catches, 119 yards, he played 129 snaps in the sweltering Texas heat. That's almost two games worth. Unranked Colorado, who won just one game last season, pulls off a shocker, 45-42. 
 
DEION SANDERS, COLORADO HEAD COACH: Thank you, Jesus. And my son, man. My other son. Man, I'm loving these kids. 
 
Rick George for giving me this opportunity, man, this is a blessing.</pre>
