RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome back.
 
French President Emmanuel Macron is about to meet with mayors from across his country. Violent protests, riots, and looting have rocked their cities since police shot and killed a teenager about a week ago. A French business association says that the riots have done $1 billion in damage. Now, an uneasy calm has settled over France after days of fury.
 
CNN's Jim Bittermann joins us live from Paris. Jim, of course, it wasn't long ago that people were protesting because of the pension reforms, and now this. I mean, how has this, if at all, weakened Emmanuel Macron's power?
 
JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Rahel, France has a very strong presidential system, it should be said. But nonetheless, if President Macron wants to get things done he's got to bring the riots -- these present riots under control. And he's had a heck of a term here. He has -- he's had the yellow vests, the pension reform protests, and now the riots over the police shooting, so he's got to do something.
 <br>[05:35:16]
 
And that's part of the point of this exercise here at the presidential palace this morning. Two hundred twenty mayors have been invited here to talk to the president and tell him what their problems are and perhaps identify some solutions. And that's probably the most needed as far as he's concerned because he'd like to quiet things down and keep them quiet apart from keeping the 45,000 police on the streets.
 
And as you have mentioned, a business association her putting a lot of pressure on him because there's $1 billion in damage. There's also a figure from them which is interesting, and that is that 20 to 25 percent of the -- of the tourists who were planning to come to France have canceled their reservations. So that's a really ominous sign and a sign that people may be wary of coming to France, and that's something the French would definitely like to avoid -- Rahel. SOLOMON:  And, Jim, before I let you go -- I mean, obviously, Emmanuel Macron recently -- recently as in within the last year or so won reelection. But nonetheless -- I mean, in terms of his standing with the people there, how popular or unpopular is he these days?
 
BITTERMANN:  Well, if you look at the sort of approval rating it is -- they're running around 30 percent or so of approval. It depends on who you ask, of course. And, I mean, the left wing say that he should do something to reform the police. The right wing says that he should do something to be tougher on these rioters. 
 
So he's still got some standing with the French people but it has definitely hurt him. And we haven't seen any polls since this rioting began last week to indicate exactly where it stands now. But in any case, it's no doubt had an impact -- Rahel.
 
SOLOMON:  Jim Bittermann live for us in Paris. Jim, thank you.
 
Quick hits around the globe right now.
 
Let's start with the U.S. ambassador to Russia saying that The Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich is in, quote, "good health." They met for a second time at a Moscow prison. He has been detained since March on espionage charges. U.S. officials refute those charges. 
 
The State Department, meantime, urging Americans to reconsider traveling to China. They are citing a risk of wrongful detention. The advisory comes as U.S. Treasury Sec. Janet Yellen is set to visit Beijing later this week.
 
And a dramatic rescue from rising floodwaters in China. Firefighters using a drone to deliver a rope and some life jackets to a couple -- you see them there -- trapped on the roof of a car. Well, they were then dragged to the riverbank by a crane. Wow -- I'm glad they're OK.
 
Well, coming up on "CNN THIS MORNING" stumping in the battleground on Independence Day where some Republican presidential hopefuls are making their pitch. 
 
And one of the best tennis players in the world -- well, he may just have another talent. We'll tell you what that could be on the other side of this.

SOLOMON:  Welcome back.
 
The severe storms threatening 60 million people today will also put airlines to the test again after a bumpy start to the holiday weekend. Major carriers are looking to recover before travelers head home.
 
CNN's Pete Muntean has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION AND TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  From severe weather to record-setting crowds, July Fourth air travel is being put to the test. Friday, the Transportation Security Administration screened the most people at airports ever -- 2.88 million -- followed by 2.5 million people Saturday and again on Sunday. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There's always situations. With this one, it was like -- I would have to say it's one of the worst. It's been kind of a disaster.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over):  Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg tells CNN that delays are down after last week when United Airlines canceled more than 3,000 flights and delayed another 8,000 -- more than any U.S. carrier.
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  We're watching more severe -- potential for severe weather. That's what touched off all of these problems about a week ago. Things look like they have quickly returned to normal for the system and United also appears to have recovered. 
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over):  In a new memo, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby says he's had constructive conversations with Buttigieg and is committed to a partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration, which he initially blamed for delays. Kirby says United will also reassess its schedule at its massive hub in Newark, which even he shunned last week, admitting to and apologizing for flying on a private jet from nearby Teterboro. 
 
SCOTT KEYES, FOUNDER OF GOING.COM:  This is not the week leading up to July Fourth that the airlines were hoping for.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over):  For now, the Federal Aviation Administration is tracking even more severe weather, warning of ground stops for flights bound to more than a dozen airports on the East Coast.
 
KEYES:  But I think that your odds are a lot better of an on-time arrival this week than they were last week.
 
MUNTEAN (on camera):  The next test, when travelers begin making the return trip after the holiday. Right now, the TSA is on pace to meet its forecast of screening 17 million people at airport checkpoints nationwide through July fifth.

SOLOMON:  Wimbledon, meantime, is underway but it wasn't all strawberries and cream for a pair of American ladies in the first round.
 
Carolyn Manno has this morning's Bleacher Report. Good morning.
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning. Happy holiday. SOLOMON:  Of course.
 
MANNO:  We all love Venus Williams. We love to see --
 
SOLOMON:  Yes.
 
MANNO:  -- Venus Williams out on the court, back on the famed lawn at the All England Club for a record-breaking 24th time on Monday, but the five-time champ just wasn't able to summon that old magic. She's been dealing with injuries. 
 
And early in the first set against Elina Svitolina, she slipped on the wet grass and just crumbled to the ground. She was screaming in obvious pain and she grabbed that already-wrapped knee that has given her a lot of trouble. So it looked like that might have been the end of her day but the 43-year-old did manage to play through her injury. She eventually fell 6-4, 6-3. 
 <br>[05:45:05]
 
And after leaving the court to a standing ovation she was asked about the possibility of playing to age 50.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VENUS WILLIAMS, 5-TIME WIMBLEDON CHAMPION:  It's never been done before so if there was one to try it, it would be me. There's really great insurance benefits on the tour. I need those so I figure I might as well keep going.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MANNO:  The funny part is she really means it. I think she really loves those benefits.
 
Meantime, Coco Gauff, ranked number seven in the world, suffered her first-ever opening-round loss at Wimbledon. The 19-year-old was beaten in three sets by fellow American Sofia Kenin. 
 
But Sofia Kenin is a 2020 Australian Open champion. She's no slouch. She was ranked 128th, though -- so low that she needed to go through three qualifying rounds just to get into the main draw. The 25-year- old has never advanced past the second round at Wimbledon. 
 
And how anxious was Novak Djokovic to resume play after a nearly 90- minute rain delay? Well, the defending champion literally took matters into his own hands using his towel to dry the grass on center court. The Serbian superstar ending up breezing to victory after that. 
 
If he wins six more matches over the next two weeks he will tie Roger Federer with the men's record eight Wimbledon titles. He'll win a record-extending 24th Grand Slam singles title. But he can do it all. What can we say?
 
Turning to baseball now. The Atlanta Braves are as hot as a Fourth of July firecracker. Michael Harris, who is sitting last in the batting order, coming up huge with not one but two solo shots against the Guardians in Cleveland last night. The Braves pushed their winning streak to nine in a row with the 4-2 win. 
 
And finally, it looks like there is nothing that Eagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata can't do. The six-foot-eight, 360-pound former rugby player getting married over the weekend. But one of the best moments happened at the reception as his bride Niki danced with her dad.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JORDAN MAILATA, PHILADELPHIA EAGLES LINEMAN:  Singing "Isn't She Lovely."
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON:  Wow.
 
MANNO:  I mean, come on. 
 
SOLOMON:  We should be clear that's him singing. 
 
MANNO:  That's him. That's him. You know, he actually appeared on "THE MASKED SINGER" a couple of years ago and recorded a Christmas album with his teammates in 2022 -- more for fun, Rahel. But I think that this tenor needs to really apply himself in the off-season and put together a smooth jazz album or something like this.
 
SOLOMON:  Yes. I think we would all benefit from that. But incredible. Also, I think he was singing Shania Twain's "You're Still the One." So he has quite the range there.
 
MANNO:  He does. He has a beautiful voice.
 
SOLOMON:  Musically.
 
MANNO:  Yes. Don't necessarily quit your day job, but maybe.
 
SOLOMON:  No, especially because I'm from Philly. So definitely, don't quit your day job because we got so close --
 
MANNO:  Right.
 
SOLOMON:  -- last year --
 
MANNO:  I like that. I like that.
 
SOLOMON:  -- and we might get there this year.
 
Carolyn, great to see you. Happy Fourth. 
 
MANNO:  You, too.
 
SOLOMON:  All right. Coming up, a live look, right now, at the American flag. It's flying, of course, at the White House. But we'll tell you what you should know before you raise your flag today. That's coming up next.
 
And a sheriff's deputy thinks fast with a driver inside a burning car.
 
We'll be right back.

 <br>[05:52:28]
 
SOLOMON:  Welcome back.
 
Fireworks, food, and flags -- of course, just a few Fourth of July staples. It was June 14, 1777 when the Continental Congress made the stars and stripes the official flag of the United States. June 14 is also officially Flag Day in the U.S. There have been 27 official versions of the U.S. flag. The current 50-star version debuted on this day back in 1960.
 
But how much do you know about the rules and etiquette for displaying and handling Old Glory? That is the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article.
 
Let's bring in the author -- writer and journalist Sal Vaglica. Sal, welcome to the program. Happy Fourth.
 
So I think a lot of people know that there is a flag code but perhaps don't really know all of its content. What surprised you most about researching the flag code and reading the flag code for this article?
 
SAL VAGLICA, WRITER, JOURNALIST (via Webex by Cisco):  Hi, Rahel. Good morning.
 
I think the first thing that people struggle with and the most important thing that they struggle with is knowing when to retire the flag. That's the question that the American Legion gets the most. It's this idea of when do I need -- when do I get a new flag and what do I do with my existing flag?
 
SOLOMON:  So, when do you know when to retire the flag, and what do you do with your existing flag?
 
VAGLICA:  Well, it's a difficult -- it's a difficult question. 
 
The code is less -- obfuscates a bit about when it's time to get a new flag. And what my sources said was if you look at the flag and it just doesn't give you the sense of pride it did when you first got it, it might be time to get a new flag. 
 
Physically, if the flag is ripped or torn this is not the time to bring out duct tape. Have the flag -- you can have the flag sewn and stitched but if it's ripped, torn, tattered, or soiled then it's time to retire it. 
 
SOLOMON:  Let's go to rule four from the article. I'm learning this this morning. So the flag should never be used for advertising or displayed on anything designed for temporary use and discarded. When I think advertising I think different merch. And a lot of people are likely out there wearing merch today.
 
How does this apply?
 
VAGLICA:  Well, this is -- this is a tricky one, too. 
 
So back to the code. That was designed to prevent politicians from using the flag when running for office, right? So you can't -- you should not go buy a flag that says "Welcome to our Fourth of July party." Anything on the actual flag is a no-no. However, you can wear things that have the flag on them. So you can wear a flag t-shirt, a flag tote bag, flag swim trunks. That's all fine. 
 <br>[05:55:02]
 
The tricky part of the code there is when the flag is laid down. So things like a flag towel is probably a little unsavory to folks, right, because you're laying on it. You could be wiping up ice cream with it and stuff like that. So that is -- that's something you should probably skip if you're going to be laying down on the flag. 
 
But anything -- you're festive and you want to wear a tie, a hat -- those aren't flags so it's usually not considered part of the flag code.
 
SOLOMON:  I'm sure a lot of people will be glad to know that they can wear their flag merch today in good conscience. 
 
Sal Vaglica, thank you, and happy holidays.
 
And thanks for joining us. I'm Rahel Solomon. "CNN THIS MORNING" is next. But before we go, we leave you on this Fourth of July with last night's fireworks in Chicago -- enjoy.
