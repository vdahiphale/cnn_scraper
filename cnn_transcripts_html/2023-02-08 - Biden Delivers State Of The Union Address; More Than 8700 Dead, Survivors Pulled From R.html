ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: NEWSROOM. In the last few minutes there's been a big jump in the death toll in Turkey and Syria as rescue crews race against the clock and a desperate search for earthquake survivors.
 
Plus, we are following international reaction to U.S. President Joe Biden's contentious State of the Union address.
 
We begin this hour with the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria that has claimed more than 8700 lives. Time is running out. The rescue crews trying to reach anyone who may still be alive buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings. And freezing temperatures in the region and making things all the more difficult. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is opening up hotels in a tourist hub of Antalya for people whose homes have been destroyed.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator): We declare the 10 cities that are affected by the earthquake as disaster areas by the authority given to us by Article 119 of the constitution. We declare a state of emergency in the 10 cities that will last for three months in order to ensure that search and rescue operations and other work are done rapidly.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: In northwest Syria, heavy equipment is in short supply. Leaving people to dig through the rubble with their bare hands to find survivors. The Red Crescent is calling for other countries to lift sanctions and allow in international aid.
 
I think we have Becky Anderson standing by. Let me just double check that. All right. We're going to actually go to Becky's report right now and we will have a live very soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice over): From underneath the destruction, a momentary sigh of relief. The search and rescue teams find a sign of life while sifting through the rubble. But seconds later, another lifeless body is found. Monday's devastating quake has left an ever-growing death toll in its thousands leaving families across Turkey and Syria without homes and without loved ones.
 
As the snow falls, grief has been compounded with freezing conditions. Huddled around a small fire survivors worry about friends and relatives still trapped under the rubble. Forbidden by authorities to intervene, Murat Alinak says he just wants to help recover his relatives to give them a proper sendoff.
 
MURAT ALINAK, QUAKE SURVIVOR (through translator): We are under the snow without a home, without anything we can overcome this, we can fast for 40 days and still overcome this. But let us recover for the funerals.
 
ANDERSON: International aid has poured in from all corners of the world. France, Mexico, Germany and India are some of the countries who have pledged to step up efforts. Planes carrying supplies from Iran and Iraq, also arriving in Damascus on Tuesday. As C-17 cargo planes from the UAE flew quickly to the quake-stricken area.
 
UMUR ZAMANOGLU, TURKISH SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM LEADER: Now 25,000 of the Turkish search and rescue crew is on the mission and more estimated 5000 people is coming from the other country.
 
ANDERSON: Back in Gaziantep. Survivors at this gas station are desperately trying to fill up and find safety away from the destruction. Barters lines stretched throughout the airport with cancellations expected for at least three days.
 
And Turkey's Erdogan declaring a state of emergency for the next three months. Passengers slowly resigned to the fact that there may be no escape anytime soon.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: And Becky Anderson joins us now live from Gaziantep, Turkey. Becky, it is a devastating situation there and I know you've been watching this search and rescue effort underway behind you.
 
ANDERSON: That's right. And when we say there is no escape for those passengers that Gaziantep airport anytime soon, we're absolutely right. I mean, people's lives have been devastated here. But there are these pockets of hope. And I just want to stand away from the camera here so that Sharbel (ph) can give you a sense. Sharbel is the cameraman here. Can give you a sense of what's going on here.
 
We've been outside this site now for more than 24 hours. And Rosemary, you remember with 52 hours now or more into this search and rescue operation. What you're seeing behind me here is the heavy crane there, the heavy lifting equipment trying to remove that huge slab of concrete. Why?
 <br>[02:05:03]
 
Well, they have been in touch in the last two hours with a man with his kids and his wife stuck below what they believe might be that slab of concrete. Now they're concerned because they've also heard signs of life below them. And so, they're working very, very carefully to ensure that even if they are miraculously able to bring this family out alive, that they're not disturbing this debris so that others may not get out alive.
 
There are 12 people still unaccounted for here, including this family, by the way, sadly, three people have been bought out. Three bodies have been bought out since we've been here. Three people who perished underneath. What was this? Seven-storey building. There would have been 150 people or so living in this building as they were in the building to the left, which is now in a real -- really precarious state.
 
So, this is a -- this is still search and rescue. You can see everybody concentrating and coordinating out there. But this is a -- this is a sign of hope, Rosie. This is a sign that now that they've removed that concrete slab but there is a possibility that a family who have been in contact by mobile phone, can you believe it? May actually come out alive. But look, time is running out for rescue crews trying to reach anyone who may still be alive buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
 
And freezing temperatures in this region are making things a lot more difficult. The authorities here are being criticized by many for the way that they've responded to this. You could also argue that they simply couldn't have conceived of an earthquake. This largest is the biggest in 100 years. And the extent of the devastation. The Turkish President has ordered all hotels in the touristic region of Italia to open up for people whose homes have been destroyed.
 
I'm standing out because there actually are now just pulling out this piece of concrete. But let's just listen to what President Erdogan has just said.
 
All right. I don't think we've got that sound from President Erdogan, or perhaps you heard it, I didn't. You can see what's going on. What a -- what a delicate operation this is. But the beauty is here, that they have got this heavy lifting equipment. This is a relatively new town, easily accessible, relatively easy -- easily accessible. Couple of the roads in here have been very badly damaged. But they've got this heavy lifting equipment here.
 
But that's not the case around the region. And it's the reason why the Turkish president and the Syrian President has made -- they've made appeals for international health and that international help is coming in from all over the world. Nada Bashir is in London and she's got the details on that. Nada, as you speak, let's just continue to keep this shot up so that people can see what's going on here.
 
Let's talk about why this international support is so important and where it's coming from?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: Yes, absolutely. Becky, as you just said that time is crucial here and it is running out. And there has been an outpouring of support in the form of humanitarian aid from the international community. Really across the globe. We have seen an extensive list of international partners President Erdogan outlining at least 70 nations and 14 international organizations have so far pledged support.
 
At this stage there are many nations which have pledged support, but it is taking time for that support, for that aid to actually be deployed, sent to Turkey and Syria. And of course, given to those so vulnerable and most in need at this stage. Because of course there are huge logistical challenges at hand right now. Of course, we are expecting further search and rescue teams to already begin arriving in Turkey.
 
The U.S. search and rescue teams being deployed to Turkey are expected to arrive a little later today. And that support coming from international partners is coming in the form of those crucial search and rescue teams. The heavy machinery and tools and equipment needed to support the rescue effort as well as the humanitarian assistance which will be so desperately needed by all those in Turkey affected but also in Syria and northwest Syria where of course there was a dire need for these essential, medical assistance health support, food, blankets, temporary shelter.
 
The conditions there, as you've laid out are freezing. People we're really struggling now with the aftermath of Monday's earthquake.
 <br>[02:10:04]
 
But of course, there is the question of the impact this will have on northwestern Syria. Syria's concern around the impact there and the ability to get aid to northwestern Syria and I have to say the majority of the aid that has been pledged so far is focusing on Turkey, not on Syria. Getting aid there will be difficult because of course there is only one key border crossing between Turkey and northwestern Syria that is sanctioned by the United Nations for humanitarian aid.
 
And the roads leading to that crossing Bab al-Hawa are so far blocked, making it very difficult for the U.N. to get across.
 
CHURCH: Nada, I'm standing out of the shot and I'm going to stop you there because they've called for silence again and we are hoping that this is because they do have now a sign of life for that family who were caught beneath, what they believe to be caught in a room that they believe to be below that slab of concrete. Let's just pause for a moment.
 
For those of you who may just be joining us, we are with everybody else just pausing for a moment while the search and rescue teams here, the volunteers hope to get a sign of life beneath the rubble that you are witnessing here. OK. it's not clear whether they've got that sign of life. Let's hope they have. The volunteers and rescue workers continuing to do their jobs once again and this happens -- this happens regularly on this site and on sites up and down this road where there are a number of -- there are number of buildings that have collapsed sadly in the building up to my right. It does appear that the search and rescue -- the search and rescue operation there is now over and it has turned into a recovery situation which essentially means that nobody else is alive or certainly they have no sign of life there.
 
But this is -- this is a -- this is a -- this is a hopeful sign. And it does sound as if there's some noises suggest, some shouting to suggest that this maybe -- just maybe one of those miraculous situations. Rosemary, we'll continue to monitor this and as of when we get more, we'll get back to you.
 
CHURCH: All right, Becky. Incredible moments there as we're hoping and wishing that the signs of life are found there. We'll come back to you very soon.
 <br>[02:15:04]
 
Well, the U.S. president powered through a combative State of the Union address and some heckling from Republicans. We will talk about the takeaways and what can be gleaned on whether he'll run for reelection. Mr. Biden did reaffirm us support for Ukraine during his address as fierce fighting rages on the front lines. The President's comments just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. The U.S. president has a new message as he tries to connect with the American public. Let's finish the job. Joe Biden's annual State of the Union address focused on his major accomplishments during the first half of his presidency, which many Democrats say are underappreciated. He passed large historic pieces of legislation that could have transformational effects on the U.S. economy.
 
But recent polls show that's not registering with many Americans. During his speech, the President repeatedly pushed for a boosting of the middle class, who he called the country's backbone and bipartisanship. And this was President Biden's first big address since Republicans took control of the House. And at times he faced open hostility. CNN's Phil Mattingly explains.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: For White House officials who crafted President Biden's second State of the Union address a critical primetime moment. Tens of millions of viewers there were three words, they wanted the American public to take away from the President's remarks. Finish the job. Finish the job of his first two years. Two years defined by major legislative achievements.
 
But still significant malaise within the country coming out of a pandemic, coming out of an economic crisis. Finish the job perhaps for two years from now, when he likely is running for reelection for a second term in office despite being the oldest president in history. But there was also an effort to reach out to Republicans. Republicans, obviously newly elevated to the majority in the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy sitting behind President Biden for the first time in the State of the Union address. And the President is offering an olive branch. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there's no reason we can't work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: But that didn't mean it was necessarily a kind and gentle House chamber when the President delved into some of the areas of clear contention. Most notably the possibility of cutting Medicare and Social Security. Something Republicans have made clear. They don't view is on the table, particularly through the lens of the debt ceiling negotiations that are now underway.
 
The President saying in fact, they did have it on the table. That leading to a back and forth that the president was more than happy to engage in even as he was called by some Republicans a liar, shouting that from the audience, the President saying he welcomed a conversion moment. 
 <br>[02:20:07]
 
Saying there was unanimity on an issue calling for all members to stand in support seniors. All members stood in support and seniors. It was a moment that was off script and one that thrilled White House officials. As one official told me, we couldn't have crafted that moment any better. It was also a window into a president that despite his age very clearly, is energized by the audience that he's speaking in front of.
 
An audience that was engaged as much as he was throughout the course of the night. There couldn't have been a better moment for that. For a president that doesn't command large crowds, doesn't often try and sit in the forefront of cable news or in publications on a regular basis. This was an opportunity to speak to a lot of people who White House officials viewed as not regularly engaged in political news or political media.
 
This was his chance to reach out to them with his economic proposals, with his kitchen table proposals, with his calls for bipartisanship. Frankly, it was a lead up, a test case, if you will, for a reelection message that the President is likely to roll out in the weeks ahead. He will certainly be rolling it out in the days ahead. Traveling to Wisconsin on Wednesday, a critical swing state. To Florida on Thursday.
 
State Democrats seem to have lost a grip on over the course of the last couple of election cycles. All to highlight his economic agenda, all to highlight his plans going ahead, all to implicitly highlight the fact that despite his age, despite his approval ratings, this President has he demonstrated in a primetime address fully plans on running for reelection in 2024.
 
Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House.
 
CHURCH: President Biden also called President Putin's attack on Ukraine a murderous assault, and strongly reaffirmed America support for the war-torn nation during his State of the Union address. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Putin's invasion has been a test for the ages. Test for America, test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? We stand for the right of people to live free of tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy? For such defense matters to us because it keeps peace and prevents open season and wouldn't be aggressive and threatens our prosperity. One year later, we know the answer. Yes, we would and we did.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Ukraine's Defense Intelligence is dismissing Russia's claims of games on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine where heavy fighting is ongoing.
 
Ukraine says its forces continue to defend areas in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions after Russia's defense minister claimed Russian troops had taken control of several small settlements there. Russia also claimed its operations were progressing near Bakhmut and Voladar.
 
Meantime, a top Ukrainian official in the Luhansk region says Russian forces in eastern Ukraine appear to be stockpiling ammunition and building up troop reserves ahead of a full-scale offensive.
 
Well, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the need for quick delivery of weapons and military equipment during a meeting with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius in Kyiv. Those comments as the German Army announced Leopard 2 battle tanks from Germany will be ready for Ukraine to use at the end of March.
 
Ukraine's defense minister posted this photo alongside Pistorius who held a miniature model of a leopard to battle tank. Older versions of the tank will also be delivered. During his visit, the German defense minister announced a joint agreement between his country, Denmark and the Netherlands to send more than 100 Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine by next spring.
 
A closer look now at Ukraine and how foreign policy flashpoints played into President Biden's address. CNN's Nic Robertson is standing by in London. But we begin with Clare Sebastian. Good morning to you, Clare. So, President Biden's commitment to continue U.S .support for Ukraine and defend democracy was understandably well received by Ukraine's President as he continues to call for more weapons to protect his country.
 
But how far will Western support go with some of these weapon requests?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT Yes, Rosemary. I think that continues to be the major question here. And in fact, we're getting some words of gratitude this morning from President Zelenskyy on Twitter thanking the president of the United States for his powerful words. He said in his leadership in helping Ukraine. But this comes at a moment obviously when the big question is -- in Ukraine is when and how Russia could launch a new spring offensive? That's something they've been warning about for months.
 <br>[02:25:01]
 
And we're seeing a real uptick in the messaging from Ukraine around this warning as you have pointed out about accumulation of Russian troops and weapons in the east warning. There was a warning from the deputy head of defense intelligence this week that Russia could be preparing another wave of mobilization. And alongside that, an uptick in messaging around these requests for weapons.
 
Obviously, they've had big success when it comes to those tanks. They're now pushing quite hard, including in that meeting with the new German defense minister for fighter jets. Germany so far has ruled that out but other countries are potentially more open to the idea. And of course, one of the big calculations around these weapons provisions from the U.S. and its Western allies has been the potential for retaliation from Russia.
 
And we heard on Tuesday, from the Russian defense minister, who hinted at that, Rosemary. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SERGEI SHOIGU, DEFENSE MINISTER OF RUSSIA (through translator): The U.S. and allies are trying to drag out the conflict as long as possible. For this, they have moved to provide heavy offensive weapons openly urging Ukraine to capture our territories. These steps, in effect, draw NATO countries into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: Clearly, the Western weapons provisions to Ukraine are a major concern to Russia posturing, perhaps there from the Russian defense minister to try to show that they are also modernizing their military and continue to be a fighting force. There are other questions from some military analysts about just how much of a new offensive Russia could put up at this stage. We are not seeing, Rosemary, a lot of movement on the front lines at the moment.
 
CHURCH: And Nic, let's talk about this. President Biden is pledging his continued support along with other allies. But what does this mean in terms of the cost of this war? And, of course, the geopolitical implications here? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, I think United States allies would have been watching the speech from President Biden. They would have been shocked if they'd heard anything other than what they heard about the, you know, support for democracies, the diminishment of autocracies, the fights, the United States leading the fight here. United States has been front and center about pulling NATO allies together about trying to lead the way to keep Ukraine supplied with the weapons that it needs.
 
President Biden has spoken in the past about, you know, we're giving them the weapons that we think that they need right now. Obviously, Ukraine thinks they need more. And it's generally been proven right over time. But there's sort of leadership position that President Biden talks about, if he had not spoken the way he did about uniting NATO partners. I think that would have caused concern but of course, that language was there.
 
And I think another interesting part of his language, which looks beyond the conflict in Ukraine towards the potential of conflict. Although he said, we were he wants competition, not confrontation, not conflict with China. But he talked about how the United States was building bridges between Atlantic partners and Pacific partners. And if we look at the recent trip of the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Japan, to South Korea, this sort of sense of building a stronger coalition of partners there and shoring up support for increased military bases has been part of United States growing focus on competition with China in that region.
 
But we've also seen this growing support coming from countries like Japan for Ukraine. So, I think the speech got to some -- got to some of that, but what to expect going forward. I think the United States, President Biden and his allies know that this really can be potentially a very long-drawn-out fight and actually the next few months will be very critical.
 
CHURCH: Absolutely. Our thanks to Nic Robertson and Clare Sebastian joining us from London.
 
Well, still to come. Row upon row of collapsed buildings. This is the Turkish city closest to the epicenter of the powerful earthquake. CNN is on the scene as ordinary people risk their lives to find survivors.
 
And rescue crews and survivors face brutally cold weather. We will go live to the CNN weather center for a look at freezing temperatures in that quake zone.

BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: I'm Becky Anderson in Gaziantep, Turkey. More than 50 hours after that powerful earthquake struck, on Monday, the death toll has now surpassed 8700 and tens of thousands are injured. There is still hope, though, for the search and rescue teams, who are working so hard across this region to ensure that those who are unaccounted for but may still live will actually be rescued. More on that in a moment. 
 
The 7.8 magnitude quake was the biggest here in nearly a hundred years, and thousands of buildings have collapsed. Rescue efforts here have been hampered by what had been bitter conditions. Bitter conditions 4:15 in the morning when this earthquake struck on Monday morning. Bitter conditions still here past 10:00 in the morning on Wednesday morning now. And damaged infrastructure, aftershocks more than a hundred aftershocks, all hampering things here across the region. But let me just give you a sense of what is going on behind me. This is just -- you know, this is just one moment in time. 
 
This is Ebrahim Li, in western Gaziantep, and we've been here, which is very close to the center, by the way, the epicenter of this earthquake. But this city has, to all intents and purposes, mostly remained intact. But there are many, many buildings that have collapsed like this one. And what you're seeing here now is the effort to extract a family that is on the fourth -- what was the fourth floor of this building. And they've just lifted the concrete between the sixth and the fifth. So, they are now a floor away, and we're talking about a collapsed building here, which was eight floors high. But we are now just a floor away. 
 
They've called for silence once again. So, I'm going to go quiet on you. Certainly, quieter while I explain what's going on because they genuinely believe that they may still be able to extract at least one family. A man, his two kids, possibly his wife as well, who are on that fourth floor. This is the sort of miracle, and that we are still seeing across the region. And this is why these volunteers, these search and rescue teams are continuing in what are these bitter, bitter conditions. Well, the epicenter of Monday's 7.8 magnitude quake, just north of the Turkey-Syria border. The U.S. Geological Survey says there have been at least 125 aftershocks, some nearly as powerful as that first quake. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is closer than we are to the actual epicenter, and things are pretty devastating where he is, and this is his report.
 <br>[02:35:06]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): You can still almost feel the enormity of the tremors here. This is Kahramanmaras, closest to the epicenter. One older neighborhood shredded its family warmth, huddling on the street. Dulce's (PH) father is trapped under the rubble here, only his feet protrude. They can't get him out but can cover his toes. It would be really nice, he says, if the government has come by.
 
Touran, retrieved his 8-year-old daughter, wife, and daughter-in-law, pray you never stand over so much of your life. Their final dignity from a carpet. Push down, and there are glimmers of hope. These rescuers have spotted a 12-year-old Mustafa (PH), in the rubble, and have to dig down to him. Further along, Ali (PH) helped them find his 65-year-old mother. She's in her bed down there, he says, we'll get her out soon.
 
There is not much sign of government here. Perhaps, as the scale of this is all too massive. Dusk makes the dust and the immense bulk of the mess harder still. The cold just an insult in the days of emptiness that lie ahead. And the news from the rubble is as often as bad as it is good. A body found here, carried out. And laid next to this man's 9-year-old daughter, Beren (PH). 
 
The black here hiding the intimate agonies buried in it. The stories with the wrong ending. But suddenly, there is a call for quiet, hush. They think they hear a voice. A pause, and then the best noise, joy. Rescuers think they might have found six people alive, but there are hours more ahead of checking. But nothing really goes to plan here. Even the joy seemed random. Where Ali's mother is being rescued, two young people are unexpectedly found and pulled out. A 16-year-old girl, apparently still alive.
 
(on camera) Extraordinary, moment of joy, a kind of thing that really all of Turkey is desperately hoping and waiting for. But as the temperatures drop and time goes by, they will become harder to come by. But extraordinary to see somebody pulled, hopefully, straight out of this building. 
 
(voiceover) Abdullah (PH) seems unscathed, almost untouched by the tremors that altered everything else he emerges into. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: A remarkable moment there. Well, the situation in northwest Syria is especially dire, and the death toll there is climbing CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following developments for us from Istanbul, Turkey. So, Salma, what more are you learning about the tragedy that's unfolding in Syria?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We are seeing, of course, aid and help pouring into Turkey. There can never be enough to deal with the scope and scale of this tragedy. But on the south to Syria, of course, there is no help at all. There is only one corridor, one access road, between Turkey and Syria that has been used for years now, to bring help to the communities that, of course, have been ravaged by a nearly 12-year-long civil conflict. That road, Rosemary, has been damaged in this earthquake. And so far, diplomatic efforts to try to create some sort of corridor with the Syrian Government between rebel areas, that's proving extremely complicated.
 
So, what that means is that Syrians are yet again alone. I know that Nick Paton Walsh just showed you a rescue inside Turkey. I want to show you what a rescue inside Syria looks like. We're going to pull up this video to show you here, show our viewers here. And what you're going to see, what you're looking at is little Mariam (PH), of course, a young girl holding and protecting her brother Elah (PH). They are wedged between two pieces of concrete trapped, of course, and what probably remains of their bed. This is about 36 hours after the earthquake. So, they've been sitting in these freezing cold conditions. These two children, who were born into war, and now crushed by an earthquake.
 <br>[02:40:07]
 
And you can hear Mariam, how calm she is, how she's speaking to that rescue worker, asking, pleading with him to pull him -- to pull them out, saying, please, do anything you can. And the rescue workers are trying to distract her, trying to keep her going. And eventually, we do see those two little children, thankfully, being pulled out, brought to their parents who, of course, had been standing by, waiting, hoping, and wishing that they would be pulled out OK. But again, this is a volunteer group. This is people in the neighborhood, coming out, stepping out, pulling these kids out, because no help is coming, no aid is coming anytime soon.
 
So, when we're looking at this very critical window, in these freezing cold conditions, which is the only glimmer of hope that families have to find their loved ones alive, that hope is absolutely faded in Syria. And you can't imagine a more grief-stricken population having yet another catastrophe, of course, Rosemary. This is a country that was already fully dependent on aid. And now yet another tragedy.
 
CHURCH: It is just hard to comprehend, isn't it? You can't imagine how those people are feeling. Salma Abdelaziz, joining us live from Istanbul, many thanks. And for more on the challenges posed by the freezing conditions, meteorologist Britley Ritz is at the CNN Weather Center. And if it isn't enough to have to deal with this earthquake, now these temperatures, and sadly, they're not going to improve, are they?
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: No, Rosemary, they're not. I want to show you this, you'll see the blue dots and the yellow dots. These are the aftershocks hundreds of 4.0 or stronger just over the last few days. In the heart of where we're dealing with some of the coldest air of the season. The darker blues indicating frigid, if not freezing conditions, where temperatures are below zero right now, especially across central Turkey. Aleppo at least were above freezing but still near where it is at three degrees. That area of low pressure still holding on to some moisture, but a lot of it fading away. And as the clouds move out, we're dealing with clearing skies.
 
That's nice in the sense of the rain, and the snow coming to an end, but not so great when it comes to the overnight hours and early morning. All that heat escapes through the atmosphere at that point, and we wind up very cold, which is what we're dealing with this morning. There is the scattered showers and snow showers leftover through today, but that dissipates as we move into Friday, and of course, that cold air really sets in. We wind up with a northerly wind, and many of us holding below zero for morning lows. But then we factor in that wind, and by Thursday morning, we wind up Aleppo feeling like seven below. Afternoon highs really not working their way up all that much, still staying below normal, but at least above zero. Aleppo, expect eight degrees on Thursday. By Friday, we're up maybe a degree, only at nine. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Britley Ritz, many thanks for bringing us up to date on that situation. And still to come, the U.S. President says he will cooperate with rival China, but vows to protect U.S. interests. A live report on Washington's relations with Beijing, that's next.

CHURCH: U.S. President Joe Biden dedicated part of his State of the Union address on Tuesday to talk about America's relationship with China. Republicans have spoken out against his handling of these suspected Chinese spy balloon incident. But the President defended his actions, saying he would always act to protect the U.S. The comments come amid new intelligence from officials claiming the balloon is part of a much larger military surveillance program. And CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now live from Hong Kong with more on this. Good to see you, Kristie. So, when President Biden delivered his State of the Union Address to a divided Congress, the issue of China actually allowed for a rare moment of bipartisan support, didn't it? What did he say, and how is China reacting?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: You know, Rosemary, right now, we are still waiting for official reaction from Beijing to the State of the Union address. In fact, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing is happening this afternoon. But it was interesting, CNN had earlier learned that China was included in the original text of the State of the Union well before the Chinese balloon slipped into American airspace last week and caused this major political uproar, prompted the U.S. chief diplomat to cancel his planned visit to February, and also added a new sense of urgency to President Biden's messaging about the U.S.-China relationship and about American competition with China. Take a listen to what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm committed to work with China where we can advance American interests and benefit the world, but make no mistake about it, as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country, and we did.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
STOUT: Now, a top Chinese official in Washington D.C. has lodged stern representations with officials at the U.S. State Department as well as officials at the White House National Security Council over the downing of the Chinese balloon. We also learned from the Pentagon that when they made an offer to speak or to arrange a conversation between the U.S. Secretary of Defense and his Chinese counterpart in the immediate wake of a U.S. fighter jet shooting down the Chinese balloon, the Chinese declined that offer. And then I just want to remind audiences what we did hear from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday afternoon saying this in regards to the balloon debris that is being collected and analyzed right now. China insisting that the debris belongs to China. 
 
According to the MOFA spokeswoman saying the airship is China's not the U.S.'s, she goes on to say, "The United States should have handled it properly in a calm, professional non-forceful manner. But insistence by using force is a clear overreaction." China continues to insist this as a civilian aircraft. The U.S. will use it for spy craft, and in fact, U.S. intelligence officials tell CNN, it was part of a broader military surveillance operation. Back to you. 
 
CHURCH: All right. Kristie Lu stout joining us live from Hong Kong, many thanks. Well, the U.S. isn't the only democracy that's encountered flyovers by Chinese balloons. Officials in Taiwan confirmed it's happened multiple times there. And they're saying the incidents should not be tolerated by the international community. CNN's Will Ripley has more from Taipei.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This Chinese propaganda video released just days ago shows the military muscle of China's People's Liberation Army. The PLA promising to reunite with Taiwan, planning to build up bullet train across the Taiwan Strait, pledging to take control of this island of almost 24 million, bringing the self-governing democracy under communist control. One of the Chinese military's tools, high altitude balloons, they've been testing them for years. The U.S. shot down this suspected Chinese spy balloon last week. Beijing calls it a civilian weather balloon. 
 
CNN obtained images of similar Chinese balloons hovering over Taiwan in recent months, including this one on New Year's Eve. And this one a few months earlier, at least four balloon sightings in the last two years says Su Tzu-yun, Director of Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He says the island's relatively small size about the same as the State of Florida gives Taiwan's military limited time to intercept balloons or even shoot them down. 
 
SU TZU-YUN, DIRECTOR OF TAIWAN'S INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY RESEARCH: The spy balloon crossed Montana state, a very important ICBM site of the United States.
 <br>[02:50:02]
 
RIPLEY: Su says balloons can capture high-resolution images of sensitive sites, potentially making China's ICBMs more accurate. Taipei says Chinese spy balloons should not be tolerated by the international community. Last year, dozens of civilian drones from China captured videos of Taiwanese military outposts, soldiers responded with rocks and flares, managing to shoot at least one drone down. Taiwan's Defense Ministry says 121 Chinese military planes flew near the island just last month. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So Taiwan is one of those places that is constantly under this kind of threatening surveillance. 
 
RIPLEY: Taipei-based political scientists Lev Nokman (PH) tells me the balloon scandal sets back months of crucial diplomacy. U.S.-China tensions could flare up even more if U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy goes ahead with plans to visit Taiwan, following former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip last year, triggering Chinese outrage and massive military drills around Taiwan.

CHURCH: The North Korean leader is celebrating 75 years of the Korean People's Army with his wife and daughter. They made several public appearances according to state media, and a military parade could happen anytime now. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following this live for us from Seoul, she joins us now. So, Paula, what are you learning about this, and of course, its significance?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jong-un, we are -- I mean, we are expecting, Rosemary, that we are going to see in a few hours' time, this military parade. But of course, with North Korea, you can't actually be sure of something until you actually see it or they tell you about it. But this is a significant anniversary, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the military. Any anniversary with a zero or a five at the end is generally celebrated in style in Pyongyang. 
 
And what we've seen is that commercial satellite imagery has been looked at very carefully by international experts. And they believe that there have been practices with thousands of people involved in Kim Il-sung Square over recent months, so suggesting that it could be a significant parade. Now, it is important to watch these parades closely not just for what Kim Jong-un may say, if he gives a speech, and what he may show what he has already achieved. But many weapons experts will be looking for clues, any indications of what he could be looking to achieve in the future. We know he's in the midst of this five-year military plan. He's two years into that. So certainly, the arsenal and the weaponry and the missiles on display will be scrutinized by experts around the world. 
 
Now, it is a very military-heavy time at this point. We saw from state-run media Wednesday, that he had with his wife and his daughter, believed to be his daughter, Ju-ae, had gone to a military barracks to rally the troops, and who also said that he wanted to see the strengthening of the military. And that, again, came just a day after he met with military leaders, and said that he wanted to push forward with war readiness, also specifying he wanted to see more operational training, more military drills from his military. So, it's a very public statement over a few days hear that we are seeing Kim Jong-un giving speeches, praising his military, saying he wants to see more. And what we could see in just a matter of hours is a significant military parade. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Our Paula Hancocks joining us live from Seoul, many things. Still to come, another wave of pension reform protests is sweeping France. We will have a detailed report when we return. 
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH: More than 750,000 people stormed the streets of France for a third round of protests against proposed pension reform. The French Interior Ministry says the turnout was lower than the last two rounds of protests. The strike mainly impacted air and rail transportation, and disruptions are expected to continue today. CNN's Jim Bittermann has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No question, a lot of people in the streets are protesting today, protesting against Mr. Macaron's plan to reform the retirement age here to bump it up from 62 years old to 64 years old. This is something he's been after since practically his first day in office. Now, there's a bill in the National Assembly that would do this as the enabling legislation. There are already thousands of amendments that have been filed against this going through. Likely, it won't be heard until end of March. So, you may see things like this demonstration going on in the near future. And in fact, on Saturday already, the unions are calling for another demonstration just like this one. So, in fact, it'll be something that's protested probably for some time to come here. Jim Bittermann, CNN, Paris.
