BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Arguably the world's greatest football player of all time has died. This hour we take a look at his 
 
 legacy. I'm talking one man, of course, Pele. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome back to "Connect the World"!
 
Pele changed everything, those words from current Brazil Football Star Neymar, honoring the football legend who died Thursday of complications 
 
 from colon cancer. Brazil is observing a three day period of national mourning for Pele while tributes pour in from across the globe.
 
A public wake will be held on Monday at the stadium in Santos where Pele burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager capturing the imagination of 
 
 a country and later the world. Pele's funeral will take place on Tuesday in Santos. World Sports Don Riddell kicks off this hour with a closer look at 
 
 Pele's remarkable life and legacy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): When the world knows you by just one name, you have truly succeeded. Pele is regarded by many as the 
 
 greatest footballer of all time his humble demeanor and generous spirit have guaranteed his legacy as a global icon.
 
PELE, FORMER MINISTER OF SPORTS OF BRAZIL: This is big responsibility. I feel very comfortable because something I cannot answer was why God gave me 
 
 this, you know, this gift? This was a gift from God. And I tried to be my best. I tried to respect people. I tried to prepare myself to be always in 
 
 good shape. You know the most important respect the people.
 
RIDDELL (voice over): Rose in the slums of Sao Paulo in the 1940s. Edson Arantes do Nascimento discovered football at a young age. He made his debut 
 
 for Santos at the age of just 16 and within a year he was scoring goals for the Brazilian national team. By this time, he was better known by his 
 
 nickname, Pele.
 
And in 1958 at 17 He became the youngest man to play in a World Cup final, scoring twice as Brazil beat Sweden. It was the first of three world titles 
 
 he'd helped win for his country. He electrified audiences with his fancy footwork and ability to score seemingly impossible goals. So it was 
 
 something of a disappointment that his 1000th goal was a penalty.
 
PELE: Friend of mine he's a comic guy in Brazil. He said, listen, God stopped the game, because everyone has to see your 1000th thousand goal 
 
 that's the reason it was the penalty kick.
 
RIDDELL (voice over): After his goal, the game against Vasco de Gama was stopped for several minutes to celebrate his landmark achievement. In 1967 
 
 Pele learned that he and his team had the power to stop other things too when they visit to Nigeria prompted warring factions to call a 48 hour 
 
 ceasefire in the country's Civil War.
 
PELE: Was the war because the people were so crazy for football, they love football. They stopped the war to see Santos play in Africa. This is a 
 
 fantastic something you cannot explain.
 
RIDDELL (voice over): By the time Pele retired as a footballer in 1977 playing his final years for the Cosmos in New York. He'd amassed a career 
 
 total of 1281 goals. For Pele that was half a lifetime ago. But his infectious love of the game ensured that he remained relevant.
 
He served as a UN Ambassador for Ecology and the Environment. He rubbed shoulders with state leaders all over the world, and he received an 
 
 honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth in 1997. Who could forget his appearance in the cult movie "Escaped to Victory"?
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
PELE: Got to give me here these - easy.
 
RIDDELL (voice over): When he starred alongside Michael Canine and Sylvester Stallone playing a prisoner of war who scored a spectacular 
 
 morale boosting goal in a game against the Germans.
 
PELE: I think first of all, is a gift from God. Second, I think it was a lot of work, hard work and training. I have to say, thanks to God, because 
 
 my father was a football player, because the - and then my father was very perfectionist. And then everything who I used to do I try to do, he used to 
 
 say, listen, no, you must to be better than that.
 
RIDDELL (voice over): He's always been a global icon. But in his native Brazil, he will always be regarded as a national treasure. His passing is 
 
 cause for national mourning. And as he so humorously put it himself, there will never be another pillar.
 
PELE: To be the new Pele of the world because my mother and my father, they--
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
ANDERSON: CNN Producer Julia Vargas Jones is with us from Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo where Pele died yesterday. Julia I met him back in 
 
 2011 and an infectious personality, a humor, a humility that completely bowled me over.
 
I'm old enough to remember him playing and I caught in the true sense of the word. I can only imagine how people in Brazil are feeling today? How do 
 
 you describe that feeling and just walk us through what happens as people mourn but celebrate his life over the next couple of days?
 
JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN PRODUCER: Well Becky, first of all, what an honor to meet such an icon right here in Brazil, he is seen as much more than a 
 
 soccer players who is seen as - there are helicopters flying over causing a lot of noise now.
 
The helicopters are going to take Pele from here quite yet. That's not going to happen until Sunday evening we're hearing but there's just been a 
 
 huge police presence around this area. There's media from all over the world.
 
And that speaks to the importance that Pele has not just for Brazilians but for the world but here the feeling what you're talking about is it feels 
 
 like we lost a giant of resilient culture. He transcended sport Becky he went so much farther than then soccer.
 
And soccer that's seeing a lot for Brazil, a country that values soccer so much he became an inspiration for young children, the black, the poor, 
 
 young children that now have an icon to look up to as a black man in the 1960s, raising to the kind of fame that he raised to its indescribable.
 
And it's impossible to overstate his importance in the Brazil. Brazilian emotional realities that make sense to you. It's kind of like, we saw Pele 
 
 shine and we also shone as Brazilians, we were able to look at him and think wow, this is something that we can strive to.
 
We could have this kind of recognition. And just that, I think, is why so many people are so sad and taking the time to mourn his loss at this time, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Julia, I described him earlier as joining the pantheon of all time, great heroes who transcend their sporting greatness, and that very 
 
 much speaks to what you've just been describing.
 
And I think you know, one of the few people that I would put in that Pantheon as far as sporting greats, of course, is Muhammad Ali, somebody 
 
 who on his death people around the world mourned and it really is this coming together, isn't it that reminds us just want an impact Pele made not 
 
 just on Brazil, but on the world?
 
JONES: Absolutely. And you know, they knew each other, they talk to each other Becky. Muhammad Ali was they were friendly, you know, in very 
 
 different though Muhammad Ali taking back political stance, right.
 
He didn't see allegedly he actually distanced himself from politics, and his greatness was so built around his personality his kindness and how 
 
 naturally he was drawn to the limelight? How kind he was to the people around him? He was always so happy to stop and talk to people to his fans.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
JONES: But he removed himself or tried to remove himself from politics, even though his victories because they were so great. Many different 
 
 governments and politicians tried to bring them and claim them as their own political game that happened in the 1970s with the World Cup win.
 
But now, ironically, Pele is doing that yet again. You know, he is coming to overshadow a political moment that's quite fraught for Brazil, as Luiz 
 
 Lula da Silva takes over office as President on Sunday.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. Well, what a really good point you're making. Excellent, thank you very much indeed. And one can only really feel for the people of 
 
 Brazil, to a man, woman and child I am sure that he is being mourned. We know he is being mourned and celebrated.
 
And I just have to say, one of our fabulous producers in Atlanta, who works regularly on this show, was just describing earlier on before the show 
 
 started the importance of this man to her young daughter. And we said what she really knows who Pele is? And this is a youngster. She plays football. 
 
 And she said, yes, you know, she cried when she heard. That is how he transcends generations as well. And there are not many sporting greats who 
 
 do that are amazing.
 
Well, more countries are placing restrictions on travelers arriving from China amid a surge in COVID cases there. It comes as Beijing uses its own 
 
 strict COVID policies. South Korea says it will stop issuing most short term visas from its consulates in China for the time being at least. 
 
 Flights coming from China will be partially reduced and passengers must present a negative test before entering.
 
Well, Spain also requiring a negative test or proof of full vaccination and after imposing mandatory testing on travelers coming from China, Italy now 
 
 asking the entire European Union to follow suit. But EU health officials say at this point, at least the restrictions are and I quote them here 
 
 unjustified.
 
China for its part insists it's been and has been transparent and truthful about its COVID cases and deaths. Well, I want to get you on to this story 
 
 on two continents. Barbie Nadeau is in Rome. Paula Hancocks joins us now, from Seoul.
 
And let's start there, because you and I talked yesterday before authorities in South Korea decided to impose restrictions on incoming 
 
 passengers from China just describe what's going on and why?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well Becky, the restrictions that the South Korean government has announced that are actually remarkably 
 
 advanced, and they go a lot further than them really anywhere else in the world.
 
You have the requirement for travelers from China to have a negative test result before boarding; they have to have another test within 24 hours of 
 
 arriving here. And if they're on a short term visa, and they test positive, they have to be quarantined in a government facility.
 
If they're a resident, they can quarantine at home. All of the flights from China that would land anywhere in South Korea are now all going to be 
 
 redirected to the one main airport - just outside Seoul so that they can monitor the situation. They are lessening the number of flights that will 
 
 be coming from Seoul as well.
 
And as you've mentioned, up until the end of January, they will be restricting the amount of short term visas that they will be issuing at 
 
 consulates. There are a couple of exemptions for business for diplomats, for example, for humanitarian reasons.
 
But South Korea has gone a step further than many countries. They're not just testing people coming in or where they will be in the next few days. 
 
 They're trying to prevent some travelers from China even being able to get to the border, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Let me get to Barbie. Obviously, South Korea's experienced back in 2020 was horrific. The Italian experience was also very, very 
 
 disturbing. Italy first hit in a wave that eventually sort of swept across Europe. One can understand Italian authorities being concerned for that not 
 
 to happen again but at this stage with EU health officials suggesting that restrictions are unjustified, have the Italians gone too far?
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's an interesting question, but you know, one of the reasons they're doing this testing is so that they can do 
 
 sequencing of a sample of all these tests, because the Italian health system here is worried that there is going to be a new variant.
 
That's because they don't believe China has been transparent in terms of the real situation on the ground there and they don't think the vaccine has 
 
 been very effective there. And so that there could be a new mutation a new variant and part of this control testing.
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
NADEAU: This mandatory testing of everyone who's coming in from China direct flight is to so they can sequence it. So they can double check the 
 
 work. And, you know, you have to look back to almost three years ago now in early 2020 when Italy was the first Epicenter out of China and Italy was 
 
 restricting flights then and the rest of the European Union said back then, oh, this isn't necessary or you're overreacting. Italy, as we learned 
 
 wasn't overreacting there.
 
And of course, the playing field is very different now with vaccines across Europe. But the Italians are still stung by that it was a very difficult 
 
 three years and they didn't want to go anywhere near that again. In Georgia Maloney, a new leader is standing strong and she's standing against the 
 
 European Union saying you need to be doing this too. It's not the other way around. You need to be controlling people as they're coming in so that we 
 
 don't have anywhere near a repeat of what happened almost three years ago, Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Well, absolutely. Thank you, Barbie. Thank you, Paula. Well, this time last year, the Omicron wave was taking off a stark reminder of the 
 
 continued threat of COVID-19. Will now heading into 2023 public health and infectious disease experts are emphasizing the importance of monitoring for 
 
 new variants, especially with the latest surge of cases in China.
 
CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins us now. Let's - I think it's really important at this point that we really drill down on how 
 
 concerned we might be about new variants potentially developing in China? What are the experts telling us?
 
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Becky, the experts I'm talking to they are concerned, they're not hysterical. They're not saying 
 
 for sure something terrible is about to happen. But they are concerned.
 
And here's the reason why. When you have a group of people who were basically, you know, in many ways, isolated for several years, not exposed 
 
 in the same way that the rest of the world was exposed to COVID vaccinated with a vaccine of questionable efficacy.
 
And then all of a sudden, they're allowed to be out and about, the problem is that kind of gives the virus a field day, the virus then multiply in 
 
 many, many, many people. And that gives it opportunities to change into a different variant.
 
Now, different variants aren't necessarily bad, they might be different variants that aren't all that harmful, but you just never know with a 
 
 little twist of some DNA, when or if it's going to become a bad variant that will then spread around the world.
 
So the way that scientists deal with this is they try to keep really careful surveillance of the variants that are out there. So there is a 
 
 website that where countries post, hey, here's what we're seeing. They swipe people's noses, they do genetic sequencing, and they say here's what 
 
 we're seeing.
 
And the more noses you swipe, and the more samples you post, the better. So let's take a look at how countries are doing with this. And you'll see why 
 
 there's concern. So in the past six months, the U.S. has posted more than 576,000 sequences to this online portal, basically called GIZI. UK in the 
 
 past six months has posted more than 123,000 China bigger than either of those countries has posted 412.
 
So there is concern that there's a lot of we just don't know what's going on there. And that's really a problem. Now let's take a look at the rules 
 
 in the United States. We just heard about rules in other countries. Starting January 5, all passengers, including U.S. citizens will have to 
 
 get a test PCR or antigen no more than two days before departure.
 
And then at seven U.S. airports on select flights, including hundreds of flights a week from China, passengers can volunteer to say swipe my nose 
 
 see if I have COVID and if I do see what genomic sequence I have? And if enough people do that, hopefully that might help.
 
But let's be clear requiring this testing, it doesn't mean that is going to keep out bad variants. It may do some good, but it is by no means a 
 
 surefire way of keeping out dangerous variants, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. Thank you, really important insight. Just ahead on "Connect the World" Vladimir Putin says he expects to welcome China's 
 
 President to Russia in a few months. What that could mean for Moscow's war against Ukraine? And more on the death of Pele, I talk to the director of 
 
 the Netflix documentary on the footballing legend.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin is telling the world the relationship between his country and Beijing has never been better. He and 
 
 his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held a meeting online earlier today with the Russian leader who vowed to strengthen military cooperation between the 
 
 two countries.
 
This comes as the Kremlin faces increasing international isolation over its war in Ukraine. On the battlefield Kyiv is reporting heavy Russian attacks 
 
 along the eastern front lines, plenty to cover. Let's get you live to Ukraine where Ben Wedeman is standing.
 
Ben, you are aware of what was discussed in that meeting with President Putin and President Xi, at least from the perspective of the Russians and 
 
 the Chinese. What did you make of what you heard and the significance of that conversation?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What we see, Becky is that these two leaders are growing closer at a time when they are both 
 
 experiencing difficulties. Russia, here in Ukraine with what has been a very dismal military performance since invaded this country on the 24th of 
 
 February of this year. Its military isn't performing very well.
 
As far as China goes, they're struggling with the aftermath of the lifting of that very harsh, zero COVID policy and now experiencing a wave of 
 
 infections, the likes of which I don't think that country has seen so far. So these are not men who, a year ago, the same men that a year ago, 
 
 declared a partnership without limits. It's proved to have its limits.
 
China, for instance, even though rhetorically it has supported the Russian war in Ukraine, in practical terms, it has not provided Russia with any 
 
 weaponry, the way it doesn't want to risk western sanctions, rather the Russians have had to turn to Iran and North Korea for badly needed 
 
 ammunition and equipment.
 
So on the ground in Ukraine; it's not clear how this meeting is going to impact the situation. But certainly, these men are somewhat diminished from 
 
 what they were a year ago, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: So let's talk about what's going on the ground then. Russian strikes continue to batter Ukraine. Yesterday some of the biggest missile 
 
 strikes in this war full stop, the Russians suggesting that suddenly the Ukraine it suggests that they've been able to neutralize most of these 
 
 targeted missiles. You visited one of the areas targeted, what did you see Ben?
 
WEDEMAN: But what we saw, first of all, overnight, we had 16 Russian drones fired into Ukraine; all of them according to the Ukrainians were 
 
 intercepted five of them right over the city of Kyiv in the early hours of the morning.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
WEDEMAN: But yesterday what we saw was that even when interceptions take place, damage and injury can occur.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): Dawn breaks in these strikes begin phone video captures a Russian cruise missile heading toward Kyiv. Russia fired nearly 
 
 70 missiles plus drones at targets across Ukraine. Air defenses managed to take down most of them but this Kyiv suburb did not escape unharmed.
 
WEDEMAN (on camera): The Mayor of Kyiv says that all 16 missiles fired in the direction of the Capitol were successfully intercepted but as a result 
 
 of this interceptions debris fell to the ground in this location massive destruction. A 14 year old girl was injured as well as her mother and a man 
 
 nearby.
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): Tatiana was at work that girl her granddaughter and Halina called her desperate for help. She was really scared in hysterics 
 
 Tatiana says, she cried grandma, the house was hit. It's on fire. She told me my mother is unconscious under the rubble.
 
Not for the first time, the crews work to clear the rubble of homes and lives shattered by war. Serhii lives just down the street. How is it 
 
 possible that we do this to each other, he asks? I understand that this rocket didn't target this place. But how is it possible to shell peaceful 
 
 people?
 
In another part of Kyiv 79 year old Leonid is still in his bathroom. He was jarred awake when missile debris smashed into the ground next to his house, 
 
 setting his son Alexander's car on fire shattering windows and walls, ripping trees out by the roots. Yet he remains stoic.
 
I was born in World War Two, so I'm very calm about explosions, Leonid says. Today I was only worried about my son. His son is fine. Ukrainian 
 
 officials insist Russia's target yet again was the country's energy infrastructure. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko is blunt.
 
VITALI KLITSCHKO, KYIV MAYOR: The Russians want to bring depression, especially right now Christmas time, New Year, then the Russians want to 
 
 bring us to black time to without lighting to without heating.
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): For now, Ukrainians just clear away the wreckage and carry on.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN: And this morning, Ukrainian officials came out and said that despite those strikes yesterday, some of which did hit critical 
 
 infrastructure. The electricity situation across Ukraine is no worse today than it was day before yesterday, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Ben, thank you. You're watching "Connect the World". I am Becky Anderson. You're watching the show that comes live to you from our Middle 
 
 East Broadcasting hub here in Abu Dhabi. Still ahead to remembering the life and legacy of Pele, I want to talk to the man who directed the Netflix 
 
 documentary on the footballing icon.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, tributes are pouring in for - football legend Pele, who died Thursday of complications from colon cancer FIFA luring its flag, so 
 
 its Zurich headquarters to half-staff as a sign of mourning and respect the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga planning to honor Pele at 
 
 weekend matches and players around the world reflecting on his influence on their lives and their careers.
 
Moroccan defender Achraf Hakimi posting a picture of a young Pele on Twitter writing, your legacy will be eternal. Well, that sentiment being 
 
 shared by so many today. And it is important to point out the enormous impact this man who last played a competitive match decades ago had on 
 
 football fans and players old and young.
 
News of Pele's death, bringing even young football fans to tears a testament to Pele's massive presence in a sport that he mastered champions 
 
 and transcended and a reminder of how widespread that admiration was. The legend spent time in this region of the Middle East.
 
Iran state media published this photo of Pele in the 1970s with the Iranian national team and he was also pictured with the Lebanese national team in 
 
 1975 right before the start of that country's civil war.
 
He was simply loved and revered by so many both on and off the pitch making his presence felt on the big screen in a number of movies along with TV 
 
 specials. My next guest directed a documentary on Pele's life and legacy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We thought Brazil was well-known back then. But it wasn't. In comes Pele. After school, all he wanted to do was to play ball.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, those scenes are from the Netflix film, Pele, it explores and I "The Untold Story" of the only player to win three World Cups across 
 
 an incredible 12 year period of Brazilian National Football dominance. Well, the Director of that film, David Tryhorn joins me now via Skype from 
 
 London. Let me start with a very simple question. What made him so great, sir?
 
DAVID TRYHORN, DIRECTOR, "PELE": God it's very, very hard to answer what made him so great? But I think it wasn't just his ability with a ball 
 
 obviously came along this incredible period in the 60s when media was beginning to boom, when football was beginning to boom was more than just 
 
 simply a sport.
 
And he was the first modern superstar the sport had. But obviously he was brilliant on the pitch. He became synonymous with the World Cup and so many 
 
 iconic moments, but I think it's also his warmth of character. His rags to riches story, the fact he put his own country Brazil on the map made them 
 
 the country of football. I think all this resonated with people. And over the years people began to just love Pele.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, I mean, I met him and everything you've just said describes the man that I met, an infectious character. I mean, smile, his humor, his 
 
 humility, his warmth, everything about him made you love him more than the guy that you knew to be arguably the best footballer in the world.
 
Erling Haaland, arguably one of the best of this new generation today tweeting that everything you see any player ever do, Pele did it first. 
 
 Players following him David and to emulate him, but in the end it is all just mere imitation.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
ANDERSON: Your film covers Pele's Guinness World Record for most career goals. Like I said, I interviewed the man back in 2011. I asked him what 
 
 his favorite goal was during that interview. Have a listen to what he told me at the time.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Favorite goal you've ever scored.
 
PELE: I said, no, no, I scored 1283 goals. Oh was important to me. Of course, I think the first World Cup, I play against Sweden in a final, I 
 
 was seventeen years old. I make beautiful goals. I think for starting my career, this is one of more important.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: You David must have been through hours and hours and hours of footage of this footballing grade. Most people I know will be watching this 
 
 with green envy that this is your job that this was your job to produce this documentary. On the field, when and how was he the best?
 
TRYHORN: I think he peaked probably in the late 50s, early 60s, by the time he was 21, 22, I think he had already scored 500 goals. And that's 
 
 ironically the period where you know, we were watching hours and hours of girls making the film. But you know that that period is very limited in 
 
 terms of what footage there is available.
 
But I think almost those early 60s were when he was at his absolute peak. But our film sort of focuses or climaxes at 1970. And that's really the 
 
 moment he makes his indelible mark on the game and becomes this iconic figure and rubber stamps, you know, his status as the greatest of all time.
 
And I think it was just interesting. You mentioned the Elon Harlands week, because I think that's something we've said, we try not to get into that 
 
 cross generational debate about who's the best. But what we always say is that he was the first, no one can actually follow in his footsteps, because 
 
 he was the first to do it.
 
ANDERSON: We've been talking tonight about on this show about how he has joined the pantheon of, of greats. The likes of which, you know, the world 
 
 revered as it were, and I'm thinking when was the last time you know, you know, someone had died and they made such an impact around the world as 
 
 Muhammad Ali, of course, there's Nelson Mandela, I mean, you and I've just been talking about how, you know, both on and off the pitch.
 
This guy really made such an impression he was revered by so many, even in the region, the Middle East where I am. I just want to bring up some images 
 
 here on the screen. Iran's national football team in the 1980s with him Lebanon's back in 1975.
 
And for those who haven't seen your documentary, I'm more than happy for you to give it a plug tonight. I'm, I'm sure it's going to be very well 
 
 watched. What was the ultimately, you know, what's the key takeaway to your mind?
 
TRYHORN: I think we wanted to show a guy who almost help build an identity, not just his own but a national identity in Brazil. And before 1958 it's 
 
 very hard to imagine Brazil, being a country of football. We're so used to that. But before 1958 obviously, it was a football match nation, but they 
 
 never won a World Cup.
 
They weren't identified throughout the world as this, this football nation and then Pele comes along. And 12 years later after 1970 and their three 
 
 World Cup wins that he's an integral part of Brazil become synonymous with football. And that's all really down to one man.
 
So when we watch Neymar in the number 10 shirt now, he's always evoking those images of Pele. I think he's, he's very, very unique like that, you 
 
 know, he comes, he was playing in a probably a slightly less divisive era. But everybody loved him. Everybody understood that here was greatness. And 
 
 I think obviously, since his sad passing yesterday, we lose a great slice of that history.
 
ANDERSON: I'm just thinking, you know, what only it was two weeks ago now we saw the re-emergence of Argentina as a footballing nation and the great 
 
 Messi sort of dragging them to the finish line as it were at the brilliant World Cup. And that's really the only sort of comparable I can think of, 
 
 but that's, that's the conceit of the documentaries is spot on and good job. You're making it well done and what a sad time. But I'm glad was 
 
 celebrating, able to talk and celebrate his life, thank you.
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, you're watching the last edition of "Connect the World" for 2022. We are looking forward to 2023. Still ahead we'll take you to Time 
 
 Square to see our New York City is preparing for one of the world's largest New Year's Eve parties and how losing your vision can give you a new 
 
 perspective on life, a special parting shots out of the CNN Academy Abu Dhabi, about life without the sense of sight.

ANDERSON: Got that sounds remarkably like Richard Quest. But it wasn't, that's organizers in New York testing out everything before the annual New 
 
 Year's Eve celebrations in Times Square, a tradition that goes back to 1904. People join the master of ceremonies on stage to throw out confetti 
 
 and a few trial runs more than a million are expected to attend the celebrations in person overnight on Saturday and millions more will follow 
 
 along on TV.
 
Well, CNN's Gloria Pazmino joins us from Times Square. To give us a sense of how preparations are going on, we're a good what hour - we're a good 36 
 
 hours out give or take at this point, less than that 30, I'm getting my math wrong. What's going on there where you are?
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's still several hours away Becky, but the energy here in Times Square is always alive. And right here 
 
 where I'm standing around this time tomorrow, people will be lining up to attend the biggest party on Earth. In arguably the most famous spot on 
 
 Earth right here in Times Square, the cross walk off the world, there will be a ton of confetti that will fall upon the revelers.
 
When the midnight strikes to clog, that ball will come down and we'll welcome the New Year. We're starting to see big preparations here; you see 
 
 some of the security gates are being set up. The stage behind me is fully up and loaded and there will be a lot of people here tomorrow.
 
Thousands of people a big security precedence expected this year. In fact, I spoke with one of the organizers of the Time Square Alliance which puts 
 
 this event together every year, and I just want to hear you. I want to play for you a little bit of what he had to say about this big celebration 
 
 tomorrow.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
TOM HARRIS, PRESIDENT, TIMES SQUARE ALLIANCE: The crowd is always excited, energized. And I think the biggest thing to bring is a sense of humor, a 
 
 sense of that New York resolve and New York spirit that make this the greatest city in the world.
 
PAZMINO: And that is exactly what makes this party so unique. There will be so many people here so much energy and just with every passing hour, even 
 
 if it's cold, even if it's raining, you know, the people just really make it happen. And that's what makes it fun. So we are expecting to see a big 
 
 crowd here tomorrow, a lot of excitement.
 
And also, you know, for the past two years, the event has had to be significantly scaled down because of COVID. This will be the first year 
 
 where there is going to be no restrictions or requirements for the crowd. So we are expecting this big party to come roaring back to its glory days 
 
 as it had been in so many previous years before, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Gloria, always a pleasure. Thank you very much indeed. Enjoy your New Year's Eve. Look forward to seeing you in 2023. And viewers wherever 
 
 you are watching in the world, celebrate New Year with us here on CNN International.
 
Ahead of that U.S. Time Square coverage we will get you across the Middle East Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America before we get to Time Square, 
 
 we'll even get into the Metaverse as the world welcomes in 2023 with New Year's Eve live starting in Asia.
 
New Year's Eve live will follow the sunset and celebrations peak in major cities around the globe. And you would expect me to be live from here and I 
 
 will be, will be in Dubai at 11 p.m. local time. That's 2 p.m. Eastern 7 p.m. in London. You don't want to miss that festive bash to join us.
 
Just ahead why a lot of stock traders cannot wait to see the back of this year, plus a crypto winter for digital currency, that's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, no doubt more than a few Investors are saying good riddance to this year. On this final trading day of 2022, Wall Street lower as it 
 
 wraps up the worst year since 2008. Looking at the European markets here, they're also out for the year on red arrows. Remember, 2008 was when the 
 
 global financial crisis hit.
 
For this year, the DOW has fallen over 9 percent year-to-date, the S&amp;P is down about 20 percent and the NASDAQ that's the one that's full of tech 
 
 stocks. Get this that is down a whopping 34 percent for the past 12 months. You really have to have nerves of steel to have been an investor in that 
 
 stock indices or stock index issue.
 
But you probably won't be surprised to hear that 2022 as being a nightmare for Big Tech collectively losing nearly $4 trillion in market value over 
 
 the past 12 months, especially hard hit the Crypto industry. CNN's Richard Quest and Paula Monica take a closer look for you.
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR-AT-LARGE: The markets and the economy and the oil and the energy, but there was one thing that kept us talking and it was 
 
 Bitcoin crypto, right, the way to the end of the year, Paula Monica is with me. When FTX collapsed, how much of a shock was that?
 
PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: I think it was a pretty big shock, particularly because it happened in such a rapid fashion. I mean, we all 
 
 knew Richard that Bitcoin prices had risen to unsustainably high levels and there needed to be a correction, a bear market, what have you.
 
But the fact that FTX, which had a more than $30 billion valuation of the private markets, people were talking about it as it's going to be one of 
 
 the 2023 IPOs of the year. It was that fast that we went from unicorn that was going to make a splashy Wall Street debut to being valued at zero.
 
QUEST: OK, so if you put that to one side and the courts will deal with SPF in one shape or another, but the actual relevance of block chain only 
 
 increases. And that's the contradiction here between the crypto speculative investment world and the block chain smart contract world, which is 
 
 growing.
 
MONICA: Definitely. I think that in many respects, the perfect analogy here is to go back to also the late 90s and early 2000s. We had a lot of 
 
 companies that all of a sudden found religion in E-commerce. They were going to sell things online, everyone wanted to be the next Amazon, no one 
 
 wound up being the next Amazon, all of those companies, including Amazon were overvalued.
 
Now, obviously, it's not a perfect comparison, because Amazon is still around, they weren't a fraud. They didn't go out of business. But there was 
 
 too much hype and too much enthusiasm about something that yes; it would eventually become a much bigger thing.
 
And I kind of feel the same way about block chain technology; we are eventually going to be doing far more transactions than we even do now. And 
 
 even consumers, probably through the Blockchain, we're just not there yet. And companies like Binance and FTX and Coinbase probably didn't deserve 
 
 their valuations in either the private markets or public markets. I mean, look at Coinbase their shares have plunged like 85 percent this year.
 
QUEST: What is the difference between block chain per se, and crypto as an investment tool?
 
MONICA: Yes, I think the difference is that Blockchain is a technology that makes sense for transparent transactions, that you don't necessarily need 
 
 to have thousands of different crypto currencies all trading on the Blockchain with their quirky niche sort of projects that they might be tied 
 
 to.
 
And then even things like Bitcoin and Aetherium yes, they are a value. But the problem is that people got so lost in the hype that they were more 
 
 treating them more like commodities and currencies on steroids as opposed to something with utility. The investment case I don't think makes sense 
 
 even though the use case does.
 
QUEST: Now which brings to the point, we always talk about our diversified, a properly diversified portfolio. All Investors should have a properly 
 
 diversified portfolio. Does that the orthodoxy now that a properly diversified portfolio should include crypto?
 
MONICA: I think a little bit of crypto probably isn't the worst thing in the world, but you just can't go overboard. These evangelists who felt that 
 
 crypto is the future and there is going to be all end all you don't need the dollar. You don't need the euro. You don't need the yen.
 
And then why invest in boring stocks that may only go up 10 to 15 percent a year when you can buy crypto, that's what was turned out to be the folly 
 
 here. And I think that yes, people talk about how you know; you should have gold in your portfolio too. But again, most sane people say two to 3 
 
 percent, maybe five, not 25 or 50 percent.
 
And I feel the same way about crypto. If you want to have 2 percent of your portfolio in Bitcoin be my guess but don't put 70 percent of it in Bitcoin 
 
 that's insane. In the same way that anything with that much concentration would be insane.
 
ANDERSON: Well, for the past two days, we've been showcasing stories by CNN Academy students here in Abu Dhabi. And tonight I want to share a very 
 
 special piece not only was it entirely shot and produced by CNN Academy student on a mobile phone, but the participant turned the camera on to one 
 
 of her peers, a girl with a very special story.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
ANDERSON: Watch - here in the Middle East use her lens to tell the story of Aldana Alhashmi, pictured here on the left.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALDANA ALHASHMI, CNN ACADEMY STUDENT: Hello, my name is Aldana Alhashmi, I have bilateral Retinoblastoma cancer. And this is my story. It is a cancer 
 
 tumor that attacks the eyes. So it has attacked my whole right eye. And then onwards, it's attacked a quarter of my left eye and then half and then 
 
 three quarters.
 
So that gives me only a quarter of one eye to see from. You know, growing up, I took so many photos, so many videos because in that moment, I cannot 
 
 really see clearly. So then I go back and I look at the videos and photos I'm like, oh, OK, that other person was there. OK, we were in this 
 
 location.
 
Because I thought I felt like the cameras really made for me because in the olden days, like all the cameras had like one lens to see from. And I felt 
 
 like OK, that's perfect for me because I have one eye so like, this is meant, this was meant for me, you know, I love bringing new stories. And I 
 
 love putting things together like a puzzle, so one of the challenges in my life is not being able to drive.
 
Of course, I can never get my license. You know, I'm legally blind on in documents. So one of the challenges is, of course, always trying to find a 
 
 way to get somewhere like I work obviously. So I have to, you know, find a way to get to work, whether it's family, whether it's a taxi, whether it's 
 
 an Uber, whether you know its public transport, it's just always a challenge. I'm so happy and thankful that my cancer is asleep right now. 
 
 It's still in my body, but it is asleep.

ANDERSON: One of a terrific bunch of academicians who graduated just a couple of weeks ago. Look, this is my last show of the year. The last 
 
 "Connect the World" of 2022 and what a year it has been. I want to take a moment and say thank you to the teams working with me from all over the 
 
 world.
 
And I want to say a particular thank you to the tech teams who make this magic work day in day out, you are the glue. Thank you to our control room 
 
 colleagues all over the world. And thank you, the viewers, for tuning in wherever you are. It is a very good evening from Abu Dhabi. We will see you 
 
 I hope New Year's Eve from Dubai. Good night.
