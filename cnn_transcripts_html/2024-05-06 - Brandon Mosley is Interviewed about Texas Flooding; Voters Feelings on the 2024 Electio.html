SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: This morning, after days of flooding, the water is finally starting to recede in parts of Texas. Unfortunately, a four-year-old boy was swept away in floodwaters. His body has been recovered south of Fort Worth. 
 
And emergency crews rescued hundreds of people from high water across the state, including in the Houston area.
 
Joining me now is Texas Game Warden Captain Brandon Mosley.
 
Sir, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
I see some of those waters, the floodwaters, that have receded a bit behind you. You've been helping conduct rescues. What have you been seeing and experiencing?
 
BRANDON MOSLEY, TEXAS GAME WARDEN CAPTAIN: Well, right now, you know, we're on the downhill slide of - the backslid of this storm. Fortunately for us, the waters have started receding. But the biggest thing as always is neighbors helping neighbors and game wardens. 
 
And Texas game wardens, in part peace officers, working in conjunction with the Texas Division of Emergency Management, working as a team to get in, extract people and help rescue people, as many as we could. Some, I think in the east Texas area, and even northeast Texas area, we're at close to 400 rescues. So, it's been a busy week, but the - the - the men and women out there have worked extremely hard and - so we're very appreciative and glad to be able to help. 
 
SIDNER: Yes, we're seeing some video of one of those rescues showing a boat with people on it. 
 
We saw this during Hurricane Harvey as well. Can you compare and contrast what this was like compared to what we saw during Hurricane Harvey, because the devastation looks vast.
 
MOSLEY: Yes, ma'am. It's - it appears to be potentially even more devastating in some parts than Harvey. So, we definitely got a lot of rain in a quick amount of time. And that's one of the things in east Texas, we - we don't get the runoff. And - and when you have these flash flooding events, many times, unfortunately, they catch people off guard. And so, yes, we definitely have a lot of water in places that I have - in my life I've never seen standing and running.
 
SIDNER: Yes, I mean, you know, you say that in some places its way worse than Harvey, which is saying something. We were looking at some video there of animals being rescued as well and people, you know, animals are a part of the family for most people who have them. 
 
So, what - what can you tell us about the need right now? What is it that people need there in east Texas? 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
What is it that they are lacking? Some of them, obviously, have lost their homes.
 
MOSLEY: Well, certainly that is - that is the case. And, you know, when we go in and we do these search and rescue events (ph), you know, certainly life of families and people and pets is what we look at. But now, when you're in the recovery phase of it, you know, it's - it's now putting on the hat of peace officer. And just with people trying to get back to their homes, they want to be safe. And so now the recovery phase is beginning to happen.
 
SIDNER: Let me ask you about what's about to potentially happen in the central U.S., in Oklahoma, your next door neighbor there. What advice would you give to people as storms continue to come through, dropping huge amounts of hail, potential tornadoes, and flooding?
 
MOSLEY: I would just tell anyone to heed the warnings of your local county judges, your local law enforcement, you're Texas Division of Emergency Management or emergency management centers there in your area. Heed the warning. You know, many times we want to cling to our possessions when the biggest thing we can do is protect our families, protect life. And so heed those warnings. Get out and turnaround, don't drown. Make sure that you're listening to updates, listening to your weather stations, making sure that you're staying in tune with their warning.
 
SIDNER: Good advice, turn around, don't drown. I've heard that one before. 
 
Captain Brandon Mosley, thank you so much. I appreciate your time this morning.
 
MOSLEY: You bet.
 
SIDNER: John.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, this morning, a notable non-answer to a very easy question. Will you accept the presidential election results in November? So, this is the response from South Carolina Senator, and potential Trump running mate, Tim Scott.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, Senator, will you commit to accepting the election results of 2024, bottom line?
 
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump, and I'm excited to get back to low inflation, low unemployment and high enthusiasm (ph).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wait, wait. Senator, yes or no - yes or no, will you accept the election results of 2024 no matter who wins? 
 
SCOTT: That is my statement. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: That is his statement. It is not an answer. 
 
With us now, CNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten.
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Whoo.
 
BERMAN: Why is it that some Republicans who want to run what Donald Trump, who lost, by the way, in 2020 -
 
ENTEN: Yes, he did.
 
BERMAN: Don't want to answer, will they accept the results? 
 
ENTEN: Well, part of it is to try and impress Donald Trump. Part of it is because they may not believe that the votes will be counted accurately. 
 
All right, this is a recent Quinnipiac University poll. 2024 presidential election the votes will be counted accurately. Look, most Americans believe that they will be counted accurately. But let's go over to the GOP column, right? The majority of Republicans, 55 percent, have no confidence. They do not have confidence that the 2024 election votes will be counted accurately. So, it's not just that they don't believe what the 2020 was counted accurately. They don't believe that a future election, a one in which we don't know the results of yet, will be counted accurately, which is, of course, garbage, but a majority of Republicans do believe it. 
 
BERMAN: I think you might make an argument that Tim Scott is trying to play to that group of people.
 
ENTEN: Yes, he is.
 
BERMAN: Whether he believes it or not.
 
ENTEN: Very good.
 
BERMAN: In terms of Donald Trump, the expectations about what Trump will do I frankly think are stunning here, Harry. Explain that. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. So, he might not just be playing to the GOP base. He might be playing to what he expects that Donald Trump thinks should be the answer. Would concede if he lost in 2024. Most Americans believed that Joe Biden would concede if he lost in 2024. Heck, most Republicans believed that Joe Biden would concede if he lost in 2024. 
 
But look, would Trump concede if he lost in 2024? Most Americans do not believe that he would. Of course that makes some sense based upon history. But perhaps even more interestingly, most - very few Republicans do not believe that he would if he lost in 2024. Just 40 percent. 
 
So, Tim Scott may not just be looking at the Republican base and saying they don't believe the votes will be counted (INAUDIBLE) because the fact is most American (INAUDIBLE) can see if he, in fact, lost.
 
BERMAN: Tim Scott probably thinks he can't be picked as Donald Trump's running mate if he says (INAUDIBLE). 
 
Hang on one second, we've got some breaking news. Let's go over to Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: I'm going to - I'm going to take it now, boys, because your camera was acting a little bit crazy. So that's what we're going to do.
 
Let's talk about this right now. 
 
Joining us right now is former Trump 2020 director of strategic communications, Marc Lotter, and CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona. 
 
Let's hope this camera doesn't act crazy, because we're going to talk about some crazy I think is what we're going to do, guys.
 <br>[08:40:02]
 
OK, Marc, you have, I'm going to call it the, let the word games begin when it comes to people who would like to be Donald Trump's running mate. You hear that from Tim Scott and then you hear related - you hear this from Doug Burgum on CNN. Let me play this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: He's talking about pardoning them and he seems to be leaving the door open to potential violence if he loses again. Based on comments you've made in the past, that must concern you.
 
GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, I think the bigger context here, Jake, is really about elections in America. 
 
TAPPER: I'm talking about the violent insurrection that you yourself have decried.
 
BURGUM: Yes, and so - and - yes, well, you know, I'm - I'm looking forward to next January when Vice President Harris certifies the election for Donald Trump. TAPPER: Do you believe Joe Biden won the 2020 election?
 
BURGUM: I - I believed that Joe Biden won the 2020 election, but -
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: I did. I believe it, but, that's what we're starting to hear a lot more. 
 
And here's the thing, wrap it all up together. Marc, we hit on this a little bit last week, but I really do feel like we're entering that season of politicians where they don't give people enough credit. People can see through dodging and deflecting and invasive maneuvers on questions. Does this set these VP candidates up well to be running mate, though? 
 
MARC LOTTER, CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER, AMERICA FIRST POLICY INSTITUTE: Well, ultimately I don't think any of these interviews is what the deciding factor is going to be. I wrote something in "The Hill" about a month or so ago that really identified the four key characteristics that all vice presidential nominees have of both parties. They're picked either for demographics, geographic policy, or to unite the party. And the ultimate thing they all have is that they bring something to the campaign that the presidential candidate either thinks they need or wants more of. And so I think, you know, these interviews are great auditions, but ultimately it's going to be, can you move the needle with a key demographic or in a key swing state, and that's true of both parties I think when these candidates pick their running mate.
 
BOLDUAN: You're hinting at something interesting, Marc. One second, Maria. Do you think that there is, one of the people who are listed right now, what is the thing that's missing that they bring? 
 
LOTTER: Well, that's going to be - ultimately to be what Donald Trump would decide. Whether that's going to be, do I think that one of these - one of these potential candidates could move the needle with suburban women or with black and Latino voters, or could help turn a state that might be in play and make it not in play. So, all of those kinds of factors go into this. I don't think it would be a policy decision because, well, Donald Trump has already been president. So, I think it's going to be more likely that he would pick somebody for something else that they would bring to the table. 
 
Of course, in addition to the ability to serve, work well in the White House, be good partners, that goes without saying.
 
BOLDUAN: Marie, what do you think of one of the slides that Harry and John were just talking about, about expectations among Republicans and expectations among all voters being polled about what Donald Trump well do in 2024 and only 25 percent of overall voters in this poll think that Donald Trump will actually concede. And it's still even less than a majority of Republicans think Donald Trump will concede in 2024. That's a statement of what? 
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, frankly, it's a sustainment of Americans taking Donald Trump, not just from history, but from his own words, Kate. He hasn't even been able to say that he would concede if he loses. He hasn't even been able to say that he would engage in a peaceful transfer of power when and if Joe Biden wins in 2024. So, the American people are simply reacting to the words that Donald Trump has already stated. 
 
Plus, you know, history is a good indicator of what will happen if the same circumstances occur. And if the same circumstances occur, when Joe Biden wins, and Donald Trump is forced to hand over power - or not to hand over power but to admit that he lost and that he is not going to go into the White House, then we already saw what happened once. He's already said that he doesn't - you know, he hasn't said that he would concede. And so I think Americans are just reacting to that. 
 
And, frankly, that should worry us all. And I know, for example, that law enforcement is certainly planning to make sure that another January 6th doesn't happen because that is something that is a danger zone for the country going into the 2024 election thanks to Donald Trump's (INAUDIBLE) words.
 
BOLDUAN: Control room tell me if there's also craziness going on with my camera. I feel like we had some real fun gremlin going on today, guys. 
 
CARDONA: We can still see you.
 
BOLDUAN: Everyone hold hands. We're going to make it through together.
 
And with that I'm going to say, Marc, let's just go crazy ourselves. 
 <br>[08:45:03]
 
You get - this is a choose your own adventure. Do you want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene forcing a - forcing a vote on the Republican house speaker or do you want to talk about Kristi Noem and her latest defense of why she killed her dog? Go. Which one? 
 
LOTTER: I'll choose - I'll choose MTG. 
 
Look, I think you can have very serious policy disagreements with the speaker, or even the Republican leadership, but that is something for Republicans to handle after the November elections when we have a bigger majority and you can have that debate. Right now all of our focus needs to be on stopping the chaos that is being created by Joe Biden and Democrats, whether it's the economy, inflation, the border, the world is spinning out of control. Let's save our internal family fights for the right time, which is after the November election.
 
BOLDUAN: And, oddly enough, those Democrats who you're just railing against, those are the ones coming to the House speaker's rescue right now. And I'm not going to pretend, Maria, that the Democrats really want to really feel strongly that they want to help Mike Johnson keep his job. Politically, why are they doing it?
 
CARDONA: Well, I guarantee you that when and if that happens, it's not going to be for free, Kate. You know, there is going to be something to be had for Democrats coming to the rescue of Speaker Johnson. And he knows that. And I think that's one of the reasons why Marjorie Taylor Greene is actually using that against him because she is saying that he will now be indebted to the Democrats. She is saying that he will now be the puppet of Democrats. I don't think he'll be the puppet of Democrats, but I do think that what it will show is that in order to lead, you have to lead in a bipartisan manner. 
 
Sadly, in the Republican conference right now, that is not what the majority or at least people like Marjorie Taylor Greene want in their leaders because they want people who are just sycophants for Donald Trump, sycophants for the MAGA extremist. Mike Johnson knows that that is not how you lead, but he also understands that he still needs to keep the MAGA extremists within his own party and supporting him. And that's the difficulty that he's going to continue to face going into - especially going into the 2024 election. 
 
BOLDUAN: So, we're going to hold talking about Kristi Noem defending killing her dog by saying she thinks Joe Biden's dog should also be killed. Here's why we're going to save it, because I'm not entirely - I could almost say you could almost bet that we might have another round of this coming up next time we talked, guys.
 
CARDONA: Totally agree.
 
BOLDUAN: It's great to see you. Thank you so much. We held hands. We made it through together. 
 
CARDONA: Thanks, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Sara.
 
SIDNER: I want a different choose your own adventure, by the way. That was ruff.
 
All right, thank you, Kate.
 
This week could be a dramatic week in the criminal trial of Donald Trump. Could Stormy Daniels finally take the stand today? 
 
Also today, a spacecraft that has been riddled with mechanical problems made by a company that has been plagued by safety concerns, set to launch two astronauts into space. We will discuss, coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:52:36]
 
BOLDUAN: All right, we have this just in. The ten-month-old baby abducted after her mother and another woman were found murdered, that baby has now been found alive. Eleia Torres is this little baby girl that you see right here. No details have been released yet on the condition of little Eleia, but police do say they have a person in custody. Her five-year-old sister was found at the murders scene, having suffered a head injury, and she is now recovering in the hospital. More details to come, of course. So, at least 17 students at Princeton University have launched a hunger strike in protest over Gaza. They say they will abstain from all food and drink except water until their demands are met. Those demands include the university disclosing all its investments and then divest from companies that they say profit from Israel's war against Hamas. University officials say they are aware of the strike and physicians are monitoring the group.
 
And the terrifying scene we're going to show you that played out on a church's live stream. We have to warn you, as you watch this, this is disturbing. A man pulls a gun on a Pennsylvania pastor - this is during the church service. Pastor Glenn Germany says the man stopped and smiled before pointing his weapon. Thankfully, the man's gun jammed when he pulled the trigger, giving, as you see here, the church's deacon the time to jump into action, tackle the suspect. Germany says he thanks God that he's still alive.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GLENN GERMANY, PASTOR, JESUS' DWELLING PLACE CHURCH: While he was in the police car, I had a chance to go and speak to him again as well. And I asked him, you know, just as calm as me you're talking now, he said - I said, what makes you do it? I mean, what were you thinking? He said, I don't know.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: That suspect has been charged with attempted homicide. Police say they later found a man shot to death inside the suspect's home. That man's identity is still not know. 
 
Football great Tom Brady - John Berman, listen up - some consider him to be a GOAT, debate, the greatest of all time. So, Netflix decided he deserved - he deserved a roast with his very own GROAT, that's the greatest roast of all time. This special was hosted by Kevin Hart live streamed Sunday, and Brady proved to be a pretty good sport about it all. 
 
Watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TOM BRADY, RETIRED NFL QUARTERBACK: People ask, Tom, why would you do this roast now? It's simple, I can take all the hits. I would have done this earlier, but I've just been to busy winning championships, which explains why Paton did this roast eight years ago.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[08:55:08]
 
BOLDUAN: Brady's former teammates, comedians, even Kim Kardashian taking shots at the celebrated athlete. He retired last year after 23 years in the NFL 
 
John Berman, thoughts. BERMAN: I understand a lot of the jokes were naughty. I read the
 
 reviews this morning. Many of the jokes could not be repeated, even in the newspaper, let alone on (INAUDIBLE).
 
BOLDUAN: I mean your definition of naughty is like so much less naughty than most people's definition of naughty. 
 
BERMAN: Naughty. Like very naughty.
 
All right, tonight, Boeing plans to send two NASA astronauts into space after facing years of challenges and setbacks. The crew will travel to the International Space Station on Boeing's new Starliner spacecraft. 
 
With me now is NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.
 
Nice to see you, Administrator.
 
Just tell me about the significance of this launch tonight.
 
BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR: Well, first of all, understand, we don't launch until it's ready to go. And we think it's ready to go. There have been a lot of problems over the years, but space is hard. Spaces is unforgiving. And so it's taken a long time. We've got to test pilots, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, a man and a woman. They're the best of the best. And they will do this test flight at 10:34 tonight. 
 
BERMAN: This has been particularly frustrating I think for NASA working with Boeing. This is a craft that was, what, first commission in 2014. SpaceX was able to beat it by years and it was commissioned at the same time. Computer glitches, tape that turned out to be flammable. What are your concerns about how the process has worked with Boeing?
 
NELSON: Well, that's why we have a backup. That's why we had two spacecraft. SpaceX ended up being very successful early on after a lot of rough patches for SpaceX. But now, look, SpaceX is even launching this year at the cape, just SpaceX, about 150 times, and this Falcon Nine. And then the dragon capsule, it's overcome things. But now it's very reliable. That's what we have to do on spaceflight. And that's what we're doing with the Boeing Starliner. 
 
BERMAN: How important is it to have a hedge, a different company producing spacecraft so you don't have to have all your eggs in, frankly, Elon Musk's basket?
 
NELSON: Well, that's exactly why, as we go back to the moon, to have two landers. One was awarded to SpaceX. I insisted that we go and have a second competition. That was won by Blue Origin. So, for the same principle, with regard to these spacecraft going to low earth orbit to the International Space Station, we wanted the same thing to have two spacecraft that could land on the moon in the Artemis program.
 
By the way, John, we go back to the moon next year with our first launch of humans. BERMAN: You're talking - you talking about the moon, China's there now, unmanned spacecraft, but they're collecting rocks on the far side of the moon. That's their plan at least.
 
What happens if they get them? What happens if China brings those rocks back to earth and says, hey, we were here first?
 
NELSON: Well, we were on the moon several times a half a century ago. We're going back to a different part of the moon this time. We're going to the south pole where we think there's water. You don't take anything away from China's accomplishment. That's true. On the far side of the moon. But that's not where we're going. We're going to the south pole. And we're going to the south pole with astronauts.
 
But if - on a separate subject then between what the U.S. is doing, if China does - you've expressed concern about what would happen if China claims lunar territory. What would you do?
 
NELSON: Well, that's why it's important that we get there first, that they don't get there and all of a sudden say, this is our territory, keep out. Remember what they have done with the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. We don't want that to happen on the moon.
 
BERMAN: Well, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, thank you for being with us. We will all be watching this launch tonight. It should be an exciting moment.
 
A new hour of CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts right now.
 
BOLDUAN: Right now Donald Trump is on his way to another day in court. The big question he does not know the answer to right now, who's going to take the stand next.
