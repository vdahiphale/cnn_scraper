LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. Thanks for tuning in. I'm Laila Harrak. Ahead CNN Newsroom, American soldier Travis King is due back in the US anytime now. What we're learning about his release from North Korea.
 
Russia doubling down on its assertion that the commander of its Black Sea Fleet is alive and well. Their latest evidence shows. 
 
And border security and the migration crisis, how Republican presidential hopefuls tackle those issues in their latest debates. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN Newsroom with Laila Harrak. 
 
HARRAK: The American soldier who sprinted into North Korea more than two months ago is on his way back to the U.S. and could land anytime now. We're told Private Travis King will be taken immediately to an Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. 
 
According to North Korean state media, he was expelled after an investigation. U.S. officials say King's release came after intense diplomacy between multiple countries and stressed no concessions were made.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: When Travis King first crossed the border into North Korea, we tried to reach out a number of occasions. They rejected our direct approaches, ended up talking to Sweden and Sweden talk to us and help negotiate this transfer. But I would not see this as the sign of some breakthrough. I think it's a one off with them being willing to return this private.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, King was already facing disciplinary action before his faithful dash into North Korea during a tour of the DMC's Joint Security Area. And now further punishment could be imposed but a U.S. official says it is quite clear. King is very happy to be on his way home. 
 
CNN's Marc Stewart is following this live from Beijing. Good day Marc. Travis King expected to win anytime now. Do we know why North Korea decided to expel him now?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you Laila. It's really interesting. If we look at the events over the last few hours, we're getting two very different interpretations as to what took place. We have North Korea offering a very systematic explanation, saying that there was an investigation and expulsion even presenting a statement claiming to be from Private King, in which he says he made an illegal entry into North Korea and also condemned his treatment in the United States military. 
 
Of course, that is something that needs to be authenticated. We just don't know if that was truly his own words. 
 
Yet at the same time, we are hearing a response from the United States calling this a big diplomatic effort giving a lot of praise to Sweden for taking the diplomatic lead in all of this, as Sweden often does, but also giving credit to an extent to China, not necessarily for diplomatic moves, but for helping to facilitate the standoff, or this release, I should say, between North Korea and the United States allowing Private King to walk over a bridge from North Korea into China. 
 
Of course, there are questions about concessions, as you pointed out. And if we look further into both United States, it has been saying about this. There really is no question. I want to read a statement from a senior official on the topic of concessions. You said the answer is simple. There were none full stop. 
 
So we have two different interpretations. But indeed, Travis King is on his way to the United States with an arrival expected sometime this morning. Laila.
 
HARRAK: Momentarily. Marc, what happens next?
 
STEWART: Next Steps indeed. 
 <br>[01:05:00]
 
So he will likely be arriving at a medical facility a military facility in San Antonio, Texas that has a very large medical facility. So of course, the first question is his health. How is his health? We did hear from one U.S. official who said that he is in good health and in good spirits. 
 
But then the next question is this reintegration into the United States. This is a facility that is actually very well known for helping people who have been detained assimilate back into everyday life. It's a facility that Brittney Griner went through after she was released from Russia, of course, the well-known WNBA star, and then as far as this question as to next steps from an administrative standpoint, or a legal standpoint involving the private, that's something that the government is very made has made very clear. It's something that still needs to be determined. Laila.
 
HARRAK: Marc Stewart in Beijing, thank you so much. Joining me now is Patrick Cronin, Chair for Asia Pacific Security at the Hudson Institute and Scholar in Residence at Carnegie Mellon University. Sir, a very good day. Did you expect Travis King to be released relatively quickly?
 
PATRICK CRONIN, CHAIR FOR ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY, HUDSON INSTITUTE: I think nobody knew. And there was a good chance he could be held could have been held for months and even years, so no, is the short answer.
 
HARRAK: We compare his case to some of these precedent cases, how does his case compared to other Americans that were previously held by North Korea?
 
CRONIN: Well, he's the first American to have been held and now almost five years, so we have to go back in history. And the history is littered with cases where some of them were held on for bargaining chips. Some were released after very high level talk negotiations behind the scenes. And others were -- were essentially just discarded. 
 
In this case, it's unique case, because this was an unexpected opportunity that befell the Kim regime, when an American soldier dashed across the demilitarized zone, and intruded into North Korea. They didn't know what to make of him. And I think it took about a month to figure out that he was really of little value as a bargaining chip. And he was much more of a liability. 
 
He was a young man, far away from his home, distraught, and isolated. They did not want to repeat what happened to the poor American University of Virginia student, Otto Warmbier, when he essentially was killed in custody, because by the time he was released, he was brain dead and died a week later.
 
HARRAK: Yes, that's a very tragic case. I think everybody was thinking of him today. In terms of diplomacy, what does this now reveal about the channels of communication between the United States and North Korea and China, which also seems to have played an important role?
 
CRONIN: Well, China says that it facilitated didn't mediate. But indeed, China did play a significant role behind the scenes. I think it says a lot about what Pyongyang and the Kim regime is looking at, in terms of leverage. They see China and Russia as their main partners right now for negotiation. 
 
So having dealt with Russia recently on defense cooperation, now, Kim has back -- gone back to China to try to reassure him and Xi Jinping in particular in Beijing, that the Kim regime is about stability. It's not looking for instability, despite these weapons deals with Russia. 
 
So Kim did a sort of a good deed for the Chinese by saying, look, you hand over this American to the Americans, as Xi Jinping prepares for a summit meeting with President Biden the first summit meeting that the American and Chinese leaders will have had in a year since Bali, in Indonesia, when the two are expected to meet in San Francisco in November. 
 
I think Russia's cooperation with North Korea spooked even the Chinese a bit. So this was a goodwill message essentially from Pyongyang to Beijing, and then from Beijing to the United States to say, look, we want to make sure we're creating the conditions for goodwill and negotiations. You Americans should reciprocate and show us more goodwill. And make sure that Xi Jinping has a successful summit when he comes to California, as is expected in November.
 
HARRAK: So what happens now? Does everybody just move on? What does this episode mean for the US?
 
CRONIN: Well, for the U.S., this was a relatively minor incident from a geopolitical standpoint. And the Americans are breathing a sigh of relief that they essentially got an American home, and now they can put them through the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He'll probably end up being dishonorably discharged, maybe forfeit. Some pay, maybe held by doubt he'll be held long. 
 
I think it's time for this young man, Travis King, to get a second start. He's very young and start a successful hopefully civilian career. Long life ahead of him will.
 <br>[01:10:00]
 
For U.S.-North Korean policy possibly this is a sliver of an opening, because Kim Jong Un clearly is back to international diplomacy. He had been essentially in hiding under COVID. He's now gone to Russia. He's now dealt with the Chinese and the Americans through this diplomatic Gambit. 
 
And so maybe he'll be more open minded to American in treaties and to South Korean treaties to go back to the bargaining table. Not that he's going to be making any concessions, but he may be at least more willing to take some risks and diplomacy.
 
HARRAK: Patrick Cronin, thank you so much for this conversation.
 
CRONIN: Thank you.
 
HARRAK: Officials in Uzbekistan say a large fire has been contained after a powerful explosion at a warehouse in the capital city of Tashkent several hours ago. Well, that's according to Reuters, and AFP, citing local media. 
 
Several videos posted to social media show a large fire billowing into the sky. The warehouse is located close to the city's airport. And so far the cause of the explosion is unclear. And there are no immediate reports of casualties. This is a developing story and we'll bring you the latest as we learn more about what happened. 
 
And in Iraq, 14 people have been arrested in connection with a deadly fire at a wedding celebration. Authorities say the building did not meet safety criteria and the ceiling collapsed after fireworks were set off. They expect to have the results of the investigation within three days. At least 100 people were killed and 150 others were injured when flames broke out on Tuesday night at a wedding hall in northern Iraq. It was packed with 1,300 guests. 
 
The father of the groom tells CNN the bride and groom are being treated in the hospital. He blames the hall's owner for the disaster because he says there were no extinguishers or safety measures. The fallout from the crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh is growing by the day, more than 53,000 people including 17,000 children have fled the region into Armenia as of Wednesday evening, and that number means nearly half of the region's population has now left their ancestral homeland, with thousands more expected to follow. 
 
The mass exodus has led to scenes like this one that you see here lines of cars stretching as far as the eye can see along the latching corridor, the only road connecting the Enclave to Armenia while the sudden influx of refugees comes after neighboring Azerbaijan defeated separatists in the breakaway enclave last week. International aid groups the U.S., the EU and others are now calling for unimpeded humanitarian access to the region.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MILLER: Number one, we want to see the ceasefire maintained. Number two, we want to see humanitarian needs addressed. That means keeping the latching corridor open, it means ensuring that humanitarian supplies can come in and that it means an international monitoring mission to ensure that humanitarian needs are addressed. 
 
And I will say that we did welcome the comments by the government of Azerbaijan just a little while ago before I came up to this podium that they would welcome such an international monetary mission. That's something that the Secretary had directly pushed the president for, and we're glad to see his having agreed to it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, CNN's Scott McLean has more now on the humanitarian crisis from London.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): As the exodus of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh continues, there is plenty of concern about those still inside the territory. The Red Cross says that aid is getting in but the challenge now is getting injured people in urgent need of medical care out. 
 
It says the latching corridors so jammed up with people trying to leave that aid workers can't use it. The U.S., the E.U. and Germany have all called for international observers to be allowed into Nagorno-Karabakh to ensure the fair treatment of the rapidly dwindling number of ethnic Armenians who are still there. 
 
The Azerbaijani President has promised that minority rights will be respected and the U.S. State Department says that Azerbaijan has agreed to allow international observers in those so far, only aid workers have been able to gain access. Last week, there were reports of locals burning documents to cover up
 
 any evidence they were part of the separatist government out of concern. They could be persecuted now that Azerbaijan has regained control. 
 
On Wednesday, Azerbaijani authorities announced they had arrested Ruben Vardanyan on the Armenian border as he was trying to fleet. He's a wealthy businessman. The former state minister of the separatist government and he had Russian citizenship until he renounced it last year and seem to be particularly disliked by Azerbaijani officials while he was in office.
 <br>[01:15:02]
 
So far the only allegation against him is that he entered Azerbaijan illegally. Scott McLean, CNN, London.

HARRAK: Hundreds of former Wagner mercenaries have returned to the battlefield in eastern Ukraine. That's from the Ukrainian military, which says they're now working for Russia's Defense Ministry suggesting Moscow was desperate for troops. 
 
Many Wagner mercenaries went to Belarus after their boss Yevgeny Prigozhin led a short lived mutiny in Russia more than three months ago. Well, he later died and he's still explained plane crash. 
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. is slapping sanctions on companies from four countries for allegedly supporting Iran's drone program. They include businesses from Iran, Turkey, China and the UAE. Russia has been extensively using Iranian drones in his deadly strikes on Ukraine. 
 
Russia is going out of its way to prove the commander of its Black Sea Fleet is alive and well. Ukraine claimed Admiral Viktor Sokolov was killed in a strike on the fleet's headquarters on Friday, but as Fred Pleitgen reports, Russia has released a second video and as many days reportedly showing the admiral back on the job.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Nearly a week after Ukraine claimed to have killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet with a cruise missile attack. Now another sign he may very well be alive after all.
 
Russian military TV showing Admiral Viktor Sokolov handing out medals to a navy soccer team, although CNN is unable to verify when the video was filmed. The award ceremony had to be postponed for known reasons a reporter asked Sokolov to comment. No, it's postponed just because we were busy and had to push it back a few days he answers.
 
As to reassure local residents after the missile strike the admiral in denial. Nothing happened he says, life goes on. The new clip comes just a day after the Russians released a video apparently showing Sokolov attending a top level video conference call with the Russian defense minister seemingly propped up by a pillow. 
 
Russia still irate about the strike on the HQ the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman claiming without evidence Western involvement in the attack. There was not the slightest doubt that the attack was pre- planned using Western intelligence assets NATO satellite equipment reconnaissance aircraft, and was carried out at the instigation and in close coordination with the American and British intelligence services she said.
 
Both the U.S. and the U.K. maintain their militaries are in no way involved in the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, some residents in occupied Crimea are questioning how committed Russia is to their safety. After this video emerged purporting to show mostly women and children prevented from entering a bomb shelter during an air raid alert a few days ago. 
 
Why did you kick us out? A woman asks. I've been told the shelter is for employees only, the guard answers. All kids, all people kicked out into the streets she says. Moscow trying to portray strength in the aftermath of the Black Sea Fleet HQ attack, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu film visiting a missile factory that is allegedly increasing its output. 
 
But even videos released by the Russian military itself like this paratrooper unit shows Moscow's forces struggling to hold the line against the Ukrainian army on the battlefield, as Kyiv says its forces are the ones that have the momentum. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, eastern Ukraine.

HARRAK: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for Parliament's celebration last week of a Ukrainian World War II veteran who actually fought for the Nazis. The Speaker of the House of Commons later resigned from the position after he invited the elderly former soldier to Parliament, while Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited. CNN's Paula Newton has the details now from the Canadian capital.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): As the international fallout from the story continues, it was the Canadian Prime Minister's turn to apologize in his words. He said that this was a mistake and that it deeply embarrassed not just parliament, but all of Canada. But more than that he acknowledged what a propaganda win. This is for Russia and the fact that it had really harmed the Ukrainian effort. Listen.
 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: It is extremely troubling to think that this egregious error is being politicized by Russia and its supporters to provide false propaganda about what Ukraine is fighting for.
 
NEWTON: The Canadian Prime Minister acknowledging there that this has been deeply troubling for so many and has really harmed the Ukrainian effort.
 <br>[01:20:06]
 
Now more than that, Poland has confirmed to CNN that is looking into whether or not this man should actually be extradited to Poland for crimes that he allegedly may have committed during World War II. And to that end, they say they are now going to look at their evidence.
 
B'nai B'rith, the human rights organization that I spoke to earlier, says that the problem is Canada hasn't done this sooner. And the fact that Canada still has not made all its Holocaust error records, open and transparent. And for that reason, Nazis did in some cases, live a quiet life in Canada, listen now to what they should say should happen.
 
MICHAEL MOSTYN, CEO B'NAI B'RITH CANADA: And so by not doing the right thing in the past, it led to this absolute international disaster today. And so let's move forward. And the government needs to show leadership on this and it needs to be done yesterday. It's really unfair to everyone and again, least of all to our to our vets who fought against the Nazis.
 
NEWTON: And Michel Mostyn there makes the point that look if this had been cleared up, then this incident in Parliament would have never happened as Canada would have faced its past with the Holocaust in the way that he says should have been done a long time ago. Paula Newton, CNN, Ottawa.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Russia is asking the U.N. General Assembly to reinstate it as a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council. But the U.S. is calling that preposterous. The General Assembly threw Russia off the panel after it invaded Ukraine. Kyiv says quote, the place of Russian war criminals is on the benches of the tribunal, not in the U.N. Human Rights Council. 
 
And the U.S. says it hopes the U.N. will reject Moscow's candidacy as quote Russia has committed violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity in Ukraine as well as violations and abuses of human rights in Russia. 
 
Still to come. Germany deploys extra patrols to its borders why officials are being more vigilant as applications for asylum surge. Plus, Ireland has struck a blow against organized crime and drug trafficking brings details on their record breaking bust, ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Germany is tightening its border security effective immediately to limit human trafficking. The country's interior minister made the announcement on Wednesday explaining police will carry out flexible checks along Germany's borders with Poland and the Czech Republic. She says authorities from both neighboring countries support the move on it comes amid a surging number of asylum applications in Germany. Officials say there were more than 75 percent more applications from January to August this year than in the same period last year. 
 <br>[01:25:03]
 
Immigration has also been a hot topic as Germany nears regional elections. Israel will be joining the U.S. visa waiver program. The Biden administration announced the move on Wednesday meaning Israelis will soon be allowed to enter the U.S. without a visa and they can stay for up to 90 days. While the same will apply to Americans traveling to Israel. 
 
A group of democratic U.S. Senators had argued against the move based on how Palestinian-Americans are treated when they travel to Israel. And staying in Israel, Israel's Supreme Court is set to convene in less than two hours it's hearing a challenge to a new law marking -- making it harder rather to declare a prime minister unfit for office. CNN's Hadas Gold reports now from Jerusalem.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The case is being heard in front of the Israeli Supreme Court on Thursday is one that could have the most far reaching personal implications for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, because it could directly affect his ability to serve as leader of the Israeli government. That's because the Court is hearing petitions against a law passed in March that makes it much more difficult to remove a sitting Prime Minister from office by declaring them unfit to serve. 
 
For many say that this law was passed specifically to benefit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he faces an ongoing corruption trial. Under this new law, the only way a prime minister can be removed from office is for physical or psychological reasons that the Prime Minister they themselves declare themselves unfit for office, or supermajority in the cabinet ratified by a supermajority in the Israeli parliament vote to remove the prime minister from office. 
 
These are much higher levels makes it much more -- much harder to remove a prime minister from office than what the previous system was, which was essentially the Attorney General had rather wide latitude to declare a prime minister as unfit to serve. 
 
But the petitioners in this case, they argue that this law was inappropriately passed because it was done so they argue to specifically benefit Benjamin Netanyahu as he faces this ongoing corruption trial charges of which he denies. 
 
But supporters of this law say that if the Israeli Supreme Court unknown this law, that would be a danger to Israeli democracy, they say because it will be essentially throwing out the millions of votes that people cast for Benjamin Netanyahu to be Prime Minister, a decision in this case could come within a matter of weeks. 
 
And it's only this case is only one of several blockbuster cases being heard in front of the Israeli Supreme Court, most of them directly connected to Benjamin Netanyahu his government's plan to overhaul the Israeli judiciary. Just a few weeks ago, the Israeli Supreme Court heard challenges to another law that was passed in July that severely limited the Supreme Court's ability to hold government actions if they deem unreasonable.

HARRAK: Irish police have made their largest ever drug bust. They intercepted a cargo vessel carrying more than 2,200 kilograms of cocaine worth a whopping $165 million on Tuesday. Well, the ship was traveling from South America had it to crime groups in Ireland, the U.K. and Europe. Well, Ireland's a police force says they're determined to stop drug traffickers in their tracks.

JUSTIN KELLY, ASSISTANT GARDA COMMISSIONER: This is the largest drug seizure in the history of the state. This is a hugely significant operation, and it shows our unrelenting determination to disrupt and dismantle networks, which are determined to bring drugs into our country.

HARRAK: While three men were arrested on suspicion of organized crime and are being questioned by police. An American soldier has been released after months in North Korean custody. We'll have the latest on Travis King's journey home and what happens next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:31:21]
 
HARRAK: You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Laila Harrak. Thanks so much for your company.
 
An update now on our top story. 
 
The American soldier held in North Korea for more than two months is heading back to the U.S. The flight carrying Army Private Travis King is expected to land in San Antonio, Texas where U.S. officials say King will be taken straight to an army medical center. 
 
CNN's Will Ripley has details on his release and what led up to it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: When U.S. Army Private Travis King made a daring dash across the DMZ in July, many wondered if North Korea would use him as a political pawn like past American prisoners.
 
His speedy release in just over two months a surprise to many. Even more shocking, it came with no concessions, a U.S. official tells CNN, calling his quick release a result of intense diplomacy after weeks of trying to break down diplomatic barriers and open a direct line of communication with North Korea. The U.S. and North Korea have no formal diplomatic ties. Swedish
 
 diplomats in Pyongyang acted as intermediary sending word to Washington the North Koreans were ready to release the soldier. 
 
China allowed King to cross the border for a handover into American custody. A senior U.S. official telling CNN he is in good health and good spirit as he makes his way home. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just want my son back. Get my son home. 
 
RIPLEY: In the days and weeks since he disappeared, desperate pleas from Private King's family in Wisconsin.
 
JAQUEDA GATES, SISTER OF TRAVIS KING: Reach out to our mom and let him hear her voice. You know, he's not the type to just disappear.
 
RIPLEY: A phone call that finally came the U.S. adding King is very much looking forward to being reunited with his family. A family statement expressing gratitude and asking for privacy. 
 
King was the first active-duty soldier more than four decades to hand himself over to the North Koreans. State media claimed in August, King was running from inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army. A message that played right into North Korea's long running anti-U.S. narrative. Past prisoners served as props for Pyongyang's anti-U.S. propaganda, paraded in front of state TV cameras held for extended periods to gain concessions from the U.S. 
 
This time was different. North Korean state media barely mentioned King during his two months in custody. 
 
His release came far faster than others who spent months or even years in North Korean captivity. Some only released with the help of former U.S. presidents like Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.
 
Times have changed. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un focusing on his friendship with Chinese Xi Jinping while deepening his military ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 
King's quick release may be sign, analysts say, the value of a U.S. detainee just isn't what it used to be with U.S. relations at their lowest level in years.

HARRAK: The Republican candidates for the U.S. presidency are making their case to the American people. They gathered in California Wednesday night for their second debate. And once again, front runner Donald Trump was missing from the stage. 
 
CNN's Jeff Zeleny has details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The Republican candidates tangled furiously during a two-hour debate Wednesday night here at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California.
 
Time is clearly running out for many of these candidates to break through and emerge as a leading alternative to former President Donald Trump. 
 
That was clear from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who early on in the debate directly confronted the former president. 
 <br>[01:34:57]
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record where they added $7.8 trillion to the debt. That set the stage for the inflation that we have.
 
ZELENY: A short time later, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie followed suit. Of course, he's been building his candidacy off of a critique of the former president.
 
Now his indictments were not mentioned at all during the debate. But the former New Jersey governor said this. 
 
CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald, I know you're watching. You can help yourself. I know you're watching, ok. And you are not here tonight not because of polls and now because of your indictments. You're not here tonight because you are afraid of being on the stage and defending your record. 
 
ZELENY: South Carolina Senator Tim Scott had one of the strongest moments of the debate when he talked about the history of race in America. 
 
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our nation continues to go in the right direction. It's why I can say I have been discriminated against but America is not a racist country. 
 
Never ever doubt who we are. We are the greatest country on God's green earth, and frankly, the city on the hill needs a brand-new leader.
 
ZELENY: As the evening wore along, a spirited debate broke out between Tim Scott and fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley. Of course, she is the former governor of the state who actually appointed him to his senate seat in the first place. 
 
They tangled for one of the first times in the presidential campaign going after their histories of spending in other matters. Clearly this debate was a sign where these candidates are trying to emerge as the second place in this race against Donald Trump. 
 
There were common discussions on Ukraine, on China, on TikTok, on abortion policy and immigration. Again not mentioned, the indictments facing the former president. 
 
So seven candidates were onstage. But the one who is not, Donald Trump may have benefited the most of all.
 
Jeff Zeleny, CNN -- Simi Valley, California.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: And as Jeff just mentioned Donald Trump chose to skip the second GOP debate, just as he did the first one. Instead the former president traveled to the swing state of Michigan to campaign amid the auto workers, unlike President Biden who joined a union picket line the day before.
 
Trump toured a non-union facility outside of Detroit that is not on strike. Here's some of what he told them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want a future that protects American labor not foreign labor. A future that puts American dreams over foreign profits. And a future that raises American wages and strengthens American industry that builds national pride and that defends this country's dignity not squanders it all to build up foreign countries that hate us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: While immigration and the U.S. border crisis were hot topics at the Republican debates, there was plenty of blame for President Biden and even a proposal to use the U.S. military to go after Mexican drug cartels. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTIE: What I'll do on day one is sign an executive order to send the National Guard to partner with Customs and Border Patrol to make sure that we stop the flow of fentanyl over the border. But also to make sure that we send a much different message. 
 
We want you here in this country to fill the 6 million vacant jobs we have but only if you come here to follow the law and only if you come here legally. 
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need to make sure we put 25,000 more border patrol and ICE agents on the ground. And let them do their job. I've spent 400 miles down that border and I'm telling you, border patrol agents aren't allowed to do their job. 
 
Let's go back to the remain in Mexico policy. Instead of catch and release, let's go to catch and deport. 
 
VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Militarize the southern border. Stop funding sanctuary cities, and end foreign aid to Mexico and Central America to end the incentives to come across. MIKE PENCE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The truth is we need to fix a
 
 broken immigration system and I'll do that as well. But first and foremost a nation without borders is not a nation. And we have to secure the southern border of the United States of America. I know how to do it and we will it again. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Joining me now from New York. Raul Reyes is an attorney and CNN opinion writer who specializes in immigration. Always good to have you with us, Raul.
 
The crisis on the southern border, what did you make of the solutions being proposed by the candidates? 
 
RAUL REYES, CNN OPINION WRITER: Well, in the debate tonight some of the solutions that these candidates were proposing were not necessarily new ideas but they were really, I imagine, I would think, kind of long on rhetoric and a little short in terms of being actually feasible solutions.
 <br>[01:39:49]
 
REYES: When Nikki Haley talks about wanting to send more border patrol, more resources to the border that's an idea but in truth our border has never been more resourced. The border patrol budget has gone in the last 40 years from about $300 million to $5 billion. $5 billion in 2021.
 
When Chris Christie talks about immigrants being welcomed in this country as long as they immigrate legally and basically get in line, he's overlooking the fact that that could take between 20 and 30 years. It overlooks the fact that our immigration system is extremely outdated and outmoded for the realities of the 21st century. 
 
And then we have (INAUDIBLE) you know, like for example Mike Pence when directly asked about things like DACA, he sort of pivoted away to talking about a nation not having any border.
 
So some of the answers were evasive but it just seems that once again we didn't see any new feasible solutions for what is a crisis right on our doorstep. 
 
HARRAK: Right at the doorstep and more people are making their way to the border. The candidates squarely put the blame at President Biden's feet. In your view, how are current government border policies addressing this crisis and how is the Biden administration handling the situation? 
 
REYES: I think right now, the Biden administration is running into problems that have bedeviled past administrations. That is the true power to create immigration policy lies with Congress. The president is very limited in the actions he can take.
 
For example President Biden and President Obama, President Trump all took executive action on immigration. And then what happened? Governors from the opposing party immediately launched legal challenges and that sort of delayed these policies and we end up basically with the status quo. 
 
So I think presidents are limited in terms of what we can do. But looking at the big picture, going back say 40 years no matter who is president, our immigration policies have really not worked. 
 
We have tried deterrence. We have tried long-term detention. Family separations under President Trump, the anti-COVID policy in 2020, Title 42. And what have seen during that time? We've seen more than a generation, we've seen more apprehensions, more unauthorized crossings, an increase in families being apprehend at the border. 
 
So in my view, I think it's time that our Congress steps back and takes a more comprehensive view of this problem that requires cooperation and compromise which obviously are in very short supply in this Congress. And it also requires more coordination between state governors, not just along the border but around the country, and the president. 
 
But given the realities of our political system that's pretty unlikely as you know. And we also this reflected in the fact that President Biden only has a 31 percent approval rating on immigration which is, you know, that really is a hindrance to its efforts to mobilize the public behind him when basically two-thirds of the country does not like what he's doing. 
 
HARRAK: Raul, very quickly if you can, final thought as the country, you know, long known for accepting immigrants mostly. Where do Americans stand on the issue of migration and the border crisis. Does it drive how people vote? 
 
REYES: In the Republican Party, immigration is absolutely a top tier issue. It has not particular been a high issue among Democrats. However that is changing as more and more states, blue states and red states are being affected by this migration crisis. I think that we will increasingly see both parties, have this thing a mobilizing issue for both parties which puts a lot of pressure on the Biden administration to come up with creative solutions that are still within the boundaries of the law.
 
HARRAK: All right. Raul Reyes, thank you so much 
 
REYES: Thank you. 
 
HARRAK: Now, just ahead, how seaweed may be one of our planet's greatest untapped resources with the potential to address some of our biggest challenges.
 <br>[01:43:49]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Throughout this week, "Call to Earth" is turning the spotlight on France and the man who believes seaweed is our planet's greatest untapped resource. Seaweed develops in water all over planet but guest editor Vincent Doumeizel says we still know very little about it. 
 
A world-renowned French research center aims to change that with an extensive focus on the science of seaweed. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The city of Brest is hosting the weeklong European Phycology Congress. Phycology being the study of algae, is what brought Vincent and hundreds of other seaweed advocates to the Brittany region. 
 
VINCENT DOUMEIZEL, LLOYD'S REGISTER FOUNDATION: I think I believe that it's positive. I mean it's (INAUDIBLE) with a lot of excitement, generating a lot of (INAUDIBLE) topics in seaweed. So I think we are all full of optimism in the seaweed community. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The seawater that goes into the aquarium here, there you want to have some phytoplankton and things in it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today a delegation from the conference had made its way to the seaside town of Roscoff along Brittany's northern coast.
 
Referred to as the seaweed capital on the region's official tourism Web site, here you'll indeed find it everywhere -- in the shops, on restaurant menus and, of course, covering the rocky shorelines. 
 
In the middle of it all, hugging the waters of the English Channel is the renowned scientific research and training center, the Roscoff Marine Station.
 
DOUMEIZEL: It's a very important place. Roscoff is where we first discovered the life cycle of the kelp. It has 150 years of experience in seaweed science and marine science. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And this man, marine biologist Philippe Potin, who Vincent refers to as his brother in algae, is the center's research director.
 
PHILIPPE POTIN, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, ROSCOFF MARINE STATION: Here we have very international important (INAUDIBLE) by some colleagues from U.K., from Germany, from the States, from Portugal. (INAUDIBLE) people for choosing seaweed studies. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: From genome sequencing to studying seaweed's impact on human health, Philippe says they've been able to plethora of new-found knowledge. 
 
POTIN: We have during the last 20 years, related to a lot of (INAUDIBLE) fishes and this is available for visitors who want to come to Roscoff and of course, we are part of a lesser (ph) program in Europe so Roscoff is really providing a lot of exercise along algae especially for seaweed. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vincent says one of his biggest concerns is that globally seaweed are disappearing at an alarming rate. DOUMEIZEL: There is a fire below water, just like there's one in
 
 (INAUDIBLE) but we should protect, we plant and cultivate. Otherwise they will disappear soon. And we will as well. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: While more seaweed is cultivated year after year, both experts and critics agree that as the industry scales up, it needs to be done for the right reason. 
 
DOUMEIZEL: I mean we want to make sure that when you are growing seaweed you do not do any harm to the environment. We want to see only positive outcomes from the seaweed population. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is quite simply a lack something like know- how. 
 
DOUMEIZEL: I think the big problem that we have in the West is that we still don't know how to cultivate. So understanding the life cycle of the seaweed and understand the mix of bacteria around them ought to put them in the right condition to grow. I think most of the discussion we had this week were around that.
 <br>[01:49:44]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's where institutes like the Roscoff Marine Station play such a critical role. 
 
DOUMEIZEL: This western world is getting interested in seaweed and there's no other way I think. If we are ever to get together to do that, then we could be remembered as the first generation on this planet that will be able to feed the entire population of this world while mitigating climate change, repairing biodiversity, and alleviating poverty. But we will need to be all together to do that. And I do believe that we will.

HARRAK: Well, for more on how seaweed is one of our planet's most valuable resources, tune in to the full documentary, "CALL TO EARTH: SEA OF HOPE" airing this weekend on CNN.
 
We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Imagine your first steps in gravity, your first of really fresh air after more than a year floating in the International Space Station. 
 
Well, that is what NASA astronaut Frank Rubio is experiencing right now. He and two Russian colleagues landed safely in Kazakhstan on Wednesday. Rubio's 371-day trip is the longest time an American has ever spent in microgravity.
 
He was only supposed to be there for six months. But NASA needed to find a new ride because the spacecraft he was supposed to travel home in -- home back, began leaking coolant and would be dangerous for the crew. 
 
Rubio spoke to reporters upon landing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FRANK RUBIO, ASTRONAUT: Fantastic. Yes, everybody did really well. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You look very well. 
 
RUBIO: Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very well. 
 
RUBIO: Thank you. It's good to be home.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Rubio says he's most excited to see his family and experience the peace and quiet of earth away from the constant mechanical hum of the space station. 
 
Dubai is turning to self-driving vehicles to help cut down on traffic accidents and congested streets. Well, the city will deploy five robo- taxis next month made by Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors. The company already has driverless vehicles on the streets in the U.S. but Dubai will be its first international launch. City officials plan to roll out 4,000 of the self-driving taxis by the year 2030, part of a 15-year deal with Cruize. 
 
A team of experts is using artificial intelligence to help a paralyzed man move his arms and hands again. The technology is still in its infancy but if trials are positive, it could be used to help millions regain mobility. 
 
CNN's Nick Watt reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVE MARVER, CEO, ONWARD: If you talk to people with paralysis, it's their number one priority. They want to restore hand and arm function even above - they prioritize that above the ability to stand and walk again. 
 
NICK WATTS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Here's how it works. An implant is placed on the brain above the motor cortex. A.I. in that implant deciphers intent to move arms, hands, fingers then relays that information wirelessly to another implant in the body. So bypassing the damaged spine.
 
A.I. in that implant triggers the right muscle to actually make those movements. They call this thought-driven movement. 
 
Dr. Jocelyne Bloch performed the surgery. 
 <br>[01:54:47] DR. JOCELYNE BLOCH, NEUROSURRGEON, LAUSANNE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: We remove a little bit of bone. We replace the piece of bone by this set of electrodes. And then we close the skin. This implant is going to work wirelessly and activate the spinal cord stimulation.
 
WATT: Her partner, a neuro scientist, first had this sci-fi idea years ago, then waited for tech to catch up. 
 
DR. GREGOIRE COURTINE, NEUROSCIENTIST: If you are paralyzed with your hands and you can just open and close, you change so that you can eat. You are gaining independence. The change in the activity of delivery is dramatic. It's why this new project is so exciting. 
 
WATT: We met Bloch and Gregoire Courtine in July to discuss their previous project, another world first, fitting a similar device to this man who lost the use of his legs after a bicycle accident.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now the implants are able to capture my thought for walking. And able to transfer to the stimulator in my lower back.
 
WATT: But they say restoring arm and hand function is actually harder. 
 
MARVER: It's more refined, especially if you want to extend the restoration of movement to the fingers and not just the arms, so help them grasp something or help them use individual digits. 
 
WATT: "While it is still too early to provide full results," Onward told us, "we are pleased to report that the technology works as expected and appears to successfully reanimate his paralyzed arms, hands and fingers.
 
MARVER: We will learn a lot from that first person. Then we'll expand to four or five people and then it that goes well, we'll conduct a global pivotal trial and hopefully get FDA approval and make it available. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WATT: A lot of work still to be done for sure. But they (ph) would be trial surgeries have proved this can be done. Something many people thought was impossible, restoring movement after a spinal cord injury. 
 
One legal ethicist told me so many people could benefit from this, that have an ethical imperative to continue this research. 
 
We looked into this and so much more for an episode of "THE WHOLE STORY" airing here on CNN next month.
 
Back to you. 
 
HARRAK: Members of Singapore's military had an unusual task to earlier this week to detonate a World War II era bomb. 
 
Officials say the 100-kilogram bomb was found at a construction site. Thousands of residents evacuated so the controlled detonation could be carried out. Local media say it was the largest-ever exercised involving a World War II relic in Singapore. The explosive is believed to been left behind by the Japanese. 
 
Thanks so much for watching. I'm Laila Harrak.
