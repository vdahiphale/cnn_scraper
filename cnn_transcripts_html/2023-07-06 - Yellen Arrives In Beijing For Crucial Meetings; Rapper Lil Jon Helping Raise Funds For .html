JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Administration setting expectations for this round of meetings.
 
JOSH ROGIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, John, just like with the previous trip of Secretary of State Tony Blinken, the expectations could not be set lower. What they say is that they want to set a new normal and perhaps have a thaw in U.S.-China relations, which is a good goal. No one could be against having good China -- U.S.-China relations.
 
But don't expect any sort of trade deals. Don't expect the administration to back off any tariffs or investment bands like the Chinese government wants. Just expect a lot of happy meetings where we say that we're going to avoid the economic war, and then a return to the tensions that we've seen.
 
Because at the baseline analysis, the Chinese government is not willing to stop any of its economic aggression. And the U.S. government's not willing to let any of that go. So, this will be a roadblock in the ever-descending U.S.-China relationship. Nothing more.
 
BERMAN: Janet Yellen is a known figure to Chinese officials from her time as Fed chair, now to her time as Treasury Secretary. How do they view her, and how might that be different from other U.S. officials?
 
ROGIN: Right. Well, the Chinese government according to officials that I talked to, they don't really like Tony Blinken. They don't like the fact that he wants to talk about the Uighur genocide and national security issues and China's military aggression. They are hoping that they're getting a more sympathetic ear from Janet Yellen.
 
And to a degree, they're right about that. She has a more moderate stance. She represents the Treasury Department and Wall Street, which wants to make economic relations better.
 
But, again, that only goes so far. Unless the Chinese government's willing to play ball on some of the things that the United States is concerned about. They can just have a bunch of happy meetings.
 
And you know, Janet Yellen, of course, would like to lower tariffs and get back to business. But it takes two to tango. And I don't think the president's about to make unilateral concessions to China heading into this campaign election season.
 
BERMAN: How important is Ukraine now in U.S.-China relations? And by that, I mean, how much of U.S. attitudes and discussions with China are about keeping them from providing, you know "lethal aid," or at least much more of it directly to Russia?
 
ROGIN: Right. Yes, as you said, it's -- I mean, it's really kind of a shell game. I mean, the Chinese private corporations are providing the Russians with enough gunpowder to make eight million bullets.
 
And then the Biden administration says, well, that's the private companies. That's not the government. Everybody sort of knows the sleight of hand that's going on there but hey, it's better than the Chinese government arming the Russians openly.
 
And if the Chinese government wants to tell the Russian government, hey, you better not nuke Ukraine, or we'll be angry. That's fine. So, I think it's sort of an agreement where we look the other way as they help the Russians. They don't help the Russians as much as possible. And that's kind of something that's better than the alternative, which is an open arming of the Russians by China, which is something that nobody wants.
 
BERMAN: As they have welcomed the senior U.S. officials the last several weeks, I guess the question is, why? Is there anything that Xi Jinping fears, or is trying to prevent from the United States?
 
ROGIN: Yes. John, that's actually the most important question. You know, the Chinese Communist Party rules by a simple bargain with the Chinese people. You give us your freedom. We'll give you economic success.
 
So, without the economic success, the whole theory of the Chinese Communist Party's rule collapses, so they really want a good economy. Now, of course, we want a good economy, too. We just don't want it on their terms.
 
So, of course, Xi Jinping is going to try to charm Wall Street, try to charm Janet Yellen into letting go of the tariffs and sanctions so that they can get back to business. But at the same time, he's cracking down. Arresting Americans and cracking down on foreign businesses. So, that's why I think things are going to get worse before they get any better.
 
BERMAN: Cracking down. China cracking down in Hong Kong, but it does seem at least as if the U.S. has some cards depending on how it chooses to play them. Josh Rogin, great to see you. Thank you so much for the discussion. Kate?
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: So, the White House says that is keeping a close watch on the situation that's been unfolding in the West Bank town of Jenin. The Israeli military operation that occurred there is now over. It left 12 Palestinians dead, one Israeli soldier was killed, dozens of homes destroyed, and critical infrastructure also damaged. Now, Israel claims all of those killed were combatants involved in terrorism. But the United Nations is now raising alarm that the strikes and the ground operation may constitute a war crime.
 
CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is live in Jerusalem for more on this. And, Salma, you were there in the aftermath of the operation. What happens now?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, today really the residents of Jenin camp are trying to piece their lives back together. As you mentioned, the lack of basic services. The dozens -- hundreds of homes that have been damaged or destroyed. Many families simply trying to make things better with their bare hands with a broom in any house so that they could get to they could rebuild what they have left.
 <br>[11:35:05]
 
Schools also shut down many of them because of the lack of basic services. But alongside the suffering in a place that was already deeply suffering, one of the most impoverished corners of the West Bank, we also saw a spirit of defiance, of anger, of resistance. There are images I know that we have to show you of one of the first things that took place when people returned to the camp, which was a huge funeral procession for those 12 people killed in the ground incursion. That funeral quickly turned into a demonstration.
 
And what was so striking to see was that the armed resistance factions, those very groups that Israel was trying to weaken, were out in full force in that funeral procession. Making no attempt to hide it. Strapped with their logos. Carrying their flag. Sending a clear message that they were unbroken by Israel's ground and air operations.
 
And that is where the question lies. Israel's military says it was able to achieve its objectives. It was able to break the back if you will of combatants and terror networks there. But will this only offer a temporary respite at the cost of just deepening that anger and hatred within Jenin?
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. I do not know that -- answers to that question. Yes, that's for sure. Salma, thank you very much. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Now, for a bit of levity. You know what I don't have to do today? Snap my fingers and take a step all by myself.
 
You know why? Because look who's in the house. Lil John, a world- famous rapper.
 
He's going to talk to us about all his wonderful work in Ghana, what he's doing for education, and what he's up to now. It's kind of crazy. We'll have that next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:41:12]
 
SIDNER: For 15 years, the Pencils of Promise organization has impacted nearly a quarter of a million students around the world. The charity has helped build nearly 590 schools and delivered more than a thousand water filters to communities in need.
 
Rapper -- world-famous rapper, Lil Jon has been working with Pencils of Promise for more than a decade now. And we have him here. You know it's a special day when we have chairs here -- 
 
LIL JON, RAPPER/PRODUCER: I was going to bring that up.
 
SIDNER: On NEWS CENTRAL. This is -- this is so outrageously wonderful. Thank you for coming. Thank you for the chairs, people. The world -- 
 
LIL JON: Thanks for having me.
 
SIDNER: So, obviously, the world knows you were sort of the king of crunk. Your music can get even a wallflower off the wall and onto the dance floor. But they are doing some really serious work. Tell me about your work in Ghana.
 
LIL JON: Well, I've been working with Pencils of Promise for over 10 years. I'm about 10 years. And I was inspired -- one time I went to one of their charity galas.
 
And I was inspired by a couple of things about how much money they were raising that night. And about the stories of people who had built schools in you know Ghana, I think Laos, and it's another country they also build schools in. But the stories of the people have built -- that built those schools. And to see the children's faces when they -- you know, they had a video you know, the presentation of the schools and see those kids' faces, it inspired me to want to do for my people too, you know.
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
LIL JON: So, the fact that they were building schools in Ghana, I was like -- that night, I was like I want to build two schools right away. I knew what I wanted to do. And we raised some money. I donated money and we built two schools in Ghana.
 
SIDNER: So in 2019 -- 2018, I think you broke ground for the schools in Ghana. Can you explain to me what that moment was like, where people are there you know, this is about to be something big a champion in education?
 
LIL JON: Well, it was -- it's like kind of mind-blowing to go and you think we are people always want it I'm not doing so well, right now, I don't have this or we complain about things and you go into these villages where they don't have running water. They live in huts, you know. I saw the schools that -- you know, some of the schools that they had before we came in got involved and there was like, no air conditioning, no -- like a tree -- they were doing classes under a mango tree.
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
LIL JON: Like outside in Africa. So you know, it's hot. SIDNER: Yes.
 
LIL JON: There's animals walking by, so the kids are easily distracted. So, to go in and to see all of that, it's just -- you know it just blew my mind. And you know I was felt blessed that I was able to help these future generations of children that can now go on and be whatever they want to be because of the power of education.
 
SIDNER: It can help a whole village, that one person educated, right?
 
LIL JON: Right.
 
SIDNER: I want to move on to something else you're doing. Because you're not just in the rap game. You're not just in the charity world. You're doing a new show. Now, what is it that Lil Jon wants to do?
 
LIL JON: I want to do what? That's the name of the show. "Lil Jon Wants To Do What?" And it's about home improvement. Myself and my co- designer Anitra Mecadon, we go and we redo people's homes.
 
SIDNER: I have an address for you if you want to come on to -- 
 
LIL JON: You got a budget though. You got a budget?
 
SIDNER: I mean, sure. Sure, I've got the budget. So, you're taking part in this. It's interesting because here you are breaking ground to build schools in Ghana.
 
LIL JON: Right.
 
SIDNER: And now, you're revamping people's houses.
 
LIL JON: Right.
 
SIDNER: What the heck got you into doing this?
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
LIL JON: Well, I had to do my own home. I had a -- 
 
SIDNER: Rough.
 
LIL JON: I was in L.A. living and I was still having my home in Atlanta. A pipe burst top floor. Flooded the house. It was running for a week. So, I had to get my house out and went to two back contractors.
 
So, going through all that process, I wanted to just put my house back together in a way better way than it was before.
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
LIL JON: So, I was -- one day, I was watching Home Improvement shows trying to get some inspiration. I saw Anitra on television. She had a show at the time. And I reached out like would you be down to do some work with me on my home. SIDNER: Wow.
 
LIL JON: So, we got together and we design my home. Put my home together. And when we were done, her husband was like you guys -- first of all you guys work really good together.
 
And second, your designs are insane. You guys need to do a show together. So, we put together to show and here we are with "Lil Jon Wants To Do What" on HGTV.
 
SIDNER: "Lil Jon wants to do what? Renovate.
 
LIL JON: Yes.
 
SIDNER: OK. Well done. Thank you so much.
 
LIL JON: That's a promo. We need -- 
 
SIDNER: I'm a fan.
 
LIL JON: I need that for a little promo place.
 
SIDNER: Thank you so much for coming in early and hanging out with us.
 
LIL JON: Thanks for having me. Also to you.
 
SIDNER: And we will all be right back.
 
LIL JON: Chairs. We got chairs.
 
SIDNER: This is the first. This is a first for our show.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:50:44]
 
BERMAN: A new government study finds that nearly half of the tap water in the United States is contaminated with what are called forever chemicals. And scientists believe they may be more hazardous to our health than previously thought. CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard is with us now. What exactly are we talking about here, Jacqueline?
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: John, what we're talking about, forever chemicals are basically PFAS chemicals. Those are polyfluorinated perfluorinated alkyl substances. And they are part of the items that we encounter every day.
 
Like you can find them in a non-sticking cooking pan or in fast food containers. And they're called forever chemicals because they break down very slowly.
 
Now, for this new study that just came out, what researchers did, they analyzed tap water samples from more than 700 sites across the United States. Those samples included private wells, public sources, and they found about 45 percent of water samples contained PFAS chemicals. And they noted that most of these samples containing PFAS were in or near big cities, in or near urban areas.
 
And this isn't meant to scare people, John, but it's more so to raise awareness about how really prevalent these chemicals are. And we know that they have been linked to certain cancers, to thyroid disease. There is ongoing research looking into the public health implications here but one takeaway for all of us one way to reduce your own exposure to PFAS chemicals would be to use a carbon filter for your water at home or there are even tests you can purchase online or from certified labs to test your own water.
 
And we know that public utilities are doing a lot of work in this. EPA is doing a lot of work on this. But these are forever chemicals so that work will take some time. Take some resources. But, John, that's the takeaway here is just the prevalence of PFAS chemicals in our water, it seems to be more widespread than previously thought.
 
BERMAN: Yes. It was a very high number. All right, Jacqueline Howard, thank you so much.
 
HOWARD: Yes.
 
BERMAN: Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: So Meta is taking on Musk. Elon Musk's Twitter is facing its most direct threat, burly yet from none other than Mark Zuckerberg. The new app is called Threads, and it launched overnight.
 
Joining us right now is CNN's Brian Fung for more on this. And, Brian, Zuckerberg just announced that some 30 million people have already signed up since it launched.
 
BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: Yes. Kate, truly a staggering level of growth here that we're seeing in this new app that is designed to take on Twitter. And you know it was 10 million at first in the first seven hours. Now, as you said, up to 30 million in the first 16 hours.
 
By comparison, you can look at how many users Twitter had. The last time it was publicly disclosed, it was about 237 million daily monetizable active users. So, we're really seeing, you know, Twitter. having -- feeling the heat right now from Threads and the enormous numbers of people signing up for this massively popular app here.
 
How does this app actually work? Well, one of the reasons why it's so successful is that it works through Instagram. So, you use your Instagram account to sign up.
 
And after you've signed up, you're presented with a very familiar Twitter-like interface where you can post Threads, which is what you know posts are called on, Threads, and images. You can reply in nested Threads as well.
 
All of this is -- should be very familiar to anyone who's been on Twitter. And really the goal here that Meta has is to make it as easy as possible to jump from Twitter to this new app. And it seems like it may be working. You know, there are some limitations here. The app only provides you with an algorithmic feed, so you can't you know search -- only see content from the people you follow. There are very limited search features and no hashtags or other organizing tools just yet.
 
Some of that may eventually be developed. But right now, it's a very bare-bones Twitter-like client. But you know, all that said, we are seeing a lot of growth right now on this new app that everyone is wondering, could this be a Twitter killer, Kate?
 <br>[11:55:01]
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. I mean -- and you know that Elon Musk is hearing this as well. And he's not one to be quiet. And he's not one to shy away from a few that seems to really be growing between these two men. Has Musk said anything?
 
FUNG: Well, all he's really done is just kind of like some criticism of Threads. And that's pretty -- been pretty much it. So well, we may have to wait until this cage match if it happens to really see the outcome here.
 
BOLDUAN: All right. Brian Fung, great to see you. Thanks, Brian. You signed up.
 
BERMAN: I'm a big deal on Threads. I'm a very big deal on this new social media app. I signed up. I'm a serious influencer, don't underplay this.
 
BOLDUAN: How many followers do you have?
 
SIDNER: OK.
 
BOLDUAN: Can you see your followers on Threads?
 
BERMAN: I think I have three. But it's growing.
 
BOLDUAN: Excellent.
 
BERMAN: I could be at five by the end of the show.
 
SIDNER: Me, you, and -- 
 
BOLDUAN: I haven't signed up but I will.
 
SIDNER: Maybe his family.
 
BOLDUAN: But we shall. We shall.
 
SIDNER: I'm in. Thank you so much for joining us. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.</pre>
