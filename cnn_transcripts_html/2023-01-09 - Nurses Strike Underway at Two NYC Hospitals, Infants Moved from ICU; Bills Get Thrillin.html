THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Those industries just so happen to make up a core part of LinkedIn's user base. In 2022 LinkedIn's mobile app was downloaded 58 million times around the world. That is up 10 percent from the year before. 
 
We're at top of the hour. Let's reset. 
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Good morning. It is being called Brazil's January 6th. The capital there under siege by protesters who stormed government buildings over false claims a recent presidential election was rigged. We're going to take you there live. 
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  In politics, President Biden has just made his first visit to the border since taking office. He did not see or meet with any migrants, though. We'll speak to the mayor of El Paso about the crisis happening on the ground there in his city and Biden's new crackdown on the immigration search. 
 
HARLOW:  In sports, Damar Hamlin set to be released from the hospital as tributes pour in from across the NFL after the life-threatening hit on the field. We're going to take you exclusively to the field as his teammates speak on the team's thrilling and emotional return. 
 
LEMON:  She has been missing for nine days now, and the husband of the Massachusetts mother has been arrested, but she's still nowhere to be found. Details on the charge and the search straight ahead. 
 
COLLINS:  And in a revealing new interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Prince Harry says that he long believed his mom had faked her death and reveals why he blames Camilla for the negative stories about him. Anderson is going to join us live in just moments. 
 
CNN THIS MORNING starts right now. 
 
LEMON:  So we'll begin this morning with that interview. Good morning, everyone. Prince Harry with new revelation revelations about his fractured relationship with the royals. During an interview with our very own Anderson Cooper on "60 Minutes" last night, he talks about the physical altercation he had with his brother, Prince William, over his relationship with Meghan. Anderson is standing by. He's going to join us in just a moment. But first, I want you to take a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX:  He was shouting at me. I was shouting back at him. It wasn't nice. It wasn't pleasant at all, and he snapped, and he pushed me to the floor. 
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  He knocked you over? 
 
HARRY:  He knocked me over. I landed on the dog bowl. 
 
COOPER:  You cut your back. 
 
HARRY:  Yes, I cut my back. I didn't know about it at the time. Yes, but he apologized afterwards. It was a pretty nasty experience. 
 
COOPER:  Do you speak to William now? Do you text? 
 
HARRY:  Currently no. But I look forward to us being able to find peace. 
 
COOPER:  How long has it been since you spoke? 
 
HARRY:  A while. 
 
COOPER:  Do you speak to your dad? 
 
HARRY:  We haven't spoken for quite a while. Not recently. 
 
COOPER:  Can you see a day when you would return as a full-time member of the royal family? 
 
HARRY:  No. I can't see that happening. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON:  That was an amazing revelation for me. He also opened up about his decades' long struggle with grief following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The interview was Harry's first with a U.S. outlet in advance of the publication of his book, "Spare," releases online in the U.S. here tonight. 
 
Joining us now, our colleague and also who did that interview on "60 Minutes" with Prince Harry, Anderson Cooper. Anderson, good morning to you. It's good to see you. Listen, there are so many revelations here. My first question to you is what stood out to you most about this interview? Most revealing to you? 
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR, "ANDERSON COOPER 360":  I read the book, so it's 416 pages. And it's a very nuanced and detailed portrait of this man's life. And I think we all grew up watching him. All of us have seen Prince Harry and his brother from the time they were born, and we feel like we know who they are. And yet, when you read the book, very quickly you realize we don't know that much about what's been going on in the inner life of Harry and how he sees himself and actually his relationship with his brother, which he says in the book has been on a different course since the death of their mother, Princess Diana, back in 1997. And that death is really the central event, obviously in Harry's life. And he writes extensively about this. This is really a memoir in many ways about grief and loss and the trajectory, how it changes the trajectory of one's life. 
 
HARLOW:  It really, Anderson, came full circle, that you started the piece out last night with William and Harry walking behind their mother's casket, and you ended with them walking behind their grandmother's casket, but how changed a relationship they had. Obviously, we know, because you put it out publicly in your podcast and talked about it, the grief that you've gone through with deaths in your own family. And I wonder what it was like as someone who lost a parent as a teenager -- my dad died just a few weeks before Princess Diana, so just I remember her death so well -- what it was like for you to hear him detail his grief in that way that we've never heard publicly before. 
 <br>[08:05:07]
 
COOPER:  To me, when I read the book, I agreed to do this interview before I had to chance to actually read the book because there were all these security protocols to actually even get a copy of the book. What really jumped out to me is this is a story of grief and loss. And it is a huge part of the book, and it infuses a lot of what the way I think Prince Harry sees what is happening now and his concerns about what is happening now.
 
And I think that idea of the walk that they took behind their mother's casket which was such a formative -- it is the indelible image from the funeral in early September of 1997, and that walk behind their grandmother's casket. And in many ways it was a similar walk in that they were together, but they were apart. They were apart by grief back when Harry was 12 and William was 15. Harry couldn't cry about it until his mother was actually buried. He couldn't even talk about it really with anyone for much of his life. 
 
And he had this sort of magical thinking in the years after she died even up until his early 20s that he thought maybe she was still alive. It's not that he thought she had faked her death. It's just he thought -- it was sort of a magical thinking which occurs with many people who have lost somebody, imagining that maybe they are still out there, thinking you see them in places. And that's something that he believed and he says that he had discussions with his brother about as well. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  I think we have that moment in the interview. It really stood out. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COOPER:  You didn't believe she was dead. 
 
HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX::  For a long time. I just refused to accept that she was gone. Part of, she would never do this to us, but also part of maybe this is all part of a plan. COOPER:  You really believed that maybe she had decided to disappear
 
 for a time. 
 
HARRY:  For a time, and then that she would call us and we would come and join her. 
 
COOPER:  How long did you believe that? 
 
HARRY:  Years. Many, many years. William and I talked about it as well. He had similar thoughts. 
 
COOPER:  You write in the book, you say I'd often say it to myself first thing in the morning, maybe this is the day. Maybe this is the day that she is going to reappear. 
 
HARRY:  Yes, hope. I had huge amounts of hope. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS:  And Anderson, one thing he told you was he struggled to even talk about it, though, really to other people, about her death. Did you get a sense of why he's talking now and why he gave such an in- depth interview to you? 
 
COOPER:  Well, I mean, look, there's a lot of different ways to look at that, and a lot of it depends on what you think about Prince Harry, probably, and his wife Meghan. He will say I have been silent for my entire life. I've had endless stories written about me and people projecting things on to me and saying things about me, and this is an opportunity for me to actually talk about who I am and how I see things and the central role that my mother's death has played in his life. 
 
Obviously, critics of his will look and say, well, look, he and his wife have left the royal family. They have been accused of cashing in on their royal titles. They are not just telling their story. They're making accusations against members of the royal family, which is part of their story as well, they would say. 
 
So obviously people are going to see it different ways. Obviously, this is part of a multi-book deal that Harry has signed with Penguin Random House. There was the Netflix series, obviously, which detailed more of the fracture with the royal family and their lives as a couple. 
 
I think the book, though -- the focus for most people on the book, obviously, are the revelations of the drama that's been going on behind the scenes and the accusations back and forth. When you read the book, though, it is very much a memoir of this person's life, and the full arc of their life, and really a story of grief and early childhood trauma. 
 
LEMON:  Anderson, before you go, just, Poppy talked about you losing a family member. And I lost my dad, my sister, my grandma. 
 
COLLINS:  In the same year, right? LEMON:  Right. And it's interesting, because you never get those
 
 people back. But he still has his brother in his life. And that was the sad part to me when I said that was the most revealing, when he said I don't think I'll ever be a member of the royal family again, which translated to me as, I don't think that I can real this rift. I hope that they can. But can you talk about that, because his brother is still here? 
 
COOPER:  He actually says -- he would make a distinction. I think the question for him was really a public -- a senior role in the royal family, living in England, working full time for the royal family as he was, that he doesn't see happening. 
 <br>[08:10:05]
 
He certainly holds out the possibility of a partial role continued in the royal family. He says that the offer that was made to -- this is not part -- this was not in the -- it came out in the interview, we didn't include it in the piece, but just for time. But he says that a partial role is still on the table. The original offer, which was living overseas for a certain amount of months a year and then fulfilling duties for the royal family for part time of the year, that is still on the table. There would still need to be a number of conversations and discussions and frank discussions that don't leak out before that would happen. 
 
So he holds out. He certainly says he wants a relationship with -- he loves his brother, he loves his father. He says he wants a relationship with all of them. Obviously, that's maybe even more difficult to imagine right now given the revelations he has brought forth. But he says he's not doing it in a hurtful manner, and he very much would like to have a dialogue. 
 
LEMON:  Anderson, thank you. Good to see you. We appreciate you joining us this morning, and we'll be watching tonight. So make sure you tune in tonight for Anderson's full interview. The Harry interview begins at 8:00 eastern right here on CNN. 
 
COLLINS:  I want to turn to Brazil now this morning where a violent attack on the seat of government is being called their own January 6th. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(SHOUTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS:  These rioters that you see there are supporters of former president Bolsonaro who lost his election. They stormed and vandalized Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court, and presidential palace, insisting that he was a victim of a rigged election. At least 400 people are under arrest this morning. These are the images that were are seeing playing out right now in the capital. Troops in the streets, as you can see there, trying to quell these protests. CNN's Brazil reporter Pedro Nogueira is on the ground. Tell us what you're seeing there this morning in the aftermath of this? 
 
PEDRO NOGUEIRA, CNN BRASIL REPORTER:  Hundreds of people are now under arrest after the invasion of the three main government buildings here in Brasilia, Brazil. Supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro broke into the presidential palace, the congressional building, and also the Supreme Court building. Rioters left behind a trail of destruction. Huge glass windows were broken everywhere, works of art were damaged or also stolen, and they even looted weapons at the presidential palace. 
 
At the Supreme Court, the ministers' chairs were ripped off the building. Supreme court ordered the governor of Brasilia to be temporarily removed. Justices understand that there was an omission in this situation. Local authorities knew beforehand that the demonstration was under way and did nothing to stop them. Hundreds of buses with rioters drove to Brasilia during the weekend, and police did nothing to stop them. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will spend the day this Monday meeting with Supreme Court justices and state governors to solve the situation. 
 
Pedro Nogueira, Brasilia, CNN, Brazil. 
 
COLLINS:  Shows the global impact that things that happen here in the U.S. have on other places. Pedro, thank you for that report.
 
HARLOW:  Also this morning, more than 7,000 nurses at two of the city's largest hospitals are on strike. This comes after talks over pay and staffing with Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore in the Bronx, rather, failed overnight. The hospitals have been really having to take extreme measuring, like diverting ambulances to other hospitals, putting elective surgeries on hold, even transferring infants out of the neonatal intensive care network. 
 
Our Vanessa Yurkevich joins us live outside of Mount Sinai. That's what really got me, Vanessa, when I heard that babies were being moved out of the NICU because there wouldn't be enough nurses to care for them. What's the crux of the impasse here? 
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and Poppy, the number of nurses out here in front of Mount Sinai have been growing by the hour. We expect that there are hundreds out here right now. And they span two city blocks all the way from 101st street all the way around the corner, down the street coming up to 99th street. And the real issue here with these two hospitals, Mount Sinai and Montefiore not reaching a deal stems around safe staffing. This is the ratio of nurses to patients in order to have safe care for these patients. 
 
I want to bring in one transplant nurse here. Where is he? Come over here sir. This is Warren Urquhart. He's a transplant nurse here at Mount Sinai. Warren, tell me why are you out here this morning? 
 
WARREN URQUHART, TRANSPLANT RN:  We're out here because we're fighting for safer staffing ratios for our patients. We want to make sure we get an equal wage, a fair wage so everyone can actually feel like we're working for an institute that actually cares about us. 
 <br>[08:15:00]  
 
YURKEVICH:  And a transplant nurse is such a critical job here. What is your concern about your patients right now? We're in the hospital without you today?  
 
URQUHART:  Well, we've been fighting for working under safer conditions. There's laws that are in place that aren't even being enforced anymore.  
 
So the thing is not working under conditions that we work under, and now we hope that these patients are going to be under safe conditions because we do the best we can every day and we want to make sure that they're getting the best of the day they get every day, and not just on days when we're not here.  
 
YURKEVICH:  Thank you.  
 
URQUHART:  Something is wrong inside the hospital, that is why we're outside the hospital fighting for them.  
 
YURKEVICH:  Thank you, Warren.  
 
Now, the Governor has suggested binding arbitration which would bring in a neutral arbitrator to try to work out a deal between the hospitals and the unions, Poppy.  
 
But the hospitals agreed to it. The Union did not, so they are here out on strike until this bill gets done -- Poppy.  
 
HARLOW:  Vanessa, thank you for that reporting live in New York -- Kaitlan.  
 
COLLINS:  Also this morning, the football world is celebrating the remarkable recovery of Bills' safety, Damar Hamlin after he collapsed from sudden cardiac arrest on the field.  
 
Before their game against the Patriots, the Bills honored the training staff that saved his life. And across the league, players, coaches, executives are all showing their support many of them wearing Hamlin's Number 3 on a t-shirt with the words "Love for Damar."  
 
We are now learning that he could be released in the hospital in just a matter of days. His Buffalo Bills are paying the ultimate tribute to their teammate and brother just seconds into the game against New England last night in a way that Hollywood even could not script.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
MAN:  It'd be short fielded at the four by Hines, coming straight up the middle to the 20, cuts it back at 25. He's got an alley down the right sideline to the 40, 50 down to the 40, 35, 30 20, 15, 10, 5, touchdown. Nyheim Hines.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  COLLINS:  Hamlin was watching that touchdown. He tweeted as he was
 
 watching the game from his hospital bed, responded to that play with a simple "OMFG."  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
NYHEIM HINES, BUFFALO BILLS RUNNING BACK:  We've received love and support from not only the fans, but every team in the NFL and it was all about three. I mean it was all about Damar.  
 
we were really appreciative of that and I don't want that to outshine his moment because he was here for us and I felt like he was running with me on that field.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
COLLINS:  The Bills' quarterback, Josh Allen also got emotional thinking about Hamlin in that special moment for Number 3.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
JOSH ALLEN, BUFFALO BILLS QUARTERBACK:  I can't remember a play that touched me like that, I don't think in my life, so it's probably number one.  
 
I was going around my teammates saying "God is real," like you can't -- you can't draw that one up, write that one up any better. And I was just told by Kevin Kearns, it's been three years and three months since the last kickoff return, so it's pretty cool.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
COLLINS:  Buffalo won the game 35 to 23.  
 
Afterwards CNN's Coy Wire caught up with the Bills offensive lineman, Dion Dawkins about the tough game.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
DION DAWKINS, BUFFALO BILLS LINEMAN:  It was extremely hard. I don't want to like sugarcoat it like it was extremely hard. And it still is because our brother is still not physically here.  
 
But the fact that he's in high spirits makes him here. But until he physically touches his toes down, then it'd be a full "ha."  
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yes.  
 
DAWKINS:  You know, but it's just -- it's a crazy balance.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
COLLINS:  Let's bring in CNN's Senior data reporter, Harry Enten, who's been looking at this Bills victory and their path ahead now that they are in the playoffs.  
 
Obviously, everyone is rooting for them in the sense of Damar Hamlin, but what do the numbers actually look like?  
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  All right, so this morning's number is two, it is two because Nyheim Hines had not just that opening kickoff return for a touchdown, but he had one later on in the game. It's the first time since 2010, that the same player had two kickoff returns for a touchdown, the same game.  
 
I can't tell you how excited I was. Go, go, go. Oh, my goodness, gracious. That was a lot of fun after a really tough week.  
 
But let's sort of talk about that road ahead. Okay, so to win the Super Bowl, what do the Bills need to do? They're going to need to win four games. They're going to have to win the AFC wildcard game at home next week against Miami, then they'll have to win the AFC Divisional game at home in two weeks. They'll have to win the AFC Championship in three weeks that will either be in Buffalo or if they play Kansas City, it will be at a neutral site.  
 
It was kind of the thing that they reached that agreement, they reached after the Bills didn't play last Monday. And then of course, they'll have to win the Superbowl in Arizona on February the 12th.  
 
COLLINS:  Yes. So this AFC game is next weekend.  
 
ENTEN:  Yes, so let's talk about that. This is the easy part of it, okay. The chance of winning the AFC wildcard game next week. Buffalo with an 81 percent chance, Miami with just a 19 percent chance.  
 
Keep in mind, the Bills have just lost one playoff game at home in their current stadium. So it looks pretty good next week. Of course, Kaitlan --  
 
COLLINS:  What comes after that?  
 <br>[08:20:05]  
 
ENTEN:  What happens after that? Okay, top team's chance of winning the Super Bowl, you can see here the Bills at a 20 percent chance that is second to the Kansas City Chiefs. But we really have just sorted this group of top five teams. It is going to be a tough road to go, but the fact is the Bills are in this, they have a legitimate shot and we'll see what happens because right now yesterday showed us, I believe fate is on our side.  
 
COLLINS:  And I feel like when you rooting for them, it's going to be higher than 20 percent for the Bills.  
 
ENTEN:  You know what? If I have any juju, I will put it all towards them winning it would truly be a dream fulfilled after all these years of losing.  
 
COLLINS:  All right, we'll talk about what your traditions are before the game next. Harry Enten, thank you.  
 
HARLOW:  You know why I'm laughing?  
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Juju.  
 
HARLOW:  Because Don is giving me weird side eyes about juju.  
 
ENTEN:  Look, the fact of the matter is, Don, I use whatever words that are needed to describe what's going on, and anything to get my Bills over the top, if the Bills make the Superbowl, Don, you and I can go together, how about that?  
 
LEMON:  Because you can use whatever words you want to use, can I use whatever words I want to use here though?  
 
HARLOW:  No.  
 
ENTEN:  Don, let's keep it PG 13.  
 
LEMON:  As it refers to you cray-cray.  
 
ENTEN:  A little bit sometimes.  
 
HARLOW:  In the best way.  
 
LEMON:  Just about, Harry. Thank you.  
 
ENTEN:  Whatever it takes.  
 
HARLOW:  Thank you, Harry.  
 
ENTEN:  Thanks.  
 
HARLOW:  All right, turning the page here, President Biden visited the Southern border this weekend for the first time in his presidency. He did not speak with though or meet with any migrants.  
 
We will talk to the mayor of El Paso, next.  
 
LEMON:  Plus, the search is intensifying for a missing mother of three in Massachusetts and now her husband is under arrest.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
 
LEMON:  Well today marks eight days since Anna Walsh a Massachusetts mother of three was last seen.  
 
She was reported missing last week after she never arrived for work in Washington, DC. Now police in Massachusetts arresting her husband for misleading investigators.  
 <br>[08:25:10]  
 
LEMON:  So let's find out what's going on now. CNN's Brynn Gingras joins us now. Good morning to you.  
 
So what's going on with the husband? What are police saying?  
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, so he is set to be arraigned this morning on that misleading an investigation charge, and it is very unclear what sort of happened over the weekend because on Friday, when police were giving a news conference about this being a missing persons investigation, they said the husband was being very cooperative with this investigation.  
 
But now, we know he has been arrested on this misleading an investigation. So we'll see what comes out in Court. It is very possible we might get more information, of course, as this Court date happens.  
 
HARLOW:  Why have police suspended their search?  
 
GINGRAS:  Yes, so that's also very unclear. I mean, there is just no sign of this mother.  
 
HARLOW:  They don't -- yes.  
 
GINGRAS:  They have no sign of this mother. So she went missing -- let's kind of go through the timeline. She went missing. She was supposed to board a flight on New Year's Day.  
 
She was last seen by a family member according to police on January 1st, leaving at 4:05 in the morning from her home in Massachusetts headed for a flight to Washington, DC.  
 
Police say she's never got into -- they have no information that she got into a ride share and definitely did not get onto a plane, and she sort of just disappeared.  
 
As far as investigative leads, they don't really have any right now. They said she has no digital footprint. So meaning she didn't spend any money on credit cards. She hasn't had any sort of, you know, communications with anyone. She has her phone actually turned off according to this investigation.  
 
So they searched here where you're looking is a wooded area around her home in Massachusetts and police said that they suspended that search, and they're not going to continue until they get new information that makes them believe they need to go continuing that search.  
 
So still so many questions this morning. This is a mother, 39 years old, has three kids ages two to six years old.  
 
We'll find out more about this, you know Court date this morning for the husband.  
 
HARLOW:  I am thinking about those kids this morning. Thank you, Brynn, very much.  
 
GINGRAS:  Absolutely.  
 
COLLINS:  President Biden is going to be meeting with the Mexican President in Mexico City shortly.  
 
Up next, we're going to talk to the Mayor of El Paso, who Biden met with this weekend in his first trip since taking office to the border.
