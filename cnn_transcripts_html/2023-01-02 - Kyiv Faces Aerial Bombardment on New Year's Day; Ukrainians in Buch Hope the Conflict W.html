MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you are just joining us, let me bring you up-to-date with the top stories this hour. 
 
The family of the man accused of killing the four college students in Idaho is offering their condolences as Bryan Kohberger himself awaits extradition in Pennsylvania. 
 
A deadly storm system is putting more than 15 million people under winter weather alerts as it moves east after hitting California. 
 
And law enforcement sources say the teenage suspect in the machete attack on New York police officers wrote in his diary about his desire to join the Taliban. 
 
NOBILO: Ukraine has started 2023 with the sound of air raid sirens across Kyiv. 
 
FOSTER: Officials say 20 drones were intercepted over the capital on New Year's Day and the attacks have continued today. The shelling has damaged critical infrastructure forcing power outages and disrupting some heat supplies have. 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson joins us with the latest developments. We have more attacks from the air. Russia damaging more critical infrastructure. Obviously, that is part of their strategy to make this harsh winter even more difficult to try and break the Ukrainian's resolve. You know, Surovikin is in charge. He's got no regard for human life. Just wants to make things as difficult as possible. What impact is this having on the resolve of the Ukrainian's and their military forces? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Unity. And we heard this from President Zelenskyy last night. And he put that in contrast to what they see in Russia which is the vision of disunity. And it's kind of interesting to look at President Putin's New Year's message where he about, you know, putting -- it's about family first, then sort of friends and comrades, and then the motherland which of course was his original narrative. The fight in Ukraine was all about the motherland because this was part of Russia. He's changing that up. He's offering -- Russia's offering conscripts to pay for their children to go through university. 
 
The key for Russia and for Putin is no longer the appeal for the motherland but to appeal to people as individuals and their families to get them to fight. That's the motivation. 
 
But on the Ukrainian side, they're fighting for their country. And so, it's unity. And I think this is the big division. Something they'll see perhaps become bigger or more apparent in 2023. But the attacks overnight and over the past few days, yes, apparently, more missiles are on their way to Kyiv were shot down in other regions. 
 <br>[04:35:03]
 
45 missiles the first day of the New Year, overnight now 40 missiles. Can Russia sustain this? Ukrainians say not. But the Russians wonder if Ukraine can sustain its support from NATO. Secretary-General Verga said, yes, we've got to up our own weapons production to support Ukraine. These are going to be the defining features I think for 2023 in this war. 
 
NOBILO: And as we ramp up to the anniversary of the 24th of February of one year of this conflict. Nic Robertson, thank you so much. 
 
FOSTER: Now in the city of Bucha, Ukraine, residence who have endured the horrors of war are looking forward with hope for the new year. And some are turning to their traditional ways to bolster their resistance, whilst also  helping their countrymen fighting on the front lines. CNN's Ben Wedeman reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The daily bread has a special meaning in this Bucha bakery, no machines here. Yaroslav (ph) kneads the dough by hand. Outside, Andri (ph) chops firewood for the oven at a time when waves of Russian strikes have crippled Ukraine's power grid. The old ways are proving to be handy. Yuri used to pass his days glued to a screen at his IT job war has brought him back to what matters most.
 
YURI BOYKO, BAKER: What's happened right now in Ukraine it's affecting all the world and people becoming more conscious and more grateful for everything they have right now in their lives.
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): Bucha outside Kyiv suffered through a brutal Russian occupation and was the scene of what investigators say were war crimes.
 
Vyacheslav, a regular customer appreciates the bread and the spirit of those who make it.
 
VYACHESLAV, BUCHA RESIDENT: They are nice guys. Very small business. I remember right after liberation of Bucha, they started baking bread and even providing this bread for free to those in need.
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): They also provide bread and traditional pastries for those far from home and in harm's way. WEDEMAN: Some of these loaves are destined for soldiers, a little
 
 something extra that will make their New Year's Eve that much more special.
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): Simple reminders of the holiday season hang over their work. The memories of recent nightmares are still fresh and the specter of more Russian attacks loom large. Celebrations will be muted.
 
In other parts of the world, people can count on comfort in waiting for nice fireworks. Yaroslav (ph) tells me. We're worried about fireworks from our neighbors. Irina's (ph) wish for the new year is simple. We hope it will be better, she says, we hope the war will end.
 
One cannot live on bread alone. Hope is also needed.
 
Ben Wedeman, CNN, Bucha, Ukraine.

NOBILO: COVID case numbers are surging after Beijing backed away from its zero-COVID policy. Just ahead how countries around the world are reacting as China struggles to get back to normal. 
 
Plus, a U.S. lawmaker makes some serious claims about TikTok and alleged links to the Chinese government and urges a nationwide ban. That story after the break.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
NOBILO: Nearly 4,000 nurses at a New York hospital have reached a tentative deal on a labor contract, a day after threatening to strike. But at seven other hospitals roughly 12,000 nurses are still negotiating their own contracts. And if a deal isn't reached by January 9 they'll move forward with the strike. The nurses are demanding better working conditions including more staff to improve patient care. 
 
FOSTER: Air travelers from China are facing a growing number of restrictions in countries around the world. This after Beijing scrapped its zero-COVID policy causing a surge of coronavirus cases. 
 
NOBILO: Morocco will ban all travelers from China from entering, regardless of nationality, starting on Tuesday. And Australia is joining countries like the U.S., Canada, England, France, South Korea, Japan, and several other countries, requiring travelers from China to show proof of a negative COVID test. And just moments ago we learned this, Qatar is reintroducing a 48-hour negative PCR test requirement for all travelers arriving from China. And that came in a statement from Qatar's ministry of public health just a few minutes ago. 
 
FOSTER: We are now going to bring in Paula Hancocks life for us in Seoul, South Korea today. And countries basically concerned that new variants are going to come out from China and they're doing what they can to at least slowdown that spread. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Exactly, Max and Bianca. And what we're seeing is a number of new countries are adding their names to the list as well. The concern not just that there could be an increase in COVID cases in their country once travelers start internationally once again from China, but also the fact there could be variants in the near future given the sheer scale of the virus that is swirling around the country at the moment. 
 
And it is really dual reality in the country. You have on the one hand, some people trying to get back to normal. You have congestion on the streets of Beijing once again. People out and about shopping. But on the other side you also have an increase in hospitalizations. You're hearing about the strains on the health system. And we heard from one pharmacist who pointed out that basic drugs are hard to come by. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): There is a shortage of all the cold and flu medicine, and fever reducing medicine. Including rubbing alcohol and thermometers, which have been out of stock. I think it's because we're in the countryside, and other goods are allocated to big hospitals and cities. But here in the towns and villages, we're more isolated, and less medicine is available.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: The World Health Organization did meet with Chinese officials back on Friday and they specified certain things they needed to know. They had very specific questions. They said they wanted to know more genetic sequencing data. They wanted to know about hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths, vaccination rates within the country. There's no indication at this point though that they are receiving any of that information -- at least they're not telling us so publicly from Beijing. 
 
And that is why, Max and Bianca, you're seeing the reticence from countries around the world and this concern and an increasing number of countries starting to put restrictions back in place again. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Paula in Seoul. Thank you. 
 
NOBILO: The crackdown on TikTok continues in the United States. The social media app is already being banned from all U.S. government devices and now the new head of the House Select Committee on China is making pointed new claims about the app. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
FOSTER: Certainly. Republican Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin told NBC's "Meet the Press" that TikTok is, quote, digital fentanyl comparing the app popular for its viral dance videos, to a dangerous synthetic opioid with troubling links to China. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI): It's highly addictive and destructive and we're seeing troubling data about the corrosive impact of constant social media use, particularly on young men and women here in America. It's also digital fentanyl in the sense that as you elude to, it ultimately goes back to the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok is owned by ByteDance. ByteDance is effectively controlled by the CCP. So, we have to ask whether we want the CCP to control what is on the cusp of becoming the most powerful media company in America. That is very troubling. And so, I was glad to see my colleagues in the Senate passed in a unanimous fashion a ban of TikTok on government devices. I think we should do the same in the House and expand that ban nationally. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: U.S. lawmakers also fear TikTok's parent company could be compelled to hand over data on U.S. citizens to Chinese authorities. And so far, there's no evidence to support any of those fears. We could at least put a disclaimer on TikTok stories, seeing as you're a TikTok superstar with over 1 million followers. 
 
FOSTER: Well, I think it's -- you have to go based on the evidence, don't you. I think we'll have to see. America's very much leading the charge on this. 
 
NOBILO: It will be interesting to see if anywhere else points to it. Obviously, the British Parliament are being suspicious of it. There's about eight MPs who are particularly vocal that want the same changes. 
 
FOSTER: Yes, we'll watch. 
 
NOBILO: We shall. 
 
FOSTER: Boulder, Colorado, has closed its main public library due to methamphetamine contamination. City officials say meth residue was found inside air ducts in the library's bathrooms after reports of individual smoking there. Officials are waiting for a final test result before meeting to discuss next steps. A statements said the earliest the library is expected to reopen is Tuesday. 
 
NOBILO: I wonder if that will impact the reputation of libraries as warm spaces where people squat. 
 
FOSTER: They're doing less work in them. 
 
NOBILO: Apparently, yes. 
 
When we come back, making sense of the metaverse. What the technology means for the future and why 2023 may or may not be its big year. 
 
FOSTER: Not. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) FOSTER: An ESPN analyst had to bail right in the middle of one of the biggest college football games of the year when he learned live on air that his wife was in labor. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will give the Michigan play players -- they have answered time and time. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Brother -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you doing? We're in the middle of the game. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sorry, guys, --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's he doing?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- I've got to go. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To the bathroom? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go, baby. Congratulations. Let's go. 1, 2, 3. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: That was former college and NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III. He was helping to cover the Michigan/TCU college semi-final game Saturday when he got the call. He rushed home leaving his colleagues to finish the game without him. At last check his wife's labor pains were apparently a false alarm. So, no word yet on whether their baby has arrived. 
 
NOBILO: So, my dad is a sports commentator and he sometimes watches the show. There is no way he would have done that for me. He see won't see come round.
 
U.S. football fans will soon be have to catch their favorite live games on a new network. DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket package will leave the satellite service for YouTube TV starting next season after nearly 20 years. It is the latest move for live sports content in the U.S. following acquisitions by both Amazon and Apple. 
 
FOSTER: I have been watching more sport on Amazon, the football and the rugby. Yes, they're really upping their game, aren't they? 
 
NOBILO: I haven't watched any sport on Amazon so I can't really comment on it. We'll take your word for it. 
 
FOSTER: 2023 could be the first year many people have their first experience at watching sport on Amazon and with the metaverse. 
 
But as we hear from CNN's Anna Stewart, who is completely sold on the metaverse.
 
NOBILO: She is, I've seen at her desk wearing virtual reality goggles clutching at air. 
 
FOSTER: Which is one really good example at why is not picking up quite yet. I'm not saying it won't, but she's way ahead of her time.
 
NOBILO: She is.
 
FOSTER: Sometimes it seems like the new technology is still in its startup phase, thankfully. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Remember this movie?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The oasis.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A whole virtual universe.
 
STEWART (voice-over): The concept of a virtual universe is rooted in science fiction. Over years it's being just that, fiction. But now, technology is beginning to catch up, bringing the idea of the metaverse to reality.
 
It is home to concerts, expensive digital real estate, and hugely popular games. But what exactly is the metaverse? What does it do? And why should you care? Let's break it down.
 
NEAL STEPHENSON, AUTHOR, SNOW CRASH: It means a virtual environment.
 
STEWART (voice-over): This is Neal Stephenson. He came up with the term metaverse back in 1992, for his book Snow Crash. Back to you Neal.
 
STEPHENSON: Where large numbers of people can get together and interact with each other, not as they are, but through avatars, which are kind of the three-dimensional representations.
 
STEWART (voice-over): For so long, our experiences with the Internet having 2D. It's been something we look at. But the metaverse gives users the sense of being transported into the Internet like this.
 
STEWART: Oh, hi.
 
ANDREW BOSWORTH, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, META: Hello.
 
STEWART (voice-over): Meet Andrew Bosworth, also known as Boz. He works at Meta, formerly named Facebook.
 
STEWART: Great. Do we shake hands? How does this work?
 
BOSWORTH: We can do a high five.
 
STEWART: Oh.
 
STEWART (voice-over): This is Horizon workrooms, the company's foothold in the metaverse. It's just one of the many ways into the metaverse that are currently available. [04:55:00]
 
In these virtual worlds, you can play games, do business, and dance with strangers that turn into friends, except that this friend could be on the other side of the world.
 
BOSWORTH: Is it as good as being together? No, and it probably never will be, but it's the next best thing.
 
STEWART(voice-over): This all sounds exciting, until you realize that the technology for building this new iteration of the Internet is -- well, still being built.
 
STEWART: Where are my legs?
 
BOSWORTH: We're also working on legs. We are working on legs.
 
STEWART: Where are my legs?
 
BOSWORTH: We -- to be fair, we are working on legs. It's one of the tricky things about V.R. we're so early on. Oops, she left me. I'm so sad. She is back, maybe. Oops, she left again.
 
STEWART (voice-over): In short, it's difficult to define the metaverse because it's constantly evolving, just as the technology is. What it is, is largely dependent on what it can do for us. And right now, its capabilities are just a fraction of what they might be in five, maybe 10 years.
 
For now, it's this place where you can be whoever you want and immerse your virtual self into this alternative world that pushes past physical barriers. To collaborate and interact with other virtual avatars, objects, and environments. As promising as it all may sound, we still have a long way to go before we're living like this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where am I?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: IOI Plaza (ph) your hologram in the real world.
 
STEWART (voice-over): Anna Stewart, CNN, Dubai.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Come back, Anna. 
 
NOBILO: Yes, do comeback. I loved her with the Mohawk that was brilliant. 
 
And lastly, wondering where to travel this year? Well CNN has compiled a list of 23 destination ideas where you can plan your trip and Poland, which I'm surprised by, tops our list. 
 
FOSTER: What's wrong with Poland? 
 
NOBILO: No, I love it. I'm part polish. One of my many countries. But not only for its beautiful landscapes, it's also because it's been showing solidarity with Ukraine. Poland has taken in more Ukrainian refugees than any other country. 
 
FOSTER: In the U.S. Charleston, South Carolina, is a favorite where visitors can enjoy a world renowned summer festival. Thessaloniki, in Greece, is another favorite with beautiful beaches in a UNESCO endorsed local food scene. 
 
Thanks for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. 
 
NOBILO: I'm Bianca Nobilo. "EARLY START" is next.
