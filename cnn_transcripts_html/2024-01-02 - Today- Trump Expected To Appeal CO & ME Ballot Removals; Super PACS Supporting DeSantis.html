THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[11:30:00]
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: This is of concern. Because just over the last few days, you've been saying that since the Colorado Supreme Court case, which is notable because you are not a party to that -- you are not a party to that car case -- court case but you receive threats after that became a case. What happened exactly?
 
JENA GRISWOLD, COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE: I was actually a party to that case, but I wasn't the petitioner who brought the case.
 
BERMAN: OK.
 
GRISWOLD: I was actually one of the defendants as the chief election officer and the person who certifies who is on and off of the ballot. But what happens is, as soon as that case was filed, I started to receive a lot of death threats. And when the Colorado Supreme Court acted in deciding that Donald Trump had disqualified himself because he engaged in insurrection, they received a bunch of death threats, and so did I.
 
So, it's just a atmosphere of political violence that, unfortunately, is not new. It has been with us since 2020 and 2021, being used to try to intimidate Secretaries of State and election workers. But I won't be intimidated. We're going to still have great elections in the state of Colorado.
 
BERMAN: What's the cause of this threat of violence, do you think? Who is to blame?
 
GRISWOLD: I would say Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress and high-ranking Republicans across the nation who have not stood up to condemn the rhetoric of violence. You know, all the lies, all the disinformation are used as justification to suppress the vote across the nation. The lies have been cited as security breaches, including election officials breaching their own equipment. And have really incited a wave of political threats to election workers.
 
And the intended result is happening. A lot of election workers have said they will step down or have stepped down, including Colorado, seeing a turnover rate of 1/3 of our elected county clerks, the people who run the elections at the county level since 2020. So, Donald Trump is -- his rhetoric is dangerous. And of course, I would say there was not a mistake -- or he knew what he was doing when he posted on social media the biography of the main secretary of state. That leads to intimidation and threats against her.
 
BERMAN: You noted I incorrectly said you were not a party to the case in Colorado. Obviously, you correct me on that. But it wasn't your decision to remove Donald Trump from the ballot in Colorado, and that's what's important.
 
In Maine, it was a different situation where the Secretary of State did have that power. You praised her decision. Do you wish you had the power in Colorado to make that decision unilaterally?
 
GRISWOLD: Colorado law is set up where the Secretary of State does have the authority to determine qualifications including those of presidential candidates. But there is an apparatus in Colorado law where voters can challenge any decision-making. So, this lawsuit in Colorado was actually brought before I had made any decisions as to whether Trump is on the ballot or off the ballot.
 
It was brought by six Colorado voters who are Republicans and unaffiliated. And I think the Colorado Supreme Court got it right. Only two courts in this country have looked at the base question, did Donald Trump engage in insurrection?
 
Both of the courts have said yes. And again, I believe the Colorado Supreme Court got it right because I don't think there should be a loophole in the Constitution for a president trying to engage in an insurrection or rebellion against the country.
 
BERMAN: So, what's going to happen in the next few days with Donald Trump's name being put on the Colorado primary ballot as we wait to see, really when he files his appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court? What are you going to do in the next few days?
 
GRISWOLD: I certify the ballot on Friday. So, that's the process of telling all the county clerks which candidates can be on the ballots that they will then go print. Now, the Colorado Supreme Court has said he has disqualified but put basically a hold on their decision.
 
So, they said he is disqualified, but if an appeal is filed, he is presumed back on the ballot unless the U.S. Supreme Court takes some action. So as of today, Donald Trump is back on the ballot. The Colorado Republican Party filed an appeal last week.
 
We hear -- it's being reported that Donald Trump is going to -- going to file his appeal today. And until the Supreme Court refuses to review the case or take some type of action, he is back on the ballot in the state of Colorado.
 
BERMAN: Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, thank you so much for being with us today. Appreciate it.
 
GRISWOLD: Thank you. RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN ANCHOR: Well, new this morning. A terrifying attack in South Korea. The country's main opposition leader stabbed in the neck following a press conference.
 
Now, the whole thing caught on camera. A word of caution. The video is disturbing.
 <br>[11:35:10]

SOLOMON: He is now recovering in the hospital after undergoing surgery. Let's bring in CNN's Paula Hancocks, who's following the developments for us. Paula, what more can you share about the latest on his condition?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rahel, what we're being told at this point is that he is recovering in intensive care. He has undergone surgery. A vein reconstruction surgery, we are told.
 
Now, when that attack happened, it was believed that he did have damage to his jugular vein. That is the latest update that we have on his condition. But what actually happened was really a brazen attack, Rahel.
 
It was in broad daylight. He was surrounded by supporters, by many people, by reporters, and it was all captured live on television. There was an individual in his 60s, we're told by police, who approached him as he was talking to reporters on camera, asking for his autograph.
 
He then lunged forward and attacked Lee Jae-myung, the opposition leader. And we're told there was a one-centimeter laceration in the left-hand side of his neck. He collapsed. And the assailant was then wrestled to the ground and arrested.
 
Now, what police are trying to find out is exactly what the motive was, for this particular attack. We know that politics in South Korea has been extremely polarized over recent months, but police are looking specifically for the motive in this attack. And there have also been previous stabbing attacks on high-profile individuals there.
 
It happens just a few months before local elections here. So, there are a lot of politicians and high-profile individuals out and about on the streets of South Korea. And as you can see from the video, the members of the public are allowed to get very close to politicians. There's little security and that is being looked at, Rahel.
 
SOLOMON: Yes. It makes you wonder if you'll see some changes there because of this incident. Paula Hancocks, live for us. Paula, thank you.
 
BERMAN: So, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, both trying to close the gap between them and Donald Trump by not going after Donald Trump. Details ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:42:00]
 
BERMAN: So, this is it. Just two weeks to the Iowa caucuses, the last chance for candidates not named Donald Trump to close the gap there with Donald Trump. So, what are they doing? Super PACs supporting Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley have released ads going after each other and not Donald Trump.
 
Steve Contorno joins us now from Des Moines where it's smooth sailing, really for the Republican frontrunner, Steve.
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: That's right, John. And he's going to be here at the end of this week trying to remind his supporters that look, I know the lead is large, but we need to make sure we actually show up to the caucuses on January 15. But meanwhile, he is going virtually ignored on the airwaves by the two most -- people closest to him in the polls, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley.
 
In fact, the Iowa Hawkeyes this -- you know, on New Year's Day were competing in the Citrus Bowl, an event that was watched all throughout the state. There were ads attacking Haley from DeSantis's super PAC, ads attacking DeSantis from Nikki Haley's super PAC, but not a single ad attacking Ron De -- or excuse me, Donald Trump. And in fact, there -- if you watch these back and forth, they've been all over the map and the issues that have been central to these two candidates. Here's one of them going back and forth over their stances on China.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nikki pretends to talk tough about China.
 
NIKKI HALEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But China has been a really great friend of ours. I now officially work for you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can't trust tricky Nikki.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ron DeSantis is lying because he's losing. DeSantis called China Florida's most important trading partner. Phony Ron DeSantis. Too lame to lead. Too weak to win.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CONTORNO: Now, DeSantis will be here tomorrow and all throughout the rest of the week leading up to our town hall on Thursday. Nikki Haley, meanwhile, she is spending a lot of time in New Hampshire. That is where her campaign has focused a lot of efforts.
 
They don't believe that they need to come out of Iowa with a victory or even a second-place finish. They just need a strong showing here. And then it's on to New Hampshire where she is challenging very strongly.
 
She has the support of the state's governor. And obviously, Chris Christie is an obstacle for her there. And depending on how DeSantis does in Iowa, that could potentially prove to be a hurdle as well.
 
But both these candidates are going to be spending a lot of time in these early nominating states trying to get the vote out, trying to convince their supporters, hey, there's still time to catch up to Donald Trump here. While at the same time, they're mostly ignoring him on the airwaves, John.
 
BERMAN: All right. Steve Contorno for us in Des Moines. Thank you so much, Steve.
 
SOLOMON: All right. Let's continue the conversation further. CNN political analyst Jackie Kucinich is with us now. She is the Washington bureau chief for the Boston Globe.
 
Jackie, good to see you.
 
JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Likewise.
 
SOLOMON: So, let's start where Steve lifts off there. The final push in Iowa two weeks out. This is it, as John Berman just said. What does a strong showing look like here for Haley and DeSantis at this point?
 
KUCINICH: You know, it's a really good question because it -- frankly, they -- these polls in the last couple of months have been really stagnant. I -- Trump really has a large lead between 25 to 30 points over his next competitor. So, these two have really been left to duke it out. And it's on -- it is more important for DeSantis because of the resources. And the most important resource, time. He has spent in Iowa, particularly over the last few weeks.
 <br>[11:45:08]
 
Then Haley who really has been focused on New Hampshire in part because she's doing a lot better in the polls there. And the -- and if DeSantis doesn't have the showing, you really have to wonder what happens next for him. And you know, what kind of conversations are going to go on in that campaign?
 
Because he needs it. He needs it badly because of you know, everything I just mentioned.
 
SOLOMON: Likelihood of any surprises. Might we see a stronger showing far -- from a Vivek Ramaswamy, for example?
 
KUCINICH: Usually -- so, at this point, you usually sort of see the rising of someone else. You saw and you -- you saw Rick Santorum, in the final weeks really start to rise in 2012, for example. Nothing is impossible.
 
The caucuses are a very unique part of American politics because of how they are conducted. But again, just seeing what we've seen on the ground, hearing what we've heard on the ground, it doesn't -- it doesn't seem like we're going to have any big surprises. But you know, I love news, so fingers crossed. It would be -- it would be fun to cover. You know, we weren't -- we weren't throwing some curveballs. SOLOMON: Touche. Jackie, what do you make of these calls for Chris Christie to drop out of the race? Of course, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu said that Christie should drop out of the race before his state's primary. We also learned this morning that a former member of Christie's New Hampshire steering committee said that he's now backing Nikki Haley in the primary. So, what is the signal to you?
 
KUCINICH: So, Christie has indicated that you know he wasn't going to drop out. But you kind of saw this coming. You saw this on the horizon because of Haley's rise. You saw -- you know, Sununu obviously, as mentioned, endorsed Haley.
 
And this argument that that consolidation could help you know boost her potentially and stop -- this is about stopping the former President Trump's momentum. And she right now is the only candidate of those that challenging Trump that seems poised potentially to do that in New Hampshire. And with -- and without Christie in the race, I think you know, those folks who are saying that you should drop out, think that they will -- those others will go to Haley perhaps give her the boost that she needs.
 
But it really is -- you know, at the end of the day, is up to Christie. And he said he's on a mission here. So, you know, what we'll have to see if that pressure gets to him. Sure, he doesn't seem like it yet.
 
SOLOMON: Fair enough. Jackie, before I let you go, we have some new reporting that the Biden campaign apparently is carefully ratcheting up the intensity against Trump that they're worried that voters may becoming desensitized or doled to the former president's rhetoric and promises about what he would do if he was back in power. Do you think that this could be a winning general election strategy for Biden?
 
KUCINICH: I think what the interesting thing is, is they're just focusing on a general election at this point, and assuming that Trump is going to be their opponent. That's where most of this has been focused. You know, initially, you didn't hear Biden even say the word Trump.
 
He would say the other guy, he'd say other things, and slowly but surely, you heard Trump really come back into his speeches. And what Trump's going to do? Because they do -- he is looking at this as potentially a rematch which when you look at the field right now, that looks like what we're heading to.
 
And so, it does make sense if this is the way the Biden campaign is headed as they head into the general election. My goodness, it's 2024, isn't it?
 
SOLOMON: Here it is. It is upon us. Buckle up.
 
Jackie Kucinich, thank you.
 
KUCINICH: Thank you.
 
SOLOMON: And a reminder that Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley will be taking questions directly from Iowa voters in back-to-back town halls. The CNN Republican Presidential Town Halls, moderated by Caitlin Collins and Erin Burnett live Thursday night starting at 9:00 p.m. on CNN.
 
BERMAN: So, a pioneering procedure uses a partial heart transplant to fix a life-threatening birth defect in babies. What we're learning about the first baby to have this procedure?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:53:07]
 
BERMAN: So, new this morning. Researchers are releasing this new study documenting the world's first partial heart transplant. It was done to save the life of a baby who was just 18 days old at the time. Senior Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell joins us this morning. So, what's new in different exactly about this surgery, Meg?
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, what's really amazing about this surgery is that previously, the option essentially would have been to use donor valves which essentially wouldn't grow along with the child. And so, the problem with that is that as the baby gets older, you have to continue to have surgeries to get bigger and bigger valves until they reach adulthood. So, you're undergoing multiple surgeries.
 
There's also only a 50 percent chance of survival with that route. And so, with this baby, Owen Monroe, who was born with this heart defect, essentially that needed emergency care. The doctors used a technique they had never used before, which was using a donor functional valves and arteries in this partial heart transplant procedure in order to hopefully have those heart parts grow along with Owen. And what they've seen is that that surgery has been successful, and he is continuing to do well.
 
The valves are growing along with him. He has not had to have additional surgeries. He is now 20 months old out from this surgery.
 
His parents say he's hitting all of his developmental milestones. And it's really just miraculous to see this procedure and to see him now functioning really as a normal little guy, guys.
 
BERMAN: So, he had the surgery when he's 80 days old, now 20 months. So, that's great news, in and of itself. What does this mean for other babies who might need surgery?
 
TIRRELL: Right. So, he was the first one. His doctor, Joseph Turek, at Duke who really pioneered this procedure, said this could potentially help save hundreds of babies a year. And one other function of this new procedure is that you could potentially use one donor heart to save two babies because it's a partial heart transplant.
 <br>[11:55:08]
 
They've already done it on an additional 12 infants including nine there at Duke. And so, they say they need to do this more in order to really prove it out. But it is offering a lot of hope for parents and babies in a really tough situation.
 
BERMAN: There he is. Right now, we're just looking at pictures of him a second ago, Meg, where he looks terrific at age 20 months just like you would want any be able to look happy and smiling right there.
 
SOLOMON: And healthy -- looking healthy.
 
BERMAN: Look -- you know, you're right. Most importantly, looking healthy.
 
SOLOMON: Yes.
 
BERMAN: What a wonderful story in breathtaking technology in medical ingenuity. Meg Tirrell, thank you so much for being with us.
 
TIRRELL: Thank you.
 
SOLOMON: Good to be with you again, John.
 
BERMAN: It's great to have you here.
 
SOLOMON: An eventful day per usual. Thank you for joining us. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.
