BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INT HOST (voice-over):  Welcome back. You're watching the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD from Dubai here at the World 
 
 Governments Summit, where it's the last day of meetings between global leaders and stakeholders in every area, from diplomacy to artificial 
 
 intelligence.
 
We'll bring you more from whom we've been speaking to here, including the head of the World Health Organization in the next while.
 
First up, your headlines this hour.  The IDF says it has launched attacks in Lebanon after a rocket strike in northern Israel left one person dead 
 
 and several others injured.
 
And families  of hostages held in Gaza are appearing at The Hague today alongside survivors of the October 7th attacks, filing a complaint against 
 
 Hamas at the International Criminal Court.
 
Ukraine says it has destroyed a Russian warship off the coast of Crimea. That and other recent war progress in the Black Sea has been described as a 
 
 great victory for Ukraine by the NATO secretary-general.
 
And India's prime minister Narendra Modi here in the United Arab Emirates to inaugurate what is the UAE's largest Hindu temple. That comes just weeks 
 
 after the controversial opening of the temple built in foundations of a prominent mosque in northern India.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, we start with the Middle East further on edge today. Israel's air force launching what it calls an extensive wave of attacks in 
 
 Lebanon. That's in response, they say, to a rocket attack in northern Israel. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON (voice-over):  You see the aftermath of that attack here. The IDF says the rocket was fired from Lebanon. First responders say one person was 
 
 killed; at least eight others are injured. 
 
Meantime, there is fear and panic in Rafah, Palestinians forced to flee there, bracing for a threatened Israeli ground offensive that the U.N.'s 
 
 relief chief says could lead to, and I quote him here, "slaughter."
 
And families of hostages still held in Gaza and survivors of the October 7th terror attacks are at The Hague today to urge the International 
 
 Criminal Court to file arrest warrants for Hamas leaders. And Jeremy Diamond is there at The Hague, back with us this hour. Nic Robertson is in 
 
 Tel Aviv and, Nic, we will start with you. 
 
What more can you tell us about this rocket attack in northern Israel?
 
And what does this mean for the wider conflict here?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Well, it was an important target for Hezbollah although they haven't claimed it yet. And Israel has 
 
 taken action against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. 
 
It was an important target and because this is the home of Northern Command. This is the military commander of the IDF that entirely protects 
 
 that northern border of Israel and projects the force forward into southern Lebanon. 
 
And that's what we've seen, the Israeli air force has taken part in a number of strikes in Lebanon, perhaps 10 or 20 miles or so inside Lebanon 
 
 and across the border to five named towns there, so far named by the IDF. 
 
We don't know what precisely the targets were. The IDF said that they were Hezbollah command and control positions. We don't know the impact entirely 
 
 that they've had there. 
 
But this is sort of been a little bit of a tit for tat that's obviously been going on for months but we saw it grow yesterday. Kiryat Shmona, 
 
 perhaps the largest town right up there in the very north of Israel, that was hit by a couple of rocket strikes from Hezbollah yesterday in the 
 
 middle of the town. 
 
Last night the Israeli air force had a couple of attacks inside southern Lebanon. And then today, you get these multiple rockets fired in, appearing 
 
 to target Israeli -- the IDF's principal command in the north of Israel. 
 
Then I think significant as well that we've heard today this afternoon from General Herzi Halevi, the chief of staff for the IDF, saying about these 
 
 strikes that it's -- that this shows that Israel can project that force, can do it quickly. This is not the end but the beginning, is really what 
 
 he's saying at the moment. 
 <br>[10:05:02]
 
Not clear how much he intends to escalate or if he'll escalate. But this is pretty immediate and tough language coming from the chief of staff for the 
 
 army here. 
 
ANDERSON:  Thank you, Nic. 
 
Jeremy, you've traveled to The Hague with those Israeli families who have family members still held in Gaza and those who lost family members in the 
 
 October 7 massacre by Hamas.
 
What are these family members been telling you today? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Becky, they've come all the way here to The Hague in order to file a complaint with the 
 
 International Criminal Court, accusing Hamas of genocide, of war crimes and of crimes against humanity. 
 
Their allegations draw on a body of testimony and evidence. Everything relating to the kidnapping of their loved ones but also, of course, the 
 
 killings and the sexual violence that took place on October 7 and since. 
 
And so these families have come here, urging the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to file charges against Hamas' top leaders. On 
 
 the flight that we just took from Tel Aviv to here, Flight 131, which was named for the 131 days of captivity that the hostages who still remain in 
 
 Gaza have endured. 
 
I spoke with several of these family members. And what they told me is that on the one hand, they are looking for justice. They are looking for 
 
 accountability. They hope that Prosecutor Khan of the ICC will indeed use the evidence that they have presented to file charges against Hamas' 
 
 leaders. 
 
But beyond that, they are also hoping that the world doesn't forget what has happened to their loved ones. And they're also hoping to build pressure 
 
 not only on Hamas with the hope that sanctions could soon follow on these leaders beyond this ICC filing. 
 
But also of course, on their own leaders and on leaders around the world, who are working to try and negotiate a potential ceasefire in exchange for 
 
 the release of hostages. We know that those negotiations have been taking place. They have been progressing in recent weeks. 
 
But all of that, of course, as far too slow for these families, who have waited an agonizing 131 days for their loved ones, unsure of their 
 
 circumstances, unsure of their fate. And so certainly they are hoping that this today will call attention to their plight  and pressure the 
 
 negotiating table, including Israeli leaders, to make a deal. 
 
ANDERSON:  Jeremy Diamond is in The Hague and you can follow -- thank you both. 
 
You can find the latest developments in Gaza, the region, in our "Meanwhile in the Middle East" newsletter. There is a story up right now about Egypt 
 
 boosting security along its border with Gaza ahead of the threat of an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah. 
 
You can access the newsletter by scanning the QR code on the bottom of your screen.
 
Actually not sure that it is there. But you can also find information on that newsletter on your CNN app. 
 
Well, there is growing panic in Rafah as desperate Palestinians, over 1.3 million, more than half of Gaza's population there, are left with nowhere 
 
 to go as their last refuge could become the focus of Israel's next ground attack. 
 
A number of international organizations pleading with Israel not to launch a ground offensive, including from the World Health Organization. It has 
 
 repeatedly expressed concern about Israel's relentless bombardment of the Strip. 
 
And last month, the director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was visibly shaken at the U.N., describing, quote, "hellish" conditions in 
 
 Gaza. I'm going to show you that moment. 
 
Then you'll get my exclusive interview with him that I conducted here at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION:  Struggling to speak because -- because the situation is beyond words.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  Since then, things have only gotten worse. Rafah now, under threat of a full-on Israeli military onslaught. 
 
What is the impact?
 
Or what will be the impact should that happen?
 
GHEBREYESUS:  You know, the situation is already beyond words. I can't even describe it, the situation in Gaza. And if this assault happens on Rafah, I 
 
 think it will be more disaster, serious, serious disaster. 
 <br>[10:10:02]
 
ANDERSON:  You are calling for an immediate cease-fire. Frankly, there, that is unlikely anytime soon. Now there are discussions going on behind 
 
 the scenes in direct talks between the Israelis and Hamas about release of hostages for a truce period. 
 
You must hope that we get some traction on that.
 
Are you confident at this point what happens if we get new troops, even a temporary truce? 
 
GHEBREYESUS:  I would go for a permanent cease-fire.
 
ANDERSON:  But nobody is -- we're not getting that. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  Everybody is echoing it. Many people are echoing it. 
 
GHEBREYESUS:  Yes. But I would still go for that because the situation is really, really -- I said it earlier -- hellish. As you know, more than 
 
 28,000 deaths now and more than 70 percent are women and children. That alone is enough to stop the war. 
 
Because those who are dying are the wrong people, who haven't done anything to bring this problem. So the best solution for this is to find a political 
 
 solution. I'm a strong believer that military intervention will not be a lasting solution. 
 
You know, you said earlier, I broke down in a U.N. meeting. The reason for that is my own experience. I know what the situation feels to be in that. I 
 
 know the sound of guns, I know the smell of war and also what it looks like. 
 
I can feel in what situation the kids and the women are living in. If a military intervention cannot be a solution, and I say, the long term is 
 
 political solution. 
 
I think Israel has to consider that very seriously because this is not for Palestinians. It's in the interest of Israel as well. I wish peace for the 
 
 Israelis and for the Palestinians. 
 
They can live in peace side-by-side. I ask Israel again to make the right decision to find a political solution. 
 
All the distraction, for instance, you know about 50 percent of residents' units have been destroyed. And not just the 28,000 (INAUDIBLE) but if you 
 
 take the missing close to 9,000 and the injured close to 70,000, more than 100,000 casualties, that's too much already to carry. 
 
ANDERSON:  Can you describe the challenges that your organization and those who work for your organization face on the ground? 
 
What's going on on the Egypt side of the border, for example, in getting aid and stuff that is needed most through?
 
And what's going on the ground in Gaza? 
 
GHEBREYESUS:  We have been asking for unfettered access but we've not getting that. As you know it's to maintain the basics in Gaza. You would 
 
 need more than 500 trucks a day but only a trickle is passing through. 
 
And compared to the need, what Gaza is getting is really nothing. Motor is a problem and sanitation a problem. Open defecation is common. We see now 
 
 there is increasing pneumonia, increasing and that's affecting the population.
 
ANDERSON:  There is talk of opening maritime corridors, air corridors, other land corridors but ultimately it's Rafah that is the access for 
 
 civilians in Gaza. 
 
How concerned are you about what is going on in Rafah at present, a threat of this assault and the potential for that no longer being access of? 
 
GHEBREYESUS:  There is already a large population coordinating that small area. If there is an operation, they have nowhere to go. And the outcome I 
 
 think is clear. It will be a serious disaster. The best solution is not to do it. 
 
And I think the whole world is calling for that. Doing it, I can't imagine what will happen. That's why when you raised it earlier, I said, you know, 
 
 its very hard to imagine even what would happen because it will be a serious disaster. 
 
I said hell but I don't think even if hell could describe it. So the best would be to stop it, not do it. And I plead to Israel not to do this. 
 
ANDERSON:  Its interesting. You're struggling to describe what you believe the impact will be of a full-scale assault, because it feels to me as if 
 
 you've run out of words to describe what is going on in Gaza.
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
ANDERSON:  Am I correct in saying? 
 
GHEBREYESUS:  That's it. That's it. And the best solution would be not two, not to because by the way, that place was initially when people started to 
 
 move, there was considered as a safe place. And there was even advice from the Israelis and in order for the population to move them. Now they have 
 
 nowhere to go, nowhere to go. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  The head of the WHO speaking to me earlier.
 
Aid reaching the Gaza Strip was already insufficient before this disaster began. The humanitarian situation has been tremendously hit by the conflict 
 
 and relief operations have been hampered even further after the U.S. and other top donors suspended funding for the main U.N. agency responsible for 
 
 aid distribution. 
 
That, of course, after allegations by Israel that some of UNRWA's staff were involved in the October 7 Hamas attacks. Here's what Dr. Tedros had to 
 
 say about that. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GHEBREYESUS:  I don't think Gaza can do without UNRWA. There is a talk saying UNRWA  can be replaced by others. I'll tell you, honestly, even if 
 
 (INAUDIBLE) or (INAUDIBLE) or (INAUDIBLE), WFP be put together, they cannot do what UNRWA is doing. That's for sure. 
 
And at this moment cannot be replaced and the only option we have, we have to continue funding UNRWA. And I hope the countries, the donors who fund 
 
 UNRWA will reconsider this.

ANDERSON:  India's Narendra Modi here to celebrate an historic moment for the UAE's millions of Indian residents. 
 
Plus Ukraine celebrating what is being touted as a major victory against Russia in the Black Sea. More on that after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  Welcome back. We are coming to you live from the World Governments Summit here in Dubai, the last day, things wrapping up here. 
 
 But the star attraction day three was Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, who delivered the main address on what is this final days here.
 
On his third visit in less than eight months, he then headed from Dubai down the road to Abu Dhabi to inaugurate the largest Hindu temple in the 
 
 UAE, a huge moment for the 3.5 million Indian residents here. CNN's Vedika Sud joins us now, live from New Delhi. 
 
Vedika, the UAE is the biggest Indian diaspora of anywhere in the road. Just walk me through the significance of this temple opening here.
 <br>[10:20:04]
 
The largest temple, as I understand it, in the Middle East. 
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Becky, 3.5 million, as you said, Indian expats of the 9 million residents in UAE, like you said, the largest in the 
 
 world as a community but also in the UAE, more than the Emirates. 
 
The people living there of that nationality itself. But yes, there is a significance which goes beyond just the expat community. There was a moment 
 
 they've been waiting for. We are told this is a temple, the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi that they wanted for awhile.
 
Yesterday, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, while addressing more than 40,000spectators who were at a stadium in Abu Dhabi to see him, he also 
 
 mentioned to them that this was a proposal that he had put forward in 2015 that was accepted by the UAE. 
 
And 27 acres of land is what was given for this temple. It's built on a sprawling land donated by the UAE government. It's made of pink sandstone 
 
 columns topped by seven spires representing the number of sheikhs that rule each of the Emirates. 
 
But also Becky, you'd know this as much as me or rather better than me in this case, that it may also signify how far the UAE has come in 
 
 acknowledging its expat community, especially the Indian community in this case, which makes up such a huge and large population in the UAE. 
 
Along with that, it also perhaps signifies and indicates deepening ties between the UAE and India, especially under Modi's governance. We're 
 
 talking about two nations. You mentioned how Modi, this is third visit in eight months. And that to an election year. 
 
Becky, how often do you see the prime minister of a country going into elections, moving away from his country and visiting another country just 
 
 two or three months ahead of the elections? 
 
Well, talk about two that have had free trade deals since 2022, the bilateral trade ties amount to about $90 billion  between them. And also, 
 
 you've seen what a big welcome he got from the UAE president. There was a guard of honor. They hugged. 
 
And he was also the guest of honor at the summit where you're at. So clearly this was a big moment, not only for the Indian expat community but 
 
 also a way of sealing the already ongoing, healthy, robust ties between the two countries -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Yes, and I can't underscore the importance enough of that UAE- India relationship. By 2030, they want to have doubles the trade ties, the bilateral trade to some 100 billion by 2030. 
 
As I say, there are of course, some politics involved. This is a major election year right around the corner. But you're right to point out, I 
 
 think this is his seventh trip since becoming prime minister, third in the past year or less. So as I say, incredibly significant moment. 
 
Well, before we move on I want to bring up two images that show how, in spite of the conflicts raging in this region and beyond, many players are 
 
 working to chart their own path. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON (voice-over):  I want to bring back these images of the warm embrace between Narendra Modi and UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al 
 
 Nahyan. 
 
The Indian prime minister welcomed with the guard of honor on his third visit in less than eight months, a sign of that fast growing relationship 
 
 between emerging powers of developing economic and political times, at a time of geopolitical upheaval. 
 
Remember the UAE has just joined the BRICS grouping, of which India is an incredibly important member. 
 
And another image of a new political reality emerging in this region and beyond, this Turkish President Erdogan, who was here in Dubai Tuesday, 
 
 arriving in Cairo today to be met by Egyptian president Sisi, a first visit by a Turkish president after nearly a decade of fraught relations. 
 
Two significant moments in the region or the wider region from which I am reporting to you tonight. 
 
Well, Ukraine says it destroyed a Russian warship in the Black Sea earlier today. Nighttime video provided by Ukraine shows a sea drone racing toward 
 
 the landing ship before a huge plume of smoke rose from the vessel. Kyiv claims it is now disabled. 
 
A third of Russia's Black Sea fleet with this latest attack, CNN let me tell you, cannot confirm the authenticity of these images and the Kremlin 
 
 has declined to comment. Earlier in Brussels, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg called Ukraine's recent gains a significant blow to Russia. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  Ukrainians have been able to inflict heavy losses on the Russian Black Sea fleet. 
 <br>[10:25:03]
 
They have actually been able to push the Black Sea fleet away from the western part of the Black Sea. And this is a great achievement, a great 
 
 victory for Ukrainians. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  He also praised the E.U.'s recent move to approve a new aid package for Ukraine and hopes that U.S. Congress members will soon follow 
 
 suit with more funds for Kyiv as well. That, of course, still outstanding stuff on the Hill. 
 
Coming up, in AI's race to the top, one chip is beating out the rest. We will be speaking to the brain behind a disruptor in the world of artificial 
 
 intelligence. That is coming up.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  Welcome back. You're with CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. We're at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. And one thing I've noticed 
 
 here is that whenever a discussion about artificial intelligence takes place, the rooms here, the huge halls get packed. 
 
That is because some of the leading minds behind the technological revolution have been gathered here at the conference over the past couple 
 
 of days. And in AI's race to the top, my next guest is sprinting at speeds never seen before. 
 
Jonathan Ross is the brain behind Groq, the world's first language processing unit. Now before I lose you in the technological jargon of AI, 
 
 let me put it this way. What Ross created is a chip that can run programs like Meta's Llama 2 model, for example, faster than anything else in the 
 
 world, 10 to 100 times faster, in fact. 
 
And he's here with me now to explain how that is possible. 
 
Before I ask you that, Groq, why Groq?
 
JONATHAN ROSS, CEO AND FOUNDER, GROQ:  Thank you, Becky. It's Groq and we spell it with a Q. And it's because it comes from a science fiction novel 
 
 and it means to understand something deeply and with empathy. 
 <br>[10:30:00]
 
ANDERSON:  Also it does. Tell us about your chip and what makes Groq chip LPU  different from other AI chips and accelerators? 
 
I have to tell our viewers the video was here of course, this week, at the beginning of the week. So we've had all the greatest minds in here. 
 
What's your story?
 
ROSS:  Well, asking me how the chip works before I show you what it does is a bit like asking how a magic trick works before showing you the magic 
 
 trick. You're going to get bored. But I'll give it a shot. 
 
So most chips, they don't have enough memory inside of them. Sort of like if you were building cars and you use a giant factory, you need about 1 
 
 million square feet of assembly line space. 
 
Well, if you don't have a building that's large enough to fit that, then you need to set up part of the assembly line, tear it down over and over 
 
 again. And that's slow and it takes a lot of time. 
 
And that's what happens with the GPU. You have to read from that memory. So thousands of times for every word that comes out, it's as if you're setting 
 
 up the assembly line over and over. 
 
ANDERSON:  You talk about the wow moment people have when they first experienced the speed of your tech. You are breaking performance records 
 
 almost every week. 
 
How fast is your processing today and why is speed so crucial, to coin a phrase?
 
So what, why do I care about the speed?
 
ROSS:  The reason you care about the speed is it's about engagement. Imagine if I spoke -- if I spoke that slowly, you'd just drift off, you'd 
 
 go away.
 
So the statistic is, if you improve the speed by 100 milliseconds on a website on desktop, you will get about an 8 percent increase in user 
 
 engagement. On mobile, it's 34 percent. People have no patience on mobile. 
 
And we now set a speed record where we can do what's called 500 tokens per second. That would be a novel in about, oh, somewhere around 100 seconds. 
 
ANDERSON:  I'm going to get to this. I've just got to ask you one other question before I actually try this out because clearly that's the only way 
 
 to really reveal what we're doing here. 
 
What makes you better than other large language models?
 
So we don't make the large language models, we just make them fast. And so we take open source models. We run them. So it's the same model everyone 
 
 else has. But you will have a very different experience because of the speed. Right now, AI is unnatural. 
 
ANDERSON:  All right. I asked you that question. 
 
But why don't I actually just ask Groq?
 
ROSS:  All right, lets do that. So we're going to turn it on. 
 
ANDERSON:  Let's do it. 
 
I know the officers in this block but what makes you different? 
 
ROSS:  First --
 
ANDERSON:  Do another -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hey, I'm Groq. You can talk to me like I'm a person or --
 
ANDERSON:  I will do --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  What makes you different from the large language model that I've -- may have used in the past?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sure I'm a bit different from those big language models you've used before. I'm a language user interface or LUI, designed 
 
 to have more natural --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  Got it.
 
How similar you to a human brain?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, I'm not a human brain but I'm designed to understand and respond to you like one. 
 
ROSS:  Yes. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I can process and generate human language in a natural way. 
 
ANDERSON:  Got it. Tell me something most people don't know.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Here's something interesting. 
 
Did you know that octopuses have three hearts to pump blood to the gills while the third pumps it to the rest of the body? 
 
And when an octopus --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- crawl rather than (INAUDIBLE) unless necessary. 
 
ANDERSON:  Write me a poem, it's Valentines Day, a very short one, very, very, very, very, very short but lovely. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, I see. Happy valentines day. I'm glad you're having a lovely day. I hope you get to spend time with someone special or 
 
 do something fun. This is. 
 
Is there anything you'd like to do better?
 
ANDERSON:  I'm giving up on you. You've done everything that I asked and more. Thank you so much. I feel as if I'm talking to a human being. It's 
 
 worrying me. 
 
How worried are other chip manufacturers by you?
 
ROSS:  Well, we've been contacted by a few of them. The speed is definitely a differentiator and people notice it and should I -- so thank you very 
 
 much. 
 
ANDERSON:  I'm sorry. How rude --
 
(LAUGHTER) 
 
ROSS:  Oh, we just interrupted. 
 
Thank you very much. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're welcome. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ANDERSON:  How will this tech be applied in our everyday life?
 
I get that. And this is quite something because I've been sitting using others, typing away, getting quite a lot of good, quite a lot of not so 
 
 good, I have to say. So this is really interesting 
 
What's the answer to that question? 
 
ROSS:  Let's talk about the reality for a moment. This technology is getting better and better every single day. Right now, it's at a point 
 
 where, for most people, when they're accessing it, it's unnatural, it's slow.
 <br>[10:35:03]
 
This is going to make it more natural. But the model that you were interacting with, while very good, is not quite as good as OpenAI's model. 
 
 That natural experience, though, changes it incredibly. 
 
What we've done is we've taken a whole bunch of open source models and proprietary models by small companies and we've accelerated them. And that 
 
 makes that very different experience. So 2024 is the year where AI is going to become real and natural.
 
ANDERSON:  Who's the customer at the end of the day?
 
ROSS:  We sell to businesses. And those businesses build applications. For example, the application that you just heard is by thatb.ai (ph). They made 
 
 all of that work and they're using our chips to do that. 
 
PlayHT, Deepgram, missdraw (ph), all of these companies working together to build this. They build the models and then we make it available to those 
 
 who want to build applications like thatb (ph) company. 
 
ANDERSON:  2024, you're excited. 
 
ROSS:  Totally. 
 
ANDERSON:  So we should be, too. 
 
ROSS:  I guess.
 
ANDERSON:  That was fascinating. Thank you very much. Indeed.

ANDERSON:  The defense minister and former army general has declared victory in Indonesia's presidential election. Unofficial results show 
 
 Prabowo Subianto has received nearly 60 percent of the vote. Official results not expected until next month. 
 
And in what is a huge year for elections across the road -- across the road -- across the world, where billions go to the polls across the world from 
 
 Indonesia and Donald Trump has requested the U.S. Supreme Court put a stay on a lower court ruling over his immunity requests for the January the 6th 
 
 criminal trial. 
 
And now the Supreme Court asking the special counsel, Jack Smith, to file his response to Trump's request. Smith will have until 04:00 pm on Tuesday
