JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome, everyone. I'm John Vause. Ahead here on CNN Newsroom.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: After 14 years of legal battles, Julian Assange can go home a free man.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: U.S. authorities to suit him for years he was the target of an arrest warrant in Europe declared sanctuary and Ecuador's Embassy in London, spent years in a prison outside London and for Julian Assange, it's over. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today, Kenya experienced an unprecedented attack. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Amid an explosion of rage, Kenya's President seems caught between the angry protesters and the promises to the IMF to increase taxes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Today is a very difficult day for us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: We're in the army now. Israel's Orthodox Jews disappointed and in disbelief. After the Supreme Court ruled they should be treated like every other Israeli and do their national duty.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from Atlanta. This is CNN Newsroom with John Vause.
 
VAUSE: For the past 12 years, Julian Assange has either been on the run in hiding or in jail for his role in a massive leak of us classified material. The co-founder of WikiLeaks is on a flight heading to the Australian capital Canberra. And when he gets there, he arrives a free man. 
 
Under a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors, Assange appeared before a U.S. judge in a courtroom in the Northern Mariana Islands. He pleaded guilty to one felony count, 17 other charges were dropped. He received a sentence of 62 months, time already served in a London prison. 
 
Let's go to journalist Alex Thomas, who's following these developments. He is in Canberra this hour. So is this -- when you think about Assange's returned to Australia? It seems there's a political component here for the prime minister that there's some you know, there's some gain to be had. If you'd like some political gain by welcoming Assange home, that is the case?
 
ALEX THOMAS, JOURNALIST: I think the initial reaction here in Australia's capital, John, is celebratory. There is certainly a political element to it. But for now, people are just rejoicing that a man that has gone through so much is actually free to return to Australia. 
 
You're right that the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has played a part in his release, and he has spoken a short time ago in the -- during Prime Minister's questions. When asked by one of the independent MPs about Assange's release, Anthony Albanese did say that he's standing up for all Australians. And that's in relation to those that see your Assange to someone standing up for the rights of expression, the freedom of speech, and the freedom of the press, which of course is all tied up with America's First Amendment. 
 
Alberni, sorry, Julian Assange's supporters have always said this is an Australian citizen, not an American citizen, who did not break the law, and certainly didn't do it on American soil. We'll get to the American reaction in a second. 
 
But this is all played out in a court on an American territory, inside pan, several hours flight away, as you say, he's in the air now on his way to Canberra Airport, which is where we are now. And this is what Julian Assange's lawyers had to say a little bit earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENNIFER ROBINSON, ATTORNEY FOR JULIAN ASSANGE: I hope that the fact that we've been able to free Julian Assange today, against all the odds and against one of the most powerful governments in the world, will give hope to all journalists and publishers who are imprisoned around the world. And we encourage everyone who's stood to fight for Julian, to continue that fight for him and for all of those others.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
THOMAS: Lawyer Jennifer Robinson also making the point that Anthony Albanese should be thanked for the party played, he raised the issue of Julian Assange with American President Joe Biden during a visit to Washington last year. But we have also seen quite a terse statement released by the American Department of Justice saying that Assange is not welcome back on American soil without prior permission, although I guess that's the same for all international business, isn't it? And making the point that they were right to pursue him so vigorously over all these years.
 
Remember, he wasn't indicted until 2018 under the Trump administration, the DOJ making the point that they still feel that American lives and national security were at stake for all those leaked documents many, many years ago.
 
VAUSE: We have a situation that we had eventually we have the Australian Prime Minister who is there ready to embrace Assange but privately it seems, you know, a good number of officials within this security establishment within the Australian security establishment, I should say, they're far from pleased that Assange is back in Australia.
 <br>[01:05:10]
 
THOMAS: Now, of course, and it's really brought out a fascinating mix of reactions from across the political spectrum. You've seen politicians on the right and the left, both uniting and support of Assange and uniting against him. What's interesting is the group of politicians here in Australia that have been campaigning for scientists release for many years and actually spoke a little bit earlier, saying that this is only the beginning of the fight, because although Assange is free, he was only free on a plea bargain and had to plead guilty to a conviction on one criminal counts against America's espionage laws. 
 
And they say that if you regard Assange as a journalist who published information that's in the public interest, you still seen the U.S. which stands for freedom of expression, and the freedom to say what you want in the media pursuing an individual for publishing secrets. Of course, there was that national security issue at stake and his detractors say that is why he will not be celebrated as a hero coming home.
 
VAUSE: Yes. A cruel wherever he goes. It's just -- this diverse opinion, and there's no common sort of reason to it. Anyway, Alex, thank you for being with us. Thank you for following the story. We will see you again throughout the day, I'm sure. 
 
Well, after nationwide protests turn deadly Tuesday, Kenya now bracing for another day of violent demonstrations over tax increases. At least five people have been shot and killed by police according to human rights groups. Dozens of others have been injured. CNN teams reporting paramedics were beaten and arrested by police as well. 
 
As lawmakers approved the tax bill, angry mobs stormed government officers setting fire to Nairobi City Hall, the governor's office as well as parliament. Kenya's President later describes the protests as treasonous, and accused organized criminals of hijacking the protests. 
 
CNN's Victoria Rubadiri has a closer look at Tuesday's protests and a warning her report contains some graphic images that may be difficult to watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VICTORIA RUBADIRI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): loud bangs ring out through the streets of Nairobi. Police firing tear gas and water cannons at dozens of protesters who gathered to condemn a controversial finance bill that would raise taxes. Demonstrators marched through the streets denouncing lawmakers for approving amendments to the draft law earlier in the day. 
 
Police responded forcefully with one officer firing a gas canister directly at the feet of a protester. Some even fired live rounds at the crowd. Throughout the day, several bodies were seen lying motionless on the ground. 
 
The clashes would escalate leading to a shocking scene at the parliament building. Dozens of demonstrators bypassed police and stormed the legislative building, with some entering the assembly chamber.
 
Lawmakers in the building were evacuated, some of them escaping through an underground channel. According to CNN affiliate NTV Kenya, parts of the parliamentary grounds were vandalized, even set on fire during the chaos. Elsewhere more scenes of destruction at city hall, the office of the governor of Nairobi was also burning and near Kenya's Supreme Court, a store was looted and parked vehicles were set ablaze. 
 
Authorities ordered the public to return to their homes by sunset. Many who remained outdoors were detained, even those who were there to help.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We were helping the injured ones. We are just from there. And we are being told to enter.
 
RUBADIRI (voice-over): The chaos drew widespread condemnation with envoys from more than a dozen nations expressing shock over the destruction, injuries and deaths. 
 
President William Ruto also responded to the violence in an address to the nation, but he didn't make mention of the Finance bill. 
 
WILLIAM RUTO, KENYAN PRESIDENT: I assure Kenyans that we shall provide a full, effective and expeditious response to today's treasonous events. 
 
RUBADIRI (voice-over): Kenya's opposition leader urged the government to put an immediate end to violence towards demonstrators and to withdraw the bill that sparked the unrest. Victoria Rubadiri, CNN.

VAUSE: Humanitarian aid is once again arriving in Gaza via temporary pier built by the U.S. military. Problem now though is that thousands of pallets packed with humanitarian supplies are just sitting on shore waiting for collection. That's after the World Food Programme suspended aid collections over security concerns. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has details.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do that you'll see with a lot of different bridging systems here --
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From ship to pier aid trucks are rolling into Gaza. Interlocking steel platforms roar with each passing wave. But after weeks of mishaps, the U.S. military's $230 million pier off the coast of Gaza is finally operational. 
 
But this aid isn't actually feeding anyone in Gaza, at least not yet. 
 
DIAMOND: We're currently aboard the U.S. military floating pier off the Gaza coastline yesterday, the military says they were able to get about 800 pallets of aid off of this pier and into Gaza. But the problem now is the World Food Programme which is supposed to be picking up that aid they say the security conditions just aren't there for them to be able to pick up that aid and distributed to the people of Gaza. 
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): These are some of the now more than 6,000 pallets of humanitarian aid. The U.S. military says are sitting in an open air warehouse across from the pier. World Food Programme paused its operations at the pier more than two weeks ago, citing safety concerns. 
 
Across Gaza humanitarian aid groups say Israeli military operations and a rise in lawlessness and looting are bringing their aid operations to a crawl. And it couldn't come at a worst time. As experts say people in Gaza are once again at high risk of famine. 
 
The U.S. military invited CNN to the pier for the first time to show how it is ramping up the flow of aid to Gaza. And how it is getting this beleaguered project back on track after rough weather damaged and took the pier out of service for weeks.
 
CAPTAIN JOEL STEWART, U.S. NAVY: The sea is a difficult task mistress. Unpredictable, each wave is different than the last. So dealing with that is a challenge. But we've adapted to that. And I think we're in a better position now than we were initially.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): About 40 truckloads are now arriving at the pier each day. Still well short of the military's initial estimates of 90 to 150. A complex effort aid officials say would have been best spent pressuring Israel to get more aid in buy land. STEWART: This was never meant to be a long term solution to the
 
 problem. This was meant to be one more way until we could find ways to open those gates up to get that pressure to open the gates.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Access to the U.S. pier also provided a rare vantage of the destruction to Gaza's coast. 
 
DIAMOND: It really is remarkable to see the Gaza coastline up close like this after nearly nine months of war. All we can see along the shoreline are buildings that are either completely flattened, completely destroyed or those that are simply shells of themselves. 
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): It is also the daily backdrop for U.S. soldiers like Sergeant Ibrahim Barry, a practicing Muslim who started working on the pier operation in March during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
 
SGT. IBRAHIM BARRY, U.S. ARMY: Knowing that they're going through his harsh conditions and still fast, still holding on to their faith and getting the little bit that they can. That's what it was another motivation right there.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Jeremy Diamond, CNN off the U.S. military's pier off the Gaza coast.

VAUSE: Well, voting in France's snap election will begin in just days. The will is high stakes gamble by President Emmanuel Macron actually pay off, a closer look at a moment. 
 
Also, Iran gearing up for its presidential election later this week. We'll hear from some of the voters in Tehran after a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:16:02]
 
VAUSE: The Israel reservists are the backbone of the military and every Israeli band must complete three years of national service once they finish high school, every Israeli woman two years, there has been one very big exception. Ultra-Orthodox Jews were actually not -- they were exempt from all of this but not now. That's after a ruling by the Supreme Court, which will enforce all Orthodox men to do national service. 
 
This ruling is a political blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ruling coalition, which relies on two Ultra-Orthodox political parties to remain in power. Netanyahu met with reservists in northern Israel, growing tensions with Hezbollah militants Tuesday, he's tried to advance legislation through the Knesset, which would enshrine into law the draft exemption. 
 
Tuesday's court ruling also ordered the government to withdraw funding from any religious schools whose students do not comply with draft notices. Joining me now is Yohanan Plesner, President of the Israeli Democracy
 
 Institute and a former member of the Knesset with the Kadima party. Yohanan, thank you for being with us.
 
YOHANAN PLESNER, PRESIDENT, ISRAEL DEMOCRACY INSTITUTE: Hi, John. Thanks for having me. 
 
VAUSE: OK. There's exemption granted Orthodox Jews of students has long been a source of division and anger in Israel. And that anger seems to have grown over the past eight months with Israelis reservist fighting Hamas in Gaza. I want you to listen to the leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid. Here he is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YAIR LAPID, ISRAELI OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): There's no more exemption for the Ultra-Orthodox, the games are over. The shady deals are over. The days when some shout will die and not serve, and others die because they served are over. The discrimination between blood and blood is over. If we don't fight together, we will die together.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Is that how the majority of Israel's feel about this exemption that the Supreme Court has ended saying that wasn't just blatant discrimination, but one which was born of shady and dodgy political deals?
 
PLESNER: Well, John, I don't think that there's any single one issue that there's a greater consensus among Israeli citizens from right left and center, national, religious, traditional and secular. And this is the issue of service. There's an understanding that Israel, obviously, is dealing with major existential threats from Iran and its proxies, and that we need a strong modern, high quality military. 
 
And the Supreme Court verdict of yesterday highlighted the fact that a quarter of the cohort of 18-year olds is gaining an automatic exemption. It started when the during the foundation of the state, but the numbers were very small. 
 
Now, two things happened. The demographic trends are such that the Ultra-Orthodox community grew very dramatically, and now they are about a quarter of the potential men that can serve. And the second thing is obviously the war that increases the military burden, not only on regular army, but also on reservists. So reservists in their 20s, and 30s, and 40s, and meet to serve for many days. And this inequality is something that is too difficult for the Israeli society to digest. 
 
On the other hand, Mr. Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, his entire a premiership for decades, is built on the alliance with the Ultra- Orthodox parties. He's basically granting them their wishes on their issue, which is mainly recruitment and other secretarial issues. And in return, he gets access to power. So those two trends are now in major conflict. VAUSE: We should note that, you know, the backbone of the Israeli army
 
 are the reservists who do their duty year in and year out. It's a very small professional army actually, but that's why Israel has been able to fight these wars that it fights. 
 
The Ultra-Orthodox (INAUDIBLE) though believes that their religious studies is how they help protect Israel and Judaism. I want you to listen to your actions now from an orthodox rabbi. Here he is.
 <br>[01:20:02]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RABBI MORDENCHAL BLOY, JEWISH ULTRA-ORTHODOX EDUCATOR (through translator): Today is a very difficult day for us. And the feeling in the Ultra-Orthodox community is of humiliation that the Supreme Court is trying to intervene and change world order.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: The Supreme Court made it clear that the military must begin drafting Ultra-Orthodox men now. But the reality is given they don't really have any kind of real world skills or training, they spend their time studying, you know, the Torah and other religious documents. 
 
How many of those 60,000 orthodox men in Israel who could be ready for a service training? How many actually would be ready to go on day one?
 
PLESNER: Well, it's a matter of a change of trajectory. Tomorrow morning, the military will not be able to enlist more than 70,000 Ultra-Orthodox men more in a status of deferral of service. But there's another implication, John, the Supreme Court said that unless the Knesset, Israeli parliament comes with comes up with an alternative legislation and exemption bill, this is the attempt of the Prime Minister to come up with an exemption bill. But he doesn't -- is not able given the situation in the war, to actually build a majority for granting such a blanket exemption. 
 
So unless there's an alternative legislation, the Supreme Court said that the Israeli law, the recruitment bill, the current recruitment bill, needs to be applied equally. And for those who decide to dodge service or trying to not do their share, the state can no longer subsidize them. 
 
One has to understand that this community heavily relies on state subsidies. It's the equivalent of scholarship -- scholarships plus an entire web of state payments and subsidies. And this would have to stop right now. And this is why it is such a consequential moment in Israel, both substantively, and obviously it has political repercussions.
 
VAUSE: Our thanks there to Yohanan Plesner, President of the Israel Democracy Institute. 
 
Now, the first of two rounds of voting will take place this week in France's snap election. And on Tuesday, the three major candidates squared off during a televised debate which at times kind of turned nasty was rough and tumble as well. The French Prime Minister squared off against candidates from the far-right National Rally Party and also from the leftist Alliance dubbed the New Popular Front. 
 
President and Macron dissolve the National Assembly and call the legislative election after the far-right National Rally outperformed his centrist political movement in European elections almost three weeks ago. 
 
Macron has framed the vote as a chance for voters to decide who they want to run the country. Candidates as expected sparred over a lot of issues, but including migration.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JORDAN BARDELLA, NATIONAL RALLY CANDIDATE (through translator): There are millions of French people who don't recognize France any longer, who don't recognize the country they grew up in anymore. And I would like us to put a stop to this crazy policy of mass immigration.
 
MANUEL BOMBARD, NEW POPULAR FRONT CANDIDATE (through translator): One in 10 workers in this country is an immigrant worker. And I'm telling you that rather than constantly putting them down, you should thank them. You should thank them because often they do jobs which are essential to the life of the nation, because as opposed to what you're saying, immigrants in France don't cost money they bring in money.

VAUSE: David Sanger is a CNN national security analyst as well as White House and national security correspondent for The New York Times. His most recent book is "New Cold Wars: China's Rise, Russia's Invasion, and America's Struggle to Defend the West." Welcome back, David. It's good to see you.
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Great to be with it.
 
VAUSE: So, now the latest poll from the French Institute of Public Opinion confirms a strong support level for Marine Le Pen's National Rally out there in front 36 percent. The left-wing alliance New Popular Front, NFP is at 28.5 percent. And way back in third place President Macron's pro-European centrist group is a distant third 21 percent.
 
Now, the French newspaper Le Monde reported some other background leading up to Marcon's decision to call this early election. Keep in mind the opinion polls we just saw, a small group of close confidence quietly worked on this high risk scenario. Allies of former President Nicolas Sarkozy pushed President Macron to take the plunge.
 
Sunday, two weeks ago, they're quite catastrophic score in the European elections precipitated that decision, that's the election where Macron is paid incredibly badly. 
 
So, with Le Pen's National Rally riding high with the momentum after those E.U. elections, Macron's plan was to stop that momentum by forcing France to essentially choose either the far-right or the center at these early elections. 
 
At the time this highly thought through strategy just seemed to be better, you know, best very risky. Now it seems kind of reckless.
 
SANGER: Well, it sure does. And let's look at the essential gamble he was making. He had -- Macron has another two years in office.
 <br>[01:25:00]
 
So he didn't need to call this vote. But I think he believed that as time went on the right might actually gain more strength, and that he'd be in a better position to call a snap election that would have to happen in 18 days, and not give everybody time to get organized for this. 
 
Well, it turns out they were organized anyway. And the best guessing right now is that National Rally will in fact end up with a plurality, probably not quite a majority. And that would keep Macron in office, but he would be obliged to get a prime minister from the far-right group.
 
VAUSE: You touched on this, I want you to listen to Marine Le Pen, as she was speaking not long after Macron, called that snap election. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARINE LE PEN, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RALLY (through translator): I can only welcome this decision, which is in line with the logic of the institutions of the Fifth Republic, we are ready for it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: I just say the far-right didn't just want these elections to happen. They were ready and prepared whenever they were called. So, if they knew this was their moment, why didn't Macron, and also why is this a moment? Is there an easy explanation why the National Rally is so popular with voters in France right now?
 
SANGER: Well, you know, you see this across Europe. You see a right- wing group that is increasingly popular in Germany. You see a piece of what's happening here, really happened in the United States as well, where you've got, you know, progressives who want to identify the Democratic Party, a group of pro MAGA Republicans who want to identify and redefine the Republican Party. And that has led to a much narrower middle, which is where the United States used to govern from. 
 
So it's not only France, and it's not only Germany. And it's not only the United States. And I think the reason for that is the move more to identity politics, this sense that one party would exclude a group of citizens, or that party would benefit from the fact that they came out of some tradition of certain kinds of citizens, whether it is Hispanic voters, or whether it is progressive voters or whatever. And what we're losing is the middle. VAUSE: Well, the far-right National Rally is not only the most popular political party in France right now. It's also within striking distance of an absolute majority in the National Assembly. Here's how the Guardian explained what that could mean, for France's 6 million strong Muslim population, the current polls make for dire reading. The party's France first policies on employment and benefits, meanwhile, intended to place Paris on a collision course with the European Union, at a time when the radical right is on the rise elsewhere. 
 
There could also be consequences here in this election for Ukraine, relations between France and the United States, for climate change policy, for instance, leadership role within the EU. 
 
So how far reaching and how consequential could this election in France actually turn out to be if the far-right does as well, as it appears they will be doing?
 
SANGER: It could be pretty far reaching, particularly if it happens in multiple places, particularly across Europe. Because of course, that's what many in Europe promised would never happen again. And the fact that you're seeing it comes out of everything, from economic frustration, to generational change, all the same forces that we're seeing happen here in the United States. 
 
In fact, the only one that sort of running counter to it at this point is in Britain where the Conservatives seem almost certain to lose. And the Labour Party, almost certain to come in.
 
VAUSE: David, thank you. Good to have you with us. David Sanger, CNN national security analyst. It's always good to have you. Thanks, David. 
 
SANGER: Great to be here. 
 
VAUSE: Another snap election, kind of, in Iran where the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini is calling for a high voter turnout for presidential elections this Friday to elect a new president after Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash last month. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Just over a month after Iran's President Ibrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were killed in a helicopter crash. Iranians are gearing up to elect a new head of government, even celebrating the important religious holiday Eid al-Ghadir people here are constantly reminded the vote is imminent. Iran Supreme Leader urging people to go to the polls.
 
Every time there's low turnout in elections, the enemies of the Islamic Republic and the envious denounced the Islamic Republic, he said. 
 <br>[01:30:00]
 
With the Middle East in turmoil and Iran recently close to an all-out war against Israel, people here have many issues on their mind. 
 
"We will defend Gaza and Palestine through massive turnout in the election," this woman says, "all people will take part in the election and we will prove that the Islamic Republic of Iran has a word to say in the world."
 
"We should all take part in this election," this man says, "to have a good choice so the country will come out of this difficult situation."
 
"I will not vote," this woman says. "I want the country to be strong, but I have not seen much action on their part."
 
There are six candidates remaining in this presidential race, and their posters are plastered all across cities and towns around Iran.
 
People are also handing out leaflets like this one. Most of the candidates that are still in the race are conservatives, but there is also still one moderate up for the vote.
 
Masoud Pezeshkian is a former health minister and heart surgeon by training. He calls for improving relations with countries across the region.
 
"Just the way we can talk to each other, we can also learn to talk to our neighbors and the rest of the world," he says. 
 
But Saeed Jalili, a conservative candidate and Iran's former chief nuclear negotiator, ripped into moderates and the nuclear agreement they negotiated with President Obama, but then President Trump walked away from.
 
"Not only did the economic situation of the country not succeed, but the economic growth became zero and negative."
 
As Iranians celebrate in the streets of Tehran, their eyes are set on the near future and who will govern the Islamic Republic in very challenging times.

VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone. 
 
I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.
 
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is on a chartered flight to Canberra, Australia at this hour, he was set free by a U.S. judge in the Northern Mariana Islands after pleading guilty to a single espionage charge. 
 
He had been facing 18 felony counts for publishing leaked U.S. military and government documents dating to back to 2010. 
 <br>[01:34:49]
 
VAUSE: The judge sentenced Assange to 62 months, time already served in a London prison.
 
More now from CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Julian Assange, a free man for time served, 62 months of it. Leaving court, his lawyer pleased with the outcome. 
 
BARRY POLLACK, ATTORNEY FOR JULIAN ASSANGE: The court today determined that no harm was caused by Mr. Assange's publications. 
 
We know that they were newsworthy. We know that they were quoted by every major media outlet on the planet. And we know that they revealed important information. That is called journalism. 
 
ROBERTSON: The WikiLeaks founder on his way to Australia, his wife and family. 
 
STELLA ASSANGE, WIFE OF JULIAN ASSANGE: It will be the first time that I get to see him as a fully-free man. All this is, it's so alien to the way we've -- it's been until now for the past 14 years.
 
GABRIEL SHIPTON, JULIAN ASSANGE'S HALF BROTHER: The work of WikiLeaks and the work that Julian did, you know, it's historical now. 
 
We can see that some of the cables that WikiLeaks leaked actually led to the end of the Iraq war. 
 
ROBERTSON: Assange's surprise deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, which included him admitting guilt and telling the judge he believed the First Amendment and the Espionage Act are in contradiction with each other.
 
Now, as much part of history as the historic security breaches he admitted to specifically conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified information relating to national defense of the United States. 
 
He has been on the run from the day his WikiLeaks first published U.S. secrets in 2010, initially about the war in Iraq, including this video of a U.S. Apache gunship killing Iraqi civilians and two journalists. 
 
His next release -- thousands of secret documents about the Afghan war. 
 
Then a massive data dump of sensitive, global, U.S. diplomatic communications, tens of thousands of secrets in the wind, lives of spies potentially compromised.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: WikiLeaks. I love WikiLeaks. 
 
ROBERTSON: Perhaps most consequentially, while on the lam in London in 2016 publishing leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign manager during her presidential election campaign against Donald Trump. 
 
For 14 years, Assange was a fugitive, first fleeing Sweden following a 2010 arrest warrant linked to rape allegations, which he denied, landing in the U.S. soon facing extradition back to Sweden eventually jumping U.K. bail in 2012, taking asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.

ROBERTSON: Ultimately wearing out his welcome, expelled seven years later, promptly arrested, taken to the U.K.'s maximum security Belmarsh prison, facing and fighting extradition to the United States.
 
Assange's freedom, it seems due in part to diplomacy.
 
ANTHONY ALBANESE, AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER: Regardless of the views that people have about Mr. Assange's activities, the case has dragged on for too long. There's nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration. And we want him brought home to Australia.
 
ROBERTSON: In recent weeks Australia's prime minister increasingly advocating for Assange's return. The White House denying it had any involvement in the plea agreement. 
 
Ironically Assange's get-out-of-jail deal was a better kept secret than his historic leaks. Once in Australia though, expect to hear a lot more from the man whose audacious challenge to power rewrote history.

VAUSE: Just over a day before debating Donald Trump, President Joe Biden remains busy at Camp David preparing with senior aides. A source tells CNN, Biden and his team are holding mock debates of varying lengths, focusing on both the substance and the stamina he will need for the rematch against Trump.
 
Meantime Team Trump is trying the old lower the expectations game by talking up Joe Biden. The man Trump has called Sleepy Joe and mentally unfit is now ready to go because as Trump sees it Biden has a long history of successful debates.
 
More now on Trump's debate style from CNN's Sunlen Serfaty.
 <br>[01:39:52]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TRUMP: Look at those hands. Are they small hands.
 
SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is a debate style, unlike any other.
 
MEGYN KELLY, FORMER FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals. Your Twitter account -- 
 
TRUMP: Only Rosie O'Donnell.
 
SERFATY: Donald Trump commanding the stage -- 
 
TRUMP: A lot of times.
 
JEB BUSH, FORMER GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA: -- property -- 
 
TRUMP: Let me talk, quiet. 
 
SERFATY: His off-the-cuff approach -- 
 
TRUMP: You're a tough guy, Jeb.
 
SERFATY: A stark contrast to his opponent's seemingly more rehearsed and carefully crafted lines. 
 
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER NEW YORK SENATOR: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
 
TRUMP: Because you'd be in jail. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Secretary Clinton -- 
 
SERFATY: That freewheeling strategy -- 
 
TRUMP: I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the emails? I'd like to know. Why aren't you -- 
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: We brought up the email.
 
TRUMP: No, it hasn't. It hasn't. And it hasn't been finished at all. 
 
COOPER: (INAUDIBLE) sent the questions.
 
TRUMP: Nice -- one on three. 
 
SERFATY: -- has targeted the moderators. 
 
TRUMP: Honestly, Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very, very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me -- 
 
SERFATY: -- and his opponents alike. 
 
CLINTON: My Social Security payroll contribution will go up as will Donald's assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it. 
 
But what we want to do is to replenish the social security trust fund -- 
 
TRUMP: Such a nasty woman.
 
SERFATY: -- with Trump oftentimes successfully deflecting policy questions by causing a commotion on stage.
 
CHRIS WALLACE, CNN HOST: I have a policy question for you, sir. 
 
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Let's see if he answers it. 
 
TRUMP: I will. Don't worry about it Marco. Don't worry about it Little Marco.
 
SERFATY: -- by leveling personal biting insults -- 
 
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): You went to Manhattan and said, I'm lying to the American people and the voters have a right to know.
 
TRUMP: You're the liar. You're the lying guy up there.
 
(CROSSTALKING)
 
TRUMP: You're the one. You're the one.
 
Let me just tell you. Let me just say -- excuse me. I've given my answer Lying Ted -- 
 
SERFATY: Interrupting.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The people left behind there were heroes.
 
TRUMP: really.
 
BIDEN: And I resent -- 
 
TRUMP: Are you talking about Hunter? Are you talking about Hunter?
 
BIDEN: I'm talking about my son, Beau Biden. You're talking about -- 
 
TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know Beau. I know Hunter. 
 
SERFATY: -- hammering away at his opponents -- 
 
TRUMP: every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from many. He shows up with a biggest mask I've ever seen.
 
SERFATY: -- with an unrelenting cadence that oftentimes knocks even the most seasoned debater off their footing.
 
TRUMP: Why didn't you do? Why didn't you do it?
 
COOPER: Allow her to respond.
 
TRUMP: Because I was a senator with a Republican president. 
 
TRUMP: Oh, really. I will be the president who will -- 
 
(CROSSTALKING)
 
TRUMP: If you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.
 
SERFATY: This chaotic approach -- 
 
TRUMP: Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
 
SERFATY: -- only amplified by his avid theatrics. 
 
TRUMP: Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. 
 
SERFATY: And one other strategy shift we've seen Trump make is for him to throw out this playbook entirely at one of the debates in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. He showed up and was mostly disciplined, more subdued, and a total surprise when compared to the past. 
 
And that is certainly one reason that Biden's team is preparing for this eventuality that Trump could break the trend and show up more disciplined and more on message.
 
Sunlen Serfaty, CNN -- Washington.

After more than a year in a Russian jail, "Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich is about to stand trial for espionage in a Russian court. 
 
Take a look at what could be the outcome. That's next. 
 <br>[01:43:38]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: At this hour, "Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich, who's been detained in Russia for more than a year, is about to have his day in court. His trial for allegedly spying for the CIA is expected to begin shortly. These are images which just came in a short time ago. You can see
 
 Gershkovich there in that steel -- the glass box rather. No media, family or U.S. embassy personnel had been allowed into the courtroom. The doors have actually been -- will be closed -- it will be a closed- door hearing held in secret.
 
The U.S. has officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Moscow. White House officials are accusing the Kremlin of hostage diplomacy.
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian has reported extensively on Russia. She is joining us live this hour from London. 
 
Clare, thank you for getting up early. Thanks for being with us. What do we actually expect if we don't know what's going to happen since we can't see what's happening inside there. 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Like I think after 15 months in pretrial detention, even though it might seem counterintuitive down in a country where less than 1 percent of criminal trials end in acquittal, I think there is probably an element of relief for making it this far.
 
As you say we've seen Evan Gershkovich in-person this morning in that courtroom in Ekaterinburg in that characteristic glass box that you see defendants in Russia. 
 
The reason why I say an element of relief as well is because Russia likes to go through this process in cases like this to lend an air of legitimacy. And I have made it extremely clear certainly in past cases that no diplomatic discussions could start on any potential prisoner swap or could at least progress on any potential prisoner swap until after the trial is over. 
 
So this is now beginning. The charges were approved last week by a judge. The prosecutors in Russia say that the FSB has proof that Gershkovich was operating, they say under instructions from the CIA. 
 
This is something the U.S. government and the State Department has strenuously denied. And that he was not trying to obtain secrets related to a Russian tank factory in that region. 
 
Again, the "Wall Street Journal" has strenuously denied that he was doing this. Take a look at this statement in an op-ed from the "Wall Street Journal" editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker. She says about the trial, "It will be held in secret. No evidence has been unveiled, and we already know the conclusion. This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for simply doing his job." 
 
So I think look, again in a country where most criminal trials don't end in acquittal, the focus will be significantly on the sentencing. 
 
And of course, the more serious crime that Russia can convict Gershkovich of the higher the value here is for them in a potential future prisoner swap. So I think that is the calculation here. The U.S. government say that
 
 embassy staff have traveled to that region to attempt to be part of this. But as we are hearing, it is a closed-door hearing and it's not clear if any part of it will be open to them. 
 
VAUSE: Clare, Thank you. Clare Sebastian, live for us this hour in London. Thanks.
 
Well, Ukraine and Russia each exchanged 90 POWs Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates brokered the exchange and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says some of the soldiers who were in this exchange, defended Mariupol and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. 
 
The Russian defense ministry says its soldiers will be brought to Moscow for evaluation and medical assistance. 
 
The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Russia's former defense minister Sergei Shoigu, as well as the current military chief. 
 
Both are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine. They join Russian President Vladimir Putin on the ICCs wanted list. It's unlikely that any of them will actually stand trial.
 
Almost 70 percent of Uganda's working population is employed in agriculture. But their access to financial services is limited and getting a bank loan can be slow, complex. 
 
Now, a financial tech company has developed a solution which empowers farmers, puts their needs first by simplifying the loan process.
 <br>[01:49:46]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LILLIAN NASSANGA MUSOKE, CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, EMATA: Because loan in Africa is a $240 billion opportunity, EMATA is a financial technology company that provides affordable financing for farmers.
 
We have over 50 partners that we work with. Within those we've been able to digitize more than 30,000 farmers. The challenges we face in this (INAUDIBLE) is that we are very high-tech company that is working in a very low-tech environment. 
 
But we have found ways to work with our partners to bridge some of these gaps by creating platforms at work offline, fast, for little to no connectivity.
 
We base our analysis of how much a format can borrow on the farmers (INAUDIBLE) and production of their particular crop or (INAUDIBLE). And so for dairy, how much they deliver in milk is what we use to create the credit limit for that farmer.
 
Additionally, what we make easy is that the farmer does not have to worry about how complex it is to repay the loan. A cooperative will check-off the amount that they need to pay to us before they pay the farmer.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So they felt like can access loan from EMATA. Well, as we need good luck if financial institution, like a bank you have to take collateral like a land title. Yet here can easily access a loan.
 
EMATA is looking into becoming a full-fledged financial service provider more than just the loan. So we will indeed look into increasing our product offering across insurance, across savings, across products that are aligned with our farmers' needs. 
 
Also, increasing our product offering to help finance our partners themselves and not just the farmers.
 
We will also be expanding into other markets, other countries in the different pilot chains (ph).

VAUSE: It's never too late to chase your dreams even if those dreams have to be objectified in a beauty pageant more suited to a time long since passed.
 
71-year-old Marissa Teijo made history as the oldest contestant ever in the Miss Texas U.S.A. pageant. She competed against 100 other women over the weekend. 
 
And while she didn't win, she said she was thrilled to represent older women inspire others to take charge of their fitness and healthy living. Teijo says weightlifting is the key to stay young, strong, and vibrant. 
 
She was able to compete because the Miss Universe Organization got rid of its upper age limit earlier this year and she did very well. Good for her.
 
Well, going for Olympic gold means burning a lot of calories and the organizers of the upcoming Paris games believe they've crafted the perfect menu with more than 500 dishes to meet the dietary needs of the world's greatest athletes. 
 
CNN's Saskya Vandoorne was there as 200 volunteers tested out the facilities in the athletes' village.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAASKYA VANDOORNE, CNN SENIOR PRODUCTER: This former power plant inside the Olympic village is now an eco-conscious restaurant for the athletes.
 
This is just one of the many kitchens that'll be fueling future gold medalists. This food hall will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and get this, (INAUDIBLE) 45,000 meals a day. 
 <br>[01:54:50] VANDOORNE: Cooking on this scale presents several challenges.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have to feed 50,000 athletes from 200 nationalities and we have to feed a judoka (ph) or we have to feed those gymnast, which is not the same -- you know, they don't eat the same food.
 
VANDOORNE: Nutrition is key and chefs have come up with over 500 different dishes with a third of what's on offer being vegetable- based.
 
In this kitchen, there's plant-based meat but also (INAUDIBLE) and some French culinary classics. But no wine to wash it down with.
 
That's right. Theres no deep fryer allowed inside the kitchen because of safety reasons. 
 
When you think of athletes, and you think of healthy eating, you don't necessarily think about cheese cake, chocolate muffins. Should the athletes be eating this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, they're here. 
 
It's for a reason because sometimes you have like a hard day, you spend a lot of energy and you want to add these to your meal. So you can cover your energy needs. 
 
VANDOORNE: There will be several cuisines on offer. Asian, Afro- Caribbean, French, Middle Eastern, and Halal cuisine, kosher food will also be available on-demand. 
 
So is the food any good? Let's go ask Paris 2024 president, Tony Estanguet what he thinks about it.
 
TONY ESTANGUET, PRESIDENT, PARIS 2024: Yes, it's delicious. 
 
VANDOORNE: That's why you won't find any cutlery here. And (INAUDIBLE) made in France. 
 
They've done away with plastic bottles in favor of reusable cups and these soda fountains. 
 
When the athletes are done eating, they'll come here. Now, there's that special thing -- right there? 
 
Recycling, and of course this is going to head straight into the dishwasher (ph).
 
30,000 plates, 20,000 bowls, and 35 people at a time, just to load these massive, dishwashers. When it comes to cutting waste, Paris 2024 going for gold.
