JAKE TAPPER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: May his memory be a blessing.
 
You can follow me on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, formerly known as Twitter, and on the TikTok, @jaketapper. You can follow the show on X, 
 
 @TheLeadCNN. If you ever miss an episode of "The Lead," you can listen to the show, all two hours, whence you get your podcasts.
 
Our coverage continues now with one Mr. Wolf Blitzer. He's right next door in a place that I like to call "The Situation Room." I will see you 
 
 tomorrow.
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: It is 6:00 a.m. in Shanghai, 8:00 a.m. in Sydney, and 6:00 p.m. here in Atlanta. I'm Lynda Kinkade, in for 
 
 Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A very warm welcome to "First Move." Here is your need to know. Widespread pro-Palestinian protests at U.S. colleges. Flashpoints at the University of 
 
 Texas at Austin, where several protesters are zip tied and pulled away. Students defy deadlines to leave an encampment at Columbia University in 
 
 New York.
 
In the Middle East, Hamas is considering a proposal to release at least 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting.
 
And fighting for a better Africa. How leaders across the continent from nearly 20 countries are working to deliver sustainable growth. We'll have 
 
 that conversation coming up.
 
But first, pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. college campuses entering their second week. Several protesters were arrested at the University of Texas in 
 
 Austin, but school officials say most of them are not believed to be affiliated with the university.
 
Here in Georgia, the president of Emory University is walking back a statement that said protesters were not part of the school's community. 
 
 That president is facing a no-confidence vote from the school's faculty.
 
And at Columbia University in New York, the epicenter for this movement, the school's deadline for protesters to disband has now expired. The 
 
 demonstrators voted to defy the order, and Columbia says it has now begun suspending those who are refusing to leave the campuses.
 
Well, I'm joined now by CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell for more on all of this. Good to see you, Josh. So, we've seen a range of responses 
 
 to these protests. We've seen situations where there's no outside police, we've seen heavily armed police, and also very violent arrests. But 
 
 certainly, in Columbia, it's almost six hours since that deadline expired for protesters there to leave the encampment or face suspension. What are 
 
 authorities weighing there with their response?
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Lynda, that posture of law enforcement and the University of Columbia much different than we're seeing 
 
 in other places such as the University of Texas today, such as Emory University in the last few days.
 
And as you mentioned, the authorities -- the officials at the university gave this 2:00 p.m. deadline today for essentially this group of protesters 
 
 who had set up an encampment to disperse. Now, the penalty that they were weighing here includes academic discipline, including suspending students 
 
 who were on campus.
 
Again, that is much different than what we've seen in other places where individuals on campus have actually been criminally charged for 
 
 trespassing. And I think that comes down to officials. They're wanting to potentially de-escalate this situation, not ratchet it up. Send police onto 
 
 that campus in order to clear it.
 
But, of course, there is the big question about what comes next. These protesters have indicated they're not going anywhere. We saw several groups 
 
 calling on others to join today to surge to the campus in order to "protect the encampment." And so, it's just a matter of time whether officials there 
 
 actually determine that they want to bring in the NYPD, New York Police, in order to clear that area.
 
Of course, as all this has been going on, we've also been hearing from Jewish students there on campus who say that they don't feel safe. One 
 
 anonymous student filed a lawsuit in federal court today, essentially accusing the university of unfair practices and having students now dial in 
 
 remotely for classes. And of course, again, we've heard from so many students saying that some of the protests themselves are making them unsafe 
 
 and not lending themselves to a safe environment in order to get an education.
 
So, certainly, a volatile situation right now, not a surge of police onto the campus, but we're all waiting to see what authorities ultimately do, 
 
 Lynda.
 
KINKADE: And of course, Josh, the stakes are high. We've already seen the resignations of two presidents at various universities for failing to 
 
 contain antisemitism and also calls now for the president of Emory to step down for those violent arrests we saw last week. How unusual is it for a 
 
 college campus to call outside policing to deal with any sort of protests like this?
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
CAMPBELL: Well, you hope that that would be the final step, right, to try to get these groups to disperse, to have these ongoing discussions again. 
 
 College campuses in the United States have long been known as places where people come to demonstrate, where people can discuss views that they might 
 
 have, even controversial views.
 
Of course, the question here has come down to a lot of harassment that people have claimed on these campuses, some antisemitic material and 
 
 slogans by some of the protesters. And we've seen, such as at the University of Texas today, authorities come in very -- with a full show of 
 
 force in order to try to dismantle a makeshift camp that was set up there in the center of campus.
 
Now, you know, I've talked to law enforcement across the country often. One thing I'm hearing now from law enforcement is they don't want to be in the 
 
 middle of any of this, right? Regardless of what one -- what a view one holds as far as the Israeli-Hamas ongoing war. The role of the police is 
 
 simply to clear out trespassers.
 
You know, there's no First Amendment right in the U.S. to protest on private property, and authorities are essentially taking their cue from the 
 
 university whenever university administrators and university boards of directors say, we want these areas clear, these people are trespassing, the 
 
 police have to go in, just as they would at any type of business or property, but it certainly presents a precarious situation when you have 
 
 protesters who say that, we're not going anywhere.
 
We saw a number of people detained today at the University of Texas, that ongoing right now trying to clear out that camp. And so, again, we would 
 
 hope that would be a last resort to bring in law enforcement, but we're certainly seeing it happen across the country.
 
KINKADE: And it's interesting, the tense scenes that we saw last week seem to have only led to the expansion and the intensification of these protests 
 
 across the U.S.
 
But it's interesting, Josh, when you look at the polling, most Americans don't approve of Israel's war in Gaza. It's handling of its war in Gaza. 
 
 So, it must make it harder, really, for some of these colleges to toe the line, to handle these sorts of demonstrations.
 
CAMPBELL: No, it is a really great point. When you look at public opinion and public sentiment and, you know, as we've discussed, college campuses or 
 
 areas where people are there to discuss their views, even the views that might be in conflict and that are certainly controversial. And so, I think 
 
 that's why we're seeing some universities take a softer approach when it comes to actually clearing out areas.
 
Because as you mentioned, you know, this is an issue that is certainly have -- has garnered widespread attention in the U.S. There's been widespread 
 
 condemnation of the number of innocent deaths that we've seen in Gaza. And so, it's certainly something that has served as a catalyst. People taking 
 
 to the streets here in the U.S., particularly at universities and college campuses.
 
But again, I think the big question for the universities come down to how do they balance that with also the need to protect the safety of students 
 
 and to ensure, you know, a campus where people are free from fear. And we've just heard so many times now in the last several days where Jewish 
 
 students, in particular, saying that, look, we signed up to come to this college campus to get an education, not to be berated and didn't have to, 
 
 you know, be exposed to a lot of these slogans and things that we've heard, you know, spraying of swastikas on certain pieces of property and the like.
 
And so, that is the delicate balance that administrators are doing right now. Despite the public sentiment, how do they create a campus that's free 
 
 from hate? It's worth pointing out that the overwhelming majority of these protests are indeed peaceful, and we have not seen any of that type of 
 
 vitriol, but it has certainly been there in certain cases, and that's what the officials at universities are grappling with, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: All right. Josh Campbell for us. Good to get your analysis of the situation. We appreciate it. Thank you.
 
CAMPBELL: Always. Thanks.
 
KINKADE: Well, our Nick Valencia is at Emory University in Atlanta. Of course, Nick, this is the scene of those violent arrests last Thursday. 
 
 We've since heard these calls, these repeated calls for the president there to step down. What's the latest?
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, much different scene of intensity, level of intensity from what we saw last week. Those violent arrests that 
 
 took place with Georgia State Patrol invited on campus by the president of Emory University, as well as members of the Atlanta Police Department. And 
 
 they descended on these protesters that were staged in an encampment in this quad just behind me. And they tackled some of these demonstrators, 
 
 throwing them on the ground.
 
Twenty-eight people in all were arrested, 20 of whom had connections to this university, including current students, and even a professor, Caroline 
 
 Fohlin, she's an economics professor, a prominent voice here on campus for the students. She was taken into custody, had to spend the night in jail. 
 
 And there was also the chair of the philosophy department here, Noelle McAfee. She was detained, given a citation, and released.
 
I caught up with her earlier, and she was telling me about the feelings of some Jewish students here on campus who believe that this has become a 
 
 hostile environment for them, and she pushed back on that. And she said she believed that these demonstrations actually were not against Judaism, but 
 
 rather against the actions of Israel in Gaza.
 
We also caught up with one of those that was arrested, who is a student here, Madeline Gordon. She's a senior here, and she says that she felt 
 
 abandoned by the school's leadership, that she was protesting respectfully when police showed up and started in with the violence.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADELINE GORDON, EMORY UNIVERSITY SENIOR STUDENT: Students are out here because they don't want violence happening to anyone. It just feels really 
 
 helpless as a young person when the people in authority and the people who are supposed to be like teaching you and leading you and showing you how to 
 
 create a better world are like actively suppressing students.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALENCIA: All of this is being held, or happening rather, as a referendum is being held on the university president. A ballot was handed out to the 
 
 faculty here at the College of Letters of Arts and Sciences. And really, it's a no-confidence vote, a motion that was organized by the tenured 
 
 faculty here last week, and it's now being put to the rest of the faculty here. It's a symbolic referendum to show that the university faculty has 
 
 voted overwhelmingly, at this point, so far, to say that not only do they not agree the way things were handled here on Thursday, but they have no-
 
 confidence in the current university president to continue on here as a leader.
 
Meanwhile, those days of action continue here. We had a 12:00 p.m. walkout by the faculty and then another 2:30 student led demonstration. The crowd 
 
 here that you can see behind me, they're the leftovers from that demonstration. Their protest continues here on Emory, but a very respectful 
 
 one so far. Lynda.
 
KINKADE: And of course, Nick, we know some students at college campuses are facing the threat of suspension should they continue with the protest, like 
 
 at Columbia. Are there any repercussions for students there that have been arrested?
 
VALENCIA: It's been of about-face here. They've been charged some with disorderly conduct, others with, you know, not dispersing when police told 
 
 them to disperse, criminal trespassing. But really, there's been sort of an about-face from university officials. They've actually been negotiating 
 
 with defense attorneys, it's our understanding, and they're talking about actually dropping the charges of those who were arrested last week. We have 
 
 yet to see that play out just yet. But those are the conversations that are happening.
 
Meanwhile, as I mentioned, those days of action continue here on campus in a much quieter fashion. Lynda.
 
KINKADE: All right. Nick Valencia, good to have you on the story for us at Emory University in Atlanta. Thanks so much.
 
We turn now to breaking news. Three U.S. marshal officers have been shot and killed in Charlotte, North Carolina. Police say the officers were met 
 
 with gunfire while serving a warrant for a firearm violation. One suspect was also killed while two other people are being held for questioning. Five 
 
 other law enforcement officers were shot and injured during that incident.
 
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings explained what happened a short time ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHNNY JENNINGS, CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT: About 1:30 p.m. this afternoon, the U.S. Marshals Fugitives Task Force went to the 5,000-
 
 block of Galway Avenue and attempt to serve a warrant on an individual for possession of firearm by a convicted felon.
 
When they approached that individual, they were met with gunfire. Officers returned gunfire and struck the victim who was later pronounced deceased in 
 
 the front yard of the residence. As officers approached that individual, they were -- they then received additional gunfire from inside of the 
 
 residence.
 
So, after a long standoff, we were able to clear this residence and confirm that there were two additional people inside. They were both brought to the 
 
 police station as persons of interest, and we're trying to determine now what exactly occurred inside of the residence.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Our thoughts are certainly with the families of those three officers. We will have more on that story as it comes to hand.
 
We're going to take a quick break. We'll have more from "First Move" in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:16:40]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. We're turning to our top story now on pro- Palestinian protests are rocking college campuses right across the United States. Protesters at Columbia voted to remain at their encampment past the 
 
 school's 2:00 p.m. deadline. The school says it has started suspending those who refuse to leave.
 
And in Los Angeles, students at UCLA entered the university's main auditorium Monday afternoon while faculty held a rally in support. And at 
 
 least six demonstrators were arrested at the University of Texas in Austin after officers moved in and surrounded a group of them.
 
Well, the campus protests are just the latest political headache for U.S. President Biden. A new CNN poll shows that 71 percent of Americans 
 
 disapprove of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. That includes 81 percent of people under the age of 35. President Biden will likely need to 
 
 carry young voters if he wants to win this November.
 
Well, as President Biden faces these challenges, could some voters be remembering Donald Trump's presidency in a warmer light? That's what 
 
 Stephen Collinson recently wrote about for cnn.com, and he joins us now live from D.C. Good to see you, Stephen.
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER: Hi.
 
KINKADE: So, are voters suffering from memory loss, failing to recall Trump's presidential term, or is it more big issues at play, the fact that, 
 
 you know, Biden's response to Israel's war in Gaza is costing him and Trump's ability to paint himself as this, you know, political victim is 
 
 actually paying dividends for him?
 
COLLINSON: Yes, it seems strange that after a presidency that was four years of absolute chaos every day, that included two impeachments, that 
 
 voters might be starting to feel a little bit more warmly about Donald Trump.
 
History does show that the longer a president is out of office the more voters appear to approve of his presidency. And I think what's going on 
 
 here is that President Biden is the incumbent. Whenever there is something that voters are dissatisfied about, the guy in the Oval Office tends to get 
 
 the blame, even if it's always not their fault.
 
So, we know that there's a great deal of discomfort still among voters about the economy, about high prices, about the impact of high interest 
 
 rates, which are still not going down, that makes it hard to buy a house, to buy a car, et cetera. A lot of this is coming to, you know, build 
 
 opposition against President Biden. And I think that is why voters might be saying, at least some of them, that their economic conditions before the 
 
 pandemic were better when Trump was present than when Biden was present.
 
But we've still got six months to go. And I think Biden will be trying to recreate those memories of the chaos of the Trump years for voters.
 
KINKADE: Yes, he's certainly got an uphill battle to do that. Especially when you consider how little interest there is in this 2016 rematch. That 
 
 recent NBC poll found that interest in this election is at a 20-year low. It seems voters overall don't seem passionate about either candidate.
 
COLLINSON: Yes, and I think that is not particularly surprising, because if you go out and talk to voters at a lot of the rallies that took place, 
 
 especially during the primary race, although you get your partisans that are in favor of Biden or Trump, a lot of voters aren't really excited by a 
 
 contest between an 81-year-old incumbent, a 77-year-old who was already present.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
I think if there was another candidate, a younger candidate, pushing more to the future, that would, I think, get a lot more voters interested in the 
 
 race. At the same time, however, Trump does have a record of turning out large numbers of people base Republican voters who are excited to vote for 
 
 him. He also has a record of stirring turnout among Democrats who despise him and really don't want him back as president.
 
I think in a lot of ways, this race, although it is a referendum on the Biden presidency, the closer we get, the question is going to become to a 
 
 lot of Americans, do they really want Donald Trump back? And as November approaches, it's going to be a little bit easier, I think, for Biden to 
 
 make that contrast as we see Trump, you know, in the public eye more often, especially if there were debates. So, we get through the convention season, 
 
 everything else.
 
So, while there's low interest now, I would expect it to tick up as we get closer to the election.
 
KINKADE: Yes. As you say, still six months to go to November. Stephen Collinson, good to have you with us. Thanks.
 
COLLINSON: Thanks.
 
KINKADE: Well, in today's "Money Move," U.S. stocks began a busy week for economic data in the green. Call it the calm before the storm with a Fed 
 
 policy meeting beginning Tuesday and the monthly U.S. jobs numbers coming in on Friday.
 
Important earnings also on tap from Apple and Amazon. Well, Tesla was one of this session's biggest winners. It rallied 15 percent onward that it's 
 
 closer to winning approval in China for its advanced driver assistance technology. Asia also in the green. The Japanese yen strengthened as well. 
 
 Traders suspect that officials in Tokyo gave the yen some much needed support after it hit 34-year lows.
 
Well, the Beijing auto show is all about electric vehicles this year, and that might explain why Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a surprise visit and met 
 
 with senior trade officials. He was also there to promote Tesla's self- driving technology. And CNN's Marc Stewart was at the auto show and filed this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is Auto China, the largest car show in all of China and one of the largest in the world. There are a few gas-
 
 powered cars here, but the real focus is electric.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (through translator): I came here mainly checking on EVs. Now, there are many EV brands. So, there are lots of options.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We like the standout, eye catching color.
 
STEWART: There are more than 200 EV makers in China. Take a look over here. This is the line to see the latest offering from Xiaomi. It's a Chinese 
 
 tech company known for its phones. This is the much talked about Xiaomi SU7. Yes, it has an aerodynamic design. It can accelerate very quickly. Its 
 
 battery can take you for about 500 miles. But its most distinct point is this touchscreen. You can use it to control almost all aspects of your 
 
 life. You can turn the lights in your home on and off. It can even start the coffee maker.
 
This isn't just about performance. Geopolitics plays a role too. Elon Musk flew to China over the weekend on a surprise trip and met Chinese Premier 
 
 Li Qiang. Musk has his biggest overseas Tesla factory in Shanghai, so he has big stakes in China.
 
According to state media, Li said that China is open to foreign business and wants to make it easier for global companies to come here. In addition, 
 
 Musk said Tesla's Gigafactory in Shanghai is its best performing.
 
Tesla wants to be an even bigger player in the Chinese market in addition to its American base.
 
ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: It's good to see electric vehicles making progress in China. All cars will be electric in the future.
 
STEWART (voice-over): As a piece of American technology, Tesla faced lots of restrictions in China out of security concerns. Until this visit, Tesla 
 
 cars were sometimes not allowed to enter airports, government compounds, and other sensitive areas.
 
Well, this time after Musk met Li, Chinese authorities announced that such restrictions on Tesla cars are no more because the company's China-made 
 
 vehicles have passed the country's data security requirements.
 
STEWART: As Elon Musk looks for success here in China, for Chinese car makers looking to break into the American market, that may not be so easy. 
 
 Top U.S. officials have expressed concern that Chinese cars could potentially collect data and send it back here to Beijing, a potential blow 
 
 for China, the world's largest auto exporter.
 
Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.

KINKADE: Well, Oklahoma was hit by almost two dozen tornadoes Saturday, killing at least four people. Severe storms brought twisters and heavy rain 
 
 from Missouri to Texas over the weekend. Well, for more on this, I'm joined by Chad Myers. Good to have you with us, Chad. So, these tornadoes 
 
 certainly left a trail of devastation.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right. More than 140. We're still counting. There likely could be 150 tornadoes that were on the ground over the past 
 
 three days. Wind damage and hail damage as well.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
But here's one of the storms near where actually I went to college, near Lincoln, Nebraska, right here. This was a 150 plus mile per hour storm. 250 
 
 kph storm in its circulation down here right at the base, tearing up even some train cars there. This is the storm that was out of Oklahoma doing 
 
 devastation down here. So, yes, some of these storms were approaching 280 kilometers per hour at the base.
 
Things have calmed down today. We are in good shape. There will be a threat of some severe weather tomorrow, but not like that. Not like the pictures 
 
 that I just showed you. There will be some hail. There may be some wind damage, but not the huge threat of monster tornadoes like we had across 
 
 parts of the U.S. over the weekend.
 
Someplace else that had some big weather, China. You don't see this very often. Look at the pictures here. Here's a tornado out of China. This thing 
 
 is going to hit the power line structure, causing power flashes here with all of this debris in the air spinning around the storm.
 
What else did it bring? Hail. Hail larger than baseballs, smashing the ground, smashing the cars and even smashing through some roofs across parts 
 
 of China. So, yes, more rain is on the way. We do know that some spots will pick up another 250 millimeters of rain. Remember, we did that -- all that 
 
 math over the last week, that's about 10 inches of rain just in the next four days.
 
People here are sick of the rain. And really, if we get much more, there is going to be substantial flooding possible here. Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Wow. Incredible. And certainly, frightening seeing the size of that hail. Chad Myers, good to have you with us. Thank you.
 
We're going to take a quick break. We will have much more on "First Move" in just a moment. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:03]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back to "First Move." I'm Lynda Kinkade with a look at more international headlines this hour. And Hamas is considering a proposal 
 
 that calls for the group to release at least 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting. That number could go up to 33 
 
 according to our sources.
 
And white visiting Saudi Arabia, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Hamas to accept the offer.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLINKEN: Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel. And in this moment, the only thing standing between the 
 
 people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas. They have to decide, and they have to decide quickly. I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision, and 
 
 we can have a fundamental change in the dynamic.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Well, in Gaza, officials in the Rafah Hospital say at least 22 people, including five children, were killed in Israeli airstrikes on 
 
 Monday.
 
Hunter Biden is demanding Fox News remove sexually explicit images of him from its platforms. That's according to a letter obtained by CNN. Fox aired 
 
 a mock trial of the U.S. president's son in 2022, which included explicit images. Biden says the images were hacked, with his attorneys alleging they 
 
 violate state revenge porn laws.
 
The Paris prosecutor's office says actor Gerard Depardieu will face trial in October over sexual assaults allegedly committed on a movie set back in 
 
 2021. He is also under investigation for suspected rape and sexual assault in another case dating from 2018. CNN has reached out to the French actor's 
 
 lawyer for comment.
 
Spain's prime minister says he will not resign after a far-right organization accused his wife of corruption. Pedro Sanchez cancelled his 
 
 public duties last week, saying he needed to reflect on whether he should stay on. A regional court has opened an investigation against his wife for 
 
 alleged influence peddling.
 
Returning now to our top story this hour and protests at university campuses across the U.S. Several institutions have called in police to 
 
 crack down on these demonstrations and remove tents. At Columbia University in New York, the epicenter for this movement, the deadline for protesters 
 
 to leave expired six hours ago. Demonstrators voted to defy that order and Columbia has yet to started to suspend those who choose to stay in that 
 
 encampment.
 
To get broader perspective on this. I want to bring in retired New York police detective and law enforcement consultant Tom Verni. Good to have you 
 
 with us.
 
TOM VERNI, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE: Good to be here. Thank you for having me.
 
KINKADE: So, we know, you know, for decades now, university students have protested and stood up for what they believe in. And certainly, when it 
 
 comes to Columbia University, it has a very long history of doing just that. What do you make of the police response so far, given that this 2:00 
 
 p.m. deadline has now passed and those encampments largely remain?
 
VERNI: Well, this is a very -- you know, this is a very convoluted situation that we're dealing with here. It's -- you know, it's very -- 
 
 there are very strong feelings on all sides of this issue. And, you know, college students live -- many of them live in an idealistic, sort of, frame 
 
 of mind where they -- you know, they think that by interrupting campus operations or closing down a bridge or a tunnel is going to suddenly, you 
 
 know, make the world correct. And unfortunately, that's not how it goes.
 
You know, while the police, ironically, are there to protect the rights of students to protest legally, because inevitably, when you have a protest, 
 
 you have anti protesters, right? So, you know, the police are there to keep the peace, to make sure that those who are protesting can do so without 
 
 feeling, you know, intimidated by those who are protesting against them, right?
 
KINKADE: Yes. And I was just going to say, Tom, we have seen plenty examples like that. But certainly, there are also the examples like the one 
 
 here at Emory University in Atlanta where we saw some aggressive violent arrests, really, with, you know, professors thrown to the ground. Is that 
 
 the right way for police to respond to a demonstration like this?
 
VERNI: Well, you know, demonstrations have a very high degree of probability of spinning out of control and turning into many riots, you 
 
 know, if cooler heads don't prevail. Many of them -- many times are -- there are anarchists that participate in these protests who try to rile up 
 
 the crowd and make the crowd go against the police.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
?And, you know, when the police are giving lawful orders to perhaps move in a direction or to clear an area, whatever it may be, you know, the 
 
 protesters have to comply with the lawful orders of the police. When they don't do that, then the police have to make a decision as to how they're 
 
 going to potentially surgically remove those who are disrupting that peaceful protest, trying to turn it into something else and potentially put 
 
 them at harm.
 
You know, if the police are in harm's way, then who's going to protect the police and the general public, for that matter if these protests get out of 
 
 control? These protests are very large in numbers, many times. Hundreds, if not thousands of people. So, you have to try to ensure that they stay 
 
 confined to the protest itself in a legal manner before things get out of control and somebody gets hurt or potentially killed.
 
KINKADE: There certainly have been instances of outside agitators, people that are not students, nor faculty protesting on campuses. How does law 
 
 enforcement detect a so-called outside agitator, especially in a campus situation where there are barricades erected?
 
VERNI: It's very difficult many times to do that. Some of them disguise themselves as part of the campus population. So, it's not until their 
 
 behavior draws the attention of the police in a certain way where they -- it seems clear that they are -- their focus is not for the actual protest 
 
 and what the protesters wanted. They try to gain or garner support amongst those who are agitated about the general situation, but now try to turn 
 
 things against the college itself or try to turn things against the police and make the group agitated towards them and looking for some sort of 
 
 uprising.
 
This happened actually during about, say, about a dozen years or so ago when there was the Occupy Wall Street factions, if you recall, in Lower 
 
 Manhattan. You know, they took over a park called Zuccotti Park. They first started protesting about, you know, the banks and the bailing out of 
 
 financial institutions during the great crash in 2008. And quite frankly, there were a number of police who were on board with that saying, yes, that 
 
 is kind of messed up that these financial institutions are not being, you know, bought -- paid for by -- with our tax money and no one seems to have 
 
 been punished for the wrongdoing of that.
 
So, you know, when it started with that core group of people protesting, it then sort of multiplied into all kinds of different protests, including 
 
 those who are anti-government, those who are anti-police. It became 52 different protests in one, and then they decided to just camp out on 
 
 someone's property. And that doesn't work well, you know, for too long either. So, at some point, they need to be removed off of private property.
 
KINKADE: Yes, it's certainly a fragile situation, trying to balance the rights of freedom of expression, the right to protest, the right to free 
 
 speech, et cetera, while also maintaining safety and security. Good to have you with us, Former New York Police Detective Tom Verni.
 
VERNI: Thank you for having me.
 
KINKADE: Well, the U.S. State Department is accusing five Israeli security units of human rights violations well before the start of the current war 
 
 with Hamas. Four of those units have since taken action to address the claims, that's according to a State Department spokesperson. But U.S. 
 
 officials are still weighing their response to the remaining unit. Kylie Atwood reports.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The State Department announced today that they have found five Israeli security units to have 
 
 been in violation of gross human rights for incidents that occurred before October 7th, but all of these units are still eligible to receive U.S. 
 
 arms. And here's the breakdown of how this looks right now.
 
Four of those units, according to the State Department, the Israelis have taken remediation action. We don't know exactly what that looks like. 
 
 Presumably, that's some sort of punishment for those were involved with those human rights abuses. And then there is one unit, this is an IDF unit 
 
 that the United States is still in talks with the Israelis over.
 
The Israelis have provided more information to the United States about this incident or this unit, presumably that was recently, though the State 
 
 Department hasn't said exactly when that was because that information is still being reviewed as the State Department is going to make its final 
 
 determination as to whether this unit is still eligible to receive U.S. arms.
 
It's noteworthy that State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said earlier today that remediation for the Leahy Act, which is the requirement 
 
 for the review of any of foreign actors or foreign governments who are receiving U.S. arms, that actual remediation is consistent across the 
 
 board. But then when asked to describe what that actual remediation looks like, he said it is different on a country-by-country basis, pointing out 
 
 that the U.S.-Israeli relationship is a very close one.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
So, it's very clear that even though the State Department says that remediation is consistent, there are some irregularities, there's some 
 
 different applications when it comes to different countries, and that is something that we're keeping an eye on as we watch to see the final 
 
 decision over this IDF unit. Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Out thanks to Kylie Atwood reporting there. We're going to take a quick break. Much more on "First Move" in just a moment.

KINKADE: We return now to the breaking news out of North Carolina, where three members of U.S. Marshals Task Force have been shot and killed in 
 
 Charlotte, North Carolina. Police say the officers were met with gunfire while serving a warrant for a firearm violation.
 
One suspect was killed and two people are being held for questioning. Five other law enforcement officers were shot and injured during that incident. 
 
 Dianne Gallagher is standing by for us. And this is certainly a horrific tragedy, Dianne, three officers dead, five wounded while serving a warrant. 
 
 What more can you tell us?
 
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. The chief of police saying that he can't recall a deadlier day in law enforcement 
 
 here in the Charlotte area. Eight law enforcement officers shot. Of course, three of them killed. The U.S. Marshals confirming one of those three, a 
 
 deputy U.S. marshal.
 
Look, this started off with the execution of a warrant. They were serving a warrant on a suspect for a felony possession of a firearm. According to the 
 
 police, when that task force arrived, there began -- they were shot at. They returned fire and they shot that suspect who was pronounced dead on 
 
 the front lawn of the home.
 
Now, according to the chief, as they began going up to that suspect who had been shot, there began having gunshots come out of the house. CMPD, 
 
 Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers then responded. Four of those officers were injured who responded to the initial gunfire there.
 
The mayor of Charlotte saying that she heard from the White House today, several members of Congress offering help and just expressing how tragic 
 
 this was and how difficult it is for those here in this community to comprehend what happened here.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VI LYLES, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA MAYOR: You never know what your day is going to be like. You can't plan things like this to be in this space at 
 
 this time. We've lost three people. They lost their lives after they gave us the opportunity to be in a safe place and they lost their lives.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
These are people that care deeply about what they've done for a profession. And now, today, we have to say to them how much we are grateful for what 
 
 they have done.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GALLAGHER: Now, we do know one of those police officers who was injured responding to the shooting remains in critical condition. The governor of 
 
 North Carolina is here in the City of Charlotte. I'm told just now by his office that he'll be meeting with the victims and their families in just a 
 
 few moments.
 
KINKADE: All right. Dianne Gallagher, we'll leave it there for now. Thanks very much.
 
And we're going to take a quick break. But still ahead, unlocking Africa's limitless potential. Global Citizen and Bridgewater Associates are 
 
 announcing a major African economic summit for later this year to help boost the continent's growth. We hear from the heads of both organizations 
 
 after the break. Stay with us. You're watching CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade. In Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday, leaders from nearly 20 African nations met to discuss how best to rev up 
 
 economic development, alleviate poverty and help protect people from worsening climate change.
 
At the event, hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates and the Global Citizen Organization announced a two-day economic summit in the Ivory Coast 
 
 later this year, and that meeting will focus on helping the World Bank improve living conditions in 75 low-income countries.
 
Well, I spoke today with Hugh Evans, the CEO of Global Citizen, as well as Bridgewater CEO, Nir Bar Dea, and Sellah Bogonko, representing the youth of 
 
 Africa. All three were in attendance at the Nairobi conference, and I began by asking Hugh about the goal of October Summit and this new public private 
 
 partnership.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUGH EVANS, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, GLOBAL CITIZEN: For the last 12 months, the team at Bridgewater headed by Nir and I have been meeting with many African 
 
 heads of state, including the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, the president of Ghana, Khufu Adu, president of Malawi, Chakwera, and so many 
 
 others.
 
And through all of these conversations, again and again, it's highlighted the urgent need for the public sector to invest more in the development of 
 
 the African continent to help catch up to the future dividend that's going to take place as you see a major growth in population that's going to occur 
 
 over the next 30 years on the continent.
 
And with that background, we decided to support the World Bank's IDA replenishment. And that's why today at President Ruto's Africa Heads of 
 
 State Summit here in Nairobi, Kenya, Global Citizen and Bridgewater Associates, in partnership with the government of Cote d'Ivoire and Harith 
 
 General Partners announced our economic summit.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
This is a two-day summit that we're going to be hosting on October 9th and 10th in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, bringing together heads of state, finance 
 
 ministers, leaders in civil society, all with one goal, calling on the G20 to increase their investment to support the World Bank's IDA fund by an 
 
 additional 25 percent which would account for more than $6 billion in new financing to help alleviate poverty across the continent.
 
KINKADE: It's certainly a huge goal, significant aim. To you, Nir, what can Bridgewater bring to this partnership? You're known for research. What can 
 
 you bring to ensure that every dollar is spent wisely both on a micro and macro level?
 
NIR BAR DEA, CEO, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: There's the announcement we made here today in Nairobi, but if you just take a step backwards, Bridgewater, 
 
 for almost 50 years, has been mapping out the cause effect linkages that underpin economies and markets. This includes short-term drivers, like 
 
 whether the Fed is going to tighten or not. But very, very importantly long-term drivers.
 
On the day to day, we use this advice -- give advice to our clients and to manage portfolios. But very, very importantly, we can also use that 
 
 understanding of what the future might look like or to help policymakers make great decisions. And one of the more important changes that is 
 
 happening in the world today is happening here in Africa. And it's going to be very consequential to what the world is going to look like over the next 
 
 50 years.
 
If I can just say two more things about that, just to make it manageable. Today, an eighth of the world's working age population lives in Sub-Saharan 
 
 Africa. That's a little under 700 million people. But Africa is going through a demographic boom. It's growing by about 30 percent each decade, 
 
 and that's happening at the same time, where population is basically declining in almost every other place in the world.
 
So, that means that in the coming future, three quarters of the population growth in the globe is going to come here from the continent, which will 
 
 result in a third of the population, the working age population being here in Africa in about 50 years in our lifetime. And that's a big deal. And 
 
 that means that Africa is going to have a huge, huge levered effect on the entire world. This could really activate a ton of untapped human potential, 
 
 like the ones that we've seen, by the way, in other regions over the last 50 years.
 
But if that doesn't happen, and there's no productivity boom, and we just continue on the current path, there's a real chance that this is going to 
 
 be destabilizing, not just for the continent, but the entire world. And just imagine, so many people on the continent, in the most critical age 
 
 bracket, in a region, by the way, that's most impacted by climate change.
 
We're in Nairobi right now. There's a climate disaster happening right now in Nairobi, but I'm talking about enough. There was one that was happening 
 
 in Malawi not long ago.
 
KINKADE: And a Hugh's point earlier, this is all part of fundraising for the World Bank's International Development Association. And I want to ask 
 
 you about this, Sellah, because you can speak firsthand to the impact off that group. Just explain what you've witnessed in your time.
 
SELLAH BOGONKO, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, JACOB'S LADDER AFRICA: Absolutely. Thank you, Lynda. I absolutely agree with Hugh and Nir, because what we are 
 
 facing is a huge opportunity on the one hand, but another huge challenge on the other hand.
 
As mentioned just now, the fact that we have a quarter of the population on the world in 2050 is going to be African. And then, by 2075, we're going to 
 
 have a third of the population that is working, working age and working class being from Africa. It means that we need to begin to make those 
 
 investments right now.
 
There's quite a bit of funding that is available, but it needs to be channeled in the right directions. And it's true that we need to -- we do 
 
 need to raise the ambition in terms of the amount of money that is being raised for the continent because we have a lot of opportunity to be able to 
 
 skill some of the workforce on the continent.
 
For example, in the renewable energy space in Africa, we have 50 percent of the world's renewable energy potential, but then you only have 2 percent of 
 
 the investment flowing into the continent, meaning that we need to raise a lot more money that would then flow into the continent to be able to 
 
 address the globe's demand when it comes to energy.
 
We have 60 percent of the world's arable land, and we have opportunity to create jobs around agriculture, tourism, energy and many others, even in 
 
 the digital space. But we do need to be a bit more strategic as leaders in Africa, even as we ramp up the - as donors and as we ramp up the investment 
 
 into the continent.
 
And we could not be working, you know, with more -- with better partners with the likes of Global Citizens and Bridgewaters who are raising their 
 
 awareness around the need, but more important, the potential and the demand and the requirements to be able to create more and better jobs for the 
 
 African news.
