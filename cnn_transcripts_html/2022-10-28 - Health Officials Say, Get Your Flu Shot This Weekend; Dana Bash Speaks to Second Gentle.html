FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The frontline between the Russians and Ukrainians.
 <br>[10:30:02]
 
They say that the Russians are only a couple of kilometers in that direction, and, obviously, there's a lot of shelling that goes on here almost all the time.
 
A destroyed tank turret right outside the Ukrainian position shows just how fierce the fighting is here, spent cartridges from cluster bombs and Russian flack vests also still lying around.
 
While some thought the Ukrainians might quickly oust the Russians and take back the key city of Kherson, in the trench, a feeling of stalemate.
 
ALEXANDER, UKRAINIAN ARMY:  There is shelling every day. In some places less and some more. We would shoot back but we have nothing to shoot with here.
 
PLEITGEN:  Inside of the main headquarters, the unit commander who goes by the call sign, Nikofor, shows me the gear they use to monitor the Russian's movements and communicate with their own units. He says they've observed the Russians strengthening defensive positions here.
 
NIKOFOR, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES:  They have dug in very well for the moment. But with our efforts, we are showing them that we are stronger and are slowly pushing them back from our territories.
 
PLEITGEN:  This territory was all Russian-controlled, but now Ukrainian troops are inching ever closer to Kherson. Having taken out most Russian supply routes across the massive Dnipro River, the Ukraine's president says Moscow forces need to get out of this region or risk being besieged.
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  They are not ready to go out of Kherson. But they know that it will be -- if we will have success, they will not have possibility to exit.
 
PLEITGEN:  Ukraine's military is pushing Russian troops back on several frontlines across the country. And as his army displaced clear signs of weakness, Russian President Vladimir Putin ripping into the U.S. and its allies during a speech in Moscow.
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT:  World domination is what so the so-called west bet its game on but that is game is, without doubt, a dangerous, bloody and I would say filthy one.
 
PLEITGEN:  But the Ukrainian troops in the trenches say they are resisting for their own country's sovereignty and hope to retake much of this key area in South Ukraine before winter sets in.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
PLEITGEN (on camera):  And, Erica, one of things that the soldiers there in the trenches have to deal with is obviously the temperatures dropping here in Ukraine right now, winter fast approaching. It is quite interesting also, because the Ukraine defense ministry said earlier today that they believe that the Russians have already brought newly mobilized people to the frontline there in the Kherson area. They say that right now they believe about a thousand newly mobilized Russians are down there. Erica?
 
HILL:  Fred Pleitgen with the latest for us there, Fred, thank you to you and your team.
 
Up next here, they're getting really stinking close. We're going to check in live with eight-year-old Sam Baker and his dad, Joe, as they near the summit of El Capitan in their historic climb. Can't wait to speak with these guys. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
HILL:  A warning from health officials about this flu season. The time is now. Get that flu shot. If you haven't done it, do it this weekend. You want to do it before November starts. Why? Well, the CDC is already seeing flu activity on the rise and it's happening about a month earlier than usual.
 
CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins me now. So, we often hear you should get it by October. This year, it is more important than ever.
 
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, because this year, the flu seems to be coming early. And after you get that shot, it takes about two weeks for antibodies to fully, really get into there. So, you want that shot to take effect and be ready to protect you against the flu.
 
And here is why and I'm sorry to put this in such stark numbers but this is really why you get the shot. The last time we had a real flu season a couple of years ago, flu killed 500 children. I will tell you, I have sat with those children and sat with those families who had children who died, cried with them. It is horrible. You do not want that to happen to your child. And adults, nearly 25,000 died that year.
 
So, let's talk about the power of flu vaccines and what they can do. So, if you look at the 2019-2020 flu season, flu shots prevented 6,300 deaths, more than 100,000 hospitalizations and more than 7.5 million illnesses. So, get your flu shot, flu by boo, this weekend, the perfect time.
 
HILL:  Flew by boo. I love that. And just remind people, there is always a lot of back and forth about just how effective the flu shot is. We know what the consequences are if you don't take it. I mean, you just walked us through some of them. This year's strain, this year's shot, what are we looking at?
 
COHEN:  Right. So, the flu that -- we don't quite know what this year's -- how effective this year's shot will be because we haven't had our flu season yet. Flu shots are generally sort of in the 40 percent to 60 percent effectiveness rate. I'll be honest, they are not the most effective vaccine out there, but, still, if you could reduce your risk of getting very sick from the flu by like even 50 percent, that is a lot. You could save your own life, you could save your child's life.
 
HILL:  I have to say, I was shocked. I've never had the flu. My husband had it in July a couple of years ago and it was miserable. And he had had a flu shot. So, yes, I am with you. From then, let me tell you, this family, we get our flu shots now.
 <br>[10:40:01]
 
Elizabeth, I appreciate it, thank you.
 
Just ahead here, a fascinating conversation between CNN's Dana Bash and the second gentleman, Douglas Emhoff, his take on the rising number of anti-Semitic incidents across the United States.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL:  I want to bring you up to speed on what we're learning about this breaking news involving a violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, at their San Francisco home early this morning.
 <br>[10:45:07]
 
We've just received a statement from the White House. The president is praying for Paul Pelosi and for the whole family. This morning, he called Speaker Pelosi to express support after this horrible attack. The statement notes he's also very glad a full recovery is expected and goes on to say the president continues to condemn all violence and ask that the family's desire for privacy be respected.
 
Well, as the fallout continues for Kanye West over his anti-Semitic comments, CNN has learned several people who were once close to him says he's long been fascinated by Adolf Hitler and even wanted to name an album after the Nazi leader. These new exclusive revelations come after West's anti-Semitic remarks have cost him a number of high- profile business deals. One business executive who worked for West told CNN the artist created a hostile work environment in part through his obsession with Hitler. That executive left his position and reached a settlement with West and some of his companies over workplace complaints, including harassment.
 
The Kanye West controversy shining a spotlight on the rise of anti- Semitism in this country and acts violence and harassment.
 
I want to bring in now Dana Bash, our chief political correspondent. So, Dana, as part of your incredible series, which I really love, you sat down with the nation's first second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, for this series being. And one of the things that I know you two spoke about are his experiences as a Jewish person in the business world. What did he tell you?
 
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first, we talked about the several firsts that he and more importantly his wife are presenting or making history with, by being in these roles. One of them is the fact that Doug Emhoff is the first Jewish person in any of sort of the four roles, president, vice president, first lady or now second gentleman. And they put a mezuzah on the door post of the naval observatory where they live. A mezuzah is something that traditionally Jews put there as a way to commemorate or remember God's commandments. And he said wanted to do that to make a point for a lot of reasons, one of which is that there is a rise in anti-Semitism in America and he wants to use his platform to speak out.
 
He did release a statement most recently about certainly the Kanye West controversy, saying that hate has no -- and anti-Semitism has no place in America. So, that is one of many things, Erica, he and I spoke about as we walked around the naval observatory. One was the fact that he has older kids. And he did something that I actually didn't even know about. He got some tattoos that relate to them. So, watch that part of this discussion.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH:  Show me your tattoos.
 
DOUG EMHOFF, U.S. SECOND GENTLEMAN:  I'll show you one. This one is very simple.
 
BASH:  Well, that is two.
 
EMHOFF:  Okay. So, I'll show you two.
 
BASH:  Okay.
 
EMHOFF:  It the kids' initials. And got this shortly after Kirsten and I separated because I just really wanted a reminder of why -- what is important to me.
 
BASH:  Were you --
 
EMHOFF:  And it was called Anelah (ph). And I just wanted was a visceral reminder of them. So Cole is Cole train and Ella is Ella Fitzgerald, very legend to jazz.
 
BASH:  Were you always a tattoo guy?
 
EMHOFF:  No.
 
BASH:  So, what made you wake up one day and say I'm going to get my kid's official on my wrist?
 
EMHOFF:  Like many people who got tattoos, it was a whim.
 
BASH:  Were you sober?
 
EMHOF:  Ish. And I just decided on the spur of the moment. This is something I want to do. I just wanted to make sure that I was focused on the most important thing in my life, which is the children, and they still are.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH:  So, Erica, the point of this series is to kind of get beyond the headlines, get beyond sound bites that we see and hear from public figures, and we certainly were able to do that with him. And I was fascinated to learn just what it is like to blaze a trail as being the first man in this role and the things that he says, Erica, about the need for men to step up and not just say they support women but actually support women, the women in their lives, kind of check your ego at the door. It is going to be fascinating, I think, for men and women to see when this airs on Saturday night.
 
HILL:  Absolutely. As we know so well, actions really do speak louder than words. I'm so excited to see this. It is such a great series and really fascinated to see what it is like to be the first second gentleman. Dana, I appreciate it, thank you.
 
And just a reminder, you can watch Being the Second Gentleman tomorrow night at 8:00 P.M. Eastern right here on CNN.
 
Just ahead, we're going to check in live with eight-year-old Sam Adventure Baker and his dad, Joe. They're nearing the summit of El Capitan in their historic climb.
 <br>[10:50:01]
 
Stay right here.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL:  History in the making right now. Eight-year-old Sam Adventure Baker, that is his real name, is about to become the youngest person to reach the summit of El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park. He is there with his dad, Joe.
 
Sam's journey up the granite face kicked off on Tuesday. They've been -- look at that face -- they've been spending the night suspended on the side of the park's iconic rock formation as they make their way up. Sam Baker and his dad, Joe, are joining me now on phone to talk about all of this, because sometimes even when we try with technology, when you're on the face of El Capitan, it is hard to get the video to work. So, Joe and Sam, you've been rolling with the technical punches this morning. Great to have you.
 
Sam, you are getting so close. You're dad told me you're through the hardest part. How are you feeling?
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
SAM BAKER, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD TRYING TO BECOME YOUNGEST PERSON TO CLIMB EL CAPITAN (voice over):  Feeling good.
 
HILL:  Yes.
 
JOE BAKER, CLIMBING EL CAPITAN WITH EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON SAM (voice over) :  And a little exhausted too, right? He just woke up.
 
HILL:  I would say it is understandable you're a little exhausted. I was shocked. I read this. So, your eight, Sam. You have an amazing name because your middle name is Adventure. You've been training for a year-and-a-half?
 
S. BAKER (voice over):  Yes.
 
HILL:  Wow. And so when you started climbing after all of that training, has this met your expectations so far, Sam?
 
S. BAKER (voice over):  Yes.
 
HILL:  Yes? I was reading that you said you were excited about the climb. But one of the things you were most excited about was actually climbing with your dad.
 
S. BAKER (voice over):  Yes.
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  Say that that was a good time.
 
S. BAKER (voice over):  That was a good time.
 
HILL:  Joe, what's it been like?
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  He's having fun.
 
HILL:  He's having fun, you guys are hanging on the side of the rock there, eating lasagna, as I understand it, watching The Lion King. It just sounds like a normal week.
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  Literally we're suspended in a giant cot right on the side of the wall and the sun is just about to hit us on the wall. And it feels like we're like above eternity up here. Like I look over the edge and it is forever down. And, yet we still have got a lot to go. And it's been just a terrific adventure all around. We had one night where we got kind of caught behind another party that got a bag stuck and ended having to climb until past 1:00 A.M. And I couldn't believe it. Sam, I expected him to cry a couple of times on this trip because it is hard and emotional but he has been so tough and worked through all of it. And so --yes.
 
So, Sam, by the way, were you scared up there at all?
 
S. BAKER (voice over):  Nope. I was --
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  You were scared. You were scared. It is okay if you're scared.
 
HILL:  I mean, I get scared looking at some of your pictures. They're incredible and I can't imagine what it is like to wake up. You paint this beautiful picture of the sun waking you up and you have this gorgeous vista. But even some of your videos, the camera points down and I have to cover my eyes.
 
So, Sam, I am super impressed here. What is it -- I mean, has this sunk in, to have that title, the youngest person ever, once you make it to the top, to climb el Capitan. Does that mean something to you?
 
S. BAKER (voice over):  I don't know.
 
HILL:  Hey, lady, I'm eight years old, I just want to get up.
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  What's interesting, he doesn't really care about that. Like when me and Anne talked about this project a couple of years ago, we just said, let's take him when he's ready. And he's definitely ready.
 
HILL:  How did you know, Joe? I mean, you're a climber. Your wife is -- I was reading he was in a harness before he could walk. But how did you know that you your son, even back when he was six, was ready to start training for this climb?
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  I thought he wasn't ready until nine or ten originally. But he -- he just showed us that. I mean, we took him up this mountain called Moonlight Buttress about six or seven months ago, which is also on a giant wall in Zion National Park, and he did terrific on it and really showed us that he could handle the exposure. And so these are rope assents, so they're not -- it is just -- it is tedious and challenging but it is like it is not as technical in a sense for him. And so, he's got -- he has to have the will to keep going and he has that.
 
HILL:  And when do you guys expect to reach the top there?
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  I'm hoping to reach the top at 5:00 P.M., hoping to make it by sunset tonight. And his mom is going to be up there. And we also are about to hang a huge banner.
 
S. BAKER (voice over):  It goes, I love you mom.
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  I love you, mom. And it is almost there. It's a huge banner. It's going to hang off our portal ledge in just a minute and she's going to get to the valley in a minute or so and see us up here. HILL:  Well, that is pretty great. I'm excited for you guys. I have loved following your adventure. And we're looking forward to the post when we see that banner and you guys are up there at the summit. Joe and Sam, thanks so much for joining us.
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  Hey, one thing.
 
HILL:  Yes.
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  Make sure to tell everybody our Instagram is Samuel Adventure and our Facebook is Sam adventure and you could follow all of the fun on there.
 
HILL:  It is great. We will follow. And I should point out, your other kids are named Sylvan Lightyear and Joey Danger. So, I'd like to apologize for my children because I totally failed them in the name department. But you've got your hands full, my friend. Great to talk to you both. Thank you.
 
J. BAKER (voice over):  All right. See you.
 
HILL:  All right. If you haven't bought your ticket yet, the good news is there is still time. Saturday's Powerball jackpot, you can't win if you don't play, people, second largest now in history. It is up to a cool $800 million.
 <br>[11:00:00]
 
There have been 36 drawings in a row with no grand prize winner. Why shouldn't it be you?
 
The biggest Powerball jackpot of all times, of course, was over $1.5 billion.</pre>
