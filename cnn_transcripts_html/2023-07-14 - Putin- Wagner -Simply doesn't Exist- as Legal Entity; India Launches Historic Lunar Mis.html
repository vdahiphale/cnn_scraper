ZAIN ASHER, CNN HOST, FIRST MOVE: Well welcome to "First Move", I'm Zain Asher and for Julia Chatterley just ahead on today's show picket power, 
 
 Hollywood actors aren't officially on strike after contract negotiations with major studios break down actors joining screenwriters on the picket 
 
 line effectively shutting down most of U.S. film and TV production.
 
The latest on the Hollywood Walk of blame, just ahead plus, the heat is on Europe bracing for record temperatures of well over 30 degrees 
 
 Celsius as the summer swelter intensifies we are live in Rome with the very latest and bank Bonanza U.S. financial giants JP Morgan, Wells 
 
 Fargo and Citigroup are out with second quarter results.
 
As U.S. earnings season gets underway all three firms beating expectations on both the top and the bottom lines as well. Their shares 
 
 are all higher premarket trading Wells Fargo and in fact leading the pack set to rise by over 3 percent strong bank earnings help give a 
 
 boost to the blue chips in early trading the Dow is set to rise by Morgan than half a percent.
 
When the bell opens in 30 minutes from now all the major averages coming off their fourth straight day of gains Europe mostly higher now to more 
 
 on the markets later on in the program. But first no legal basis, Vladimir Putin saying that the Wagner group Wagner mercenary group 
 
 simply does not exist as a legal entity.
 
The Russian President says he also offered the Wagner fighters options for their future service. Alex Marquardt joins us live now. So Alex, 
 
 what exactly did Putin mean by that? And what has happened to Wagner fighters since the failed uprising? Are they in Belarus? Are they still 
 
 on the battlefield in Ukraine? Where exactly are the majority of them right now?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: They are we understand, and this is, according to the Pentagon just yesterday, Zain 
 
 that they are still in Russian occupied Ukraine. But according to the Pentagon, they are not operational.
 
They are not fighting. So it's a very good question of what they're going to do next. In terms of what Putin has now said about Wagner, it 
 
 appears that he's being rather coy. He's playing with some legalese.
 
But what I think is clear is that Wagner, as we've known it, since the war started here in Ukraine, does no longer exist, that they're not 
 
 going to be fighting in Ukraine anymore. What shape the organization takes beyond Ukraine, say in the Middle East and Africa where they have 
 
 significant operations that remains to be seen.
 
Of course, the fate of Yevgeny Prigozhin, of course, still very much in the balance one thing that Putin is saying here is that Russia does not 
 
 have a law that allows mercenary groups to operate, they are illegal.
 
But Wagner is technically a private military company. Here's a bit more of what Putin said in this interview with Kommersant newspaper, he says, 
 
 we do not have a law for private military organizations that simply does not exist. There is no such legal entity and he goes on to admit that it 
 
 is not an easy question.
 
Zain, this interview that he gave was fascinating. And he really got into the details of that meeting on June 29. With members, the most 
 
 senior members of Wagner right after they carried out this insurrection and marched towards Moscow.
 
Putin said that some 35 Wagner commanders gathered together in the Kremlin. And during that meeting, Putin said you can continue fighting 
 
 and you can continue fighting under your direct commander whose -- which means gray hair. And apparently according to Putin, the men nodded in 
 
 affirmation.
 
And then Prigozhin, Yevgeny Prigozhin a Head of Wagner, who was sitting in the front row, apparently told Putin No, the guys do not agree with 
 
 this decision. So how that meeting ended? We do not know.
 
But it does appear that Putin is trying to divide production from his forces perhaps try to weaken production while still maintain the 
 
 benefits of the Wagner guys who are still a considerable fighting force, Zain.
 
ASHER: Alex, let's just talk about what happened overnight in Ukraine. Ukrainian Air Defense Forces basically saying that they shut down about 
 
 20 Iranian made drones aimed at Kyiv overnight. What more can you tell us?
 
MARQUARDT: Well, the vast majority of them are taken down. This is the latest in a wave almost nightly attacks that we have seen from the 
 
 Russians, Zain, primarily with drones, they have been flown over the past few days up from southern Russia.
 
The majority of which have been taken down by Ukraine's air defenses, often resulting in damaged buildings when the debris falls. So this is 
 
 part of the continuation of the really that, what Ukrainians consider to be a terror campaign Russia has not been able to make any kind of or any 
 
 significant battlefield advances.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
As I but they are very much on the defensive, and they are able to maintain those defenses quite easily or rather, they have been able to 
 
 maintain those defenses even that despite the fact that Russia or that Ukraine rather is really throwing as much as they can at them in this 
 
 counter offensive to try to claw back as much territory as they can, Zain.
 
ASHER: Alex Marquardt there thanks you so much. A mission to the moon India launching a historic lunar mission are hoping to become the first 
 
 country a spacecraft on the moon South Pole is successful, it will also become only the fourth country to execute a controlled landing on the 
 
 moon Kristie Lu Stout has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): India's literally shooting for the moon with a historic mission that could cement its 
 
 position as a space power the Chandrayaan-3 which means moon vehicle and Sanskrit launch Friday afternoon.
 
As name suggests, this is India's third lunar mission and its part of the country's greater bid to be a space power. During the last mission 
 
 in 2019, the rover crashed after a hard landing. With this mission, they're aiming to land the rover near the moon's unexplored South Pole.
 
Officials say the Lander is due to reach the moon on August the 23rd. After the landing, scientists plan to deploy the rover and to conduct 
 
 scientific experiments including analyzing the chemistry of the Lunar soil, measuring the temperature of the Lunar surface and scanning for 
 
 moon quakes.
 
On launch day, India's Prime Minister tweeted this quote 14th of July 2023 will always be etched in golden letters as far as India's space 
 
 sector is concerned Chandrayaan-3, our third Lunar mission will embark on its journey. This remarkable mission will carry the hopes and dreams 
 
 of our nation.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
STOUT (on camera): Success would be huge for India. So far, only three countries have successfully soft landed a craft on the moon, the U.S. 
 
 the Former Soviet Union, and China. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.
 
ASHER: Hollywood halted actors are walking off the job joining writers on picket lines, it's the first actors strike in 43 years their union 
 
 SAG-AFTRA represents about 160,000 performers the walkout means new movies and TV shows are likely to be delayed, even more than they 
 
 already are actually joined due to the writer's strike.
 
That's in theaters on big networks and on streaming services. Chloe Melas joins us live now co it also means that actors can't really 
 
 promote films that are already in the can. They can't do interviews, they can't go to the red carpet, they can't attend premieres, just walk 
 
 us through how Hollywood is going to be paralyzed by this?
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: I mean, look, you saw it last night, Zain on the red carpet for Oppenheimer and the cast walked off 
 
 and they were making their signs for the picket lines.
 
Which are going to be starting today we're going to see them in front of the studios in Los Angeles, New York, some famous faces. But this 
 
 affects hundreds of thousands of people. You've already seen the writers on strike for two months. But I have a little bit more here to break 
 
 this all down for you.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELAS (voice over): The actors of Hollywood are on strike.
 
FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT OF SAG-AFTRA: This is a moment of history. That is a moment of truth.
 
MELAS (voice over): Disrupting the industry in the midst of its critical summer movie season. The actors of the forthcoming movie Oppenheimer 
 
 walking out of their premiere Thursday.
 
FLORENCE PUGH, ACTOR: It's been a really, really tense few days for a lot of people, not just actors, but everybody in the industry who are 
 
 going to be affected by the decision but affected by a decision that is necessary.
 
KENNETH BRANAGH, ACTOR: We know it's a critical time at this point, the industry and the issues that are involved need to be addressed that 
 
 difficult conversation. Everybody's trying to get a fair deal. That's what so we'll support that.
 
MELAS (voice over): And the actors from the highly anticipated Barbie movie are voicing their support for their union amidst our global 
 
 promotional tour.
 
MARGOT ROBBIE, ACTOR: Yes, absolutely, no I very much in support of all the unions and another part of SAG so I would absolutely stand by that 
 
 strike.
 
RYAN GOSLING, ACTOR: I was sport the actors.
 
GRETA GERWIG, BARBIE DIRECTOR: Love the unions, they've always protected all of the artists I know and I really want them to stand strong and win 
 
 their fight.
 
MELAS (voice over): The union has sped up over compensation in the streaming era enough to walk the line.
 
DRESCHER: We are being victimized by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating 
 
 us.
 
MELAS (voice over): The strike crippling a TV and movie business, already limping during the Writers Guild of America strike, SAG-AFTRA 
 
 reps around on 160,000 Entertainment professionals of all kinds.
 
Along with better pay actors see residuals for past work have dried up in the streaming era. Add to that artificial intelligence actor say AI 
 
 threatens their future, the guild claiming that studios want to use AI to replace background actors.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND, NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SAG-AFTRA: They proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, 
 
 get paid for one day's pay, and their company should own that scan their image, their likeness, and to be able to use it for the rest of eternity 
 
 in any project they want. With no consent, and no compensation
 
MELAS (voice over): Studios say they've offered the highest percent increase in minimum pay in 35 years, and that the actors aren't seeing 
 
 reality.
 
BOB IGER, DISNEY CEO: This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption.
 
MELAS (voice over): Disney CEO Bob Iger notes, the decline in revenue from traditional platforms, and the industry wide struggle to make 
 
 streaming a viable alternative.
 
IGER: There's a level of expectation that they have that is just not realistic. And they are adding to a set of challenges that this business 
 
 is already facing. That is quite frankly, very disruptive.
 
DRESCHER: How they plead poverty, that they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is 
 
 disgusting.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELAS (on camera): OK, so this is what we are hearing Zain, we are hearing on one hand from people like Bob Iger and these studio heads who 
 
 are saying, we're not making as much money as you think that we are streaming has hit, but it kind of hasn't.
 
And we're still trying to figure this entire out. Obviously, AI is a cheaper alternative. But both writers and actors are worried that AI 
 
 could take their jobs. And then you heard about this whole scanning extras, you know, so that they could use the likeness in perpetuity.
 
I keep pointing out, you know, shows like "Game of Thrones" or those movies. Remember, you know, Brave heart were these fighting scenes where 
 
 you have thousands of actors in the background.
 
Well, obviously, you know, those were CGI and computer generated, they're talking about scanning someone's face for a day paying them one 
 
 day's pay, and then never having to pay them again.
 
Now, you heard the alliance of motion pictures and television come out and say that this is unprecedented in terms of how they've raised the 
 
 minimum wage, minimum pay, but then they're also saying that the union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for 
 
 countless of thousands of people who depend on the industry.
 
It's not just the actors, Zain, as you know its hair and makeup, it's the crews, and it's the catering services. It's the security it's 
 
 everyone who's out of a job, because writers and actors are on strike. So this has ramifications that go far beyond just the famous faces that 
 
 we all know and love.
 
And also consumers we're going to see this affect all of us come mid fall if there isn't some sort of middle ground or resolution because how 
 
 are they going to continue to make shows, you know, there are non-union actors.
 
But if you are, you know, those are independent films, and those projects are few and far between. So it's going to be really hard to see 
 
 how they're going to be able to make content wrap up these films and promote these film and television projects. What is the landscape even 
 
 look like in the spring, Zain?
 
ASHER: It's interesting because a lot of what the actors want seems perfectly reasonable and fair on paper. But as you point out, the 
 
 studios are in a tough situation because there isn't as much money to go around as they used to be so we'll see what happens. Chloe Melas for us 
 
 there! Thank you.
 
The record of breaking summer heat wave gripping much of the Northern Hemisphere shows no sign of letting up record temperatures are some 54 
 
 degrees Celsius that's 130 degrees Fahrenheit for the Americans out there are expected in parts of the western United States.
 
This weekend, about hundred million people remain under heat alerts. Their temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona have topped 43 degrees Celsius 
 
 for five days straight dangerous weather conditions in southern Europe too, with tourists in many parts of the continent urge to follow the 
 
 most important advice in any foreign language.
 
Stay hydrated, drink up it is hot out there. Barbie Nadeau is in Rome, braving the elements it's interesting because the Italian meteorological 
 
 societies said basically listen the Earth has a high fever and it leaves feeling it firsthand just how brutal is it? How brutal is it Barbie? How 
 
 hot is it? I love Rome by the way but how hard is it right now where you are.
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN REPORTER: It is so hot. And you know one of the big problems here is it there's not a lot of air conditioning only about 10 
 
 percent of homes in Europe have air conditioning.
 
It doesn't cool off at night the humidity we're under shade, but it doesn't matter because the humidity is so strong. But we took a closer 
 
 look at what the city of Rome is doing for the tourists. Let's take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADEAU (voice over): Rome, the Eternal City lately is more like the infernal city a deadly heat wave gripping Southern Europe has made those 
 
 trying to enjoy a Roman holiday rather uncomfortable.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
CATHERINE HODGDON, TOURIST (ph): I mean, it's hot, but yes, it is a little disappointing. I was thinking today like, because we're planning 
 
 not be out when it's the hottest, like we're missing some hours to be able to do stuff but, but ultimately, to be able to enjoy it the most 
 
 we're going to have to cut out those hot hours of the day.
 
NADEAU (voice over): Temperatures are climbing and expect you to top 40 degrees Celsius 104 degrees Fahrenheit in Rome. Italians have named the 
 
 heat wave Cerberus after a figure in Greek mythology that guarded the gates of hell.
 
Officials say the best way to combat the heat is with water. And Rome has no shortage of that. Rome has more than 4000 public water fountains 
 
 with drinkable water. And Rome's civil protection agency has an app that will help visitors locate the closest one.
 
The command center head -- tells us that common sense is, key. And staying hydrated is essential. So is using water to cool off he says. 
 
 But tempting as it may be to swim in a fountain. Doing so runs the risk of a several $100 Fine.
 
SARAH, TOURIST: Oh, we can't stay out all day. That's for sure. Yes.
 
ANDY SMITH, TOURIST: I think we just have to take a lot of breaks and not try and over plan.
 
NADEAU (voice over): The heat wave is supposed to last at least through next week. And for most tourists, canceling is not an option. Which 
 
 means another week of hell not fit for man or beast?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADEAU: And you know, Zain is just hot and the idea that is just going to get hotter and it's going to last longer is really, really difficult. 
 
 And you know, we're standing here in front of the Roman Colosseum, there are hundreds, if not thousands of people under this blazing sun right 
 
 now not even in the shade waiting to get in waiting to go on tours.
 
These are vacations planned months ago of course they can't cancel them or change them. So we thought if people come to Rome, try to see it on a 
 
 day or two. Those people are really suffering and you know they're staying hydrated. That's about all we can do right now, Zain.
 
ASHER: Yes, the thing is, if you go to Rome, you can't just stay indoors. You know, Rome is basically an outdoor museum. You have to get 
 
 out and go to the Colosseum. You can't go to Rome and not go into the Colosseum as he mentioned, these vacations have been planned months in 
 
 advance.
 
They can't cancel Barbie Nadeau, live for us there. Thank you so much. Alright, so straight ahead, the U.S. and China meeting once again to try 
 
 to Thor a frosty relationship, we'll discuss the latest contacts with political scientists in Bremen often.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
ASHER: Welcome back to "First Move", higher level talks are taking place between the U.S. and Beijing this time in Indonesia. China's top 
 
 diplomat says Washington needs to take real action to put relations back on the right track. Wang Yi and U.N. Secretary State Antony Blinken met 
 
 on the sidelines of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers summit Thursday.
 
The meeting less than a month off the two men in Beijing is the latest effort to ease tensions between the two superpowers. An official from 
 
 the U.S. State Department said the talks were candid and that they weren't constructive. Marc Stewart has more.
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's Wang Yi is part of this piecemeal 
 
 effort to try to cool things down and improve the relations between the two nations. This 90 minute meeting happened on the sidelines of the 
 
 ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia.
 
We've been hearing from a Senior State Department Official who said this was intended to be a follow up to previous conversations in Beijing. 
 
 We're told the two were able to pick up where things left off and then take the conversations to the next level of detail adding the 
 
 conversation was a bit more focused on action and concrete next steps.
 
Secretary Blinken talked about the need for peace in the Taiwan Strait. According to Chinese government readout Wang told Blinken the next step 
 
 for China and the U.S. would be to take real actions to put the relationship back on track. The two men also discussed the global flow 
 
 of synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, human rights and recent email hacks. Marc Stewart, CNN, Tokyo.
 
ASHER: It has certainly been a major week for global diplomacy from the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania to ASEAN, as Marc Stewart was just 
 
 talking about in Indonesia. A key topic discuss that both is of course, Russia's war in Ukraine. Joining me live now is Ian Bremmer.
 
He's the President and Founder of the Eurasia Group and GZERO Media. He's also the author of The Power of Crisis, how three threats and our 
 
 response will change the world. Ian, thank you so much for being with us. Let's start with this meeting between Antony Blinken and Wang Yi.
 
Just obviously comes out a month, roughly around a month after Blinken traveled to Beijing, the relationship between the two superpowers at 
 
 that pretty much one of the lowest points in history right now. Is this meeting, perhaps possibly a precursor to Biden, eventually meeting Xi 
 
 Jinping later on this year?
 
And what do you expect just in terms of any kind of breakthroughs, at least in the short term?
 
IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER OF EURASIA GROUP &amp; GZERO MEDIA: It is, Julia, I expect that Xi Jinping and Biden will be meeting in San 
 
 Francisco on the sidelines of the APEC summit this fall. And certainly, the more face time those two leaders have directly with one another with 
 
 a lot of personal history and a reasonable amount of mutual respect.
 
The more stable it is overall in the relationship, but the direction of travel continues to be negative, despite the flurry of high level 
 
 meetings between the U.S. and China over the last month and a half. There has been no resumption of direct military to military talks, this 
 
 despite all sorts of tensions and confrontations, over the South China Sea, over Taiwan, over China's military buildup.
 
There continues to be America focused on export controls. And now investment outbound investment reviews that are going to as the 
 
 Americans say de risk the relationship. The reality is the Chinese see that as containment in, their own economic development. So there's no 
 
 trust in the relationship between the two largest economies in the world, and the political atmospherics have been deteriorating.
 
ASHER: And Wang also met with Sergey Lavrov. I mean, just explain to us and ever since that sort of failed mutiny, that failed, sort of, I 
 
 guess, mini coup attempt rebellion in Russia. What has been China's what has been China's perspective on Russia's war in Ukraine?
 
BREMMER: Well, China continues to be a strong friend of Russia on the global stage, but they are not providing any military support to the 
 
 Russians. And that was true even when Putin faced an existential threat with thousands of revolting of rebelling troops on their way to Moscow.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
China had nothing to say until it was resolved and that's a pretty big deal right? I mean, Russia really didn't have any friends on the global 
 
 stage Belarus, Iran, that's about it. Even Turkey recently, you saw with the summit in Vilnius, the Turks have been tilting much more strongly 
 
 towards the United States, towards Sweden, towards Ukraine than they are with their on again, off again, friends, the Russians.
 
So Putin is feeling I think, increasingly isolated on the global stage. And that includes with the Chinese. And the Chinese are very happy to 
 
 buy all sorts of goods from Russia at a relatively lower cost. But this is a very deeply asymmetric relationship. And the Russians are 
 
 increasingly supplicants to Beijing, not a position that Putin wants to be it.
 
ASHER: Alright, speaking on the summit in Vilnius that we just had. It seems that Zelenskyy now completely accepts the fact that it is 
 
 virtually impossible for Ukraine to become a member of NATO, as long as this war is going on. What are the right conditions for Ukraine to be 
 
 able to join NATO in a post war environment and should some kind of timeline have been laid out for Zelenskyy?
 
BREMMER: He wanted a timeline desperately. And there were a lot of NATO members that were prepared to give it to him, the Polish government, the 
 
 Baltic governments, the French government, Emmanuel Macron flipped on this over the last couple of months, and were also saying we should give 
 
 a timeline.
 
It wasn't going to happen. Biden tried to telegraph that through the East European allies. They didn't get that message Biden then over the 
 
 weekend, before Vilnius gave an interview on CNN with Fareed Zakaria; he made it very clear this wasn't going to happen. They still didn't get 
 
 the message.
 
Zelenskyy shows up at Ukraine, I mean, in Vilnius, and the Ukrainian President publicly says, this is absurd. I mean, he's outraged that he's 
 
 not getting a direct timeline for NATO membership that really wasn't a constructive position for Zelenskyy to take. I mean, of course, he's got 
 
 domestic politics at home, he's under massive pressure.
 
Heck, he's being targeted every day for assassination by the Russians, like it's hard for you and i Julia, to put ourselves in his shoes. But 
 
 still, it was very clear that he wasn't going to get a timeline. And I think there are two reasons for that going forth. The first is that any 
 
 timeline gets undermined if Trump becomes the nominee for the GOP.
 
And that Biden's not going to be able to actually follow through on it. Second, is that many NATO allies, including the Americans and the 
 
 Germans, the U.K., as well think that, you know, giving the Ukrainians NATO today, as opposed to waiting when we are ready for a ceasefire and 
 
 negotiations.
 
And then basically saying, you know, this is a -- to be given in return for starting negotiations, when the Ukrainians haven't taken all of the 
 
 land, remember, Zelenskyy's position is still every inch of that territory has to be taken back, that's nobody thinks that's actually 
 
 going to happen, at least not militarily.
 
So I think some of this is political weakness in the U.S. electoral cycle. And some of this is a recognition that there's going to have to 
 
 be some horse trading, as the war grinds on.
 
ASHER: And one of the sorts of bigger fears that Zelenskyy has is that listen, if we are not a member of NATO, and no clear timeline is 
 
 actually laid out, and Vladimir Putin is going to use that as a precondition for ending the war, he's going to use that as a negotiation 
 
 tactic.
 
He's basically going to say, listen, you know, we will end the war, as long as you do not become a member of NATO, within the next, I don't 
 
 know, 15, 20 years. I mean, is that something that you see happening? Do you see Vladimir Putin using that as some kind of precursor or 
 
 precondition to ending the war?
 
BREMMER: Well, Putin is not in a great position right now. I mean, he has already lost many of the war goals that he had attempted to achieve 
 
 when he invaded a year and a half ago, having said that, Julia, if Trump is the next President, Putin doesn't need to use that as a negotiating 
 
 tactic.
 
Trump will make very clear that it's not going to happen. And I don't know what the likelihood that Trump is going to be the next President 
 
 does but it's not 5 percent, Is it 20, is it 25, is it 30? I mean, it's a meaningful possibility. And if you're Putin, that's absolutely what 
 
 you're hoping for right now.
 
So I mean, again, Biden can say as long as it takes the Americans are there, the United States is the dominant military power on the global 
 
 stage. And if the Americans are suddenly led by someone that has a completely different perspective on what the Ukrainians should and 
 
 should not get.
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
The outcome for Putin and for everybody else is also going to be very different. So there's a lot of uncertainty that actually rests here on 
 
 the U.S. electoral cycle.
 
ASHER: Alright, Ian Bremmer live for us there, thank you so much. Right still to come here after the break and keeping an eye on crime. -- Anna 
 
 Stewart comes face to face with AI technology to tackle shoplifting of all things, that's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: Welcome back to "First Move", U.S. stocks are up and running for the last trading session of the week. The major averages are suddenly 
 
 higher in early trading with earnings from the banking sector helping boost sentiment. Chase of JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are all in the green 
 
 after across the board.
 
Earnings beat a bit of weakness for shares of Citigroup. You see that red arrow there at the top of your screen DOW component United Health 
 
 Group is on the rise as well. Its earnings came in better than expected. It's also raising its profit forecast for the rest of the year.
 
Three developments to bring you in the world of artificial intelligence China will become one of the first countries to regulate the technology 
 
 that powers popular services like for example ChatGPT. The country's internet watchdog has drawn up a list of rules and a key provision is 
 
 that AI providers conduct security reviews and register their algorithms with the government.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
Here meanwhile, the U.S. government investigating the maker of ChatGPT. The Federal Trade Commission examining open AI is handling of personal 
 
 data as well as the tools potential for giving users inaccurate information. And Indian tech giant has announced a billion dollar 
 
 investment in AI.
 
Wipro, which provides software services, says its entire staff of 250,000 people will get training on how to use artificial intelligence 
 
 responsibly. Meantime, AI is now being used by some British retailers to track suspected shoplifters rather. Anna Stewart has been caught red 
 
 handed.
 
You tried out the technology yourself. So, Anna, just walk us through the complications with this. Are there concerns though more seriously 
 
 about privacy?
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: They really are. I mean, AI is a useful tool in a number of sectors, particularly though with facial recognition, it 
 
 is faster, it is cheaper than humans. And depending on the algorithm, and this is a big talker at the moment, it can be a lot less biased as 
 
 well.
 
So it's probably a little surprise that shops here in the U.K. are now harnessing AI so they can help recognize potential shoplifters, although 
 
 they suspect of shoplifting. But as you say, this raises big questions. What if there is a mistake and what about your biometrics?
 
What if they're shared not just at the shop where you're supposedly caught? But what if your biometrics is actually shared between networks 
 
 of other shops in the area and all of this without your knowledge and without any kind of judicial process? So I gave it a go, have a look.

ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice over): Got that feeling you're being watched? You probably are. And it's not just CCTV, AI could be watching 
 
 too.
 
STEWART (on camera): So your camera should have picked me up as I walk through the front door.
 
SIMON GORDON, FOUNDER OF FACEWATCH: Yes.
 
STEWART (on camera): So if you were the security guard, and you discovered that I'd stolen something, you would go to this and find me.
 
GORDON: Yes, I agree. I'd scroll down and look at the system and I'd know what time you've walked in. So I'd be able to find your face and in 
 
 fact, here's your face.
 
STEWART (on camera): --
 
GORDON: -- ran out.
 
STEWART (voice over): I'm a suspect a case of mistaken identity I assure you. But here's what happens next, a suspects biometrics a store by face 
 
 watch for a year. If they returned to the shop, their presence will be alerted to staff. And for prolific thieves, all those suspected of 
 
 taking a high value item, the biometrics could be shared with other stores in the area, all legal under British law.
 
GORDON: I was reporting all these crimes to the police, trying to help the police giving them CCTV and nothing ever happened.
 
STEWART (voice over): This didn't start in a store, better wine bar. London's oldest wine bar in fact runs by Facewatch Founder, Simon 
 
 Gordon.
 
GORDON: Our goal is to be the trusted and we are the trusted name in facial recognition in crime prevention. We're just here to prevent 
 
 crime. We --
 
STEWART (on camera): -- have the police -- . Are you filling a gap that shouldn't be filled by private businesses?
 
GORDON: Everybody should be taking security seriously.
 
STEWART (voice over): Gordon says there are no bias and the AI algorithms and the company also uses human super facial recognizers but 
 
 mistakes happen. Accuracy was 99.85 percent in June, according to Facewatch.
 
MADELEINE STONE, SENIOR ADVOCACY OFFICER OF BIG BROTHER WATCH: If you're put on a watch list, your information is held for up to a year because 
 
 there's no real due process. This is all done by private company is no police involvement. There's no direct evidence that anyone's actually 
 
 committed a crime.
 
So you could very easily be wrongly placed on watch list and have your life really changed because some AI powered technology has flagged you 
 
 as a criminal which you aren't.
 
STEWART (voice over): For shoppers leaving a store with Facewatch tech, there's a mix of opinions.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't want my face to be recognized. I'm just doing my shopping.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, it's uncomfortable, but I mean I understand why they're doing it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think in this day and age like even our phone, facial recognition are like biometrics and everything, it's all around 
 
 us. So I don't think there's any escaping it.
 
STEWART (voice over): Back at the supermarket, it's time to see how quickly alarm bells will ring. Now I've been flagged.
 
STEWART (on camera): That was quick I didn't even make it on the first dial.
 
GORDON: That's a match it's 99 percent similarity, you would trigger an alert in a store down the road if you'd carried out more than one crime 
 
 here or if it was over a certain value.
 
STEWART (on camera): Well, thanks for showing me how it works. Can I ask that you delete my profile?
 
GORDON: Absolutely.
 
STEWART (on camera): Not really.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEWART: -- deleted.
 
ASHER: -- deleted --
 
STEWART: I should -- shop and see.
 
ASHER: Anna Stewart live for us there, thank you so much. Appreciate it.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
Alright, so to come here on "First Move", after the break, lifting the lid on lab grown meat helping the planet and addressing ethical issues, 
 
 is there any downside to Upside Foods, that next?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: All right, it is chicken. Technically but not as we know it, you're looking at food that actually came from cells from a chicken 
 
 rather than the chicken itself. Now the U.S. has given it to firms to green light or permission to start producing lab grown chicken products.
 
They're called Upside Foods and good meat their cells are grown with the help of nutrients like amino acids in massive bio reactors. As you can 
 
 see, it kind of looks, like a brewery. And Upside Foods chicken is already on one restaurant menu in San Francisco. Uma Valeti is the CEO 
 
 joins us live there.
 
Uma, thank you so much for being with us, sir, from how I understand it, this is derived from live animal stem cells that then multiplied and 
 
 eventually become muscle fat and connective tissue. Just explain to our audience, the sort of process by which this kind of chicken is produced?
 
UMA VALETI, CEO OF UPSIDE FOODS: Zain, thanks for having me, delighted to be here. So upside foods is cultivating chicken directly from live 
 
 chicken cells. And when I say live chicken cells, we take a drop of cells from either a chicken or egg. And we provide them with rich 
 
 nutrients in a clean controlled environment like the one I'm sitting in.
 
And after two to three weeks, the cells do what they naturally do when they get good nutrients they grow. And after two to three weeks, we 
 
 harvest it there is no slaughter in the process. And we make products we love that could be a chicken breast, chicken fillet or sausage or simply 
 
 southern fried chicken.
 
ASHER: It's interesting because I'm wondering, who is the target audience? So, you know, obviously no animals are slaughtered in the 
 
 process, which is obviously good, you know, good news. But you know if you're targeting, obviously people who are vegetarian or vegan or people 
 
 who don't want animals to be slaughtered.
 
Then there are products like Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, for example, that use plant based protein. This is not that so who is your target 
 
 audience?
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
VALETI: I mean right front and center we're looking at people who love eating meat and as humans over thousands of years we've evolved with the 
 
 love for meat always at the center of plate. And that's the group that we are targeting anyone who loves to eat meat from real animals and 
 
 animal cells.
 
And want to maintain the traditions and cultures in any dish that in any cultures that it come from, because meat is such a universal, desirable 
 
 food for us. What we're trying to walk away from is the downsides of how we bring meat of that scale to the table.
 
And this is the opening bell in declaring that yes, we can bring the meat we love from real animal cells, by growing it directly from the 
 
 cells versus trying to grow an entire animal, slaughtering it and then dealing with all the downsides in terms of animal production.
 
ASHER: Right, so if I love to eat meat, but I don't enjoy the downside, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and also animals being 
 
 slaughtered, I am the target audience. So just explained to us the technology and the relationship between reducing greenhouse gas 
 
 emissions, I think that's important for the audience to understand.
 
VALETI: Absolutely, so like I said, this is the only technology that I can think of that exists in the world. That can actually provide us the 
 
 choice of adding act, having real meat, and also preserve the life we care about animal life, the societies, and the communities that we live 
 
 in.
 
And much of the world we're living in is suffering from changes related to climate. And when we think about food production, it takes about two 
 
 years to grow a cow. It takes about nine months to grow a pig and about two to three months to grow a chicken. And in that lifetime, the animal 
 
 has to be fed.
 
And it's going to have to go and do its duties and raising animals, healing broken bones, you know, peeing pooping all of that. Now, if we 
 
 say we don't have to do any of that we can raise meat in two weeks versus two years or two months. We don't have to feed them for that 
 
 long.
 
You don't have the same level of greenhouse gas emissions. And we have zero methane because animal cells do not produce methane. Is the 
 
 industrial process that we're shortening by saying two weeks to grow meat versus two months, or two years. And that's where the big 
 
 opportunity to decrease greenhouse gas emissions comes from just a shorter period of production.
 
ASHER: And the elimination of methane is really, key here. Just in terms of the production process. I mean, it seems expensive, I would imagine 
 
 and pretty complex. So what does that mean, in terms of what customers have to pay out of their pockets paying for Upside Foods versus ordinary 
 
 chicken? What will be the difference in terms of you know how expensive it is?
 
VALETI: Yes, great question. Eventually, we don't think upside chicken is going to be more expensive than conventional chicken. I think the 
 
 path to conventional price parity is inevitable. Of course, it's complex to make it takes a lot of research, innovation, complex building of all 
 
 of these things to come together.
 
So it's expensive for us to make it at this point. But when we go to consumers, we're applying to provide it as a premium to organic, because 
 
 it provides all of the benefits of eating chicken like we love without the downside. So we think maybe initially premium to organic and with 
 
 time, conventional parody or even breeding it.
 
ASHER: Right, Uma Valeti, CEO of Upside Foods, thank you so much and congratulations.
 
VALETI: Thank you.
 
ASHER: Right, still to come here on "First Move", Barbie is taking the world by storm again. After the break, we'll look at the business of 
 
 Barbie, ahead of her big screen debut.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
ASHER: Welcome back, she's pretty in pink and ready for business, since Mattel launched the iconic Barbie doll in 1959. She has captured the 
 
 hearts and imaginations of millions of people around the world. She's been a lawyer, she's been a doctor, and she has flown into space, and 
 
 even become President.
 
Now business is booming ahead of Barbie live action movie next week. Vanessa Yurkevich joins us live now. Things are different though, for 
 
 Barbie compared to when you and I were growing up. Actually, I don't even know how old you are? I'm guessing we're the same age roughly.
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Same age.
 
ASHER: Yes, roughly more or less. And so back in the 1980s, early 90s, you know, everybody had a Barbie doll. It's not the same anymore. Is 
 
 Barbie still relevant? And how will that affect box office numbers for the movie?
 
YURKEVICH: Right and I think that's what this movie is designed to test out. I mean, Barbie really needs no introduction. She's been around for 
 
 64 years. And Mattel, the maker of Barbie has done lots of brand partnerships before clothing, coloring books, but this is the first live 
 
 action movie.
 
And the President of Mattel tells me that he's hoping that the nostalgia of Barbie brings longtime fans into the theater. But also, Zain tries to 
 
 go after a brand new audience watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Barbara Millicent Roberts, you know her as Barbie parents, Mattel born in 1959, but doesn't look a day over 19.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everyone had a Barbie, and it was the thing to have a Barbie.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Next week, Barbie comes to life in a new movie with an -- director and actors.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi Barbie.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi Ken.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Distributed by CNN's parent company Warner Brothers Discovery.
 
RICHARD DICKSON, PRESIDENT AND COO OF MATTEL: It's an incredibly important milestone for the brand.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Barbie beloved by girls and boys around the world has had ups and downs.
 
DICKSON: Back in 2014, 15 we hit a low and it was a moment to reflect in the context of why did Barbie in this relevance. She didn't reflect the 
 
 physicality the look if you will of the world around us.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Now Barbie can and friends have many different skin tones, shapes and special traits that make them look more like us. 
 
 But this year's first quarter sales that Mattel slumped down 22 percent from last years.
 
YURKEVICH (on camera): How is Mattel and Barbie viewed as a brand?
 
KATIE MANCINI, GENERAL MANAGER OF LANDOR &amp; FITCH: There's been a lot of decline and that differentiation and that relevance that keeps a brand 
 
 fresh and top of mind from a purchase perspective. And when that happens brands go into a place of fatigue.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Mattel hopes this new movie will give them the boost they're looking for.
 
DICKSON: We also now have the opportunity to reach new ages and stages that ultimately from a business perspective provides huge merchandising 
 
 and monetization opportunities.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): We're standing in front of --
 
EILEEN GEYER, OWNER OF HOMBOM TOYS: Barbie.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): -- at HomBom toys owner Eileen Geyer, can keep movie Barbie on the shelf.
 
GEYER: Or within a day they will gone.
 
YURKEVICH (on camera): Have you always had Barbie and her friends --
 
GEYER: Absolutely. It's a staple. It's the moms and dads who are more nostalgic than the kids.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): But that nostalgia isn't for everyone.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know how she's evolved. Like the ship college degree now.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): The movie that's calculated for that. And for others, you're never too old for Barbie.
 
CAROL SPENCER, BARBIE CLOTHING DESIGNER 1963-1998 AT MATTEL: I am 90 years old. Or I should say 90 years young.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Carol Spencer didn't grow up playing with Barbie's.
 
SPENCER: This was my first project.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): But Barbie wouldn't be well Barbie without her.
 
SPENCER: I was a designer for the Barbie doll starting in 1963 for over 35 years, and I loved every minute of it.
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): While Carol helped make Barbie, Barbie helped make Mattel as other toys have come and gone. Barbie is still -- .
 
SPENCER: Barbie really carried Mattel for great many years. I thought of every child who played with the Barbie doll as my child. So let me tell 
 
 you I have a big family and I love it.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): And that is the magic and power of Barbie.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH: And when Barbie launched in 1959, her job was to be a teen fashion model. She then evolved into a fashion designer. And then 
 
 consumers started asking questions could Barbie be more than that? Not that those careers are bad, but they wanted to see her in more male 
 
 dominated fields.
 
So we had lawyer Barbie, we had scientist Barbie, Astronaut Barbie as you said, and Zain, of course here we are Reporter Barbie --
 
ASHER: -- the microphone and everything.
 
YURKEVICH: And we have camera woman Barbie.
 
ASHER: -- Barbie, and speaking of fashion, loves that you will pink for this interview very on brand Vanessa Yurkevich. Thank you so much. And 
 
 that's it for the show. I'm back in a couple of hours with one world "Connect the World" is up next. You're watching CNN.
