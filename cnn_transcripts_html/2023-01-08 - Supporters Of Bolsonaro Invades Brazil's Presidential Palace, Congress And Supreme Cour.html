PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: I'm Pamela Brown in Washington and you are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
We are watching chaos break out in Brazil right now in the capital city. Take a look right here. These are supporters of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro. They are storming security barriers and breaking into the country's congressional buildings, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace, and this is happening one week after the inauguration of President Lula da Silva. 
 
CNN senior Latin affairs editor Rafael Romo joins us now. I mean, this has been going on for hours, Rafael. This is frightening and looks out of control and has a very familiar feel to those of us who watched something similar happen here in Washington, D.C. two years ago. What's going on there right now? 
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR: Yeah. That's right, Pamela. I mean, people are comparing what's happening today in Brazil with what happened here in the United States on January 6, 2021. Over the last few hours, we have seen protesters breaking windows and doors, vandalizing offices and clashing with police and government employees as they stormed government buildings in Brazil. You have the capital of Brazil.
 
Protesters not only stormed the congressional building, but also the Planalto Palace which is Brazil's presidential building, Pam, as well as the country's Supreme Court building. In the last hour, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who took office only a week ago, as you mentioned, reacted to the events describing them as barbaric and calling those responsible for acts of vandalism fanatical fascists.
 
And this -- here's a statement of what he had to say just a few moments ago. He said, "These people are everything that is abominable in politics to invade the government headquarters, the headquarters of Congress and the headquarters of the Supreme Court like true vandals destroying everything in their path."
 
That's what president said. Pam, it started a few hours ago as a peaceful protests in front of the army's headquarters in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. Then a numerous group of protesters started marching towards the area where government buildings, where all three branches of government are located and then they stormed them. Back to you. 
 
BROWN: So, where is former President Bolsonaro right now as all of this plays out? 
 
ROMO: That's a very good question, because the former president, instead of attending the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, decided to leave the country more than a week ago and he is in Florida right now, as a matter of fact. He was adamant. He never recognized that he lost the election on October 31st. Although he cooperated with the new government for a peaceful transition, but again, he did not want to be there when his successor took power, Pam. 
 
BROWN: So many parallels to what happened here as well and another example of what happens when you're in a position of power and you lie to your followers. Thank you so much, Rafael Romo, CNN's senior Latin affairs editor. Well, right now, President Biden is on the U.S.-Mexico border marking
 
 his first visit to the region since taking office. And his trip comes at a critical time as a surge of migrants attempt to cross the border into the United States. Just this week, Biden unveiled a new plan for the border but called on Congress to do its part in repairing the country's broken immigration laws. 
 
Criticism on both sides of the aisle continues to mount over the administration's handling of this crisis. Republicans and even some border district Democrats argue this trip is long overdue. The arrivals of thousands of migrants have put a severe strain on border communities, including El Paso. And that is where we find CNN's Rosa Flores. So, Rosa, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in his letter to President Biden that this is nothing more than a photo op. How is President Biden responding?
 <br>[17:05:03] 
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, President Biden really hasn't made much remarks. My understanding is that we might get some video from him in the next few minutes. What I can tell you, Pamela, is the big question is, will the president actually get a clear picture of the reality here on the ground? I want to show you around. 
 
I'm in the second ward in downtown El Paso. This is a church. And you can see that there are hundreds of migrants who are still living on the streets. They have been living on the streets for weeks. That's why you see these piles of blankets. These blankets that you see here, this is what mothers use to block the wind. 
 
All of the clothing and the items you see here, most of them are donated from Good Samaritans from the El Paso area. You can also see that there's lines for everything. There are lines for food. Migrants are getting in line for water. They get in line for toys for their kids. This is the reality on the ground right now. 
 
What we know that President Biden has done is he's gone to the Bridge of the Americas. We have video of that. But from talking to advocates, there's really nothing to see when it comes to the migrant crisis there. What he will see, of course, is the enforcement side, what CBP has there, some of the tools that they use for the traffic of cars and inspections and such.
 
But a lot of the advocates, Pamela, that I've been talking about, what they question is, if the president doesn't come here to see the actual reality of what is happening on in the streets of El Paso, will he actually leave the border with a clear picture of what is happening here? I can tell you that in mid-December, the number of migrant apprehensions according to border patrol was at about 2,500. It has drastically improved. Drastically improved. 
 
According to DHS, that number has dropped to about 700 per day, but as you can see, the situation is still very chaotic here and the big question is, will the president stop by here before he leaves? Will he actually speak to migrants? Will he actually understand that? And Pamela, one final thing I want to leave you with is, a lot of
 
 advocates that I've been talking to say that they were hoping that then -- when President Biden campaigned with humane immigration policies, they were hoping that he would really have his heart in the immigration policies that his administration was going to roll out. 
 
And instead, they say, that these immigrations are Trump-era policies. And on top of that, that he is expanding those Trump-era policies and they say and they describe the chaos that you see around me. Pamela? 
 
BROWN: All right, Rosa Flores live for us in El Paso. Thank you. 
 
And tomorrow, House Republicans reconvene for a new fight, a big vote on the rules package that will set the parameters for how this Congress will function over the next two years. And if the grueling fight over the speaker's gavel was round one for Kevin McCarthy, this next showdown over the rules could be round two. 
 
CNN national politics reporter Eva McKend joins us now. So, the big question is as we look ahead, Eva, should we expect another week-long mess like we saw on Capitol Hill last week or is the expectation that this will run more smoothly?
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: You know, Pam, that is the key question. What I do know for sure is that we heard House Republicans really spend the weekend kind of in cleanup mode here, despite the unprecedented action that we saw on the House floor last week, trying to, I think, assure Americans that that is not going to be emblematic of a Republican-led House. 
 
You have Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio saying democracy is messy. That is how the founders intended it. Games go into extra innings all of the time in reference of course to it taking McCarthy 15 votes to secure the speakership, that dispute is healthy. That's what we heard from Steve Scalise. That, of course, is McCarthy's deputy. 
 
And yes, that is essentially what they are trying to do. But listen, McCarthy enters the speakership in a weakened state. That is just a fact. Weaker than he would have been or weaker than Speaker Pelosi when she held the role. It will just take one member that could trigger a potential vote to oust the speaker. 
 
And I think that is something that Republican members are still trying to, I think, some are viewing it as a victory, but others are -- moderate Republicans are concerned about that. Take a listen to Chip Roy. He spoke with us earlier today. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): I'm not going to -- you know, I'm not going to play the what if games on how we're going to use the tools of the House to make sure that we enforce the terms of the agreement, but we will use the tools of the House to enforce the tools of the agreement. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[17:10:02]
 
MCKEND: So, you hear Congressman Roy there not trying not to show all of his cards, but what we have seen is that the detractors from McCarthy, they have really spent this weekend also taking a bit of a victory lap here. Really happy they were able to secure these key concessions from McCarthy. 
 
BROWN: And of course, you know, when you hear people like Steve Scalise say this was healthy debate, you hear that and then you look at the video of one of the most shocking moments during all the votes when Congressman Mike Rogers lunged at Matt Gaetz and had to be held back. Are there any developments between those two? 
 
MCKEND: So, Pam, it seems like at this point they want to say let bygones be bygones. They both want to move on. You know, they have had in the past a working relationship. They're both going to be serving, I believe, on the House Armed Services Committee with Mike Rogers serving as the chairman and I think Congressman Gaetz was jockeying for a position leading a subcommittee on that panel. 
 
So, it seems like they are just ready to move on and work together. But you know, tomorrow, they are going to have to start voting on that House Rules package. For folks at home, that might seem kind of mundane and boring, but that has really important implications for policy and that, of course, affects all of us. 
 
BROWN: It does. And it's not necessarily a slam dunk. You heard Nancy Mace earlier today, the congresswoman, say I'm still on the fence on how I'm going to vote. So, we shall see. Eva McKend, thank you so much. 
 
And with us now, Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Carey. He voted for Kevin McCarthy to become speaker all 15 times. Hi, congressman. Nice to have you on the show. So, I know you and your colleagues have a full agenda starting tomorrow. Hopefully, you've been able to rest up since that late night vote Friday. But first I have to ask you about that wild scene then on Friday night. What did you think, being in that chamber as Congressman Mike Rogers went storming after Congressman Matt Gaetz after the 14th vote? 
 
REP. MIKE CAREY (R-OH): You know, we're that -- where Mike went up to Matt was completely on the other side of the House. I was sitting with the Ohio and the Michigan, and believe me, Ohio and Michigan actually do sit together on the floor of the House. But I was sitting with them on the other side. There was a little bit of loud voices, but there was no altercation. So, I agree with what other people have been saying. 
 
Let's -- let bygones be bygones and let's get the rule package forward. Again, there have been many concessions made. There were many concessions made before we entered the voting for the speaker. So, I think we're going to have a good rules package. We'll get it over the hump and we can get to the business of the American public. 
 
BROWN: And you mentioned the concessions. Let's show our viewers the key areas where Speaker McCarthy made concessions to when they include requiring only one vote to oust the speaker and just 72 hours to review bills before they come to the floor. Is the speaker in a weakened state going into this job? Did he give away the store to get the job? 
 
CAREY: Oh, absolutely not. I think what you got to remember is that this motion to vacate the chair, with only having one member doing this, that's what we had for many, many years. This just changed rather recently. What the Republican conference agreed to was we wanted the majority. Then in negotiations before the vote for the speaker, we went to five and then the group of 20 wanted one. 
 
It doesn't change anything. And honestly, I think when you saw us at the last vote, it took a little longer than I think some of us wanted, but listen, I think the Speaker McCarthy is stronger than he ever has been. He's been very clear. It's not how you start; it's how you finish and the way (inaudible) I think he's going to come into this with a -- in a very strong position. 
 
BROWN: If it wasn't such a big deal to go down to one, then do you think that Kevin McCarthy should have done that earlier rather than let this draw out for four days, the first time since the mid-1800s since that happened for the speaker? 
 
CAREY: Yeah. I think that the thing was we thought that the five because the concessions were made to go from majority, which is what our conference wanted, to five, which is we thought the group of 20 wanted. So, I mean, if that would have been something that could have got it done earlier, yeah, probably should have done it then, but that wasn't part of the issues. 
 
I think there were so many different issues that were being floated around, so. I think, listen, I think we're in a good place. We just got to get this rule package. We got to select our chairman, and then we got to go about getting the commitment of America done and moving our agenda forward. 
 
BROWN: And how do you expect it to play out with the rules package? How do you expect this next week to play out after what we saw this past week? 
 
CAREY: Yeah. Well, listen, I think that we're going to be in a very good place and I think we'll get back tomorrow. We'll start going over all the details in the rule package. And most of us, I think, understand that we have, you know, the rule package has been something that's being developed for some time, so I don't think we'll have as much difficulty as you saw last week because I think most of us have buy in to that. So, my hope is we'll get this through it in short order. 
 
BROWN: Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat's new House leader said this today when asked about working with your party.
 <br>[17:14:58]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We look forward to trying to find some
 
 reasonable Republicans who are willing to break from the extreme elements of their conference to do the business of the American people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN: So, what is your reaction to that? 
 
CAREY: Listen, I think if you look at what -- and I've only been here a year and I understand that, but just in the first-year time I've been able to partner with the opposing party to get legislation passed and I have a very good working relationship with the members here in Ohio and I think we'll find a lot of common ground.
 
And I think if you look at the framework, which is the commitment to America, it's a lot different than the contract. The contract was very specific. But I think if you look at the framework by which -- what the commitment to America is designed, I think there's going to be a lot of things that we'll be able to reach out to Democrats and Republicans and really move this agenda forward. 
 
BROWN: What's this all --
 
CAREY: And I was glad to hear (inaudible).
 
BROWN: Okay. You know, this past week we did learn a lot, also, you know, seeing the former President Trump helped seal the deal for McCarthy. In your view, does he lead the Republican Party in 2023? 
 
CAREY: Well, listen, I think if you're looking at the House, I think the leader of the House is going to be Speaker Kevin McCarthy and I think if you're looking at the president, I, you know, I endorsed President Trump for his next run for president. So, I think he has a -- he plays a major role in Republican politics. There's no doubt about that. But I think as far as the politics of the House, I think that's going to be Speaker McCarthy. 
 
BROWN: All right. Congressman Mike Carey, thanks for coming on the show. 
 
CAREY: Good to be with you. 
 
BROWN: It's been quite a while -- quite a week, we should say, for the Buffalo Bills and Hollywood producers, they could not write a script better than what we saw on the field both before and during the Bills' first game back after Damar Hamlin's scary collapse. 
 
Plus, the mayor of Newport News, Virginia, joins us. That community is just in shock after police say a 6-year-old student shot an elementary school teacher. 
 
And then later, Prince Carey like you have never heard him before, an explosive interview days before his memoir comes out.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:20:00]
 
BROWN: The Buffalo Bills just played their first game since teammate Damar Hamlin's stunning collapse on the field last Monday night. They beat the New England patriots 35 to 23, but the final score barely begins to tell the story of what happened today. Few games in NFL history have ever been more emotional, and that was evident inside the stadium tunnel before kickoff. Here's what star quarterback Josh Allen told his team before they took the field. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSH ALLEN, BUFFALO BILLS QUARTERBACK: They always say don't play for the name on the back, you play for the name on the front. I'm pretty sure we play for that (BLEEP) number on the front too, all right? So, get some go, one, two, three!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN: And the opening kickoff was something straight out of a Hollywood screenplay. Buffalo's Nyheim Hines ran it back 96 yards for a touchdown. You got to believe Damar Hamlin was watching from the hospital. Here he is on FaceTime with Miles Sander, a running back for the Eagles. He's wearing his "Love for Damar" t-shirt. CNN's Omar Jimenez joins us now. So, Omar, what is the atmosphere like in Buffalo? 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, in short, great. We are right across from the stadium at Danny's South Bar, and really, throughout the entire game, beforehand, during and now afterwards, it has been filled with Bills fans. And look, I think it's -- I don't think it's an understatement to say it has been a roller coaster of a week for the Buffalo area, especially so for the players as they've been monitoring Damar Hamlin's recovery.
 
But then, of course, they got good news leading into this game. They played well. And of course, ended the game on a high note. It kicked off, though, quite literally with a return from a kickoff for a touchdown, and as quarterback Josh Allen reflected on that moment, he got a little bit emotional. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSH ALLEN, BUFFALO BILLS QUARTERBACK: You can't draw that one up like that one up any better. I was just told by Kevin Kearns (ph), it's been three years and three months since the last kickoff return. So, it's pretty cool. 
 
TREMAINE EDMUNDS, BUFFALO BILLS LINEBACKER: I'm extremely happy for him, extremely happy to see, you know, how he, you know, continues to progress through this thing, man. And you know, I know he's happy. I can't wait to talk to him, man. And this was for sure for three (ph). 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIMENEZ: And look, that emotion is not just felt by the players, by the fans. We're out and about talking to Bills mafia as they're known, as they are tailgating. I survived their tailgating experience because it turns out they go pretty hard. 
 
But over the course of it, they just talked about how devastating this was. They had never left a stadium in complete silence for those that had -- that were in Cincinnati attending the game. But here at this bar, they had never seen this bar completely silent as they did during that moment in the game.
 
And then you fast forward to today, you couldn't go anywhere without seeing Damar Hamlin's jersey, even on a cookie like we picked up a little bit earlier because his spirit is of course with his teammates on the field and very much with the fans as well. 
 
BROWN: Absolutely wise. Omar Jimenez, thank you so much. 
 
And we're following the latest from Brazil tonight. The very latest is next. 
 
Plus, after a 6-year-old shot his teacher, the mayor of the Virginia city where it happened says it's, quote, almost impossible for the community to wrap its head around it, and he joins us live up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:25:00]
 
BROWN: An update now on the chaos of Brazil and the capital city. Supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro are storming security barriers and breaking into the country's congressional buildings, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. And this is happening just one week after the new president, Lula da Silva was inaugurated. Anne Barbosa from our affiliate CNN Brazil joins us now from Sao Paulo. So, Anne, what's going on the ground there right now? 
 
ANNE BARBOSA, CNN BRASIL: Pamela, good to be speaking with you. Here are the last information from Brazil right now. Actually, about an hour ago, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva decrees federal intervention after terrorist attacks. Actually, he is not in Brasilia right now. He is at the city Araraquara in the countryside of the state of San Paolo. Actually, it's not the same place of the attacks. 
 <br>[17:29:51]
 
It all starts about 3:00 p.m. here in Brazil. Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, who refused to accept that he lost the elections in last October, they broke through palace barriers in the capital of Brazil, Brasilia, and they invade Congress National, Brazilian Congress, Supreme Court, and the presidential palace. 
 
For those who don't know the place, these buildings are located at the same square here in Brazil. Actually, in Brasilia. We call the Tres Poderes in Portuguese. In English, it means three powers. And they invaded this place about 3:00 p.m. here in Brazil. 
 
Police after that, actually, they used gas tear trying to repeal them, but they failed. Image that actually you may be seeing right now show people breaking windows, jumping into seats, all of this happening inside the National Congress, and Brazilian Congress, inside the presidential palace, inside the Supreme Court. Totally out of control scenes. 
 
So, as you said, it's happening a week after President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's inauguration. He is not at the capital right now. On the other hand, Jair Bolsonaro has left Brazil in the end of the last year. He's currently in the United States and supporters of Jair Bolsonaro were camping at the capital of Brazil after the elections, since October, since last October.
 
Actually, in another city in Brazil, it was happening at the same situations. Just as minister (inaudible), before all of this happening, has ordered armed force to refuse these people. Actually, today is Sunday. Parliamentarians and ministers were not working there, but actually, there are a lot of people in this building, of course. Back to you, Pamela. 
 
BROWN: Anne Barbosa from our affiliate CNN Brasil. Thank you for bringing us the latest there on the ground. 
 
Also tonight, police in Virginia face a gut-wrenching situation as they try to figure out why a 6-year-old little boy shot his schoolteacher and how he even got a gun in the first place and then brought it to school. Authorities in Newport News say there had been a classroom altercation between the two before the teacher was shot on Friday. A single round was fired and no other students were involved.
 
What we are hearing just how terrifying it was when the school went into lockdown. Newport News Mayor Philip Jones joins us now. SO, Mayor Jones, first off, I'm so sorry what you and your community have had to go through. How awful. How are you doing? How is your community doing? 
 
PHILLIP JONES, MAYOR OF NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA: Thank you so much for having me on the show. This past weekend has been a dark day for our city. It's a very raw experience, but I'm extremely proud of all my first responders, the teachers, the staff, the community coming together. We are going to pull together. 
 
BROWN: You've said grappling with what happened is almost impossible to wrap our minds around. How do you make sense of this? 
 
JONES: Honestly, it's a very difficult thing to process. The fact that we have a 6-year-old individual with the ability to bring a gun into school and harm his teacher, something that we're still grappling with. It is still an active investigation. But as always, our main priority is to ensure the safety of our children in schools. 
 
BROWN: And what about the parents here? Do you think they'll be held responsible for this? Do we know if police have talked to the parents as part of this investigation or any other family members for that matter? 
 
JONES: So, right now, it still remains an active investigation, so at this time we're going to let the police conduct a thorough and formal investigation before we comment on that matter. 
 
BROWN: So, you can't tell us whether they've been spoken to by police? 
 
JONES: We're still working through that process right now, Pamela. 
 
BROWN: Authorities and the Newport News public school district did not name the teacher but her alma mater, James Madison University, identified her as Abby Zwerner. How is she doing? 
 
JONES: So, actually in accordance with Virginia law and after talking to victim and her family, we're actually not going to announce her name at this time. But I can tell you that myself and other colleagues of city council as well as the police chief, we've spent the last couple days at the hospital. We have spoken to the family almost every single day, and I'm very glad to report that she's in a stable condition at this time. 
 
BROWN: That's good to hear. I just can't even imagine what she is going through right now, not just physically, but emotionally, mentally processing this. What happens next for this little boy involved here? I mean, obviously, he can't be tried as an adult and in Virginia, he's too young to be put up in the justice system. What becomes of him? Can we assume his parents or legal guardians, as I asked earlier, I mean, that they could be held responsible for this? What do you think? 
 <br>[17:35:03]
 
JONES: I think right now, there's a lot of questions that we have to answer as a community. One, how a 6-year-old was able to have a gun, to know how to use it in such a deliberate manner, but I do know that right now, because it remains an investigation, we're going to let itself sort of work out before we rush to judgment at this time. But I can tell you that the individuals responsible will be held accountable. I can promise that. 
 
BROWN: There's a lot of questions about how this little boy was able to get a gun into school. What steps need to happen to make sure that this never happens again? You know, in the wake of this shooting? 
 
JONES: I think right now there are going to have to be some discussions. After the investigation has concluded, I do know that myself, members of council, school board, along with the superintendent, are going to review our current security protocols and policies, a combination of SRO's, police officers in the schools, possible metal detectors. There is a lot of things that we can look at when we review our policy. But first we want to take and ensure that the police have time for a formal and thorough investigation. 
 
BROWN: Just a follow-up on that. Why wait until the investigation is over? It could take a while. I mean, given what just happened, why not dive in now, look at the policies and security plans and see what could be fixed now? 
 
JONES: So, it's actually already happening. So, myself and members of council, we do not formally swear in until Tuesday. This is essentially week zero for us. We're going to swear in on Tuesday and there is going to be a lot of discussion concurrent to the police investigation. But I do want to give my chief of police time to do an investigation before we start to piecemeal and do security.
 
Newport News public schools has about 26,000 students just under 40 schools. I want to make sure that we do things correctly in a refined manner because it is going to affect a lot of children. 
 
BROWN: All right. Newport News Mayor Philip Jones, thank you. 
 
JONES: Thank you. 
 
BROWN: In just days, the Golden Globes will be back on TV after facing controversy. New reporting on what the award show has in store. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:40:00]
 
BROWN: After years of controversy, the Golden Globes will be back on television Tuesday night. Chloe Melas is in Los Angeles getting ready to cover the ceremony and she talked with the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. So, Chloe, what did she tell you about changes the group has made?
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Good evening, Pamela. Well, look, that is the question on everyone's mind as we gear up for the Golden Globes that are going to be taking place on Tuesday because they did not air last year on NBC because of their diversity issues, their ethical complaints. But the president says that they have made a lot of changes. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HELEN HOEHNE, PRESIDENT, HOLLYWOOD FOREIGN PRESS ASSOCIATION: Ethical changes such as implementing a new code of conduct, mandatory training, education for our members, but also, implementing the first industry gift ban, so that we are not influenced by any gifting in the industry. And then I think we really made diversity and inclusion forefront and -- of our efforts. 
 
MELAS: Would you say that it was a good learning lesson for the HFPA and now the Globes comes out stronger in the end? 
 
HOEHNE: Absolutely. You know, change takes time and sometimes it takes a crisis to start change. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MELAS: So, Pamela, among the changes that the Hollywood Foreign Press has made, in recent months they've added 103 new voters and they are touting now that they are 52 percent female in their voting body. So, it will be interesting to see if the tone of the night is different and if this is addressed by the host that everyone is so excited to see take the stage, Jerrid Carmichael, and we haven't heard much of anything from him leading up to Tuesday night's ceremony. 
 
BROWN: So, let's talk about the awards themselves. What are you moist excited about? 
 
MELAS: Okay. Look, "Avatar" "Top Gun," some of the movies' biggest, some of the year's biggest block busters are nominated. And I think that that is a really big deal. I was talking to the HFPA president, Helen, that you saw just there, and she says that it's because people got back to the theaters and these are the movies that people are most excited about.
 
So, best motion picture, drama, as you see, "Avatar: The Way of Water" which James Cameron now really happy that he's breaking even. "Elvis," "The Fablemans" by Steven Spielberg, "TAR" and "Top Gun: Maverick." But I also want to talk about best motion picture musical or comedy, so, "The Banshees of Inisherin" staring Colin Ferrell and Brandon Gleeson is leading the way with nominations.
 
And this is the move that everyone is saying if you haven't watched it, try to watch it by Tuesday. And people are thinking that this is going to sweep. And then also you see "Triangle of Sadness ", "Babylon" with Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt. "Everything Everywhere All at Once" is another movie. I haven't seen it yet, but I'm getting a lot of text messages over the last few days saying, have you seen this? You need to see it.
 
And then of course, everyone's favorite "Glass Onion." So, a lot of movies to watch, but I think it's really cool that "Avatar," "Top Gun," these big blockbusters, it could be their moment. 
 
BROWN: It definitely could. I'm going to have to watch "Banshees." I came home last night, my husband was watching it. I should have maybe stayed up and watched it with him rather than go to bed. Oh, well. 
 
MELAS: I know, but you and I, we're tired moms. Who has time to stay up and watch this stuff? 
 
BROWN: I know. I turn in -- exactly 9:00, I'm like ready to turn into a pumpkin because you know how early you have to get up. Chloe Melas, thanks so much. 
 
MELAS: Thank you.
 
BROWN: Well, you are in the "CNN Newsroom." In a new interview, Prince Carey is addressing his mother's death and more including the odds of reconciliation with his family. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:45:02]
 
BROWN: Prince Carey making his first TV appearance tonight since the leak of his explosive new memoir. In an ITM interview just -- that aired just moments ago, Carey addressed some of his book's most shocking claims including his past drug use and his fractured relationship with his family. CNN's Max Foster joins us now with reactions. Max, this interview literally just ended a few minutes ago while we were on air. What jumped out at you while you were watching this? 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's a lot. I mean, it goes everywhere and you just keep up with what Carey is saying. 
 <br>[17:50:00]
 
Some of his ideas are quite complex. He chose to really outline his issues and concerns. So, for example, you know, a lot of people coming away from the Oprah interview previously saying -- suggesting that they accused the royal family of racism by questioning whether or not, you know, what color this baby would be, the first baby, Archie, as he turned out to be. Carey is saying we weren't accusing them of racism. We're accusing them of conscious -- unconscious bias. 
 
He says a lot of quite, sort of thoughtful process for Carey trying to explain all the different stories that have been coming out in recent years. He firmly blames the complicit relationship as he sees it between the palace and the tabloid media specifically the British press for many of the issues, he has with his life recently and with the monarchy. He says he does believe in monarchy. 
 
Some of the specifics he comes up with, he said pretty much from the get-go, that William and Kate did not get on with Meghan and they say she was -- they weren't used to the idea of him potentially marrying someone with a career, who was bi-racial, who was American, an actress. He accuses Camilla of leaking stories from William. 
 
So, there are some major accusations in there. At the same time, he says there's been no indication of reconciliation from the palace, the family side, but he would ultimately like reconciliation. He does think it would be possible. 
 
BROWN: Yeah, it's hard to imagine how that would be after putting all of this out there. I mean, there are so many details, and did he address why he put so much out there? It seems like nothing was left unsaid. 
 
FOSTER: Yeah, and you know, he's questioned about that. You know, he talks about his private life and how, you know, that should be private and he said that any conversation we do have in the future with the other parts of the family should remain private, but then he is questioned about, you know, revealing all of these very intimate details about the family. 
 
The way he explains it, if I'm right and I don't want to sort of summarize too much of what he says because he does feel as if he gets constantly misinterpreted, but he is basically saying he wants to choose -- he wants to own his own narrative. He is allowed to speak to his narrative. He doesn't like it when it's reinterpreted by the British press in particular. 
 
So, he is basically saying he needs to own his narrative for him and able to, to be able to move on. He needs -- he thinks truth should be out there. So, he is putting all of his truth out there and therefore he can move on. What he'd ideally like to do is get the rest of the family around the table and they can all talk about the truth. 
 
BROWN: Yeah, which brings me to my next question. You know, Buckingham Palace has been silent. Any word from them, any expectation of word from them in response to the interviews he is doing? 
 
FOSTER: No. So, having been in touch with palace tonight, it is the same sort of conversation that they will not be commenting and they applied that to the Netflix series as well. They haven't explained what the no comment policy is. Is it they're allowing Carey to have his time, his say in public because he is so desperate for that? Are they rising above it? Are they just refusing to engage, to stop fueling all of these exposures as it were? 
 
It's not clear why they're doing that. I don't see any reason why they will respond even though some of these accusations particularly the ones around Camilla are very specific and pretty offensive I would have thought to the royal family. 
 
BROWN: Wow. Well, look, I hope that Carey finds peace and the members of the royal family find peace and can get through all of this. The bottom line is no one could put ourselves in their shoes, right, including Carey's. Max Foster, thank you so much. And be sure to join Anderson Cooper tomorrow night for a special report on Prince Carey as they discuss revelations from his book, "Spare." The "360" special airs tomorrow night at 8:00 right here on CNN. 
 
Still ahead for you tonight on this Sunday, the Bills pull off a story book first game since Damar Hamlin's cardiac arrest. How fans and Damar, himself, who is watching, are reacting.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRIS WALLACE, CNN ANCHOR: I understand you're set to play in the next "Dead Pool" movie and even though your character Logan or Wolverine was killed off in the last movie, you're going to play Wolverine again for the 10th time. 
 
HUGH JACKMAN, ACTOR: Yes. 
 
WALLACE: Why? 
 
JACKMAN: I mean, you categorize it as the "Dead Pool" movie. We like to call it Wolverine X. That's (inaudible) in our house. 
 
WALLACE: Have you checked with Ryan Reynolds on this? 
 
JACKMAN: I need to check with him. I'm kidding. We, basically, this is taking place, the story is pre-Logan, which is exactly as you said, where Logan died. So, we pre that in the story line. 
 
WALLACE: Okay. 
 
JACKMAN: And I honestly, Chris, really thought I was done. Like I was at peace with it, fine. I got asked every day in interviews or Ryan Reynolds, can we do it again? I'm like, no, I'm done. Someone said to me, I think it was -- I think it was Deb, well, he was my wife. She said, you know, after this, what is it you really want to do? 
 
And I was just driving down a day later and I thought, and it came to me like that. Because when I keep thinking of me and Ryan, "Dead Pool" and "Wolverine" which are classic comic book rivals. There is also a dynamic that I've never really got to do before as "Wolverine" and I just thought this is going to be fun, something I've never done before and I can't wait.
