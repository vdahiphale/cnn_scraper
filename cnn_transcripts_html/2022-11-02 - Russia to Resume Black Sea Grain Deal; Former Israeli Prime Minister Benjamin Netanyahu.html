BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST (voice-over):  This hour, Benjamin Netanyahu is on track for a massive comeback and is on course to lead Israel's most right-
 
 wing government ever. 
 
South Korea on the defensive, after North Korea launches a record number of missiles over the past 48 -- 24 hours. 
 
And some good news for global food supplies, Russia says it will resume participation in the Black Sea grain deal.

ANDERSON:  A very warm welcome, it is 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi, I'm Becky Anderson. From a fast-moving region, you are watching CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
Israel's former prime minister set to complete an emphatic comeback, as voters shift the country to the Right. Amid final election results due 
 
 anytime soon, new concerns today that Iran is getting increasingly aggressive and may be planning to attack energy infrastructure in Saudi 
 
 Arabia. 
 
Over the next two hours, a closer look at the shifting dynamics in this region where I am and the impact for wherever you are watching around the 
 
 world. 
 
We're starting in Israel this hour. Final results from today's elections could be announced later today or tomorrow. With some 80 percent of the 
 
 votes counted, Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party and its allies on track to win a majority of seats in Israel's parliament, known as the Knesset.
 
The ultranationalist bloc that will join the Likud ruling coalition, performing well, setting the stage for the most rightwing government in 
 
 Israeli history. Hadas Gold connecting us from Jerusalem. 
 
Hadas, huge turnout this election. Just explain where things stand and what's behind that surge, the surge to the Right this year. 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Huge turnout, the highest seen in years. And actually the numbers we are seeing from the early 
 
 official results show a better result for Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies than the opinion polls were predicting. 
 
They were predicting maybe just making it to the 61 seat majority they needed to form a government and needed for Benjamin Netanyahu to become 
 
 prime minister. 
 
And instead what we're seeing is a 65-seat majority, where even if one of the smaller parties, as these final votes get counted, even if they somehow 
 
 pass a threshold and maybe take four seats away or something, they still have a good cushion, 65 minus 4, that's 61. That still gives them the 
 
 majority. 
 
It's hard to see an outcome where Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies are not going to be in power. It will be, as we're seeing right now, the most far-
 
 right Israeli government that Israel has ever seen. 
 
That's because of the explosion in popularity of these far-right parties, specifically this bloc called Religious Zionism/Jewish Power. It's these 
 
 two parties that came together in one. Their probably most well-known leader is Itamar Ben-Avi, very much known as a settler leader. 
 
We've often seen him sort of stirring up trouble in hot point places like Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem. These people have exploded in popularity. In 
 
 fact, they were once considered the extreme fringe of Israeli politics. 
 
Just a year ago, Netanyahu was dismissing the idea that Itamar Ben-Avi would be a minister and now in the last final days, he said, yes, of 
 
 course, they will be considered for minister. 
 
Not only will they be in the government, they clearly will be, their party will likely be the third largest party in the Israeli parliament behind 
 
 Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party and current caretaker prime minister Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid party. 
 
But what kind of ministerial positions will these people get?
 
Will they get important ones that can change Israeli policy, like defense, like public security?
 
How much influence will they have in this new government, Becky?
 
ANDERSON:  I just wonder what you believe at this point. We are still waiting for these results to come in. 
 
But given what you've said and given the potential for this very far right wing government, what are the implications for Israel, for the region and 
 
 around the world?
 <br>[10:00:00]
 
GOLD:  We've seen reporting, Becky, that allies around the world have expressed concern over the rise of these far-right parties. Keep in mind, 
 
 it's not just the United States; it's these new allies like the Abraham accords allies, like the UAE. 
 
I can think it will be hard to imagine someone from the UAE coming to visit and meeting with the government, where there's someone like Itamar Ben-Avi, 
 
 sitting in a ministerial position. 
 
Now when Benjamin Netanyahu is asked about this -- and he had been asked about this on CNN and elsewhere -- he essentially says, look, listen. Likud 
 
 is still the biggest party. They're the biggest party in the Israeli parliament, they will have something like 31 seats, he will be the prime 
 
 minister. He's the one who gets to decide on the policy, gets to decide the direction. 
 
But you cannot ignore the power that this group will have, because if Benjamin Netanyahu does not have those 14 seats, he doesn't have the 
 
 majority. So he's going to have to cater to them in some way. 
 
The question will be, what will be the price they will extract from him?
 
ANDERSON:  Fascinating. Hadas, stay on it. Back to you next hour.
 
And you can read a lot more news and analysis on Israel's election our "Meanwhile in the Middle East" newsletter. That drops three times a week. 
 
 There's a story up now on how Benjamin Netanyahu eyed far right extremism support to stage a political comeback. 
 
One Israeli expert saying, after years of political deadlock, a new right- wing government might stick. 
 
A flurry of missiles and a new level of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea says the North truly crossed a line this time. Seoul launching 
 
 three surface-to-air  missiles that landed just north of the maritime border between the two nations. 
 
This is a flexing of firepower, after a barrage of missile launches from Kim Jong-un's military. Nearly 2 dozen missiles and scores of artillery 
 
 shots fired into the waters of the east and west coasts. 
 
One of the North's ballistic missiles crossed the northern limit line for the first time near the South's territorial waters. Selina Wang is 
 
 following the story for you from Beijing. 
 
There is no doubt that this is a major escalation, Selina, even by this year's standards. Just explain the significance of what we are witnessing 
 
 here. 
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Becky. This is unprecedented. We are talking in about a single day, as many as 23 missiles launched from North 
 
 Korea, the highest number ever of those short-range missiles. 
 
One of those missiles included one that landed near South Korean waters. It triggered a rare air raid warning on South Korea's Ulleung island. Now in 
 
 an immediate response, we also saw South Korea launch three air to surface missiles from fighter jets. So we are seeing a strong retaliation from 
 
 South Korea. We're seeing this escalate into a tit-for-tat. 
 
Now this entire region has been on edge because, to your earlier point, this has been an unprecedented year. This counts as the 29th series of 
 
 launches from North Korea this year. We have seen recent aggressive acceleration in North Korean weapons testing. 
 
Now the timing here is critical. This comes just two days after the U.S. and South Korea held joint military exercises that include hundreds of 
 
 aircraft. It includes thousands of military personnel from both countries. 
 
We had heard North Korea make extremely strong statements as backlash against those joint military exercises, threatening even more powerful 
 
 follow-up measures. 
 
So experts are saying this dramatic response we saw today is because of those joint military exercises and that it could be a pretext, in fact, for 
 
 an even more provocative response to come. 
 
Just last week, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said North Korea could be preparing for a nuclear test, its first one since 2017. Satellite 
 
 imagery does show activity at its underground nuclear test site. 
 
Key context here as well is that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to build up the country's nuclear arms, has vowed to build up its missiles 
 
 launch capabilities. He sees them as critical to regime stability and giving North Korea more leverage in future negotiations with the United 
 
 States. 
 
Now U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is scheduled to meet his South Korean counterparts in the coming days we. know, Becky, that there will be 
 
 plenty for them to discuss. 
 
ANDERSON:  Absolutely. Selina Wang on the story. Thank you, Selina. 
 
This is first on CNN. The U.S. is accusing North Korea of trying to hide shipments of ammunition to Russia for its war against Ukraine. The U.S. 
 
 says artillery shells are being made to look as if they are sent to the Middle East or North Africa. This comes as the Kremlin changes its mind 
 
 about a standoff that threatened to reignite a global food crisis. 
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
ANDERSON:  Moscow says it's rejoining what is known as the Black Sea grain deal, ensuring safe passage for ships carrying vital food exports from 
 
 Ukraine. A short time ago, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. reacted to Russia's news on CNN this morning. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  And I was delighted to hear this news and I want to first commend the U.N., the secretary general 
 
 in particular, for continuing to negotiate this important deal, because it's providing needed food to the world. 
 
So clearly, Russia was finally convinced that they needed to continue this. They can't stand in the way of feeding the entire world. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, speaking to my colleagues on CNN this morning. Earlier, 
 
Well, CNN's Clarissa Ward standing by for us in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. 
 
There's a lot to cover. And I want to bring in Kylie Atwood, who is also with us at the U.S. State Department for more on that North Korea line. So 
 
 let's start. 
 
Kylie, what more do we have on these U.S. accusations?
 
Just explain. 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, so, basically, what the Security Council is saying this morning, based on newly 
 
 declassified U.S. intelligence, is that North Korea is essentially trying to hide the fact that it is shipping artillery shells to Russia by 
 
 essentially diverting those shipments first to the Middle East and North Africa. 
 
And then, the theory, according to this intelligence, is that they would go from there to Russia. Now the National Security Council's John Kirby said 
 
 they don't necessarily know yet that they have landed in Russia. They're continuing to monitor this, these artillery shells.
 
And we should just note that this comes as, of course, Russia has turned to Iran for weaponry. We've seen those deadly attack drones used to great 
 
 effect on the battlefield by Ukraine. 
 
We know that there are, according to our sources, planned shipments of additional weaponry from Iran to Russia. Those are expected to be some 
 
 advanced missiles. And so what this reporting this morning indicates is Russia isn't only looking for those weaponry backing from Iran. 
 
But they're also looking for artillery. That is demonstrative of the fact that they are, according to U.S. officials, just not doing very well in 
 
 terms of their stockpiles, having to turn to North Korea, diverting these shipments through other countries, to try to hide the fact that they are 
 
 trying to get this weaponry, this ammunition, from North Korea. 
 
That will continue to watch this, because the key here is, when or if, of course, these artillery shells actually get to Russia and how impactful 
 
 they are on the battlefield. There's some folks who believe it could have quite an impact, just because of how much artillery Russia has already used 
 
 during this aggressive war. 
 
But there are some who also point out the fact that North Korea's artillery shells in the past don't have a great track record of being particularly 
 
 accurate. So they may not be as impactful as one would expect them to be. 
 
ANDERSON:  Kylie, good to have that information. 
 
Clarissa, let me bring you in. Of course, we know Ukraine claiming that Iran is sending more sophisticated drones to Russia. 
 
Before we talk about that, I just want to get back into this grain story, because one thing Russia has conceded to, it seems, is to get back on board 
 
 this deal so that vital foodstuffs can continue to move to parts of the world where it is needed most. 
 
What do we know at this point?
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So there's been a lot of back and forth, Becky. It is quite hard to keep up with, honestly. 
 
 But what we know is Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke to the leader of Indonesia and said that Russia was reentering the grain deal. 
 
And that, essentially, they had been given the appropriate assurances by the Ukrainians that these humanitarian groups would not be used for 
 
 military purposes. 
 
If you recall, the stated reason that Russians left the grain deal on Saturday was because they were accusing the Ukrainians of launching an 
 
 attack on Sebastopol, using drones in the Crimean Peninsula and using those humanitarian waterways and vessels in order to do that. 
 
The U.N. had refuted that, saying there was no such thing taking place. Also, the Ukrainians had refuted it. Indeed, those ships did continue to 
 
 move. But now, for whatever reason, we see the Russians reversing course, saying they will allow for grain to move once again. And this will be a 
 
 huge relief for many people. 
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
WARD:  Not just here in Ukraine, Becky, but as you know, all around the world, where the previous standoff had really precipitated in a very 
 
 serious food crisis. 
 
ANDERSON:  Not just the cost of living crisis, you're right to point. Out a really, really worrying potentially, catastrophic food crisis. 
 
Before I let you go, let's just get our viewers up to date on what you know about these claims that Iran is sending more sophisticated weaponry to 
 
 Russia. You've been reporting on all of this. 
 
Again, what can you tell us?
 
WARD:  So this was actually, you know, Kylie Atwood from the State Department, who you were just talking to, had reported yesterday that Iran 
 
 was expected to give ballistic missiles, more drones and other weaponry to the Russians. 
 
Then the Ukrainians expanded a little bit more and talked about the nature of that weaponry. And what they are particularly concerned about, in 
 
 addition to two different types of ballistic missiles that can go up to 700 kilometers, which would give them a huge potential to move right into 
 
 Ukraine or hit right into Ukraine, they're also very concerned about these Arash 2 drones. 
 
The reason they're so concerned about these drones is they can carry roughly five times more explosives than the Shahed drones the 136 drones, 
 
 that have been used for the last six weeks which such devastating effect on the battlefield here. 
 
So their concern is that an influx of these Arash 2s and they're potentially looking at hundreds arriving, as early as the coming days, that 
 
 that would be incredibly difficult for them to defend against in terms of their air defense systems. 
 
And that it could have yet more devastating impact on civilian life but also on civilian infrastructure, which, as you know, Becky, has been the 
 
 real focus of Russia's targeting in recent weeks. 
 
This has had a very damaging effect on not just the electricity grid but also on the morale here, as we head into winter. There's a lot of people 
 
 very concerned that it's going to be very tough, indeed. 
 
ANDERSON:  Clarissa Ward, it was good to have you in Kyiv, Ukraine today. Thank you very much indeed. 
 
We've got you up to speed on Ukraine. Coming up, fresh fears about Iran. Sources say Tehran may be planning to target energy infrastructure in the 
 
 Middle East. We'll tell you more in a live report from Washington. 
 
Meanwhile, student protests on the streets of Iran continue, with much of this story being told on social media, including a disturbing scene now 
 
 under investigation. That is after this. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  The U.S. and Saudi Arabia fear that Iran is planning an attack on energy infrastructure in the Middle East, particularly, in the kingdom 
 
 of Saudi Arabia. A report from a source says officials in Washington and Riyadh have been sharing intelligence that indicates an attack may be 
 
 imminent. 
 
A second source says American fighter jets are in Saudi Arabia and prepared to counter any threats. Our senior national security correspondent, Alex 
 
 Marquardt, joins us now from Washington, D.C., to explain this further. 
 
We know that since these protests, these student protests have been ongoing in Iran, that the regime there has been blaming, amongst others, the 
 
 kingdom for fomenting these protests through media, anti Iranian media. 
 
What more do we know for sure at this point?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  And Iran, the head of the Republican (sic) guard has directly threatened Saudi Arabia 
 
 because of that Saudi-backed Persian language media that is very popular with Iranians outside of Iran. 
 
But, Becky, as you know, there is long-standing robust intelligence sharing between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Now we have U.S. and Saudi 
 
 officials saying there are indications of a possible attack against energy infrastructure in the Middle East. 
 
A Saudi official confirming to me that Saudi intelligence has shared with the United States intelligence pointing to a possible, credible, imminent 
 
 attack against Saudi oil or energy infrastructure inside the kingdom. 
 
Beyond that, there are few specifics. The United States does not seem terribly worried that any attack could affect its own infrastructure in the 
 
 Middle East. We have not seen the U.S. military raise its protection levels. We have not seen U.S. embassies in the region warn citizens of any 
 
 kind of imminent attack. 
 
But as you say, this could be directly tied to the Iranian protests, those anti government protests. Of course, the Iranian regime may be trying to 
 
 deflect from those protests. They have accused Saudi Arabia of backing those protests, of fomenting the unrest, including through that TV channel 
 
 I was just talking about, General Salami, the head of the IRGC, making that warning to Saudi Arabia. 
 
Of course, an attack against Saudi Arabia or the region could also come through a cyber operation, Iranian cyber operation, as well as some Iranian 
 
 proxies in the region like the Houthis. 
 
But what is clear, Becky, is that there is significant concern over the potential for an Iranian-backed attack. 
 
ANDERSON:  It's important timing, this, because it underscores the importance of that intelligence sharing, doesn't it?
 
It's coming at a time when relations between Washington and Riyadh have, as one well placed source in this region has described to me, hit a nadir. It 
 
 does appear that pressure is growing inside the U.S. for the White House to take a stronger stance toward Iran. 
 
What are you hearing?
 
MARQUARDT:  The White House has been mulling, considering how to respond to these protests, how to back them without appearing to really go after 
 
 regime change in Iran. They have been -- activists have been meeting with them. 
 
We have reported that the White House has considered how to get those Elon Musk-made Starlink internet terminals into Iran. What we're seeing now and 
 
 what we're reporting today is there is a large group of American academics, who are now pressuring the Biden administration. 
 
As you know, Becky, so much of these protests are emanating from the universities, students on campus who are rising up and going out into the 
 
 streets to face off against Iranian security services. 
 
And as a result, we now have more than 2,000 prominent U.S. academics, many of them from the Iranian diaspora and at least 10 of them are Nobel 
 
 laureates themselves, who have now written a open letter to President Biden, urging him to do more. 
 
I want to read part of that letter sent to President Biden last night. 
 
They write, "Iran has a rich history of student movements, who have been at the forefront of the Iranian people's struggle for freedom and democracy, 
 
 both under the dictatorship of the shah and the current totalitarian theocracy. 
 
"Under both regimes, university students have suffered significant casualties when security forces violently crush their peaceful protests. We 
 
 are writing to you to take urgent action to prevent such casualties and a loss of life this time." 
 
Of course, Becky, we have seen those brutal crackdowns on university campuses; in concrete terms, these more than 2,000 academics are asking the 
 
 Biden administration to stop all negotiations with the Iranian regime. 
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
MARQUARDT:  That is something that has happened on the nuclear front. Those have been paused for now. They are also asking the Biden administration to 
 
 prevent any kind of sanctions relief, as well as respecting the Iranian protesters' right to self-defense during these demonstrations, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  It's fascinating, isn't it?
 
I spoke to Rob Malley, the U.S. envoy for Iran, a number of times this year. And as late as the summer, when pressed on whether the U.S. had a 
 
 plan B, if the nuclear deal didn't come off, we were just talking about the JCPOA anymore, it really seems as if Washington didn't have a plan B on 
 
 what they would do with Iran and Iran relations at this. Point 
 
So, these protesters have ramped up the need to take a different position, it seems, or at least, encouraged to take a different position from those 
 
 academics. Good to have you, Alex. Always a pleasure, sir. Thank you. 
 
Let's turn to Iran, where tensions continue to rise. We're about to show you some disturbing video of a man being beaten and shot. 
 
CNN cannot verify when the video was shot. We're not certain who is the man in the video but it is clear this is a violent situation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON (voice-over):  This video was posted on social media. Now it appears to show officers attacking a citizen. Iranian police have responded 
 
 to this video and have issued an order to investigate the incident. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Jomana Karadsheh joining us from Istanbul.
 
We've seen the video, our viewers have seen the video. 
 
Do we have any further details about what was going on in this incident?
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We don't really know what was going on before and after this short clip, this very disturbing, horrific video, 
 
 that surfaced yesterday and has been circulating on social media. 
 
Becky, it is one of those rare moments, where you have video, an incident like this, the brutality that we hear so much about from protesters and 
 
 human rights defenders and Iran and you see it caught on camera. 
 
You see that man on the ground, being beaten mercilessly, by the security forces. Then you see an officer pointing his gun toward him and firing a 
 
 shot. We hear one of the people who was filming this incident from a distance, saying these were shotgun pellets. We don't really know the 
 
 condition of the man and what happened to him afterwards. 
 
But as you mentioned, another rare moment here where Iranian police are not denying this incident took place. They say they've seen the video, they've 
 
 ordered an investigation. They are saying that this is, in their words, they don't approve of this violent and unconventional behavior. 
 
But many Iranians and human rights defenders will tell you this is the way security forces behave in the country. Amnesty International also saying 
 
 this is another horrific reminder that the cruelty of Iran's security forces knows no bounds. 
 
This is coming amid a crisis of impunity, in their words, where security forces are given free rein to brutally beat protesters and shoot 
 
 protesters. Again, renewing their call for the United Nations Human Rights Council to urgently investigate the crimes in Iran, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  This time caught on camera, of course. Thank you. Jomana Karadsheh, on the story for you. 
 
We're going to take a very short break at this moment.

 <br>[10:30:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
ANDERSON:  Welcome back, I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. The time here is half past six in the evening. 
 
The U.S. government is waging a war on inflation on two fronts today. The most obvious attack comes in the form of higher interest rates. The Federal 
 
 Reserve is expected to enact another steep rate hike, taking another three quarters of a point on to what it charges banks for loans. 
 
That, of course, spills down to that man on the street. Then there is President Biden. He is delivering a speech today to tout his program to 
 
 train American workers in highly skilled technical jobs an effort that should, he says, over time, ease some of the labor shortages that are 
 
 fueling inflation. 
 
Let's take a deeper dive into all of this. CNN's MJ Lee is at the White House. Stand by, we'll come to you. 
 
Also joined by business correspondent Rahel Solomon. 
 
Rahel, I want to start with you. The Fed is expected to raise rates by three quarters of a percent. 
 
Are we anywhere close to the top of all of this?
 
And were those rates to go higher, at this point, what do we expect?
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I wish I could say we were at the top of it but the truth of the matter, Becky, based on what we've heard from the 
 
 Fed, is we have more rate hikes to come. 
 
As you rightly point out, we are expecting another three quarters of 1 percent. That would be the fourth consecutive rate hike of that magnitude, 
 
 something we have not seen in recent history. So that will take the federal funds rate, its benchmark interest rate, as you pointed out, Becky, 
 
 essentially, the rate banks charge each other. 
 
That will take it to about 4 percent. In terms of the peak, the Fed says it expects to hit about closer to 5.4 percent, 6 percent, I believe?
 
So we still have some ways to go. Here is what we're expecting. We're expecting the Fed to raise a few more times, perhaps, half a percent at the 
 
 next meeting in December. Perhaps another half a percent or lower in the early 2023. And then hold it there. 
 
It will keep it higher for longer and hold it there. And what it signals, Becky, is that this inflation we're experiencing here in the U.S., which is 
 
 hovering around 8.2 percent, it's proving to be quite stubborn, quite persistent. And the Fed is proving it will be aggressive in its approach to 
 
 tackling inflation, even if that does mean a recession. 
 
ANDERSON:  Yes. Very good points. 
 
MJ, let me bring you. In this inflation, this cost of living issue, the economy, squarely, clearly front and center in voters' minds, as people get 
 
 ready to go to vote next Tuesday in these midterms. Mr. Biden, it seems, is somewhat on the defensive at this point. Just explain why. 
 
MJ LEE, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, yes. No question about that. Polling after polling here in the U.S., it shows that inflation and 
 
 economic concerns, they remain top of mind for voters heading into next week. 
 
It has been the biggest political and domestic problem for this president and for folks here at the White House behind me. What we are going to see 
 
 today in Washington is going to be a pretty interesting sort of split screen day. 
 
Just in that, on the one hand, we have the Federal Reserve. That is expected to make this historic rate hike, which will be such a huge 
 
 reminder for folks that inflation still remains such a big problem. 
 
And then literally, at around the same time in the building behind me, we have the president, who is going to be giving a speech and doing an event 
 
 that is about workforce training. 
 
You might wonder, what does that have to do with inflation?
 
Well, officials would argue that, when you are training workers so that they can have skills to go into these specialized fields, what that 
 
 accomplishes, at least, in the long term, is that it deals with some of the labor shortages the U.S. has been dealing with. 
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
LEE:  That's, of course, is one of the many factors fueling inflation here in the country. So again, this is not a short term solution. In fact, there 
 
 really isn't a short term solution to dealing with inflation. The president has tried in many different ways to try to tackle this issue that has been 
 
 so harmful politically. 
 
But I think we get the sense that they, again, in such a vivid way, the Fed is really the one actor that can take the most aggressive action when it 
 
 comes to inflation. There's not much the president can do or Congress can do. And that's been a big reminder for this president throughout the last 
 
 couple of weeks. 
 
ANDERSON:  It's interesting, MJ, because, to a certain extent, watching as an observer, it feels as if the Democrats, particularly their surrogates, 
 
 President Biden and the vice president, failing to read the room somewhat. 
 
Inflation but cost of living, the economy, as we said, squarely front and center for viewers. It does seem remarkable that the Democrats, the 
 
 president himself, is now playing catch-up. 
 
Why is that?
 
LEE:  This has been such a big narrative at the White House. Economic advisers and other top advisers to the president, they have had a pretty 
 
 tricky balancing act to conduct here. 
 
On the one hand, there are some big highlights and bright spots in the U.S. economy, particularly when it comes to the labor market. They will point to 
 
 the jobless rate, for example, wages growing. 
 
But inflation has really just loomed large for the average American. We know that, despite some of these improvements in the economy and the data 
 
 the White House has tried to point to, on top of the legislative victories they've had in recent months, people still remain pessimistic, because 
 
 prices remain so high, whether it's at the gas pump or at the grocery store. 
 
Again, this has been a very challenging problem for this president and they're trying to deal with it. But, yes, I think you're basically right 
 
 that it's six days until the election and it's basically too late.
 
ANDERSON:  MJ, thank you.
 
Rahel, always a pleasure.
 
Thank you, both.
 
For our viewers watching around the world, we can't underscore the importance of next week's (INAUDIBLE) balance of power in Washington. 
 
 Millions of people have already voted for their city mayors, state governors, senators and representatives. 
 
While Mr. Biden isn't on the ballot, his legacy and his legislative agenda for the rest of his term certainly are. That's because voters will decide 
 
 who controls Congress. With the House and the Senate, the party with the majority in the House and Senate wields an enormous amount of power in the 
 
 United States. 
 
They run the committees, they write legislation and decide what measures get a vote on the floor. And that includes hot button issues like the 
 
 economy, like abortion rights and immigration. 
 
So who's on the ballot in the midterms?
 
Well, all 435 members of the House, since they serve two-year terms. And a third of the Senate. They serve six years. So they have staggered 
 
 elections. 
 
Right now, Democrats control the House and the Senate by a razor thin margin. If Republicans take control of either chamber, that could affect 
 
 how much President Biden can get done in the next two years. 
 
I hope that it's clear and it makes sense. It's why you'll see these midterm results here on CNN. We'll stay all over the story for you. Join us 
 
 next Tuesday for in-depth special coverage of the crucial U.S. midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, starting at 4 pm Eastern 
 
 time. 
 
Well, what a difference a week makes for Tottenham. Ahead, how the Spurs advanced in the Champions League.

ANDERSON:  Well, parts of Brazil still at standstill as demonstrators continue protesting the country's presidential election results. 
 
These are the live pictures out of Sao Paulo. The demonstrators angry that leftist former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva unseated Jair Bolsonaro 
 
 on Sunday. 
 
Brazil's industrial union is calling for an immediate end to these blockages, calling the protests "undemocratic," saying they could spark 
 
 goods and gas shortages. Meanwhile, president elect Lula da Silva is getting on with the prospect of governing again. He just announced he'll be 
 
 traveling to Egypt for the global COP27 climate summit. 
 
That kicks off on Sunday and he is promising to act on climate change in ways critics say president Jair Bolsonaro has not. Lula has vowed to work 
 
 with the international community to protect the Amazon and address the climate crisis. 
 
We will be there in Egypt to cover the conference. As always, we are keeping the climate crisis front and center here on CONNECT THE WORLD. Join 
 
 us on Thursday for our second annual Call to Earth Day, 24-hour global day of action to raise awareness for environmental issues and engage with 
 
 conservation education.
