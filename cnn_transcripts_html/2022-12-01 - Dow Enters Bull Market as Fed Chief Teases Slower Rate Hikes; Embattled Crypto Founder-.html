(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: That is the legendary Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. Sad that she's gone at the age of 79, but there will never be another. She was so talented. She was a singer, a song writer. 
 <br>[06:00:09]
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, ANCHOR: It's a huge loss for the group. 
 
LEMON: Don't you think? For the world. 
 
COLLINS: She was such a presence. Yes. Yes, for all of us. She was such a presence on stage. 
 
LEMON: You saw them in concert. 
 
COLLINS: I saw them in concert years ago in Washington. It was such a good concert. 
 
LEMON: Yes, I mean.
 
COLLINS: Amazing. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: You were just saying, it's a songwriter. And she's both. 
 
LEMON: People are talking about the singers, and the singers are great. But it's the songwriters who actually write the song. I mean, think about -- when you think about "I Will Always Love You," we love Whitney Houston. But Dolly Parton wrote that song. 
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
LEMON: When you think about all the things, even -- she wrote that. "Say You Love Me," "You Make Loving Fun," "Hold Me," "Don't Stop." HARLOW: "Little Lies". 
 
LEMON: All that. "Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies."
 
We'll honor that. So we're going to honor her and talk about her, because there will never be another. 
 
Good morning, everyone. We're just reminiscing about Christine McVie. We'll get to that in a moment. It's the first day of December. Can you believe it? 
 
HARLOW: Is it? 
 
LEMON: Yes. It is! So here's the thing. Poppy is all excited about this. Or should -- well --
 
HARLOW: Excited? Depressed. 
 
LEMON: Poppy has all the inside information on this story, I should say. We're talking about broke former billionaire. What the former FTX CEO is blaming for the collapse of his business empire and how much money he claims is left in his bank account. You're going to want to hear this. 
 
HARLOW: We're also going to explain why it matters to you, right? Average folks, everyone across America. 
 
Also, the markets surging after the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, said smaller rate hikes are likely coming this month. Does this mean we are turning the corner on inflation? 
 
COLLINS: And welcome to Boston. Fans at the Celtics game chanting "USA" as the Prince and Princess of Wales, as you see them there, sat courtside. This is their first trip in eight years. We'll tell you why they're here and where they're going next on their trip in the United States. 
 
LEMON: Yes. Well, it's Boston, so they should have expected that. Because we know what Boston is like. They tell you exactly how they feel. 
 
This is where we're going to start with, though, because this is really, really important to you. Smaller rate hikes could be on the way. That announcement from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. 
 
Turning a sharp rise in the Dow and the S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ, not to mention all of those 401(k)s. Powell suggesting it may be time for the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in its fight against inflation. I want you to listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: It makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down. 
 
The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: So we're going to get in on all of this. There she is. What it means for you and your bottom line and all of that. Joining us now is CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon.
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, guys.
 
LEMON: Good morning to you. Poppy, take it away. This is your -- your ballgame.
 
HARLOW: It was good to hear him say that, I think, for -- just in terms of an indication that maybe we're getting a handle on inflation. But what does it mean for everyone watching at home? 
 
SOLOMON: Yes, I think it was great news for investors. This is the sign that they have been waiting for, finally, some smaller rate hikes after, what six meetings straight of rate hikes. And the last four, by the way, were pretty massive. 
 
So what it means for people at home is you're probably not going to see your credit card rate go down, but maybe it won't continue to go up as much. And indirectly, it's good for all of us, because essentially, what Powell said is we know we have done a lot. We have raised hikes -- raised rates almost 4 percentage points since March. We're going to take a wait-and-see approach and just sort of see how this all is impacted and really felt in the real economy. And that should be a breath of relief for all of us. 
 
HARLOW: The question is why is he saying this now? Because people are watching closely to see what he did say. What's driving his remarks? 
 
SOLOMON: Well, I mean, I think an acknowledgement of reality, which is the fact that they have done a lot. I mean, they have raised rates more in  the last -- since March than -- you'd have to go back to, like, the early '70s, late '70s to see something similar. They have done a massive amount. 
 
So put it this way. Let's say your auto loan rate was, like, 5 percent in March. They've raised rates 4 percent since then. So suddenly now, you have an auto rate of 9 percent in just that short period of time. 
 
Now, interest rates aren't one-to-one with what Powell does, but what I'm saying is they have done so much in a very short period of time. 
 
So to your point, why he's doing it now is because they have to wait and see. They have to see how this is being really felt in the economy, because there's a lag in terms of what they do and when it's really felt in the economy. 
 
LEMON: People at home don't know. Because they're like, wait -- 
 
HARLOW: I know. 
 
SOLOMON: I know. LEMON: They're saying how should I feel about this? What's the real story when it comes to the economy?
 
SOLOMON: Well, I mean, I don't know that there was a huge shift in narrative. Right? I mean, they're still raising rates. I mean, they're not cutting rates just yet, right? So all of the same concerns still exist. 
 
But I do think that it is a sign of relief for investors, economists all of us that Powell acknowledged. We know that there is a risk of doing too much and unnecessarily hurting the economy. 
 
And so, we're going to wait. We're going to see how this really plays out in the economy. We don't want to do more damage than is necessary. So they're going to sort of take a breather. 
 <br>[06:05:07]
 
LEMON: Thank you.
 
SOLOMON: We can all breathe a sigh of relief. 
 
LEMON: Yes. I'll be -- bring us out, really -- but you can't go anywhere. Because we're going to have you a little bit later on in the show. 
 
SOLOMON: OK.
 
LEMON: So thank you, Rahel Solomon. We really appreciate that. 
 
HARLOW: Also this morning, former FTX CEO, Samuel Bankman-Fried, who was once one of the richest people in the world, says he only has $100,000 left in his bank account. 
 
This is after his company plunged into bankruptcy, like, a few weeks ago. Just a few months ago, his wealth was estimated to be $26 billion. 
 
Let's bring in CNN chief business correspondent--
 
LEMON: Twenty-six billion dollars.
 
HARLOW: -- Christine Romans.
 
LEMON: And now $100,000. 
 
HARLOW: Yes. And that's the stunning headline. But that, I think, belies the point of -- the point of all of this is the huge risk of this unregulated crypto market for everyone. 
 
ROMANS: Yes. And this is something that was positioned as the entrance for real people into the crypto market, right? I'm not going to cry many tears about Sam Bankman-Fried and his on-paper $26 billion, but there could be real investors who have no idea how much they've lost and whether they'll be able to get it back. It's impossible to know how much he lost, but it's a remarkable
 
 picture of a crypto empire with no oversight, no transparency, no CFO, no regulation, and its founder at times with no clue. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAMUEL BANKMAN-FRIEDMAN, FORMER FTX CEO: I mean, look, I've had a bad month. 
 
ROMANS (voice-over): Disgraced FTX founder and ex-CEO, Sam Bankman- Fried speaking out on camera for the first time since he resigned after the implosion of his multi-billion-dollar empire. 
 
BANKMAN-FRIED: I'm down to -- I think I have one working credit card left. I think it -- I think it might be $100,000 or something like that. 
 
ROMANS: Bankman-Fried, who was known as crypto's white knight, sitting for a wide-ranging interview at "The New York Times" Deal Book Summit, speaking about FTX's liquidity crisis and bankruptcy filing. 
 
BANKMAN-FRIEND: I ever didn't try to commit fraud on anyone. 
 
ROMANS: The collapse of FTX is under civil and federal investigations into whether FTX misappropriated customers' funds when it made loans to his hedge fund, Alameda Research. 
 
Bankman-Fried addressing this.
 
BANKMAN-FRIED: I didn't knowingly co-mingle funds. I was frankly surprised by how bi Alameda's position was.
 
ROMANS (voice-over): Bankman-Fried now acknowledging the lack of corporate controls and risk management within the businesses  he oversaw. 
 
BANKMAN-FRIED: Look, I screwed up. Like I was CEO. I was the CEO of FTX. And I mean, I'd say this again and again, that that means I had a responsibility. That means I was responsible, ultimately. 
 
There was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX. And that feels pretty embarrassing in retrospect. 
 
ROMANS (voice-over): FTX, which was once marketed as an easy way to get into crypto, using star athletes like Tom Brady, Naomi Osaka, and Steph Curry, and even a Super Bowl ad with Larry David to amplify the platform. 
 
LARRY DAVID, COMEDIAN/WRITER: Edison, can I be honest with you? It stinks. 
 
ROMANS (voice-over): Now, its customers don't know how much, if anything, they'll be able to get back. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) ROMANS: Yes. Just a shame. Marketing for Main Street right there in those Super Bowl ads, right, trying to become as common as buying an index fund. 
 
It is not an index fund. It is not a plain vanilla regulated bank account or investment. And it's going to be a cold, cold hard truth that a lot of people will face on this. 
 
COLLINS: And I think what Andrew Ross Sorkin did so well in that interview, was he talked about the effect. He said he had gotten thousands of letters from people, saying, I put $2 million into this. That was my life savings. 
 
HARLOW: Andrew did an amazing job -- 
 
ROMANS: He did.
 
HARLOW: -- in that. It was a conversation. And to see a CEO, ever, have you ever seen -- 
 
ROMANS: No. I'm sure his lawyers are saying, do not -- shut your mouth. I mean, he's making these admissions. And he -- at one point he said he thinks that people might be able to get some of their money back in the U.S. and Japan.
 
HARLOW: Yes. 
 
ROMANS: But gave no indication about how.
 
LEMON: His lawyers are saying, Shut your mouth; don't talk. 
 
ROMANS: Any lawyer would tell.
 
COLLINS: He said that.
 
ROMANS: I'm not a lawyer. Any lawyer would say stop talking. We have a lot of litigation to go through here. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Christine.
 
COLLINS: All right. Also this morning, Congress is one step closer to potentially averting a rail strike. That's that rail strike that President Biden warned just a few days ago would devastate the United States economy. 
 
He said it could cost an estimated $2 billion per day. The House overwhelmingly passing legislation that would -- that would basically give the deal both sides -- it would adopt the deal that was reached by both sides back in September. 
 
Lawmakers also passing a measure that provides 7 days of additional paid sick leave to workers. The question is whether or not the Senate is going to pass that. They will need the support of at least 10 Republicans in that 50/50 Senate to get that passed. 
 
Also this morning, Democrats are calling in their closer when it comes to Georgia. Former President Obama is going to be there campaigning today for Senator Raphael Warnock. 
 
Obama is already headlining Warnock's closing ad campaign ahead of Tuesday's runoff against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. 
 <br>[06:10:03]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Georgia, serious times call for special leaders. Leaders you can trust. Leaders who are driven by something bigger than politics. That's why you need to reelect my friend and your senator, Reverend Raphael Warnock. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: The question is whether or not that message is appealing to voters. CNN's Eva McKend is live on the ground in Atlanta. 
 
You have been following this race incredibly closely. What are you hearing from voters? Because over a million of them have already voted in these early days of voting. 
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Kaitlan. 
 
I want to begin with the Obama visit, because when he was here just about a month ago. It was the most fired up that I have seen Georgia Democrats. He was over in College Park. The line stretched around the arena. 
 
And when you talk about runoff elections, it is principally a runoff game. Which side can turn out the most voters. It makes a lot of sense for him -- for them, the campaign to be calling him back here to really energize the Democratic base. 
 
I would imagine we are going to hear from him a lot of what he said just four weeks ago, when he essentially argued that Herschel Walker was a great football player, but not in a position to serve in the United States Senate -- Kaitlan. 
 
COLLINS: And so when it comes to the voters, you know, there are those 200,000 voters who did vote for the Republican governor just a few weeks ago but did not vote for the Republican Senate candidate. I know that they've been trying to appeal for them. Is Herschel Walker out on the road? What is his schedule looking like in these last few days? 
 
MCKEND: Both of the candidates have very busy schedules. And you are right: both sides trying to capture those moderate voters. 
 
As I've been out on the trail, though, speaking to people, I was at a Latinos for Warnock event last night, talking about star power with Obama. Tessa Thompson and America Ferrera were there.
 
But as I was speaking to voters, it seems as though both sides really have their minds made up. One woman told me that she is actually more progressive than Senator Warnock but supports him and believes he does a good job of appealing to moderates in this Southern state. Meanwhile, Herschel Walker supporters tell me that they think that the
 
 national media underestimates him and that the national media also underestimates the ground game that Republicans have in this state. Take a listen to what I'm hearing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LISA BELL, GEORGIA VOTER: Being out here to see Senator Warnock and having him kind of be part of the voice that we -- we've been wanting for so long here in Atlanta. 
 
PAULA SENN, GEORGIA VOTER: When Herschel decided to run for Senate, it was a no-brainer for us. We don't know his opponent, but we do know Herschel. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND: So there are two days left of early voting in this state. Today and tomorrow. And then, of course, folks can vote on election day, on December 6th -- Kaitlan. 
 
COLLINS: And everyone is looking to see what will happen on Tuesday, 50 or 51 seats for Democrats. So thanks so much, Eva. 
 
And just ahead, I also spoke with Georgia voters this week. We'll tell you what they said was their top priority as they were going and voting early. 
 
Also, this this morning. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIMMY FALLON, LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Prince William and Kate Middleton arrived in Boston for their first trip to the U.S. in nearly ten years. And this Is nice. This was nice. They met with Boston royalty, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: Well, the Prince and Princess of Wales really are waking up in Boston this morning. 
 
The royal couple sat courtside last night to watch the Celtics take on the Miami Heat. William and Kate were spotted clapping and cheering the players on throughout the game. 
 
It is their first trip abroad since the death of Queen Elizabeth. Tomorrow, William and Kate will hand out awards for their Earth Shot Prize. 
 
While in the states, the White House says that they will also meet with President Biden. 
 
We're going straight now -- Max Foster is live for us in Boston on this side of the pond this morning. Max, controversy following the couple across the ocean. Good morning to you. MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's been really
 
 -- Don, it's been one thing after another. They had this racism scandal back kin the U.K. just breaking as they landed.
 
Then they went to their first ceremony, and it was pouring with rain. And the other special guests, John Kerry and Caroline Kennedy, couldn't make it to that. 
 
Then they turn up to the game last night. I was there. But just after the booing that you heard there. But there was booing, and there were chants of "USA, USA!" 
 
But by the time I arrived and was asking people about it, I think it had more to do with, you know, that Boston sense that they are the cradle of the American Revolution, the Boston Tea Party. It was a really spirited event.
 
So I'm not sure that was personal. But it does seem to be one thing after another for this couple during this tour. But of course, everyone is hearing about it. Lots of publicity around the event, as well. 
 
LEMON: Yes. So let's talk about this. You said the controversy followed. There's an honorary member of the British royal family has resigned and apologized after questioning whether a black British woman was really British at a royal event earlier this week. What can you tell us about that? 
 <br>[06:15:05]
 
FOSTER: Well, that woman has been on British radio this morning doubling down on exactly what happened. And it's, you know, really hard to read the transcript of the conversation, where this senior royal aide, you know, really central part of the Buckingham Palace machinery for decades, was grilling her. 
 
And she says she felt interrogated and she felt it was an abuse. She kept on saying she was British, but this aide kept on asking where she was from, where in Africa she was from, where her people were from, when she arrived in the U.K. I mean, it was a really offensive conversation.
 
The palace did recognize it straight away. She has stepped down. There's an investigation ongoing. And Prince Williams' team had to address it here, saying there's no place for racism in society. 
 
LEMON: Yes. I mean, we were reading that, Poppy, that transcript. I wasn't sure it was real. 
 
HARLOW: I couldn't believe it. It kept going and going and going. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: After she said, "I'm a British national," you know, it was just like --
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: -- really surprising. 
 
Thank you, Max.
 
LEMON: All right, Max. Thank you very much. Enjoy being on this side. It's good to see you. 
 
Just ahead, we're going to talk about, just declassified, new documents revealing how President Biden passed the buck when he was warned about an imminent al Qaeda attack before 9/11. 
 
Plus this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTINE MCVIE, SINGER (singing): And the song birds are singing, like they know the score.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HARLOW: She was a legend. Looking back on the life and career of Fleetwood Mac's songbird, Christine McVie, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC: FLEETWOOD MAC, "LITTLE LIES")
 
HARLOW: Christine McVie, the singer/songwriter behind some of Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits, has died. Her family confirmed the sad news on her verified Instagram. And they wrote in part, quote, "She passed away peacefully at a hospital following a short illness. She was in the company of her family." 
 
Of course, her band members paid her tribute, calling her "one-of-a- kind, special and talented beyond measure," adding, "She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life. We were so lucky to have had a life with her." 
 
The prolific musician is known for hits like "Songbird" from Fleetwood Mac's groundbreaking album "Rumors," one of the best-selling albums of all time. 
 
(MUSIC: FLEETWOOD MAC, "SONGBIRD")
 
HARLOW: She also wrote "Don't Stop," which gained a second round of popularity when Bill Clinton used it as his campaign song. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(MUSIC: FLEETWOOD MAC, "DON'T STOP")
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: And there we see McVie and the band members performed at Clinton's inauguration in '93. It is something that McVie said she never expected for the song that inspired people for decades. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCVIE: I think the words are sort of very adaptable to a million different circumstances. I mean, I for one, visualize it more being used for a sort of insurance company or something more than a sort of political campaign song.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HARLOW: Bill Clinton also put out a statement, thanking them for letting him use it and what a pleasure it was to know them. 
 
She was just 79 years old, and her death comes in a year when the world has lost a host of other treasured musicians, from Naomi Judd, to the Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins, Meatloaf, Ronnie Spector of the Ronettes, Jerry Lee Lewis, Loretta Lynn, Olivia Newton-John, Coolio and just a few days ago, "Fame's" Irene Cara. 
 
So let's talk about the life, the woman, all the talent. With us now is senior music writer for "Rolling Stone," Brittany Spanos. 
 
Brittany, thank you for being here. 
 
BRITTANY SPANOS, SENIOR MUSIC WRITER, "ROLLING STONE": Thank you so much for having me.
 
LEMON: Aww. 
 
HARLOW: What a woman.
 
SPANOS: Yes. I'm a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, so this was really devastating to find out the news yesterday. So --
 
LEMON: There will never be -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
 
COLLINS: Oh, no. Go.
 
LEMON: This sort of era of band and songwriter, even the type of people that they were, no -- it's -- it's over. She was a legend, and I just think that this -- it's -- I can't even explain the loss at this point. 
 
SPANOS: Yes, I mean, looking back on just the trajectory of her career, I mean, she was a blues musician for many years with Chicken Shack, and then Fleetwood Mac's early years. 
 
And for her to sort of transition from that into one of the greatest pop songwriters, pop melody writers in music history is really incredible. I mean, to think about what she did in the '70s with "Rumors," to make some of the best love songs on a -- on a massive breakup album and to then kind of transit that to synth pop in the '80s and continue to keep Fleetwood Mac at their height for decades is really incredible. 
 
COLLINS: Yes. And even still, seeing them perform in recent years. They were still just amazing. 
 
Is there a back story to the Clinton song there? Because that is such a -- that's, like, indelible. It's what people always think of in a moment like this.
 
SPANOS: I mean, that was a reunion that Fleetwood Mac wasn't expecting to do at that point. They'd broken up in 1987. They had a very tumultuous breakup. Like everything else in the band, there was a lot of drama. And they were not anticipating getting back together. 
 
And so for that to happen and for it to be this moment of hope for a lot of people, the song is a very optimistic song. Again, on a very messy breakup album. 
 
And for that song to have that second life, this political life for it, was really extraordinary and brought the band back together for -- for a brief moment. Then they kind of went their separate ways again. And then later in the '90s were, like, OK, we're doing this for real. 
 
HARLOW: I loved them. One of the things that was written in obituary in  "The New York Times" last night, they wrote, "Her soulful -- soulful contralto could sound by turns maternally wise and sexually alive."
 <br>[06:25:05]
 
SPANOS: Yes. 
 
LEMON: That is a sentence. 
 
HARLOW: That is a sentence, right. It was just so rare. 
 
SPANOS: Yes, I mean, especially with two other lead singers in the band, which again, is the most incredible part of Fleetwood Mac. You have three of the best songwriters in rock and pop history. You have three of the great vocalists in rock and pop history, all together in one band, doing you know, equal parts on all these albums. 
 
And Christine's voice was just, like, so tender and so soft, and the way that she sang was so different from Stevie kind of having this, like, bewitching, bellowing sound to her, and Lindsey being a little bit more aggressive, a little bit more avant-garde in his songwriting. 
 
And she was sort of like the kind of beating heart of the band. She was very controlled in the way that she sang. 
 
HARLOW: I think we have the statement, if we can pull it up, of what Stevie Nicks said. 
 
COLLINS: Yes. Their relationship was amazing. 
 
HARLOW: Let's talk about, if we can pull it up. Let's talk about what was their relationship like? 
 
SPANOS: They were best friends. I mean, especially with women in music. They want to pit women against each other and make it a competition. For two women to be equal parts lead singers in a band together, they looked at each other as them against the world. Like, they were together against the forces of this male-dominated industry. And they wanted to help each other. They loved each other. 
 
Stevie wrote "Sisters of the Moon" about their relationship. And she just really -- they always had the kindest, most beautiful things to say about each other. And just there was a genuine love, no competition. No sort of sense of --
 
HARLOW: Which is rare. 
 
SPANOS: Yes, yes.
 
LEMON: That is so Stevie Nicks, to --
 
COLLINS: To write the letter.
 
LEMON: -- to handwrite the letter in cursive, her tribute to her friend. 
 
SPANOS: It's like how else would she do it?
 
LEMON: Can we give a shout-out, though, to the songwriters?
 
SPANOS: Yes.
 
LEMON: I mean, people -- you know, the singers, right, often get all the fame. But it's the people who write the songs. You may not recognize the title of the songs --
 
SPANOS: Yes.
 
LEMON: -- but when it comes on the radio, if they play it, you will be humming it, because you know it. That is -- that speaks to the importance of a great songwriter. 
 
SPANOS: Yes. And Christine was a little bit more private. She had semi-retired in the late '90s for a little. So she wasn't touring with Fleetwood Mac for several years. And has always kept her life kind of away from the spotlight in ways that Stevie and Lindsey have sort of been very active and been sort of continuing their drama for many years. 
 
But Christine sort of stepped away from a lot of it for a while. So people forget that there are so many of these songs that have continued to be a big part of their legacy, that she wrote and continue to be some of the biggest hits that Fleetwood Mac ever had. 
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
HARLOW: We're grateful for her. 
 
LEMON: Real quick, we don't know the cause yet. They haven't released it?
 
SPANOS: There's no cause of death that I've seen. It said a short illness. So -- 
 
COLLINS: She said she was in bad health in recent years.
 
SPANOS: Yews. Stevie said she had found out on Saturday. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Brittany.
 
SPANOS: Yes. Thank you.
 
HARLOW: We appreciate it. 
 
LEMON: Thanks so much.
 
COLLINS: What an impact. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: All right. Also this morning, former President George W. Bush is denying there was any kind of intelligence of a domestic terror threat ahead of the 9/11 attacks. We have the newly-declassified report. That's next. 
 
LEMON: Plus this. This is very interesting. LeBron James is now questioning reporters about why he has not been asked to react to a racially-offensive photo of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after getting inundated with questions about Kyrie Irving. We'll tell you what's behind all of this, straight ahead. 
 
COLLINS: That was great.
 
HARLOW: Thank you. Great to meet you.
 
COLLINS: Thanks for getting up way early to come in.
