ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Abu Dhabi, this is CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: And this is the second hour of the show. Hello and welcome. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the 
 
 time is 7:00 in the evening.
 
Ousted Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad is speaking out a statement posted to his Telegram account could be his first comments since fleeing Syria.
 
Meanwhile, Cyclone Chido hits the French territory of Mayotte, leaving at least 11 dead. Residents describing the damage as if an atomic bomb fell on 
 
 the islands.
 
 -- statement purportedly from Bashar al-Assad, says his sudden departure from Syria was unplanned, and he says, purportedly, not his idea.
 
The statement was posted to the Syrian presidency's account on Telegram, which has been disabled and then restored since the rebel takeover.
 
In it, Assad, purportedly says he stayed in Damascus, "carrying out his duties until the early hours of Sunday, December the 8th." Well, after 
 
 rebel swept into the capital, the statement goes on to say, he left the country until late that same day when Russia made the decision to evacuate 
 
 him from its coastal Air Base in Syria.
 
Well, our international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson joining me now.
 
Look, in this statement, Assad, and we have to assume it is him, but we are saying purportedly, because we don't know for sure.
 
But in it, he writes, "At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge. The only cause of action was to continue 
 
 fighting against the terrorist onslaught."
 
Nic, what can we learn about the final hours of Assad's dictatorship from this statement?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, I think, some of it certainly smacks us face-saving that, you know, by -- he did had -- this 
 
 came without planning, and no point did he plan to actually sort of step down.
 
His account, for example, of what happened those hours when he was fleeing his residence, that was late Saturday evening, and then flying early Sunday 
 
 morning to the coast of Syria to that -- getting to that Russian air base, and then being flown by the Russians later in the day, because he says that 
 
 the Syrian Army's forces had collapsed.
 
Some of that just doesn't seem to gel with what sources were telling us, and we were reporting that Saturday night, that Assad had fled his 
 
 residences at some point during Saturday, and we were reporting this late Saturday evening before we, you know, as we were learning a few hours later 
 
 that the defenses, the military, had collapsed in Damascus. And that, that seems to be the time when Assad is actually flying to -- out of Damascus 
 
 and to safety.
 
And he is saying, until the early hours of Sunday morning he was doing his duties. He'd already fled his residence. He was apparently at the military 
 
 airport in Damascus, waiting for the flight that would take him to safety.
 
So, some of this really doesn't gel. And then, this notion that he is flown to Russia, but is not asking for this. This flies in the face of what the 
 
 Russians have actually said, that they had agreed to give him humanitarian refuge there in Russia.
 
It really feels like face-saving. And I think some of his lines at the end where he's essentially alluding to, you know, he had no meaningful role 
 
 there, because the terrorists have taken over.
 
But beyond that, he is speaking about he hopes that Syria will again be free and independent. I mean, what is he referring to? Does he think that 
 
 he's going to come back and somehow rid the country of its new leadership?
 
That's completely and wholly unrealistic, and there are certainly those in Russia and other places who would say that throughout the war, the 14-year 
 
 civil war, Assad was not making the best and most informed judgments and decisions, thinking that he could hold out.
 
Is he thinking he can come back? Obviously, no one in their right mind believes that.
 <br>[10:05:04]
 
ANDERSON: And he is being given asylum in Russia on humanitarian grounds, according to Moscow.
 
On the ground in Syria, the U.N. envoy has suggested that sanctions should be lifted on what is this new interim Syrian leadership. There are concerns 
 
 by the U.S. and the E.U., of course, given the past affiliations of Jolani and the HTS, who are at present, leading this infrastructure on the ground.
 
Sanctions are extremely important as we look to where Syria goes in the future.
 
What chance the lifting of the sanctions at this point, which are so important in rebuilding Syria, of course?
 
ROBERTSON: Yes, it's the messaging around it. Isn't it? It's the messaging that we're hearing from the E.U. and the United States that there is the 
 
 possibility of lifting sanctions. But this has to be done when actions on the ground match what HTS and the interim leadership is saying about a 
 
 transition towards, you know -- a transition to a more democratic future for the country.
 
And, you know, the E.U. is being cautious on this at the moment. Foreign ministers of the European Union a meeting with the E.U.'s high 
 
 representative on foreign affairs, Kaja Kallas.
 
And they are saying very clearly that they need, you know, the leadership in Syria to understand that what happens and how they are treated by the 
 
 international community, depends on this transition to a democratic future that is being talked about.
 
You know, what the U.N. representative was saying was, there is a need, there is a real humanitarian need to get some level of support and aid 
 
 flowing into the country that it requires these U.N. resolutions to be -- to be changed, you know, and reframed at the moment, to get that aid in.
 
And that's -- it's a delicate position, and there's a real possibility that if it's held back too much, then HTS may decide to regress.
 
I think -- I think the analysis at the moment is they are still heading in the right direction.
 
ANDERSON: Nic Robertson's on the story for you, and more on Syria, of course, as we get it.
 
Well, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expected to hold a news conference from Mar-a-Lago next hour with the CEO of SoftBank. Now, sources say the 
 
 SoftBank chief will announce a $100 billion investment in the U.S.
 
The goal? tens of thousands of jobs focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure.
 
Now, CNN Steve Contorno joining us, live from West Palm Beach in Florida. So, first, what more do we know about the details of what is on the face of 
 
 it, a huge investment by the billionaire investor.
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Yes, this Japanese company has made similar promises in the past. In fact, right after Donald Trump was elected in 
 
 2016, SoftBank promised $50 billion worth of investment into the U.S. economy.
 
But look, Donald Trump has put an emphasis on trying to attract domestic investments and domestic production throughout his campaign, and this is 
 
 certainly a showy early sign of how he can curry favor with CEOs and try to get that repatriation of U.S. product and production and manufacturing here 
 
 in the United States.
 
And Trump has already promised that companies that put a billion-dollars- worth of investment into the U.S. will have their permitting processes streamlined, including potentially environmental permitting.
 
Now, obviously, Congress could have some say on that, and there will be some regulatory hurdles, and Donald Trump can't just snap his fingers and 
 
 make decades worth of regulation go away, but this is going to be a focal point of his administration, making it easier and less burdensome for 
 
 companies to manufacture and invest in the U.S. economy.
 
The flip side of that opponents would say is that we need regulation in place to make sure that these companies are not wreaking havoc on the 
 
 environment, and polluting, and that their products are safe and not poisoning Americans.
 
And so, there will be an interesting balance to see between Congress, the regulatory agencies and the Trump administration over how to balance this. 
 
 But right now, Trump is celebrating this early investment, and we will see him just behind me across the water in Mar-a-Lago in about an hour, where 
 
 he intends to make this announcement and address the media there.
 
ANDERSON: And when we talk about AI and related Infrastructure, is it clear very specifically, what this fund will be invested in?
 <br>[10:10:09]
 
CONTORNO: It's not. But look, there has been a tremendous amount of emphasis by Donald Trump and many of his key allies on artificial 
 
 intelligence going forward.
 
Obviously, Elon Musk is someone who is heavily involved in artificial intelligence. But we also just saw the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, donate a 
 
 million dollars to Donald Trump's inauguration fund.
 
So, these A.I. companies have been promising that they can help the U.S. be at the forefront of this industry, and Donald Trump says that he wants to 
 
 work hand in hand with them to ensure this technology is homegrown and not being losing a race to China or other potential adversaries as we get into 
 
 the forefront of the A.I. future.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, fascinating. Good to have you, Steve. Thank you very much. Indeed, an important story.
 
Still to come, eyes on the sky. More mysterious drone sightings, this time forcing a critical U.S. base to close its airspace.
 
Plus, forget glamorous locations. This unassuming building is linked to what Israel says is a major Iranian spiring. Our report on that is just 
 
 ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, a mystery in the sky, and concern and anger on the ground today. There is growing frustration with the U.S. government and the lack 
 
 of answers over a rash of suspected drone sightings.
 
Now, the latest of these sightings was in Ohio, where drone activity forced what is known as Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to close its airspace for 
 
 several hours over the weekend.
 
Federal officials so far downplayed many of the reported sightings, saying that they are likely small airplanes or other manned aircraft.
 
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, trying to reassure the public, saying over the weekend, his agency knows of no threat and this is 
 
 not nefarious activity.
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval is following the story, joins us live from New York.
 
This has been going on now for some time. CNN has learned that the House Intelligence Committee is expected to receive a classified briefing about 
 
 these drones on Tuesday. So, what do we understand to be happening here? And second question now, how and why is it taking them so long to 
 
 investigate?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Becky, the first reported sightings, according to New Jersey's governor, happened four weeks ago 
 
 today. So, you think about that nearly a month later, and those questions still remain. So, it certainly, all eyes will be on that Homeland Security 
 
 Committee briefing come tomorrow.
 <br>[10:15:03]
 
Though it's confidential, we certainly hope to learn something about what these things in the sky are. Now, to be clear, the U.S. federal government 
 
 knows and has recognized, they believe that many of them are, in fact, airplanes, regular air traffic.
 
But as we heard from the DHS Secretary, as you mentioned just a short while ago over the weekend, is that the U.S. government also recognizes and 
 
 acknowledges that some of these are, in fact, drones, and they cannot explain them.
 
And that really begs some really important questions here, as laid out by Senator Richard Blumenthal, who represents Connecticut, one of the states 
 
 that has seen some of these possible drones flying overhead.
 
As a senator asks, here we are a month later, is it that the U.S. government is not sharing everything it knows, or does it not know 
 
 everything that it should?
 
And what you hear from the people as we have for the last several weeks now, especially New Jersey residents, say, well, really, they are wondering 
 
 what's worse.
 
And so, I think you certainly are seeing those frustrations and a sense of disbelief that here we are, this much time later, and still those questions 
 
 remain.
 
But we're also seeing real world implications and delays, for example, you mentioned Wright-Patterson Air Force Base facility in southwest Ohio, a 
 
 critical base for the U.S. Air Force, having to essentially halt some of their air traffic temporarily as they investigated some unauthorized drone 
 
 flights.
 
And we should mention that the leadership at that base was eventually able to determine that none of these incursions had any impact. But also, this 
 
 weekend, two people were arrested for flying a drone dangerously close to Boston Logan International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the 
 
 country.
 
So, that's certainly telling about the disruptive potential about this, and that's without even discussing this sort of -- some of these false reports 
 
 that have also been called into authorities when, in some cases, is an airplane, or, as federal authorities said, in some cases, even a star.
 
But again, to be very clear, DHS officials and the FBI, two federal agencies leading the way in terms of investigating this have confirmed that 
 
 many of these sightings are, in fact, drones that they can't explain.
 
ANDERSON: Understood. Good to have you, Polo. Thank you.
 
SANDOVAL: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Well, Israeli authorities say an unprecedented number of Israelis have been spying for Iran. Dozens have been arrested over the past year, 
 
 accused of carrying up missions like photographing military bases and even plotting government assassination.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports on the fallout, following the arrest of an alleged cell leader.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In this low income building in the city of Haifa, Apartment Five, looks just as ordinary as every 
 
 other, until you notice the spot where police broke in.
 
Israeli authorities say the man who lived here, Azis Nisanov, was the leader of a group of Iranian spies.
 
LEONID GORBACHOVSKY, NEIGHBOR (through translator): I wasn't surprised, I was shocked. It was like thunder amid clear skies.
 
DIAMOND (voice over): His next-door neighbor, Leonid Gorbachovsky, was home when police pried the door open with a metal bar. He says they turned the 
 
 place inside out and found piles of cash.
 
Israeli police say Nisanov led a seven-person cell of Israelis who gathered intelligence for Iran for more than two years and are now awaiting trial. 
 
 And the Haifa 7 are allegedly just one cell.
 
Israeli authorities say they have uncovered multiple spy rings in recent months.
 
SUPERINTENDENT MAOR GOREN, ISRAELI POLICE: If you go check the last year and the last decades, we can count on two hands How many people got 
 
 arrested for this. The last six months we have over 30 Israeli citizens that got arrested.
 
DIAMOND: So that's unprecedented.
 
GOREN: Yes. Of course.
 
DIAMOND (voice over): Superintendent Maor Goren, who oversaw the investigations, says the arrests foiled multiple assassination plots as 
 
 well as ongoing intelligence gathering efforts.
 
DIAMOND: While some of these alleged Iranian spies were accused of plotting to kill senior Israeli officials, others had a different task, 
 
 photographing Israeli military bases like the Nevatim Airbase right behind me.
 
An Israeli officials say those photographs that information actually helped the Iranians carry out those ballistic missile attacks in April, as well as 
 
 in October.
 
DIAMOND (voice over): Missiles struck Nevatim Airbase in both of those attacks. And while the base's location is known to Iran, police believe 
 
 zoomed-in photos and videos provided additional targeting intelligence.
 
GOREN: Some of them got recruited by the Iranians by using the social media.
 
DIAMOND (voice over): Many of those Telegram messages provided by Israels Shin Bet security service are wildly unsophisticated. Spam-style messages 
 
 offering interesting and exciting jobs that pay a very high salary.
 
In one series of messages provided by the Israeli police, an alleged Iranian handler writes "We just need brave men. Are you brave for a lot of 
 
 money?" before tasking their mark with buying gasoline and setting off forest fires.
 <br>[10:20:13]
 
ODED ALLAM, FORMER MOSSAD OFFICIAL: It worked, and based on the theory of the big numbers.
 
DIAMOND: Oded Allam, a former top Mossad official, says Iran is more interested in casting a wide net than in recruiting skilled operatives.
 
ALLAM: And they said to themselves, ok, if we fail here, we'll go to the next one. And they don't really care of the outcome.
 
DIAMOND (voice over): Unlike previous Iranian intelligence efforts in Israel, which have largely involved Palestinian recruits, the majority of 
 
 those arrested in the last year have been Jewish Israelis, many of them new immigrants, according to the police.
 
They were also often poor or had criminal histories. People like Slava Guschin, who lived in this apartment and was allegedly part of the Haifa 
 
 cell.
 
For neighbors like Riki and Moshe, who saw him struggling and had given him food and clothes -- 
 
RIKI, NEIGHBOR: Shock, shock.
 
MOSHE, NEIGHBOR (through translator): No one could believe it. People here that know him, that also brought him food and everything. They want to kill 
 
 him.
 
DIAMOND (voice over): A sense of betrayal for the accused spy next door.
 
DIAMOND: And Iran did not return a request for comment about the spying allegations. As for Azis Nisanov, the alleged leader of the Haifa 7, I 
 
 spoke to his attorney, who did not deny that Nisanov photographed these military bases, but said he did not know that he was working for Iran.
 
He said that his motives were purely financial and that he did not believe he was harming Israel's security.
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, still come a ticking clock for TikTok. We look at the final attempts to save the platform before the U.S. bans it, next month. More on 
 
 that is coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. Time here in Abu Dhabi, 24 minutes past 7:00 in the evening.
 
Catastrophic and apocalyptic words being used today to describe the devastation in Mayotte after Cyclone Chido tore through the French 
 
 archipelago in the Indian Ocean.
 
Now, the destruction is immense. The Category 4 storm slammed Mayotte's two main islands with winds topping 220 kilometers an hour. While 11 people are 
 
 currently confirmed dead, local officials believe the actual death toll will reach the hundreds or even the 1000s.
 <br>[10:25:04]
 
CNN's Jim Bittermann filed this report.
 
JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Officials are still trying to figure out exactly on what extent the island has been damaged. 
 
 It's obviously it's a catastrophe.
 
One of the hotel owners on the island said it was like an atomic bomb that hit. And he said his hotel has been completely destroyed. Other officials 
 
 on the islands reflect that comment exactly and point out the fact that the communications have been lost. The electricity is down. It's quite a -- 
 
 quite a bit of damage to an island that's very remote. This island is off the coast of Africa, between Africa and Madagascar.
 
And about 900 miles from the closest French possession, next French possession, which is Reunion, the French officials have set up an aerial 
 
 bridge now, trying to commute in aid and resources as much as possible.
 
They have already committed about 1600 gendarmes, and there's another 800 rescue workers on their way, and President Macron says he is going to 
 
 convene a crisis meeting this evening at the interior minister. But it's quite a disaster, and it will probably be some time before we know exactly 
 
 how bad it is.
 
Jim Bittermann, CNN, Jill (PH), France.
 
ANDERSON: Well, the deadline for an American ban on TikTok is fast approaching.
 
The popular video sharing app has been in an ongoing battle with the United States and faces a countrywide ban on January the 19th, 2025, that date is 
 
 just a day before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
 
Meantime, TikTok says it has plans for another appeal.
 
Let's get you back up to date here. CNN Business writer Clare Duffy is in New York.
 
So, what will TikTok's next appeal look like? Let's just start there.
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Yes, Becky. So, we are expecting tick tock is going to appeal to the Supreme Court. They potentially could also 
 
 ask the Supreme Court to stay this law, to pause the law while it has a chance to review this block, this request from TikTok.
 
But, look, I think we will see sort of an expedited movement from the Supreme Court on this. The D.C. Circuit Court ruling was expedited because 
 
 this deadline is coming up. And so, experts do expect that the Supreme Court will take this up fairly quickly, because it's an interesting case. 
 
 It's balancing the free speech considerations of 170 million Americans who use this platform with these national security concerns.
 
So, we do expect the day that TikTok is going to appeal to the Supreme Court, and that we're likely to see the Supreme Court take this up fairly 
 
 quickly.
 
ANDERSON: Donald Trump has done a 180 on TikTok. He wanted it banned when he was first in office. What's his position now?
 
DUFFY: So, he is now saying that he does not want TikTok to be banned, that he wants to save TikTok. It's not clear that he is going to be able to do 
 
 anything about this, because this deadline for a sale or a ban is the day before his inauguration.
 
Experts tell me that there are a couple of things he could potentially do. He could ask Congress to repeal the law, although that's sort of unlikely, 
 
 given that they just passed it back in April.
 
He could also essentially say that TikTok is no longer subject to the -- to the law. The law has the sort of loophole that gives the president the 
 
 ability to say whether a sale of qualified divestiture has taken place, and so experts think he could potentially say TikTok is -- has been sold. It's 
 
 no longer subject to the law, even if that hasn't really happened and it would be difficult to challenge in Court.
 
The final option for him is he could direct his attorney general not to enforce the law, they could signal to the app stores that they won't be 
 
 punished, they won't be fined if they continue to host TikTok.
 
But if you're in the General Counsel of Apple or Google, he might not feel so comfortable continuing to break this law, even if President Trump says 
 
 that you won't be fined.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, a lot going on there. It's good to have you. Thank you.
 
Well, the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO in the states has sparked a national conversation about the U.S. health care system and outrage is 
 
 growing. Some people even defending the man accused of killing Brian Thompson.
 
CNN's Brian Todd has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Along a Seattle area highway, a digital sign says, "One less CEO," then, "Many more to go."
 
In New York City, posters were put up, praising the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, with a red X across his picture. Other 
 
 posters singled out another executive.
 
In Florida, police say a woman who was on the phone talking with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, about recently denied medical claims said to the 
 
 representative, "Delay, deny, depose. You people are next." Those words were written on the shell casings found at the scene of Brian Thompson's 
 
 murder. The woman has been charged with threats to conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism.
 
TAMI LUHBY, CNN SENIOR WRITER, HEALTH POLICY: What we are seeing has been unleashed on social media and elsewhere, is just all of this pent-up anger 
 
 and frustration. I mean, we're talking about people's health. This is a life and death situation.
 <br>[10:30:00]
 
TODD (voice-over): The head of the healthcare conglomerate, Brian Thompson worked for, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty, tried to address some of 
 
 the growing frustration with an essay in the New York Times. 
 
He praised Thompson as a brilliant, kind man who was working to make health care better for everyone. And wrote, we know the health system does not 
 
 work as well as it should, and we understand people's frustrations with it. Our mission is to help make it work better. 
 
Witty said his company is willing to partner with anyone to deliver better care at lower costs, but acknowledged, "Clearly, we are not there yet."
 
Witty did little to appease thousands of people who replied to his op-ed with comments. One person writing, to think that the healthcare providers 
 
 do not also seek to maximize their profits is simply naive. Another saying, I don't know how he sleeps at night on his bed of blood and suffering.
 
KEVIN O'LEARY, "SHARK TANK" INVESTOR: At this point, social media is now the jury. And it doesn't like what it sees. So, if you're an executive, you 
 
 know, in interim management, United Health Corp or any other health company, you've got to read the room.
 
TODD (voice-over): UnitedHealth Group is a for profit company that reported over $100 billion in revenue in the third quarter of this year, and is the 
 
 largest provider of health insurance in the United States. It has been facing a class action lawsuit since before the Thompson shooting, accusing 
 
 one of its subsidiaries of using algorithms to deny care to seniors. United says that assertion is false, but the horror stories seemingly never end.
 
Arete Tsoukalas tells CNN she needed a specific drug to treat the leukemia she was diagnosed with. She said her insurer, one of the nation's largest, 
 
 refused to pay for the drug entirely at first, then said it would pay part of it, but she'd have to pay a $13,000 a month copay. Tsoukalas says she 
 
 went without the drug for three months, then got it with financial help from the drug manufacturer.
 
ARETE TSOUKALAS, LEUKEMIA PATIENT: No one should have to fight cancer and insurance at the same time. Some aspects of the cancer treatment felt a lot 
 
 easier to deal with than insurance. 
 
TODD: CNN's Tami Luhby says she spoke to several health policy experts who told her the most effective way to bring about real change in the industry 
 
 is if the current consumer outrage is sustained. She says they told her if that ever dies down, the insurers will have less incentive to make changes. 
 
Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

ANDERSON: Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. 
 
And Russia is preparing to send teams to deal with an oil spill in the Black Sea after two tankers were damaged and had to be abandoned in stormy 
 
 weather. That's according to the TASS news agency, which says the ships came to grief in the strait between the Russian mainland and annexed 
 
 Crimea. Well, reports say the crews have been evacuated from both ships. One person is known to have died.
 
Any minute now, we are expecting to get the result of a confidence vote called by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He is expected to lose the vote, 
 
 paving the way for elections in February. 
 
Last month, Germany's governing coalition collapsed after disagreements over the country's financial position prompted the Chancellor to sack his 
 
 finance minister.
 
The U.K. government has approved to take over a Royal Mail's parent company by a Czech billionaire. The deal is worth $4.5 billion and was agreed 
 
 earlier this year. 
 
However, it was called in for review under national security laws in the U.K., as the Royal Mail Postal Service is considered to be part of the 
 
 country's vital infrastructure. 
 
You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. Time here, just after half past 7:00 in the evening in Abu Dhabi broadcasting to you from 
 
 our Middle East programming hub. I'll be back with more news in just a moment. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:35:44]
 
ANDERSON: Global electricity demand is set to surge 70 percent by 2030, that is a massive challenge for nations trying to meet growing needs 
 
 sustainably. 
 
And the road ahead is far from smooth, as we know, in Europe, for example, power prices have soared as low wind generation forces a costly reliance on 
 
 fossil fuels. 
 
But even the UAE, the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant is offering solutions. Since opening in September, its four reactors have been producing enough 
 
 carbon free electricity to meet 25 percent of the UAE's needs. It's now this nation's largest source of clean power driving what is a bold energy 
 
 transformation. 
 
Well, I recently spoke with engineer Mohamed Al Hammadi about how Barakah is preparing for a cleaner tech driven future for the UAE and for the 
 
 world. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHAMED AL HAMMADI, MD AND CEO, EMIRATES NUCLEAR ENERGY COMPANY: In the UAE and COP28, COP in Dubai, we've seen a transformational change in the view 
 
 of toward nuclear. Over 31 nations, by the way, today, have signed the pledge to meet net zero by 2050 through tripling of nuclear.
 
ANDERSON: Are you finding reluctance from some countries to share nuclear energy technology?
 
AL HAMMADI: The use of civilian purposes of nuclear, there's a very clear system and clear regulation globally to maintain the use of this technology 
 
 for civilian purposes. 
 
And to give an example, in UAE today, we've -- we have the best model for other industries to adopt, and other countries to adopt, to be able to 
 
 develop civilian nuclear power plants and for peaceful purposes.
 
ANDERSON: Barakah was developed in partnership with South Korea. Of course, it was worth tens of billions of dollars. What plans stand to build a 
 
 second such plant here? What are the ambitions and who would you likely cooperate with? 
 
AL HAMMADI: So, the nuclear industry here in the UAE, and we do thank our partners from Korea who helped us in this journey, and the expansion and 
 
 demand for electrons from base load such as nuclear has grown remarkably, and we have seen a lot of demand in the UAE and outside UAE, specifically, 
 
 when it comes to around A.I., it's only the tip of the iceberg. 
 
The estimate by 2026 the total demand for cloud computing, data center plus A.I., will be around 1,000 terawatt hours. To put this for -- this for the 
 
 audience, 1,000 terawatt hour equivalent to the whole electricity generation of Japan. 
 
ANDERSON: We saw news of Google looking at operations through small reactors. We see Microsoft reports that that will be sort of firing up the 
 
 Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. 
 
Is that where you see the partnerships for energy organizations like your own going?
 
AL HAMMADI: Looking at the race between ultra-scale ups and every company want to have the lion's share of energy because that will give them an edge 
 
 to become leading in the A.I. sector. Amazon and Microsoft and others are very serious in their demand. They are -- they want every electron as soon 
 
 as possible. They are in a sprint to be able to put their hands on the maximum size of clean energy. 
 
I will definitely today ENEC, we will definitely help and work with those companies. If I may also put my hat on as the chairman of the World Nuclear 
 
 Association. We are also enabling technology providers, with supply chain, with the also academia and government to lead the policies and strategies 
 
 for countries and companies to be able to utilize this new technologies to be able to power their energy demand for the betterment of humanity.
 
ANDERSON: Do you see, for example, the ambition for nuclear here to be in partnership with either China or Russia, and how might that impact 
 
 relations with a new Trump administration?
 
AL HAMMADI: U.S. collaborated with our partners in Korea. We have vendor suppliers from U.S., from Sweden, from Japan. These projects are very 
 
 international. The nuclear power plants you have over thousands and thousands of components come from all over the world. 
 <br>[10:40:16]
 
For us as ENEC, we are looking for business opportunities and A.I. demand today. U.S. is number one when it comes to the demand for artificial 
 
 intelligence, and that's something we see it as a clear business opportunities. 
 
As a company, we follow government policies and strategies, and today, as you mentioned, U.S. market. We know it well. There is a great appetite of 
 
 investment, and there's appetite for business people to do business, to be able to meet the demand for artificial intelligence. 
 
ANDERSON: Electricity prices are sky high and in Europe as we approach the winter, not enough wind generating electricity on the renewable side. 
 
So, it must be at this time of the year that you look around the world, particularly in Europe, and you say, here is the argument for nuclear as 
 
 part of the energy mix.
 
AL HAMMADI: So today, prices, as you mentioned, in Europe, is high, but these are cyclical. So, there's a lot of cycles that industries and 
 
 commodities go through, and the prices are high in Europe. 
 
What I can tell you, Becky, there is over 700 million people without electrons, and in those countries, they are the highest, by the way, all 
 
 year long, you know, regardless of commodities of prices, very high electrons, very high cost electricity. And that's something as UAE and as 
 
 ENEC, as Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, we are interested also to provide solution to those nations. 
 
ANDERSON: So, give me some examples. What does that ambition look like in parts of the world where there is not enough electricity and when there is, 
 
 it is so expensive?
 
AL HAMMADI: Today, if you look at the world, where are the costs of double digit, let's say 20 cents plus per kilowatt hour costs. If you look at 
 
 East, there's countries like Philippine and others, and that's an opportunity for foreign investment to help them and go on down the cost and 
 
 also decarbonize their sector, also Indonesia and other countries. 
 
If you look also in Africa, there's a huge abundance of demand young people who are -- and want to learn, want to grow and want to be contributing 
 
 factor in part of humanities and grow their nations. I see there's a huge opportunity for us to collaborate and cooperate with countries like the 
 
 U.S. for example, and invest on those advanced reactors, which is easy to manage, easy to control, at the same time provide abundance electricity and 
 
 a clean basis for such countries.

ANDERSON: The head of ENEC here in the UAE and a reminder of one of our top stories this hour, sources say the SoftBank chief will announce a $100 
 
 billion investment in the United States. The goal tens of thousands of jobs focused on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure along the 
 
 lines of the kind of investment that you just heard my guests and I discussing there in that interview with the managing director and CEO of 
 
 ENEC.
 
And in just about 15 minutes, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is expected to hold a news conference from Mar-a-Lago with the CEO of SoftBank. CNN 
 
 will bring you that live as and when it happens.
 
That's it for my show, CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson. Stay with CNN. Up next, the "MARKETPLACE MIDDLE EAST."
