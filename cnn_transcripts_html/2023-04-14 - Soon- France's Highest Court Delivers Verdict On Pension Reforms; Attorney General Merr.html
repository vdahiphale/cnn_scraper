SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
Here with a look at some of our top stories. The suspect accused of leaking classified Pentagon documents just wrapping up his first court appearance this morning. Jack Teixeira was charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of National Defense Information and unauthorized removal of classified information. A detention hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. Teixeira did not enter a formal plea.
 
This morning, the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport has reopened finally as South Florida tries to move past the historic flooding there. Passengers now checking in, which is welcome news after what looked like 24 hours ago. Yes, that's the picture of it. More storms are expected though today. Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Moments from now, we are expecting to get a verdict from France's highest Constitutional Court on the pension reform plan that has sparked massive protests across France. If the court signs off on the plan that reforms including raising the retirement age there by two years, could go into effect in September.
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins me now from Paris. Fred, what is the mood? What are you hearing there as everyone is kind of waiting for this final word from the country's highest court?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. Way to get very anxious to see what the Constitution officer is going to say. You can already feel a lot of the anger here on the streets in Paris. I'm going to show you a little bit.
 
Kate, you can see there's a protest that's going on right now. I'm actually in front of City Hall here in Paris. It's mostly student groups that are protesting here, but then also some of the trade unions as well.
 
And you know, we saw yesterday that explosion of anger that took place on the streets of Paris. You do have a lot of anger here as well. But of course, you don't have any of the violence here. It's very colorful here. But the people certainly are very, very serious about the fact that they are very much against this reform bill.
 
And one of the things that we spoke about yesterday is that on the one hand, it's the raising of the retirement age here in France from 62 to 64. It gets a lot of people very angry. But it's also the way that Emmanuel Macron is pushing this reform bill through essentially bypassing the legislative process.
 
And of course, today is really an important milestone in all that because if the Constitutional Council, OKs this law, then it can go into effect and then it'll start going into real effect in September of this year. Obviously, the people here are hoping that that won't be the case. Most people don't ever believe that maybe some parts of it will not be declared constitutional, but that retirement age thing will probably come, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Fred, Thank you. John?
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right. 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls are set to take the stage at the annual NRA convention in Indianapolis this weekend. Both former President Trump and his Vice President, Mike Pence, will be there. The convention is happening just days after a gunman in Louisville killed five people out of the bank, and weeks after a shooter killed three nine-year-olds and three adults at a Nashville school scene.
 
CNN's Kristen Holmes at the event in Indianapolis. And, Kristen, this is something of a pilgrimage for presidential hopefuls.
 <br>[11:35:02]
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it is absolutely. And I will note that this has become somewhat of a pattern having this event right after a mass shooting likely because of the frequency. We're seeing that last year. This fell three days after that shooting at the Uvalde elementary school.
 
But when you look at the slate of people who is coming to speak today, whether they're doing it in person or they've submitted a video, you can see just how important this voting bloc is to Republicans, particularly in a primary year. You have former President Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence. We have Vivek Ramaswamy.
 
Nikki Haley has submitted a video. Tim Scott submitted a video. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis submitted a video. These are all of the top 2024 candidates and hopefuls that are out there in this field.
 
And remember, when they are speaking to the crowd today, they are trying to port some of the most extreme parts of the Republican Party when it comes to gun rights restrictions. This is a group who opposes almost -- even the most moderate restrictions on gun ownership. So, something to keep in mind there.
 
And you did also mention that Trump and Pence will be here. This is the first time that we are seeing them in person at an event in years. Obviously, the two haven't spoken in more than two years, but it is notable they probably won't overlap given the timing. BERMAN: All right, Kristen Holmes for us in Indianapolis. Kristen, keep us posted. Sara?
 
SIDNER: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is facing scrutiny yet again, this time for a reportedly undisclosed real estate transaction with that Republican megadonor. According to ProPublica, Thomas sold three family properties to billionaire Harlan Crow in 2014. He is the same person linked to Thomas in last week's bombshell report, the detailed undisclosed luxury trips worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
 
CNN's Jessica Schneider is following the story. Jessica, Thomas has said he was advised not to report the travel gifts. What's he saying about this transaction that for the first time, real money was exchanged?
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. So, as for this latest report, Sara, we have not heard any response from Justice Thomas just yet, even though he was on the bench this morning as the Supreme Court issued one opinion. But really this new ProPublica report is drawing even more criticism than that first report that disclosed Justice Thomas had received that free luxury travel from a Republican megadonor, as they put it nearly every year for the last decade. And the reason for the outcry about this most recent report is that the requirements for disclosure. In this case, they seem pretty clear.
 
So, I'll lay it out for you. Pro Publica has now reported that the same Republican megadonor, Harlan Crow, actually purchased three pieces of property directly from Justice Thomas in 2014. The sale according to the records they uncovered was about $130,000. This is significant because there is a federal disclosure law that was passed after Watergate that does require justices and other officials to disclose details of most real estate sales over $1,000. And ProPublica is finding that Justice Thomas never actually disclosed the deal at all.
 
So, there's been no comment from Justice Thomas on this. But here's what that megadonor, Harlan Crow, actually told ProPublica in the wake of their report. He said My intention is to one day create a public museum at the Thomas home dedicated to telling the story of our nation's second black Supreme Court Justice. I approached the Thomas family about my desire to maintain this historic site so future generations could learn about the inspiring life of one of our greatest Americans.
 
But, Sara, that still really doesn't answer any of the questions. And the response on this has been very swift. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse on the Judiciary Committee. He had previously asked the Chief Justice, John Roberts to investigate that initial report about free travel.
 
But now the senator is asking the Judicial Conference which serves as this policymaking body for all federal courts. Sara, he wants that body to refer Justice Thomas to the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, for what he's calling brazen disregard of disclosure laws and violations of ethics laws. So, there's a lot swirling now that ProPublica has yet uncovered another transaction that hasn't been disclosed, Sara.
 
SIDNER: Wow. Jessica Schneider, thank you for all of that. John?
 
BERMAN: All right Thanks, Sara. A story you will only see here on CNN. An exclusive look at the dangerous and sometimes deadly trek that migrants take through Central and South America. Stay with us.

BERMAN: We got new information just into CNN. Attorney General Merrick Garland was briefing reporters about a fentanyl bust. But after he was asked about this arrest and hearing now of Jack Teixeira, who is the Massachusetts Air National Guard, been now charged with leaking sensitive classified documents, this is what the attorney general had to say about that, moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Everyone is talking about it. Really just point you at what the Secretary of Defense has said. But the Department of Defense is leading an important effort now to evaluate and review the national security implications and most importantly, to conduct a review of the methods of access accountability and control procedures that the department has, so that something like this can never happen again.
 
And the more general question. We met yesterday with all of this major security ministers of Mexico, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Interior Security, foreign minister, and we all know that we need to work together continually to strike against this enemy that is injuring people in both of our countries, is killing law enforcement and service members in Mexico, as well as individuals in Mexico, communities in Mexico, and is doing the same in the United States. So, we will be working together on all of these matters.
 <br>[11:45:27]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sadie.
 
SADIE GURMAN, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Hey, there. OK, so, Deputy Attorney General, you had mentioned, you know, the role of social media companies in cases like this. I was hoping I could trouble you to elaborate on the role of social media in this specific case, and also what your interactions with those companies have been like.
 
And then Attorney General, if I can ask you a question about our Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich? You know, you've been a longtime advocate of press freedom and so I guess I'm wondering what you think Russia's arrest of an American journalist on espionage charges says to you about the state of press freedom around the world.
 
GARLAND: Yes, I'll start with the second and I'm sure it'd be no trouble for the deputy to answer the first. Look, the United States has already made clear that this is a wrongful detention of The Wall Street Journal reporter. This kind of case just shows how important freedom of the press is in all countries around the world. 
 
In our country, but even more so in countries that are making it increasingly difficult and dangerous for the free press to operate and to report what is actually happening in that country. The United States will do everything in its power to get the reporting back. And now, on the social media question, I let the deputy answer that.
 
LISA MONACO, U.S. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thanks very much, and thank you for the question, Sadie. Look, I highlighted the -- 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BERMAN: All right. We have been listening to the Attorney General of the United States in there with the Deputy Attorney General, Lisa Monaco asked obviously, about the arrests and now the charges coming for the Pentagon leaker, also asked about Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. He, of course, stood up for free speech and stood up for the rights of that Wall Street Journal reporter now imprisoned in Russia. We're going to have much more ahead. Stay with us.

SIDNER: The NFL is taking a major step to protect quarterbacks now. The league and its players' union have revealed a newly designed helmet specifically for quarterbacks to wear in an effort to reduce the severity of impacts that can cause concussions. So, the announcement follows last season's high-profile injuries that we all saw suffered by Dolphins quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa. On two separate occasions, the 25-year-old fell backwards and hit his head on the turf.
 
CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard joins us now live with more details. Jacqueline, can you give us some more details about what this helmet does that the others don't?
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER (on camera): Well, Sara, this is the first time that we're hearing from the NFL that it's announcing a quarterback-specific helmet that was engineered and tailored to reduce the severity of impact when a quarterback hits the ground. Now, this is the first time we're hearing about a helmet of this kind that will be available for the 2023 season. The NFL says it's not required for quarterbacks to wear this specific helmet but they do say that according to lab tests, this helmet was found to perform seven percent better than the type of helmets that were the most popular among quarterbacks last year.
 
And this isn't the first time that the NFL has leaned on helmet technology in an effort to make the game safer. Sara, we do know that in 2021, there was a helmet specifically for offensive and defensive linemen. We also know that the NFL encourages players to wear what are called Guardian caps under their helmets, that's a layer of cushioning during practice.
 
But I should say that no helmet is one hundred percent concussion- proof. Helmets originally are intended to reduce the risk of skull fracture. So, the risk of a concussion, Sara, is always going to be a looming concern when we talk about football, and when we talk about safety.
 
SIDNER: You know, you talk about -- you know, the design of this new helmet. And we heard about Tagovailoa hitting his head on the turf. What do we know about the health implications of this particular helmet in a case like that?
 
HOWARD: Yes. Well, the NFL did say in its announcement that 50 percent, half of concussions suffered by quarterbacks are result from the quarterback hitting the -- his head on the ground. And what we do know just in general, with any blow to the body, any blow to the head, that can actually cause the brain to kind of slosh around in the skull. And that is what impacts brain function, and that's the concern here.
 
And we also know that the more blows to the head that you receive, that can raise the risk of CTE. And that occurs when there's a buildup of protein around the blood vessels in the brain. So, that's why I said, Sara, that no helmet is really one hundred percent concussion- proof because there is always that risk of the brain hitting against the skull. And that's the health concern here when we talk about head injuries and the sport of football, Sara.
 
SIDNER: Jacqueline Howard, thank you so much. All very interesting. I think the first helmet was the don't quote me because you're going to come for me. This is a key helmet. It looks very odd like it wouldn't do anything. So, the evolution is real.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: Have you seen the pictures of like when they wore leather helmets lately?
 
SIDNER: Yes, that's what that was.
 
BOLDUAN: What they're called? Leatherheads? (INAUDIBLE)
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
BERMAN: Yes. Nicely done.
 
BOLDUAN: Oh.
 
BERMAN: Yes. No, for sure.
 
BOLDUAN: Do you think that helmet like that could have helped the Red Sox last night?
 
BERMAN: That's mean.
 
SIDNER: Oh, wow. BERMAN: That's mean.
 
SIDNER: Wow, Kate. Kate, it's Friday, be nice to him.
 
BERMAN: The Red Sox were swept by Tampa who like just tie to a record for the most wins to start a season. But you know what? There were like eight people in the stands. If Tampa is going to win all these games, Tampa fans, you got to start showing up to watch that.
 
BOLDUAN: Are you saying the win doesn't count because they didn't -- 
 
BERMAN: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: It's like the tree in the forest.
 
BERMAN: Yes, exactly. If Tampa wins a game, does it make a sound? We don't know because there weren't necessarily any fans there.
 
BOLDUAN: And there you have it, Sara.
 
SIDNER: He suffered long enough -- he suffered long enough.
 
BOLDUAN: No, no.
 
SIDNER: No.
 
BOLDUAN: No, you are on my team on this one, full stop.
 
BERMAN: All right, friends. Thank you all for watching CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.
