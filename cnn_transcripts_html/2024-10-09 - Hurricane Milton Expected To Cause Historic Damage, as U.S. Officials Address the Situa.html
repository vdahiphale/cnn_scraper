THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[13:00:00]
 
MICHAEL BRENNAN, NOAA NHC DIRECTOR: -- the entire West Coast of Florida because water gets funneled up into the Bay. If you were to see a worst case scenario there, you could see storm surge as much as twice as high as they saw during Helene where it got up to seven or eight feet in the Bay. It could potentially get up above 10 feet in this event.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, thanks a lot, Mike. I appreciate it.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hey, Mike, it's good to see you again and thank you for all your work. So, for the folks who have been living in Florida a long time and have experienced these storms many times, how are you talking with about how this is going to be different and what -- and so the difference between what they're used to and what this will be as a way to hopefully give them more encouragement to know that they need to get out?
 
BRENNAN: Thank you, Madam Vice President. Yes, we've been emphasizing that the size and the intensity of the storm and the direction at which it's approaching, which is unusual and really raises that storm surge risk for the West Coast of Florida. We typically see hurricanes approach the West Coast of Florida from the south or southeast, moving parallel to the Coast. 
 
This track more perpendicular to the Coast really raises the storm surge risk. And the size of the storm is going to produce hazardous impacts across much of the Peninsula. So, we've been hitting the surge risk on both coasts, actually. The hurricane force winds, the flooding rainfall threat, the tornadoes, and trying to reemphasize the scale and breadth of the threat, which is somewhat unusual for Milton.
 
HARRIS: Thank you, and thanks for your good work.
 
BIDEN: Mike, one more question.
 
BRENNAN: Yes, sir?
 
BIDEN: For people listening, what is the -- what is the width of the state of Florida from the Tampa Bay area across to Sebastian inlet (ph), in that area to Palm Beach? What kind of distance are we talking about? BRENNAN: You know, across the state of Florida, you're probably talking about, you know, 150 to 200 miles. That's an estimate. But the storm's going to be moving at 15 miles per hour, so it's going to be moving across that area very quickly. And the tropical storm force (ph) winds, the 30, 40 miles per hour winds are greater now extend almost out more than 200 miles from the center. They're going to get even larger as the storm approaches the coastline, so that's going to cause those wind impacts to affect much of the state.
 
BIDEN: The reason I ask the question is, I think at least for me, having done a lot of this the last three years, emphasizes the consequential damage this storm can do. I mean, this is going to enter Florida on the west as a hurricane and leave as a hurricane, and that's pretty unusual. Anyway, thank you.
 
BRENNAN: It is. Yes, sir. Thank you.
 
ELIZABETH SHERWOOD-RANDALL, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISOR: Thank you so much. We will move on now to the National Weather Service Director, Ken Graham.
 
KEN GRAHAM, DIRECTOR U.S. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE: All right, thanks Liz. I appreciate it. And I wanted to thank Administrator Criswell for everything through this and Dr. Brennan as well. The Hurricane Center has been really focused on this and on it with such great forecast the whole way. And I just wish we could minimize those impacts, but that doesn't look like what's going to happen. So, Mr. President, Madam Vice President, we continue to work at the National Weather Service with our federal, state and local decision makers during the storms. 
 
Look, we actually have our scientists embedded with FEMA, the state and local emergency operations centers, and we also have our scientists embedded with the U.S. Coast Guard, District Seven, to really help out with these decisions, to make sure they're right there to answer the questions as they come up. They're covering really the subtleties, as you've mentioned in this forecast. 
 
Dr. Brennan mentioned those small changes can make a big difference. Little wiggles really do matter. Those small wobbles make a difference in the storm surge and all these big storms, they wobble and wiggle all the way in. We'll see that happening as this gets closer to landfall. 
 
So, as Administrator Criswell said, listen to those local officials. I can't stress enough 30 years with NOAA, 30 years in the Weather Service, this is a particularly dangerous track. People really need to be getting into their safe locations as the impacts start deteriorating really quickly over the next few hours. Words really matter in these storms. Even if the winds decrease somewhat near landfall, we really try to avoid words like weaken. It really gives a false sense of security to the public. 
 
So, we really want to stress that no matter what happens to that, the wind speed in the system, catastrophic impacts will result either way. The size of the wind speed, the actual size of it will be expanding, as Dr. Brennan was saying. So, much of that impact will cover most of the Peninsula. And Mr. President, like you said, think about it. Goes over my mind over and over. Milton will enter as a hurricane and exit as a hurricane. 
 
So, you'll see damage from the landfall point on the West Coast and you'll see damage on the East Coast as well. So, it's really important to focus on those impacts. Again, seeing those impacts on both coasts, we're really starting to see the impacts as we speak. I was just looking at the radar before doing this meeting here, and we've got tornadoes already touching down in some spots in Florida, and some have been confirmed, that have touched down as well. 
 
[13:05]
 
And about 90% of those tornadoes occur on that right front quadrant of a tropical system. So, really our folks are at the Weather Service run duty 24 hours a day watching that radar to make sure that we can get those warnings out quickly to people so they can take cover. And as Dr. Brennan has said, think about it, Mike (ph), right, 140 miles wide. 
 
Now, we're 200 and expected to be greater than 240 miles away from the center with these winds. So, that's a huge area that we can see some of those that damage. Very concerned about the storm surge and I wanted to double down on something. It's not just, you know, Tampa Bay with that eight to twelve foot forecast or ten to 15 down to Boca Grande. I mean, you can see five to eight feet of storm surge all the way down to Chokoloskee. 
 
Think about Fort Myers, Naples, well away from that center. We just got to really keep reminding people they're not safe even though you're not, you know, not near the center of the storm. So, we'll continue to really message that as we can. The other part of this flooding could last a while. So, unlike other areas with elevation, there's not much elevation in Florida. So, some of these rivers are going to be slow to drain. 
 
Some of these rivers could stay up for about a week after the storm and the storm surge will act as a blocker to drain some of that rain from the inland area. So, that could really be add some challenges to some communities with these flooding and recovery efforts as some of the roads will be pretty impassable. So, you know, I was looking at this, Mr. President, Madam Vice President. 
 
Yesterday, I said the clock was ticking. Today, I'm saying the alarm bell's going off. People really need to start getting into their safe place. As always the Weather Service remains on duty 24 by 7 to make sure that the decision makers have all the information they need and the updates to the storm.
 
BIDEN: Ken, I'd like to focus on one thing you said. I don't think most people would think it, but you know, the idea that sometimes it takes days for rivers to crest after a major storm like this. Are there any particular areas of concern that you've related to this type of flooding? And how long do you think the flooding conditions could last? In other words, I think people think once the winds are died down and gotten through that, OK, we're all set. But these rivers flooding are consequential and it takes time. Right?
 
GRAHAM: It takes time. That storm surge pushes up every nook and cranny of Florida. So, it goes up bays, goes up rivers, it fills in all these areas. And then you add that incredible amount of rainfall and that rain can't drain because the storm surge has it blocked. So, just really looking at some of the areas and Hillsborough River, Alapaha River, the Peace River, some of these type of traditional places that could flood, we really got to watch those areas in those communities. So, it takes quite a while for that water to drain.
 
BIDEN: Thank you very much.
 
HARRIS: Hey, Ken, I have a question for you. You mentioned words matter, and I know there's a lot of media following this briefing, so there have been -- we've gone from a Cat 5 to a Cat 4. And the language that a lot of folks have been using is downgrade. But it sounds like you're cautioning us that that may communicate a sense that the danger is lessened, when in fact it's not. Can you talk a little bit about that? Because I know a lot of folks are watching right now and would love to have your feedback on how we should be talking about this?
 
GRAHAM: Yes, we need everybody that communicates to the public to be on the same page with the words. Because I've 30 years of doing this, I've seen this so many times, people will think, oh, it was a Cat 5, now it's a Cat 3. That's not a reason to relax. It's not weakened, that's not diminished. That means we've expanded the windfield. The impacts don't change associated with that. I've seen this in Hurricane Florence and other historic hurricanes. So, we have to be mindful of the words that we use and focus on those impacts. Those impacts haven't changed, no matter what the wind speed does over the next 24 hours.
 
HARRIS: Thank you. That's very helpful. Thank you.
 
SHERWOOD-RANDALL: Thank you, Director Graham. We'll go now to Secretary Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security. Alej (ph), over to you.
 
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Thank you very much, Liz. Mr. President, Madam Vice President, if I can just pick up on the important phrase, that words matter. I want to thank you for the strength and moral clarity with which you have been speaking. To bat down false information that is being spread. That false information is only hurting survivors in need of help, and it is also hurting the first responders who are so bravely risking their lives to deliver that help to the survivors. 
 
Mr. President, Madam Vice President, we are executing on your directive to not only rely on FEMA to provide emergency relief, but to draw upon other resources throughout the Department of Homeland Security and throughout the federal government, throughout your administration. I know you will hear from the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, Linda Fagan. 
 
[13:10]
 
The United States Coast Guard has deployed almost 1,300 personnel to Florida, not just for search and rescue, but also to ensure the safety and security of the Port of Tampa, which is a critical lifeline for supplies that are needed by Florida and elsewhere. I want to also say that our U.S. Customs and Border protection has devoted search and rescue personnel, as well as other parts of our Department. 
 
To give you just a quick snapshot of some of the resources that are devoted from other parts of the administration, the Department of Defense is providing search and rescue, commodity movement, commodity distribution and security to Florida. We already have 1.5 million meals and 2.8 million liters of water ready to provide to people in need. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing temporary power, temporary roofing, debris removal support and engineering expertise. The U.S. Forest Administration is also providing debris removal. 
 
This is absolutely critical so that our search and rescue personnel can reach the people in need and provide them with the humanitarian relief upon which they rely. Health and Human Services is providing hospital and health related support. The small business administration has dedicated 137 personnel to assist people who have lost or whose businesses are destroyed, to get them back up on their feet and understand what resources are available to them. We have an entire administration dedicated to this effort at your direction. 
 
And with that, I'll pause.
 
BIDEN: Hey, Alej (ph), or Mr. Secretary, do you have everything you need from all the federal departments and that agencies in support of this response? Are there anything lacking?
 
MAYORKAS: We certainly do have all of the resources. We are well positioned to continue to respond to Hurricane Helene, to respond to Hurricane Milton. Mr. President, we are meeting the moment and meeting the challenges because of the extraordinary people who have spoken before me.
 
BIDEN: Well, you know, I want to thank the Governors. They've stepped up. You know, all this disinformation going out about how we're devoting all this money to migrants and we're, I mean, all the -- even one Congresswoman suggesting that I control the weather and implying that I'm sending it to red states. I mean, stuff off the wall, it's like out of a comic book. 
 
But you know, people, when they're in trouble or for example, and I asked this to our Administrator, they said that you get $750 and that's it. And you lost everything. You get $750. That's not it. That's just you're giving immediately what you need to get by the next day, to get a prescription, to get a whatever. Are you getting calls already about what we're going to be able to deliver? For people who get in trouble?
 
MAYORKAS: We are. Mr. President, let me say that one of the false narratives is that the federal employees who are actually delivering assistance will take an individual's land. And that is causing individuals, survivors, not to approach the people who are there to help and obtain the relief to which they are entitled and that we have to available to them. 
 
And the Vice President knows very well, as a former Prosecutor, that false information only is fuel for the criminal element to exploit individuals in positions of vulnerability. And Madam Vice President, your words at the outset were so very important for that reason.
 
BIDEN: Thank you.
 
HARRIS: Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you and the folks in your agency working with FEMA, NOAA and all the federal agencies I've seen, I've been on the ground, and the work that you all have been doing to coordinate with local and state law enforcement and first responders has been outstanding. It really does show the best of the kind of work that we do in a moment of crisis to work together. So, I applaud the folks that work with you and your leadership in that regard.
 
MAYORKAS: Thank you, Madam Vice President.
 
SHERWOOD-RANDALL: Thank you, Secretary Mayorkas. We'll go now to Admiral Linda Fagan, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.
 
LINDA FAGAN, COMMANDANT OF THE U.S. COAST GUARD: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, Madam Vice President. And I want to assure you that the Coast Guard is ready to respond. We continue to monitor the storm closely and are mindful of how dangerous and devastating the storm is and the potential to the region, which is still recovering from Hurricane Helene. 
 
[13:15]
 
My senior field commanders are well integrated with both the state and local emergency responders and have stood up incident commands. We continue to search personnel and assets from across the country into the region, and I want to highlight how we prepare for storms. And so, we have people and helicopters and aircraft and boats and cutters that would have been in harm's way for the passage of this storm. 
 
And we have sort of moved those people and assets out of harm's way for the storm. They are ready and positioned to begin to move back into the region as soon as it is safe to do so. In addition, the aircraft and ships and boats include shallow water boats, medical teams, pollution response teams, crisis support teams. Our top priority is saving lives and safeguarding the marine transportation system. 
 
This also includes responding to any pollution incidents. We will begin to move back into the region as soon as it's safe to do so, with our primary initial focus being life saving work and reopening the ports to re enable the flow of commerce. I want to focus just for a minute on the Port of Tampa, which is the largest port in Florida. And depending on the impacts of the storm, there could be some impact to the port and commerce flow. 
 
We will conduct overflights as well as bring ships into the region to ensure that the channel in the harbor is clear and safe for commercial traffic. We will work with the Army Corps of Engineers and others to do those assessments. We'll work to reestablish the aids to navigation constellation, and work with the pilotage in the area to ensure that ships are able to move safely in and out of the Port of Tampa. 
 
We'll also need to ensure that the port has electricity for handling of cargo and cargo flows. So, I share this with you, Mr. President, because we are myopically focused on regaining commerce flows into the Port of Tampa. Once the assessments are able to be made. It does take a little bit of time, but we will move with all urgency to ensure that Tampa is reopened for commerce and commercial flows. 
 
We continue to monitor the storm closely, and a number of our briefers have spoken on the need to heed to the evacuation orders. And just like to emphasize that my first responders, and as one of the critical first response agencies, supports (ph) a hurricane response like that. My first responders have moved out of harm's way and are not in the path of storm. 
 
They are ready for immediate reconstitution into the area, and you will see them moving quickly. But as the storm effects come on, people really need to move into safe positions so that they do not lose their lives. Mr. President, your Coast Guard is ready to respond and we are well positioned for that. Thank you, sir.
 
BIDEN: Admiral, one of the things that I don't know whether people have not been through any kind of hurricane in the past may not understand is that when the rainfall and the flood surge are significant, but these elevated water levels are likely to be accompanied by large and destructive waves. It's not just the water horizon. There's significant waves. And what do you anticipate, if anyone else wants to respond, what do we anticipate in terms of the wave damage this time? Not just the water rising, but these waves, large waves coming in?
 
FAGAN: Sir, I'll just touch on the impact of the water and just the flow and significance of any kind of increased water flow, storm surge, whether it's wave driven or otherwise, it creates conditions that are incredibly hazardous to life. People can't swim or save themselves. Which again, just emphasizes why it's so critical that people evacuate and get themselves out of harm's way and that allows them for the assessment with regard to any property or property impacts.
 
BIDEN: I know search and rescue is obviously the number one priority immediately after storm, but we know that the Port of Tampa is critical, critical for the state and the state's economy in the r]region as well. What can you and the Army Corps of Engineers do to get the port quickly reopened once this storm passes through?
 
FAGAN: Thank you, Mr. President. We're already in conversations with the Army Corps of Engineers aligned on the need to begin those assessments as quickly as possible, to determine whether there were any impacts from the storm or not. And regain and reopen the Port of Tampa. The Port of Everglades is also a critical port on the East Coast of Florida. [13:20]
 
The Port of Everglades remains open for fuel tankers to ensure that that commerce continues to flow into the state from other ports that are not in the direct impact of the storm. But sir, I assure you, we and the Corps of Engineers are already in conversation with regard to what it will take to reconstitute the Port of Tampa, and we will lean into that work as quickly as possible.
 
BIDEN: Thank you, Admiral. Appreciate it.
 
HARRIS: Commandant, I echo the President's words. Thank you for what you and the men and women of the Coast Guard have been doing in response to Hurricane Helene and now this. And your emphasis on the importance of the Port in Tampa is critically important to recovery. So, thank you for all the work that you are doing. I know that resources are spread thin in terms of your folks being on the ground in every area right now, and you're doing an extraordinary job. So, thank you for that.
 
FAGAN: Thank you, Madam Vice President.
 
SHERWOOD-RANDALL: To each of the dedicated professionals on this screen, we are truly in your debt and in debt to your teams for what they are doing right now to prepare for and respond to what is coming to Florida this evening. With that, we will conclude the public part of this briefing. And if you'll just stay on the screen for a few Minutes, we can --
 
BIDEN: Can I say one closing thing?
 
SHERWOOD-RANDALL: -- have further conversation. Of course, Mr. President.
 
BIDEN: Pass on to your folks how much we respect and understand a lot of these folks are risking their lives.
 
SHERWOOD-RANDALL: Yes.
 
BIDEN: They're risking their lives to help other people. I mean, this is Americans helping Americans in ways that when, you know, to me, it's a measure of who we are as a nation when we see this happen, and it constantly happens, Americans stepping up to help other Americans and risking their lives. So, thank all these first responders. It really matters, really, from the bottom of our heart. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. We're ready -- 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR: We've been listening to a teleconference where President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris have been receiving details from federal officials, including the DHS Secretary, the FEMA Administrator, and others, about Hurricane Milton now bearing down on the state of Florida, specifically the area of Sarasota, just a few, couple miles from here, and of course, Tampa Bay, the area that we are in right now. I'm Boris Sanchez, coming to you live from Tampa Bay. My colleague
 
 Brianna Keilar is in the nation's capital monitoring developments. We want to paint a picture for you of what things look like here and what they are about to look like over the next few hours as this powerful storm gets closer and closer to landfall. In this park outside of Tampa Bay, we've seen a lot of extensive damage from Hurricane Helene left over from about two weeks ago. 
 
You see it on this pier right here. You're looking eastward toward Tampa Bay, and there are planks of wood strewn about. There is scrap metal in different areas. And one of the most concerning things about this hurricane, aside from the powerful winds that are headed this way, somewhere in the vicinity of 125 to 140 miles an hour, is the storm surge. And we're seeing an ominous sign of what is to come. 
 
Right now, the water is receding in Tampa Bay. That means that the wind is pushing it out. As we get later and later into the evening, this water will return and we are expecting a storm surge anywhere from eight to 12 feet here in Tampa Bay. If you look over in the distance on that side, you're supposed to see skyscrapers, you're supposed to see the skyline of Tampa Bay. But it is clouded right now because of the strength of this storm. 
 
And over here to my right, you have something that officials have been warning against. You see onlookers, people with children coming outside, even in this dangerous state. We've seen tornadoes touch down across the Gulf Coast of Florida. So, that right there is a terrible idea. We hope that those folks will soon head inside. 
 
Right now we want to get the very latest on the forecast from Elisa Raffa. She's in the CNN weather center. Elisa, bring us the latest update from the National Hurricane Center.
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, we are still looking at an intense Category 4 hurricane that has been maintaining its intensity for the most part, 145 mile per hour winds. It's picking up speed, moving at 17 miles per hour. It is sitting 160 miles to the south and west of you in Tampa. The tornado threat has just been prolific this morning. I mean, look at all the tornado warnings. 
 
We find this often when we have a hurricane making landfall, you have these outer bands that start to get friction with the land and that's what causes these spin ups because the entire thing is spinning with so much moisture. But we have had multiple tornado warnings and multiple of which have had the tag for considerable damage. 
 
I mean, look at all the warnings that are around Fort Myers right now, as all of these little cells start to spin and drop tornadoes that we have been able to capture in pictures and video. 
 
[13:25]
 
The watch for the tornadoes continues until 9 o'clock this evening for a lot of the Peninsula here, as those tornadoes continue to spin onshore. When it comes to the track, we're still looking at that major hurricane making landfall on the West Coast of Tampa Bay. We're going to maintain that hurricane strength as it goes across the
 
 Peninsula here. The hurricane warnings in effect and what the officials were really honing in on is it doesn't matter at this point if it's a Category 3 or a Category 4. It has been dragging the ocean with it for the last couple of days. So, the wave height, the storm surge, those forecasts are not going to change no matter what the wind speed does. 
 
We're looking at ten to 15 miles per hour -- I'm sorry, feet of storm surge around Sarasota, where the exact eye goes will determine who gets the worst storm surge whether it's in the Bay area or to the south. But you've got storm surge washing against the entire West Coast here. Still up to eight to 12 feet around Fort Myers and Naples, and five to eight feet just south of there. 
 
And that's the unsurvivable, that's the devastating part again with some of these storm surge numbers that are well above what is survivable here. Looking at the wind again, 110 plus mile per hour winds there in the purple, possible from Tampa down towards Fort Myers. Hurricane force winds across the entire Peninsula, even running through places like Orlando. Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, you will feel the effects of this storm far and wide across the state of Florida. Elisa Raffa from the Weather Center, thank you so much. One of the things Elisa talked about is tornadic activity. We've seen a number of tornadoes already touching down. We actually got video. I believe this is from Broward County. This is in the southeast part of Florida. Actually want to go live to CNN's Carlos Suarez, who's in Fort Myers for us because he has an update right now on tornadic activity. Carlos, what are you seeing where you are?
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Boris. So, about an hour ago, a strong line of thunderstorms moved across downtown Fort Myers here. Some of the worst weather that we have seen associated with Hurricane Milton. And as you noted, there have been two confirmed tornadoes by the National Weather Service out of Miami. That first tornado was in western Broward County, near I-75, which is one of the primary evacuation routes for folks that are trying to get from the West Coast of Florida over to the East Coast of Florida. 
 
That second confirmed tornado was out by Clewiston. That is right near Lake Okeechobee. And it is also along another road that connects the West Coast to the East Coast of Florida. And now we're looking into the possibility here in Fort Myers that there may have been some damage about ten to 15 minutes from where we are. To give you a sense of exactly our location. Earlier today I was live kind of closer to the Caloosahatchee River back there. 
 
We're keeping a close eye on it because we expect that that river is going to overflow and at some point begin pushing in with storm surge right now of anywhere between eight to 12 feet. So, as all of that played out, we made the decision to go ahead and make our way a little bit closer, more inland away from the river. 
 
And then there was a break in the weather and now we're starting to hear some reports of some damage to some homes in one neighborhood, again, not too far from where we are. It's just about a ten to 15 minute drive from this location. Whether that was a confirmed tornado or just a strong burst of wind. Of course the National Weather Service out here will be the ones that will have to determine that. 
 
As for why we picked this location to cover Hurricane Milton. Two years ago I was out here for Hurricane Ian and this part of Lee County was destroyed. It was underwater, and the storm surge two years ago was 10 feet and that was a direct landfall. And with the expectation of course that the storm continues on its track north. We're still dealing with a storm surge possibly north of 10 feet. Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: And that is alarming that you would see a tornado touching down in western Broward County that is a few hundred miles from where this storm is expected to make landfall later this evening. Carlos Suarez, thank you so much for the update. Right now we want to discuss with a local official. We're joined by Chief Jim Kilpatrick, he's with the St. Pete's Beach Fire Department. 
 
Chief, thank you so much for being with us. First and foremost, I want to ask you about folks that are doing what officials have been warning against for days. There's like a family right now not far from where I'm standing and they are with children watching this storm come in. If you could give a message to folks at home watching this to warn them against this, what would you say, Chief?
 
JIM KILPATRICK, ST. PEACH BEACH FIRE DEPT. CHIEF: Those waters are dangerous. Those winds are dangerous. There's a potential for missiles when the winds pick up. It is not safe to be outside right now. You should be in a structure that is able to withstand the storm and be hunkering down.
 
SANCHEZ: Certainly that is the right approach and not --
