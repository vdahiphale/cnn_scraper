SUNI WILLIAMS, NASA ASTRONAUT: -- about that, like the things that we had sort of all talked about and planned for this fall and this winter. And I think I was a little bit nervous, to be honest with you, to say like, OK, I'm not coming home for it. But you know what? Like, like we both mentioned in the very beginning, everybody was on board.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND AVATION CORRESPONDENT: And one other thing that Butch and Suni are going to be missing while they are in space is the election that's taking place back on Earth. Butch said that he actually put in his request for a ballot today. So, that means Butch and Suni will be voting from the International Space Station. Victor, Isabel.
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: I still want the details on that, the voting from space.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN ANCHOR: Voting by mail from space, wow. 
 
BLACKWELL: Kristin Fisher, thanks so much. CNN THIS MORNING continues right now. 
 
Top of a brand-new hour on CNN THIS MORNING, and good morning to you, New York City. That's picturesque. Got the river there, Manhattan. 
 
ROSALES: Fog in the background, or pollution, I don't know. 
 
BLACKWELL: All right, here's what's going on today. Donald Trump keeping his focus on the battleground states with events in Nevada as Vice President Harris heads back to Washington D.C. What both candidates are saying about the prospect of a second debate in the weeks ahead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Active shooter. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Active shooter.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have an active shooter at Apalachee High School.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROSALES: And we're hearing the 9-1-1 calls and that deadly school shooting in Winder, Georgia that left two students dead and two teachers also dead, plus the new details about what the shooter was doing in the moments before he began his attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, SINGER: I try to hold myself to a very high standard for myself. And this is not that. This is not that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BLACKWELL: Justin Timberlake spoke outside of court Friday after he pleaded guilty to driving while impaired. The sentence, the judge handed down. And while you'll be seeing Timberlake talk more about the case in the future.
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: And we have the remnants of Francine, but also a potential new tropical system brewing just off the East Coast. We'll detail what impacts those both will have on the U.S.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS REPORTER: And it's Saturday, it means it's time for some college football. Some big ones today, you got Wisconsin taking on Alabama. You got a couple rivalry games this afternoon and we had a top 25 matchup last night. A rare Friday night top 25 game. Well, the highlight is coming up. 
 
BLACKWELL: Election draws closer, both campaigns are going full steam ahead, of course. Former President Donald Trump, he visited Las Vegas and California Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris stumped in Pennsylvania. 
 
ROSALES: Sources tell CNN her campaign is now targeting red and rural counties, trying to sway away voters. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez explains the significance of Vice President Harris' Pennsylvania trip.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Isabel and Victor, the Harris campaign is looking for multiple pathways to this 270 electoral votes, but Pennsylvania always a crucial state in that calculus. The Vice President has been spending the majority of her time here over the last several days, which is indicative of how the campaign sees this state, but also looking for opportunities in counties that might be unexpected. The vice president hitting two counties on Friday that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 and voted for him with double digits. 
 
So, the vice president trying to make a play in those counties. Now, sources tell me that the strategy here is to try to peel off voters from former President Donald Trump and try to build her support in some of these areas. And it is a reflection, they say, of how close they see the race being, that even a few votes, if they can peel them off, could help make a difference for the vice president. Now, the vice president, while traveling, was asked by reporters how she's feeling about the state. This is what she had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I am feeling very good about Pennsylvania because there are a lot of people in Pennsylvania who deserve to be seen and heard. That's why I'm here in Johnstown. And I will be continuing to travel around the state to make sure that I'm listening as much as we are talking. And ultimately, I feel very strongly that you've got to earn every vote. And that means spending time with folks in the communities where they live. And so, that's why I'm here. We're going to be spending a lot more time in Pennsylvania.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ALVAREZ: Now, the vice president also in her rally here in Wilkes- Barre talking about job opportunities and the economy. That was intentional, according to a campaign advisor, an attempt again to try to reach some of those voters who may not be diehard Democrats in this area, but may also be uninterested in Donald Trump. So, the campaign again trying to convert voters, looking ahead to November. 
 
Campaign aides also well aware that they need to get creative with some strategies and they're also thinking about foregoing some of the traditional media and big speeches and big policy rollouts. They're trying to keep the energy and momentum that they saw over the early weeks of the Harris campaign. But again, the vice president looking toward these states as critical for her to win in November. Back to you.
 
ROSALES: Priscilla Alvarez, thank you. Well, many have been wondering if we're going to see Trump and Harris debate again. Harris says she is up for it, but Trump is going back and forth. On Thursday, he said he wouldn't do another debate saying he won on Tuesday despite all the polling. But Friday he told Fox News maybe if he's in the right mood.
 <br>[07:05:38]
 
BLACKWELL: In Las Vegas last night he continued to push these unsubstantiated claims that Harris was wearing an earpiece during the debate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: She can't talk without maybe getting the answers. What's the story with that? Did she get the questions? Do you think? So, I hear she got the questions and I also heard she had something in the ear, a little something in the ear. No, Kamala, do this. Say it this way, Kamala. OK, be quiet. Too many people watching.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) BLACKWELL: During his stop in California, he doubled down on baseless
 
 claims of Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, and he promised large deportations from there if he's elected. The city of Springfield notes it has about 12 to 15,000 immigrants in Clark County, and Haitian migrants are there legally. 
 
In Georgia, funeral services will be held today for 14-year-old student Mason Shimmerhorn and teacher Christina Imirie -- I'm sorry, Irimie. They were among the four people killed in a shooting at a school in Winder, Georgia ten days ago. 
 
ROSALES: School administrators are planning for a gradual reopening of Apalachee High School the week of September 23rd. Yesterday police released the 9-1-1 calls and more than 500 radio messages between emergency personnel during and right after the shooting.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Active shooter. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Active shooter. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have an active shooter at Apalachee High School. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One suspect in custody. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I lost the status of the shooter. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In custody, uninjured.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROSALES: CNN's Rafael Romo is with us now. Rafael, we also got new details from police about the shooter, what he was doing in those moments leading up to this attack. What are you learning? 
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and one of the main questions here, Isabel and Victor, was whether this was a spur of the moment decision or whether there was a plan before it. And officials say it appears Colt Gray, the 14-year-old student accused of the shooting, had a preconceived plan to attack that day. That's what Barrow County Sheriff Judd Smith said in an interview with CNN affiliate WXIA. 
 
As we have previously reported, Gray brought an AR-15 style rifle to school. On September 4, a weapon he used to shoot fellow students and teachers, leaving four dead and nine injured. Sheriff Smith says it appears that very gun, that very gun was hidden in Gray's backpack when he left home for school that morning, as well as the bullets he was going to use. Let's take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He got on the bus with a backpack. We believe he had concealed the firearm in the backpack. We know that he concealed it with some sort of something that he had wrapped around it as if it was a project, a school project if you will. He had obviously stored magazines and rounds in that backpack with it as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROMO: Another difficult question authorities have been trying to answer is how did the 14-year-old manage to get the gun in the first place? Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith earlier said that the rifle was a Christmas gift from the teenager's father last year. As we have previously reported, 54-year-old, Colin Gray, was arrested and has been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and eight counts of cruelty to children with more possible. 
 
And Victor and Isabel, the deadly attack on September 4th marked the 45th school shooting in 2024 and the deadliest US school shooting since the March 2023 rampage at the Common School in Nashville that left six people dead. But again, the question here is the responsibility of parents, and as you know and we have reported this is the second parent that is going to be charged in connection with the shooting perpetrated by a child. So, we're going to see what happens in the future. 
 
ROSALES: Behind the crumbling over in Michigan. 
 
ROMO: Right. 
 
ROSALES: Rafael Romo, thank you so much for your time. Pop star Justin Timberlake has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while impaired. The actor appeared in a Long Island, New York court on Friday following his arrest in June saying he failed to achieve a high standard of behavior. 
 
BLACKWELL: CNN's Brynn Gingras has more on the penalties he's facing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Victor and Isabel, popstar pleading guilty to a lesser charge than what he was actually arrested on here in the Hamptons and Sag Harbor back in June. He was arrested on a DWI charge, but he is going- he pled guilty rather to a driving while impaired charge. Now that was part of a deal that was struck with the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office and Justin Timberlake and his defense team, which also includes Timberlake must have given a public service announcement. 
 <br>[07:10:15]
 
When that was announced in court, this deal, the judge wasn't exactly happy about it. He basically said that it was surprisingly favorable conditions toward Timberlake and said that it lacked any sort of retribution. So, he told Timberlake that he was going to add community service, which he will now have to do, 25 hours with a non-profit of his choosing, which can be done within a year. 
 
And when he asked Timberlake, you know, made clear that that was his condition and not the D.A.'s office, Timberlake said that he'd be honored to do it. So that is the case. Now, after court, we heard from Timberlake where he gave that apology, that public service announcement. I want you to hear some of that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TIMBERLAKE: I try to hold myself to a very high standard for myself. And this is not that. What I'd like to say to everyone watching and listening, even if you've had one drink, don't get behind the wheel of a car. There's so many alternatives. This is a mistake that I made, but I'm hoping that whoever's watching and listening right now can learn from this mistake.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GINGRAS: Timberlake finishing up his remarks saying we all can be more safe out there. In addition to the community service, he is also going to have to pay a $500 fine. And also, he will lose his license in the state of New York for 90 days. I'm Brynn Gingras from Sag Harbor, New York. Victor and Isabel, back to you guys.
 
BLACKWELL: All right, Brynn, thank you. Flood watches are in effect for millions of people in the Southeast. As what's left of Tropical Depression Francine drops in pretty heavy rain.
 
ROSALES: And as the storm slows down, the threat of flooding increases. CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is tracking this for us. Allison, the rain is welcome, the flooding not so much. 
 
CHINCHAR: Right, exactly. Because some of these areas need to have some of the rain. They're experiencing drought. You just don't want too much in a short period of time. So, here's a look at where the remnants are. Again, you can see still got those winds with 15 miles per hour. It's moving at 10 miles per hour. That may not seem all that fast. 
 
It's faster than it was yesterday. It was only moving at 3 miles per hour. So now we're going to start to see a lot of that rain spread eastward. So far you can see a lot of these yellow, red, and orange areas where they've had two, four, and even six inches of rain already fall. Now, we're going to be adding more on top of it. 
 
And as we mentioned, a lot of these areas are dealing with some level of drought, so the rain itself is welcome. You just don't want it to come too quickly because then that triggers a lot of the flooding concerns. And the biggest flooding concern lies along this narrow path right through here, where you can see another three to five inches of rain is still expected on top of what they've already had. 
 
Now, another concern is this section right over here. You can see off the coast of the Carolinas right through there. That is actually from what could become our next named tropical system. We have two low- pressure system. What's left of Francine and then this low-pressure system, if you're sitting just off the coast or just off the East Coast, this is the system that's going to ride up along the Carolinas, bringing all of that moisture in and eventually taking that moisture with it into the Northeast as we go into the next couple of days. 
 
The real question becomes is does it start that transition into more of a tropical based system? And if so, it could end up becoming the next named storm. Now, as of right now, it has about a 50 percent chance over the next several days to transition into some type of tropical system. If it does, the next name on the list is Helene. So, we'll have to keep a close eye on this storm over the next couple of days, guys?
 
ROSALES: All right, Allison, thank you. Still to come, a big meeting between President Biden and the U.K.'s Prime Minister, while Russia gets help from Iran in the war against Ukraine. Will the U.S. clear the way for Ukrainian-use missiles to strike military targets inside Russia?
 
BLACKWELL: Plus, Pope Francis is not picking sides in the U.S. presidential election. He had pretty harsh words for both Vice President Harris and former President Trump, his message to voters after the break.
 
ROSALES: And new details this morning on the deadly Apalachee High School mass shooting that left two teachers and two students dead. What happened moments before the shooter opened fire?
 <br>[07:14:19] 
 
That's after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
BLACKWELL: President Biden is considering whether to give Ukraine the go-ahead to strike deeper into Russia with U.S. built long-range missiles. No meat immediate decision came out of his White House meeting with the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
 
ROSALES: However, the two leaders did reassert their strong defense of Ukraine, especially in the wake of Putin's recent threats. Joining us now is CNN White House reporter Camila DeChalus. Camila, what was discussed during Biden's meeting with the U.K. Prime Minister?
 <br>[07:19:29]
 
CAMILA DECHALUS, CNN WHITE REPORTER: Well, President Biden signaled an openness to the idea of allowing Ukraine to use American long-range missiles when it comes to striking deeper into Russian territory. But U.S. officials have said that there are no immediate plans at this time to have this policy changed or any plans come out to just change how the US's stance on this issue. 
 
Now, in recent weeks, U.S. officials, U.S. lawmakers, and Ukrainian officials have put more pressure on Biden to change his policy stance on this issue, but to no avail. And this is all happening even as the White House signals that they're open to having more conversations around this topic. This is happening as Russian President Vladimir Putin issues his own threats, warning that Russia will be at war with NATO if Western countries consider lifting and easing restrictions around long-range missiles. Take a listen to what Biden had to say when asked about these threats.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you think of Vladimir Putin's special war, Mr. President?
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't think much about Vladimir Putin.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DECHALUS: Now, U.S. officials have acknowledged that there could be a potential escalation, a conflict escalation, if they decide to ease restrictions around allowing Ukraine to use long-range American missiles. But they say that they are committed to supporting Ukraine, and also say that they are going to continue holding conversations on how to best support Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Isabel, Victor, back to you.
 
ROSALES: Camila DeChalus, thank you so much for your time. Well, CNN exclusive this morning, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is talking to CNN as he waits to find out that critical decision from President Biden. Here's a conversation with our own Fareed Zakaria.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Everybody is looking the decision of the United States. Everybody's waiting for such decisions. After that they make decisions. It's true. And so, we wanted very much to use this weapon and just to attack these jets on the military basis. Not civilians infrastructure. Military basis. 
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: So, you just want to be able to attack the bases that are being used to launch these weapons, these planes, these missiles. 
 
ZELENSKYY: Yes, because these jets, these jets, these jets, from there they use not only missiles, they use these jets and jets use per month 4,000 guided aerial bombs on just on the east of our territory -- 4,000 bombs. 
 
ZAKARIA: And these bombs and missiles are hitting Ukrainian civilians --
 
ZELENSKYY: Schools.
 
ZAKARIA: Energies. 
 
ZELENSKYY: Universities. All our energy infrastructure, they're destroyed, 80 percent, by these guided bombs, 80 percent. Now, I said we had some meetings with officials and I said, we waited too long. Now, Russia began to move their jets from 100, 150, 300 to 500. After that, I will tell you that now we need more permissions. But now you will tell me, maybe we will give you 100 or 200, but for what? To destroy what? If they begin to move. So, we again, like with the packages, again slow decisions. And again, we can't win in such circumstances.
 
ZAKARIA: Do you have permission now to -- ZELENSKYY: No. Until now, no.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROSALES: An important sit-down interview with President Zelensky. You can catch it in full on Fareed Zakaria, GPS, right here on CNN tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern.
 
BLACKWELL: Pope Francis is not impressed with either candidate in the U.S. presidential election, Trump or Harris? His advice to American Catholic voters after the break. 
 
And as we get closer to election day, both former President Trump and Vice President Harris are in an uphill battle for the swing states. Trump is in Nevada; Harris is in Pennsylvania. Can the candidates keep up the momentum? 
 <br>[07:23:37]
 
We'll talk about it after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
ROSALES: In a rare move, Pope Francis is commenting on the U.S. presidential election and criticizing both Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump. The Pope made the case that the two are both anti-life. Harris, because of her stance on abortion; and Trump, because of his policies and rhetoric directed at migrants. Here's what he told the Catholic voters to think about.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[07:28:21] 
 
POPE FRANCIS, HEAD OF CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translation): You have to vote and one must choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser of two evils? That lady or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone with a conscience should think on this and do it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROSALES: And according to the Pew Research Center, Catholic voters were split in the 2020 election with 50 percent voting for Biden, and 49 percent supporting Trump.
 
BLACKWELL: With a little more than 50 days until the election, the candidates are focusing in on swing state voters, of course, Vice President Harris spent Friday in Pennsylvania, while former President Trump's team is making the rounds out West in Nevada and Arizona. The former president appears to be heeding the advice of some aides and allies by publicly distancing himself from staunch ally, Laura Loomer. 
 
Loomer is a far-right activist with a history of bigoted remarks, made headlines this week after posting extremely racist comments about Vice President Harris. With me now is national political reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. Good morning to you. Let's start here with yesterday in the afternoon in California, the former president suggested he didn't know anything about those controversial racist, bigotous, Islamophobic comments from Laura Loomer. 
 
Then, this was posted on Truth Social: "Laura Loomer doesn't work for the campaign. She's a private citizen, a longtime supporter. I disagree with the statement she's made." If there are, you know, obviously tens of millions of people intending to vote for former President Trump, he also said he didn't know about David Duke's history as the former Grand Wizard of the KKK. 
 <br>[07:30:04]
 
He didn't know the details about the Proud Boys, and Nick Fuentes, and all in on. Is this too, baked into the Trump cake that Laura Loomer will be around?
 
JULIA MANCHESTER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE HILL: Look, it's been an issue that the Trump campaign has been dealing with, like you said, Victor, going back to 2016 with that controversy surrounding David Duke.
 
But these comments by Laura Loomer this week are just another added headache for the Trump campaign, and we are seeing, essentially, in a way, damage control being done to distance themselves from Loomer.
 
It was interesting once we saw Loomer posting these very racist remarks about Kamala Harris on social media, we saw a number of Trump allies, like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Senator Lindsey Graham, immediately trying to get in there to distance Trump from Loomer. But obviously, that wasn't enough. It took Donald Trump having to go to Truth Social to distance himself.
 
What this ultimately does, though, is that it plays into this argument that Democrats and Trump critics have been making, that there are extremists within the Republican Party, and Trump is tied to this, these extremists, and in their words, Trump is an extremist.
 
So, it certainly does not do anything to help the Trump campaign, as you have Republicans trying to get the former president to really focus on policy, to create that contrast with Kamala Harris.
 
We'll see if he goes the additional step and disinvites her from the campaign events and no longer includes her on the plane when he is traveling.
 
So, when the former president has attacked or focused on the vice president's racial identity, Vice President Harris has simply kind of just said, I'm not going to deal with that, next question please, in the Dana Bash interview. Are they exploiting this, though, in the Harris campaign? Are they going after him on Loomer and this line of his associates?
 
MANCHESTER: You know, it's interesting, you know, watching Kamala Harris and covering her throughout this campaign, she has, in general, sort of veered away from focusing on her identity. Obviously, it is something that is a part of her, and she still talks about it, but she is very much tried, like you said to, you know, sort of veer away from that and focus more on, you know, other issues, other parts of her background.
 
But look, this is something I could certainly see her allies taking control -- taking, you know, the reins of and trying to tie Trump to this rhetoric.
 
I think it's a way, obviously, to, you know, present this argument to undecided voters who may actually have been in favor of Trump's policies, like Trump's economic policies, for example, the swing voters, but they don't like Trump himself -- at play, or his personality, those who he associates with.
 
It plays into this argument that Harris has continuously been making, that Trump is the chaos candidate. So, I think we can expect to see that going forward.
 
BLACKWELL: Staying with Harris, she just sat for her first solo on camera interview. This is with a local station in Philadelphia, CNN, affiliate, WPVI.
 
You know, she is been, of course, criticized for not doing one on ones. This is the first solo since she became the nominee. Is this the strategy, not going for the one on ones, with the networks, with the national -- international outlets, but going local, Philly, Milwaukee, kind of maybe Atlanta, the swing state, local stations.
 
MANCHESTER: That seems to be the strategy for now, and I think it's an important strategy. Look, you often hear during these campaigns, Victor, whether it's, you know, at the presidential level, you know, going further down the ballot. To run like you're running for mayor, really meet these voters where they are when it comes to local issues.
 
And even though the Office of the President of the United States is obviously the highest federal office, there still, you know, is a lot to be said, and, you know, a lot of ties to local issues. So, I think that's what you're hearing. The Harris campaign trying to do, to maybe talk about, you know, some of these local issues, and localize her campaign as much as she can.
 
You know, it was interesting when she was in Pennsylvania yesterday, you know, we not only saw her sit down with that Philadelphia station, but we also saw her going to more rural communities in announcing, you know, that she would essentially cut back if elected president on these four-year college degree requirements for some jobs.
 
That's actually an echo of what Governor Josh Shapiro has done in Pennsylvania. So, she is essentially trying to, you know, appeal to these voters more on a local or state level basis, which I think is very important.
 
Now, on the other side of this, I certainly working for a national outlet, understand the importance of sitting down with a national reporter or correspondent, anchor, to get questioned from a national perspective, but the local perspective is certainly a part of this.
 <br>[07:35:08]
 
BLACKWELL: All right. Julia Manchester with The Hill, thanks so much.
 
ROSALES: Still ahead, newly released 911 call shed some light on last week's mass shooting at a high school in Georgia.
 
The terrifying moment students and teachers endured in that deadly attack.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:40:00]
 
ROSALES: We are learning new details this morning in the Georgia high school shooting.
 
Officials say the shooter, 14-year-old Colt Gray, had preplanned the attack that day. Barrow County sheriff said, Gray hid the gun and rounds in his backpack before he left for school.
 
Then, while in class, Gray was allowed to leave his classroom with his belongings before returning with the rifle, and then he began shooting.
 
Today, funerals will be held for two of the victims, 14-year-old student Mason Schermerhorn, and teacher, Christina Irimie.
 
Joining us now is CNN senior national security analyst Juliette Kayyem.
 
Juliette, thank you so much for joining us.
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Thank you.
 
ROSALES: And Juliet, what stuck out to you and hearing those 911 calls and the law enforcement radio traffic?
 
KAYYEM: So, what struck me is how lucky the school was to have sort of in-person in residence security officials who basically ended what would have been a much greater slaughter, mass murder, than we saw.
 
The four is enough, but he clearly had the ammunition, he had the capacity, and he would have had the time. But for him being essentially isolated and then surrendering because of the -- of the high school security officials.
 
So, that's the first thing. And the second is just, you know, when we do the comparative of these mass shootings, what can we learn is just how quickly they were getting the information out, wondering what was happening? Was the site clear? Could they get the other kids out? And that's important information, because, you know, during the mass shooting, time is really, you know, time is so short. The runway is so short. It was, as we say, that you want to have accurate information that's related to 911, and then, disseminated to others so they can -- they can protect as many lives as possible.
 
ROSALES: Yes, and Juliette, I was talking to Marcee Gray, the mother of the shooter.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KAYYEM: Yes. Yes, I mean -- 
 
ROSALES: And text messages were shared where she said, I don't know what took them so long, because, from her perspective, she called 30 minutes before the shooting began, saying, there's an extreme emergency.
 
KAYYEM: Yes,
 
ROSALES: Is it just something unfortunate that happened in the sense that there was another student in the class with a very similar name that they had pooled moments before -- 
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
ROSALES:  -- thinking that, that was the kid that they were looking for?
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
ROSALES: Or was there anything more that law enforcement three SROs in the school that day could have done differently?
 
KAYYEM: Well, it's really hard. I mean, this mistake is just a tragedy, and part of it is, is that the gunman, Gray, or the student, Gray, who ended up shooting was really unknown to the school.
 
When you actually look at his attendance record, he was -- he was barely there. He is in and out. He is not known he's not a known entity and sort of isolated in this -- in this community. So, that when they get this phone call, you know, yes, it's a mistake. I'm not defending the mistake. On the other hand, this wasn't sort of someone who was making a lot of noise beforehand.
 
The parents -- yes. The arrest of the father is absolutely right. I am a proponent of getting these parents -- treating these parents as essentially assisting a mass murder. The parents had direct knowledge well before that day of the violence that their son wanted to do. And the father, at least, aid and abetted -- aid and abetted it. The mother is clearly trying to serve as sort of a check on it, and can't do so in time.
 
ROSALES: Let's talk about those mobile panic buttons that the teachers had literally on their badges. The sheriff showed me on his phone, 26 of those alerts came in, and that's how he knew there was something seriously going wrong at Apalachee High School.
 
KAYYEM: Right.
 
ROSALES: Do you think that more schools should have technology like this?
 
KAYYEM: Yes. ROSALES: Is that a good preventative measure, or do we need to be discussing more at the root cause of this, as we've seen, lawmakers talking about gun control reform measures, or both?
 
KAYYEM: Yes. All of the above. I mean, at this stage, look, we're the only country that has mass shootings like this, and, in particular, school shootings like this. It -- that is because the means are available. We have -- we have too many of a certain type of gun that can assist mass murders. It is because the laws are too loose, and part of it is just mental health and parental oversight.
 
But, in the moment, this kind of technology is very helpful to simply reduce the harm and to let law enforcement know that there is a real threat out there. And so, there is lots of things that school can do. Schools can do from layered defenses, but that's, you know, there is only so many defenses you can have at some stage. We really do have to get to the root cause issue, which is prevalent in this country.
 
ROSALES: Yes. And as we saw that, AR-15-style rifle bought by -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
ROSALES: In our reporting, bought by Colin Gray -- 
 
KAYYEM: The father.
 
ROSALES:  -- as a holiday gift to his son, months after deputies paid them a home visit asking about potential threats.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 <br>[07:45:01]
 
ROSALES: Juliette Kayyem, thank you so much for your time.
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
BLACKWELL: Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson sat down for an in-depth interview with CNN.
 
She talks about the challenges of juggling a high-pressure career while she was raising two daughters. That's ahead.
 
Plus, Andy Scholes is standing by with sports.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes, Victor. Coming into Friday, Aaron Judge was in the midst of the longest home run drought of his career, but it ended in a big way that sent Yankee Stadium into a frenzy. We'll have that for you up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSALES: Day of college football on tap today, but the action got started last night with a rare top 25 Friday night game.
 <br>[07:50:02]
 
BLACKWELL: Andy Scholes is here. Tell us about it.
 
SCHOLES: Oh, yes. Well, we had some good -- we got some good ones today. I can't wait.
 
You got Wisconsin hosting Alabama. That's a rare matchup there. And you got big rivalry games this afternoon as well.
 
Oregon versus Oregon State in the Civil War, Washington State versus Washington in the Apple Cup. Those two games a little extra spicy this year, since Washington Oregon bailed on the Pac-12 for the Big 10.
 
But last night, we had 14th ranked Kansas State hosting 20th ranked Arizona game tied at seven in the second. Dylan Edwards fielded that punt off the bounce, and look at that gone down the sideline, 71 yards for the score. K-State, it would end up running away with that game, 31-7, the final.
 
All right. Caitlin Clark, meanwhile, making some more WNBA history last night, the rookie sensation, recording her 317th assist in the 2nd, breaking the WNBA single season assist record.
 
Now, this game against the aces was close. Clark here gets the driving layup, cuts Vegas's lead to two with under two to go. Clark finished with 18 points and nine assists, but Kelsey Plum, the dagger three with under a minute to go. Aces beat the Fever in that one, 78-74.
 
U.S. men soccer meanwhile introducing their new coach, Mauricio Pochettino, yesterday. The Argentinian comes to the U.S. after managing Chelsea PSG and Tottenham over the past decade.
 
Now, the U.S. hopes he will be the man to lead them on a deep run when they host the World Cup in 2026.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAURICIO POCHETTINO, HEAD COACH, UNITED STATES MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM: We love to win. We are so competitive, and we need to think in that. We need to think in big and think that we can win. I really care for the women football, soccer, and of course, for us, it's a challenge to match them, you know, to match them.
 
And we need to work really hard to be in the level that the women are showing. It's going to be difficult, but that for us is a huge inspiration for us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: All right. To baseball Aaron Judge was in the longest home run drought of his career, going into last night. Have been 16 games since he hit a dinger, but he ended the drives a big way. Yankees down three, bottom seven to the Red Sox, base is loaded. Judge crushes a grand slam, his 52nd home run of the season. Yankee Stadium just going bonkers. It would hold on to win five before Yankees. Now, got a three-game lead over the Orioles in the A.L. East.
 
All right. You know, finally baseball, it's a tradition, you know, you catch an opposing player's home run, you got to throw it back, right?
 
Well, this Phillies fan, he caught Brandon Nimmo's home run last night. The fan behind him was like, throw it back. But there was also a kid who was a Mets fan two rows behind him, begging for the ball, and he gave it to him.
 
So, guys, what would you have done? You follow the baseball tradition, or you give it to the kid?
 
ROSALES: No. For the kid.
 
BLACKWELL: Give it to the kid. Yes -- 
 
SCHOLES: Give it to the kid? OK.
 
ROSALES: You got to give it to the kid.
 
SCHOLES: The guy in the second row is absolutely not. He wanted that ball thrown back out of to the field.
 
BLACKWELL: And you just know, he complained about it for the rest of the game.
 
ROSALES: Yes.
 
SCHOLES: Yes. When they lost big to the Mets. So, they were going like, gee -- 
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. You need to throw the ball back.
 
SCHOLES: Throw the ball back.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ROSALES: You got (INAUDIBLE) 
 
SCHOLES: We would have come back and won the game, but you tempted the baseball gods, and look what happened.
 
ROSALES: Look what happen.
 
All right, Andy.
 
BLACKWELL: Give it to the kid. Yes.
 
ROSALES: Thank you so much.
 
BLACKWELL: All right.
 
ROSALES: Well, it's a candid conversation with the first black woman to ever serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. After the break, what Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson tells CNN about a contentious moment on the bench involving fellow justice, Clarence Thomas. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:57:51]
 
BLACKWELL: In a rare interview with CNN's Abby Phillip, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is reflecting on her experience on the nation's highest court.
 
ROSALES: Here is what she had to say about disagreements with her fellow justices.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: In the time that you've been on the court, because you have written your own dissents and some pretty big cases, there is disagreement, obviously, among your colleagues over the law. In one case, Justice Thomas, devoted roughly seven pages of his concurring opinion on affirmative action to critique, your opinion, and your dissent.
 
He also read that opinion out loud just feet away from where you're sitting. What was that experience like?
 
JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, you know, dissents are common on the court. One of the nice parts about the collective decision-making model is that the justices have the opportunity to express their views.
 
And then, when you are in the majority, there is a majority opinion that you can sign on to. You can write separately to express your particular take on an issue. And of course, you can dissent. And Justice Thomas, in his concurring opinion, decided to talk about my dissent.
 
In one way, I think I was flattered. I was flattered because it meant that I must have been making points that were worth responding to. But it's a dialog. It's always a dialog with the justices.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: All right, Victor, do you know what time it is?
 
BLACKWELL: I do know what time it is.
 
ROSALES: It's time for "FIRST OF ALL WITH VICTOR BLACKWELL", my favorite time.
 
BLACKWELL: Excellent. Thank you.
 
ROSALES: What do you have going on?
 
BLACKWELL: Listen, we got a lot going on this morning. There is one Haitian American member of Congress right now, and Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is here to react to the dark rhetoric former President Trump keeps pushing about Haitian Americans. A lot of fear in the community and threats. We'll get the response. Plus, I'll speak with a friend of an American activist killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank. She is being laid to rest in Turkey today. But loved ones and members of Congress are now demanding.
 <br>[08:00:04]
 
And later, Alicia Keys and Swiss Beatz. They are prolific musicians, art collectors. I was there as they walk through a new exhibit, featuring work from their collection for the first time on display.
