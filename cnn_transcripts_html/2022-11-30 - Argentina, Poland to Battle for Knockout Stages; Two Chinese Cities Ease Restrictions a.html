BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello. Welcome to our special coverage of the World Cup, here in CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson, 
 
 coming to you live from Doha in Qatar. 
 
Three hours ago, two iconic captains and one big game ahead, with Argentina taking on Poland, here in the knockout stages of the World Cup. 
 
And the pressure is on. Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, second to Poland in the group, and they cannot afford to lose today's game.
 
A point made by World Cup veteran-turned football manager, Mauricio Pochettino, who told my colleague, Amanda Davies, that in a tournament like 
 
 this one, nothing can be taken for granted. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAURICIO POCHETTINO, PLAYED AT 2002 WORLD CUP WITH ARGENTINA: It's going to be a tough game, an emotional game. So important how we are going to manage 
 
 the stress. 
 
Because we saw again, Mexico, how difficult it was. It was very difficult, 45 minutes. Difficult to find the freedom to play. Because during the game, 
 
 we say, oh, I need to win, I need to win. Lots of pressure. 
 
But I think after Mexico and Argentina, they will get the confidence and trust. I think it will be a tough game, a different game, it will be 
 
 different. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That's Pochettino for you.
 
And elsewhere, U.S. goal scorer, Christian Pulisic, insists he will be fit enough to play against the Netherlands this weekend. He got injured as the 
 
 U.S. knocked Iran out of the tournament with that one-nil win. 
 
Well, Amanda Davies is with us for more on another big day here in Doha. 
 
This is the World Cup. Just when you think it can't get any bigger, it does. 
 
Let's talk about the big game coming up, the big face-off, Argentina and Poland, and two big football league starts. There is no one better or 
 
 bigger or better than Messi, although Ronaldo will probably argue on that!
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ANDERSON: Of course, Robert Lewandowski from Poland, playing in that game as well. 
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN ANCHOR, "WORLD SPORT": Yes. I think those are two sides that would have hoped that it had gone better, heading into this one. If we 
 
 were to roll back a few weeks, no one would have thought that this match was set to have the consequences that it will have. 
 
Ultimately, Argentina needs to win. And if they don't, then we are not only potentially facing, definitely facing Argentina's exit, it could possibly 
 
 be the last time we ever see Lionel Messi in an Argentinian shirt. 
 
And after 20 years, everything he has done and won, that would be quite something. It is not how it is meant to end. Of course, he and his team 
 
 will be absolutely doing everything they can to try to avoid that. 
 
But what we saw against Mexico, they were aware of that pressure. They were aware of the emotions behind what they are trying to do. And at times, that 
 
 was stifling for them, until Messi produced that moment of magic, which he is always capable of doing. 
 
So it is fascinating to see how this team would react to this moment, whether they could do it. Because all of us, whether you support Argentina, 
 
 or Poland, I think everybody would love to see him with a few more moments of magic on the international stage. 
 
ANDERSON: France is already through. We knew that before tonight's games. We have them up, Australia and Tunisia, all of them in a position to take 
 
 the other place. France has got some stars in its team.
 
But, my goodness, Mbappe. When we talk about Messi, of course, still in this contest here with Portugal, Mbappe also potentially one of the stars 
 
 of this tournament. 
 
DAVIES: Potentially, one of the stars. Interestingly, in the build up to this game against Tunisia, the coach said I will not get involved with the 
 
 egos. If I want to drop Mbappe for this one, I will drop Mbappe in this one, even if that raises the stakes. And he's followed through.
 
There's quite a change on the French side. Mbappe not starting. And you can understand why. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
DAVIES: Yes. They are through. If they're going to get to the final successfully, and defend their title, that is seven games in the middle of 
 
 the European season. So he is not playing. 
 
I have to say, Tunisia has the better of the chances in that one. They got the ball in the back of the net. The goal did not stand. They need to win 
 
 to give themselves a fighting chance. 
 <br>[11:05:08]
 
But the fact that Australia are still drawing nil-nil with Denmark, that means that, if it remains like this for the second half, it will be 
 
 Australia going through into the last 16, for the first time since 2006.
 
Which would be a huge moment for their coach, Graham Arnold, Arni, as he is known. Not named after Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't think he minds my 
 
 saying that.
 
But Arni was their number-two coach in the Germany World Cup in 2006, the last time they it through to this stage. So he knows what he's talking 
 
 about. 
 
ANDERSON: There will be a lot of fans here, because, as we have been discussing, groupies, since the start of the tournament, this is a 
 
 tournament they host wanted to be for the region, not just, of course, Qatar. 
 
There will be a lot of people here. We hear them. They'll be supporting the Tunisians, because they from regionally North Africa and Arab speaking, of 
 
 course. 
 
Thank you. Always good to have you. 
 
The sports world, there's another big story coming out of this country, outside of the World Cup. Qatar are looking to play a pivotal role in the 
 
 global energy market, especially as Europe works to slash its dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
 
Now, Qatar has announced that it will provide liquefied natural gas for Germany under two new deals. Berlin saying it does not, and I quote them 
 
 here, "expect any energy from Russia anymore."  
 
This comes one week after Qatar Energy signed a 27-year deal to supply China's Sinovac with liquefied natural gas, calling that the longest gas 
 
 supply agreement in the history of the LNG industry. 
 
In the previous hour of CONNECT THE WORLD, I spoke to Qatar's energy minister, Saad Al Kaabi, who joined me here in Doha. 
 
I started by asking him, why Qatar is signing these deals now. 
 
Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAAD AL KAABI, QATAR ENERGY MINISTER: As you know, we have embarked on this expansion exercise, if you will. And we will announce later the expansion 
 
 of our energy production from 77 to 126 million.
 
ANDERSON: That's significant.
 
AL KAABI: And it is going to come online in 2026. And also some volume will come from the U.S., in 2024. 
 
We have been working very hard on putting together sales agreements on all the volume that we will bring online, which you have heard is just two 
 
 deals, the Chinese deal and the German deal. Two of many deals that we are working on. 
 
And people are lining up really. And we could be really oversold in the next year or two, with people from around the world. 
 
ANDERSON: That's fascinating. 
 
And the Chinese deal, a 27-year deal. The German deal? A 15-year deal. I know how important it is. We should impress upon our viewers how important 
 
 that is for a producer like you. 
 
You get these long-term deals locked in. You don't want to look at these kinds of short-term deals. So, why 15 years with the Germans? 
 
AL KAABI: Most of the deals you hear about going forward are 25, 27-year deals, the long-term deals we are looking at and we're discussing with many 
 
 people, the 27-year deals.
 
The deal that we signed yesterday, it is a 27-year deal. The reason we've have announced as 15 years-plus is because Germany has put the restriction 
 
 of their requirement to import gas into Germany, at that point. 
 
So if you take from 26, 15 years from 2026 when we started taking gas into Germany, then it stops when the German government says that we want to stop 
 
 gas. 
 
We don't think that will happen. We probably need it for longer, it will be available for longer. And it'll be available for longer. But the actual 
 
 deal is to go for longer. If that's not for Germany, we will go somewhere else. 
 
ANDERSON: The German Chancellor Scholz says this deal is an important building block in the country's strategy to wean itself off of Russian gas. 
 
 It had a significance dependence on Russian gas. 
 
Do you think that you will play a very significant part in replacing that gas in the European energy market? 
 
AL KAABI: We have worked with them, even before Ukraine, we went and have broad capacity, to France, to the terminal, the olive green in the U.K. We 
 
 have the largest energy terminal in the U.K. 
 
So we have been working on that because of the expansion to have a big chunk of business in Europe. Europe is a very important continent for the 
 
 gas business. So we have already been planning for a supply to Europe before Ukraine. 
 
What the war in Ukraine war has done is turned some, like the Germans, who did not want any energy import, to have zero energy, going to about five in 
 
 the very near future. 
 <br>[11:10:02]
 
So it's really, it is the change, if you will, in import requirements in Germany that is changing it. 
 
Our plan has always been to serve Europe and Asia. So we look probably 10 years from now, to probably be a 50 percent, Europe 50 percent, Asia market 
 
 mix. It could be skewed to 60/40, depending on how deals work out. 
 
ANDERSON: That is a significant change, that which you currently have? 
 
AL KAABI: Not really. When you look at what we serve as a market, we have a terminal in Italy. We're serving in the U.K., 20 percent of the gas, energy 
 
 that goes into the U.K.'s from Qatar.
 
So we have already been in Europe.
 
ANDERSON: I want --
 
AL KAABI: We are just expanding. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: That was Saad Al Kaabi speaking to me earlier. 
 
Coming up on the show, it is a brutal disease that strips people of their independents and memories. One experimental drug is providing some hope for 
 
 treating Alzheimer's. That, after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Protests still forming in some parts of China despite a security crackdown and stark warnings from government officials. 
 
Since the protests broke out last week, CNN has verified 23 COVID-related demonstrations in 17 cities across the country. 
 
Now, in many of those cities, the streets have been cleared. But there are pockets of defiance. Videos have emerged showing new confrontations between 
 
 protesters and police. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(SHOUTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: In the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou, on Tuesday night, protesters threw bottles at police and security forces, who responded with 
 
 tear gas. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(CHANTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Similar scenes in nearby Donwane (ph). People there shouting "lift the lockdown" at a COVID-19 testing site. 
 
And in the eastern city of Ginowan, protesters clashed with security forces using police barriers to hold them back. 
 
CNN's Ivan Watson now joins me from Hong Kong. 
 
Ivan, we are hearing announcements today in a couple of Chinese cities, there's some easing of their strict zero COVID policies. What do we 
 
 understand to be the details at this point? Is it clear whether that will quell these demonstrations? 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think it is too early to say. What we do know is there seems to be a two-pronged approach 
 
 that the Chinese government is taking to this unrest. 
 <br>[11:14:59]
 
On the one hand, the security forces are vowing to strike hard, not to tolerate protests whatsoever. They are pursuing all the levers of this 
 
 police state being used to intimidate, to censor, and to try to put a stop to this. 
 
On the other hand, you have health officials and city government announcing that they are going to ease some of the restrictions that have created so 
 
 much discontent, hardship in the first place. 
 
I think the southern city of Guangzhou, where you show those remarkable images from Tuesday night, is an incredible test case for this two-pronged 
 
 approach. 
 
Tuesday night, you have riot police in hazmat suits with shields, confronting, clashing with residents in that city. 
 
And then the next day, city officials were announcing that they were going to lift lockdowns from four of the cities districts. But they are also 
 
 going to stop demanding that anybody who is considered a close contact of a COVID case has to go to government quarantine. 
 
These are all of the kinds of measures China has been imposing on the population now for several years, again, triggering all of this anger.
 
And we have seen Shanghai, its government lifting lockdowns in at least 11 districts. Beijing announcing it will reduce some of its demands for 
 
 mandatory testing of the population there. 
 
The news of the protests has not been anywhere in the state media, Becky. 
 
However, the big news right now is the passing of the former Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin, who died at the age of 96, of health problems linked 
 
 to leukemia. 
 
The government is coming out and saying he is basically an important statesman. And the current leader, Xi Jinping has announced his deep 
 
 condolences. 
 
Xi Jinping is actually going to be the chairman of the funeral committee for Jiang Zemin's state funeral, which we anticipate will be coming in the 
 
 days and weeks ahead. 
 
A big question, though, is at this tense time, how will the Chinese government deal with potential, spontaneous gatherings of people to 
 
 commemorate the death of Jiang Zemin? We see calls already for vigils on university campuses, for example. 
 
It is clear that the Chinese government does not want gatherings that it can't control right now. That will be something to watch very closely in 
 
 the days ahead. 
 
There's some historical precedence for vigils and commemorations after the passing of a senior Communist Party official, to then lead to further 
 
 unrest. I am talking about 1989, over here -- Becky? 
 
ANDERSON: Ivan Watson's in Hong Kong. Ivan, thank you. 
 
The sports world is buzzing about Tuesday's dramatic match between the U.S. and Iran. Why? Because of the tension off of the field in the run up to the 
 
 game, one peppered with political implications between countries who are rivals on the world stage. 
 
U.S. President Joe Biden relishing the victory. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: United States beat Iran one- nothing! The U.S. won! Iran, zero! We did it!  
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(CHEERING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ANDERSON: Certainly not disguising his delight there. 
 
One of the big questions for the U.S. is the fate of star player, Christian Pulisic, who have scored the game's only goal. He was taken to hospital 
 
 after a brutal collision with Iran's goalie. 
 
But the U.S. Coach had some good news after the game. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GREG BERHALTER, HEAD COACH, U.S. MEN'S FOOTBALL TEAM: So, he seems to be doing good. Spoke with him a couple of minutes ago. 
 
We can get him on the training field tomorrow. Hopefully, he will be ready for the game against the Netherlands. 
 
In terms of his contribution to the group, I have said all along, when one of your most talented players is also one of your most hardest workers, you 
 
 know you are in a good spot. And that exemplifies Christian. 
 
Feels good, you know? I think it is about focus. Like, we are not done. It is nice to get to the next round, but we want to keep going. 
 
We had two tournaments we were looking at, the group-stage tournament and the knockout tournament. We are now here to knockout. We want to keep this 
 
 thing rolling. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Iran's coach lamented the end of his team's tournament, saying he thought they played well enough to advance, but he also praised 
 
 the U.S. squads effort. 
 
On the political front he said, things need to change at the World Cup. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:20:11]
 
CARLOS QUEIROZ, HEAD COACH, IRANIAN MEN'S FOOTBALL TEAM: I will say that this World Cup, the violence is not acceptable. It is disgusting. Nations, 
 
 governments all over the place, disturbing the game, disturbing the football, disturbing the World Cup. 
 
I think something must be reviewed. Because our mission, the footballers, the professionals, this is a big part of the entertainment, in the 
 
 business. We bring smiles to people, happiness. 
 
And in this way, we are damaging the game, we are damaging the spirit of the game. So if the goal, it is to create wars and confrontations between 
 
 people, some guys there are doing a good job. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, in the wake of the U.S. victory, there was something surprising on the streets of several Iranian cities, or perhaps not so 
 
 surprising. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(CHEERING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Some Iranians -- some Iranians actually celebrating that you as win over their home country. Most of the celebration involved protesters, 
 
 who see the U.S. win as a blow to Iran's Islamic regime. They feel it was sort of co-opting the team's performance here. 
 
Iran has been rocked by protests in recent months, but people seeking better treatment of women and more openness in their society. 
 
Well, there's little question that the political struggle between the U.S. and Iran brought an extra attention to that football match. 
 
"Washington Post" columnist, Ishaan Tharoor, wrote, and I quote him here:
 
"For Iran, you can tell an entire political story in the span of a generation that bridges American victory in Qatar are, an American feat to 
 
 Iran in Lyon, 24 years ago. Unlike in 1998, there was no shared group photo of this year's U.S. and writing players standing together in an appeal for 
 
 uniting the power of sports."  
 
Ishaan Tharoor joins me now here. 
 
I enjoyed reading your perspective this morning, in the "Washington Post," Ishaan. 
 
You were at the game last night? 
 
ISHAAN THAROOR, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, "WASHINGTON POST": That's right.
 
ANDERSON: So, let's reflect on what you saw on the pitch, because I know you are a big football fan, and then how that fits into the wider story. 
 
THAROOR: Well, it was a tense game, of course, a tense affair. The Iranians knew they had to avoid defeat. The Americans knew they had to win. 
 
The narrative was already built. The tension was powerful, especially as the game stretched on and the Americans basically clawed out a narrow 
 
 victory, as narrow as it was. 
 
The Iranian fans in the stands were so loud, the atmosphere was great. It was fraught in many ways. 
 
I think, as you said, there has been this narrative of these two powers. They have a long history of amity. But on the pitch, that played second 
 
 fiddle to the internal Iranian story. 
 
ANDERSON: I think that was the point. It was very clear in the stands. I was there as well. You could see that there were supporters who were really 
 
 conflicted about whether they wanted a win for their team. 
 
Iranians are so passionate about their football team, but who are anti- regime, or certainly protesters. And there were supporters, for all intents and purposes, who aren't regime supporters, there. 
 
And you can feel that tension. You are right, it was palpable, last night. 
 
THAROOR: I spoke to fans before the game began, from a really wide geography of places. This is the crucible, here, Canada, Australia, the 
 
 UAE, et cetera. And I think all of them were supporting their team. Some or the jerseys of 1998, with that defeat of the U.S.. 
 
But they all stress, we see this team as a reflection of the people of Iran, not of the regime. Yes, you heard on the anthem played, some people 
 
 are whistling and jeering the anthem. 
 
But I think that the strong message of supporters who were there in the stadium, cheering this team on is that we see this team as a reflection of 
 
 ourselves, not of the political forces at play. 
 
We know this team has faced a lot of pressure from regime authorities, families facing pressure to not join the protests, in any meaningful way. 
 
 And I think there's a lot of sympathy among the fans I spoke to for what these players had to cope with. 
 
And then at the same time, as I am sure you also saw, they were disturbances in the crowd. There were clashes between pro-regime, regime 
 
 sympathizers and opponents to the regime, and the diaspora. Those were quite real as well. 
 <br>[11:25:01]
 
ANDERSON: It was very -- it was a really, really interesting game to be at. You are right, the last seven minutes really felt like the U.S. was climbed 
 
 out a victory. 
 
By the way, on the pitch, I think, by far, they were the best team on the pitch for the entirety of that 90 minutes. 
 
Carlos Queiroz, the coach, we heard from ahead of you and I talking, I thought rather naively, he called on the world to keep politics off of the 
 
 pitch, and in the dressing room. 
 
We have to be on the moon to think about how, unfortunately, sport as a whole, football particularly, it gets messy, doesn't it? 
 
I think it was Nelson Mandela who said sport has the power to change the world, if for the right reasons, and everybody applauds a platform that is 
 
 a sports field. 
 
But this has been a very -- you felt the policies around this tournament, specifically, haven't you? 
 
THAROOR: This is the meta-narrative of the World Cup. The World Cup is the single most important event to most people around the world stage. It's a 
 
 crucible of cultures, of nations. 
 
As such, it reflects real passion and meaning for the world, it takes up a lot of meaning. Often, that meeting is political. 
 
With this World Cup, it's obvious that they want to keep politics at bay. You can't do that. This is a clear example of that. 
 
ANDERSON: I know you had a lot of brownie points with your editors back in B.C., to be sent here today to do this geopolitical column on the World 
 
 Cup. 
 
What other stories are you looking at? Talk to me about how actually coming here, rather than sitting, watching and reporting on this from afar, is 
 
 important? 
 
THAROOR: I think this is a deeply unique World Cup. Obviously, it has been built, the narrative around it has been quite contentious. There's a lot of 
 
 debate around the ethics of Qatar staging it, in the way that it was staged. 
 
But it is a unique experience, the fact that you and I can go to multiple games in one day is remarkable. The infrastructure here is incredible.
 
It's also important that I think we come to a part of the world that is quite alien and different to the West, and to many of my readers, and show 
 
 them this is a part of our identity as well. This is part of the lived experience of millions of people.
 
And I think the Qatari, talk to many officials here, they don't see this as a World Cup for the West, but for people who usually can't go to the West. 
 
You have lots of visitors from Africa, parts of Asia who are able to come to this World Cup. 
 
I have been spending a lot of time talking to all sorts of people from various corners of the world, who are uniting here in Doha, in complicated 
 
 circumstances, for sure. 
 
But this is the World Cup. And this is the place to be. 
 
ANDERSON: Good stuff. Glad you are here. Good to have you on. Always a pleasure. 
 
THAROOR: My pleasure.
 
ANDERSON: Ishaan Tharoor, thank you very much, indeed. 
 
Just to update you, there's a match going on at the present, and you and I kept one eye on this only because we heard that roar behind us just before 
 
 we started this conversation. 
 
Tunisia is actually one up against the French. The French don't have to win this match. They are already through. 
 
But to the point we were discussing, this is a tournament, hosted by Qatar. They always promised it will be a tournament for the region, and the wider 
 
 region, the Arab world, the Muslim world. 
 
So should the Tunisians beat the French tonight, and should they get through -- because there's a whole lot of permutations here -- but should 
 
 they get through, that will be good for the tournament. 
 
THAROOR: That's right.
 
ANDERSON: Really, really good for this tournament. So, I wish them luck. 
 
THAROOR: And the Saudis and the --  
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Absolutely!  And the Saudis against Mexico, later on tonight. Absolutely, they could still get through. It has been great. 
 
Thank you. 
 
THAROOR: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: All right, let's take a short break. Back after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:31:13]
 
ANDERSON: America's top diplomat says heat, water and electricity are the Russian president's new targets. Antony Blinken calls that a brutalization 
 
 of Ukraine's people and says the targeting of civilians is, and I quote him here, "barbaric." 
 
He is vowing ironclad support for Kyiv in a two-day meeting in Romania. That is a NATO meeting. 
 
In the meantime, Russia has bombed more than a third of Ukraine's electricity and water supply in the past few weeks. 
 
The U.S. and NATO are pledging more arms and more equipment to help Ukraine restore its decimated infrastructure. 
 
The U.S. secretary of state says NATO is also looking to invest in Soviet- era weapons systems in Ukraine. 
 
Antony Blinken spoke to my colleague, Christiane Amanpour, on Wednesday. Here's part of what he said. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: We are now very focused on air-defense systems. Not just us, many other countries. We are working to make sure the 
 
 Ukrainians get those systems as quickly as possible.
 
But also as effectively as possible, making sure they are trained on them, that they have the ability to maintain them. And all of that has to come 
 
 together, and it is. 
 
We have a very deliberate process established by the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, in Ramstein, Germany, that meets regularly to make sure the 
 
 Ukrainians are getting what they need, when they need it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: To hear more of that interview right here on CNN tonight, London, 6:00 p.m. Abu Dhabi time, if that is where you are watching, 10:00 p.m. 
 
Let's take you to the front lines now in Ukraine, and to what is a brutal battle in one critical city. 
 
Fierce fighting is underway in the city of Bakhmut. That is where Russia is sending wave after wave of its forces. One Ukrainian commander says it 
 
 feels like one constant nonstop assault. 
 
CNN's Matthew Chance has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(GUNFIRE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The brutal fight for Bakhmut --
 
(GUNFIRE)
 
CHANCE -- where Ukrainian troops are battling Russia's onslaught. 
 
(GUNFIRE)
 
CHANCE: These exclusive images --
 
(SCREAMING)
 
CHANCE: -- are from the soldiers themselves. Their commanders tell us dozens of lives are now being sacrificed here every day. 
 
The road into town is heavy with thick smoke and danger. 
 
(EXPLOSION)
 
CHANCE: Explosions ahead force us to pull over before another slams into a building close by. 
 
(EXPLOSION)
 
CHANCE (on camera): All right. Well, you can hear the incoming rounds. The incoming rounds from Russian artillery fire are really intensive here as we 
 
 have entered the outskirts of Bakhmut, which is certainly, from everything we're seeing, everything we've been told, is now the most fiercely-
 
 contested patch of ground in the entire Russia/Ukrainian conflict. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Quickly, quickly. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Quickly, quickly.
 
CHANCE: OK. Let's go.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): So fierce, we made a rapid exit, leaving the relentless barrage behind. 
 
(on camera): (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
(voice-over): Much of this battle is fought avoiding the artillery threat, in underground bunkers like these, where local Ukrainian commanders like 
 
 Pavlo (ph) can respond to Russian attacks. 
 
"They're assaulting our positions from early morning until night," he tells me. "But the real problem is we are heavily outnumbered," he says. 
 <br>[11:35:06]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
CHANCE: But the innovative use of low-cost tech is helping to bridge that gap. 
 
In another frontline bunker, we saw how commercially-available drones are giving Ukraine an edge. 
 
(on camera): Wow. That's incredible. We've just seen an artillery strike in this position that the Ukrainian drone operators have identified as being 
 
 full of Russians. 
 
You can see Russian soldiers, as we look at them live now, running for cover as Ukrainian artillery pounds their positions. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is our position.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): But battery commanders at the front line, like Tuman (ph), tell me they're now running low on ammunition rounds. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
CHANCE: That even guns sent from the United States are breaking under such constant strain. 
 
(GUNFIRE)
 
CHANCE: They need more of both, they say, if this battle for Bakhmut is ever to be won.

CHANCE: Matthew Chance, CNN, in Bakhmut --

CHANCE: -- Eastern Ukraine.

ANDERSON: Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories on our radar right now. 
 
Spanish police are investigating an explosion at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid. The interior ministry says one employee who was handling a letter 
 
 there was slightly injured and was taken to hospital. 
 
Ukraine has ramped up security at all of its embassies. Spain, and NATO countries, sending military equipment to Ukraine. 
 
The Ukrainian first lady has met with Britain's queen consort during a Buckingham Palace reception, hosted by Camilla. Elena Zelenskyy says it was 
 
 an honor to meet her. She told the royal about families being divided because of Russia's war in Ukraine. 
 
Well, to an exciting development in the fight against Alzheimer's disease now. We are getting detailed data at this point. 
 
A clinical trial shows a new experimental drug does appear to counteract the effects of Alzheimer's and is one of the first treatments to 
 
 potentially slow the decline of brain function in someone already with the disease. 
 
Senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, joining me now. 
 
You have been looking into this new drug. Just how promising is it at this point? 
 
DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Becky, it is promising. But I don't want anyone to think it is a cure, or if someone 
 
 they love had Alzheimer's, took it, they would be fine. That is not what this drug is, and it also has side effects. 
 
Let's take a look at what it does do. The drug companies gathered together 1,800 people, with some mild to moderate early stage Alzheimer's diseases 
 
 between the ages of 50 and 90. 
 
Half of them got a placebo, half of them got the drug. The half that got the drug, their cognitive decline did slow down, 27 percent slower than the 
 
 folks who did not get the drug.
 
But they did still have a cognitive decline. It was not as fast as the folks who got the placebo. That's important.
 
Also, the amyloid levels dropped. Amyloids, that's those plaques you see brains of folks with Alzheimer's almost levels dropped. That's a good 
 
 thing. 
 
Here is the important question. How helpful are those measurements? Even if those two things happened, does it matter to the person with Alzheimer's? 
 
Would they feel a difference? Would they be able to function better? And is it worth the risks of the drug? Because they did find some adverse effects. 
 
Let's take a look at that. So, when they looked at the folks who took the drugs, 17 percent of them had brain swelling -- sorry, brain bleeding, and 
 
 12.6 percent of them had brain swelling. Now that is not good.
 
Some of the folks who took the placebo also had that, but not nearly as high as a percentage. 
 
Now the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and other regulatory authorities around the world, have a decision to make, is this drug helpful enough that 
 
 it is worth these risks? 
 
The authors of the paper themselves say that this needs to be done in order to look at the efficacy and safety of this drug more closely -- Becky? 
 
ANDERSON: Elizabeth, thank you. 
 
Elizabeth Cohen on the story for you. 
 
Well, the men's World Cup is in full swing. You can hear some of these supporters I am sure. They are behind me. Tunisians up one-nil against the 
 
 French at present. That is one of the reasons why it is no easy here in Doha.
 
But it is the women who are making some big headlines. And an all-female referee crew is set to make history in an upcoming match. The coach of the 
 
 Saudi women's national team joins me next to discuss that and more.
 <br>[11:40:07]
 
That's after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: The men's World Cup is dominating the airwaves right now, rightly so. But women are still making headlines in this sporting world. 
 
Thursday will be a historic day on the field as Costa Rica take on Germany here in Doha. It won't be historic because of the players on the pitch. 
 
 France's Stephanie Threatpoa (ph) will be the first woman to lead an all- female referee team in a men's World Cup. 
 
And get this, the U.S. women's national team is also making waves, without playing a single match yet. 
 
They will make more money from the U.S. men's team, getting to the knockout phase of this year 's World Cup, as they did when they beat the Iranians 
 
 last night, then the women did when they won their tournaments back in 2015 and 2019. 
 
And that is as a result of the equal pay agreement, put together earlier this year. 
 
Well, I want to turn to one place in this region making incredible progress in the world of women sports. That is Saudi Arabia. It's only been since 
 
 2017 that women in the country were allowed inside stadiums, yet alone, to play this beautiful game. 
 
My next guest, Monika Staab, helped launch their women's national football team in the country last year, becoming the first ever head coach in the 
 
 process. 
 
Staab is a former player, and now a leading pioneer and advocate for women's football across the globe. We're absolutely thrilled to have Doha 
 
 to talk to all of this.
 
Let's -- let's just start with the great accomplishment, which is getting the Saudi women's team up and running. 
 
I remember the lesion of 2030, back in 2016, when the crown prince, then crown prince, promised that support would play a significant role in his 
 
 vision for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for both men and women. 
 
And it was quite a stretch to really believe that vision was going to have some substance. And here we are in 2022, I am talking to you, the coach of 
 
 the Saudis women's team. 
 
How -- tell me, quality, interest, appetite, ambition? 
 
MONIKA STAAB, COACH, SAUDI WOMEN'S NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM: Well, this is a lot at once. But these women like to play football, like all the man and 
 
 boys playing all over the world.
 
And these girls and women are so passionate. And they are happy to have a league where we have established. 
 <br>[11:45:04]
 
We have done the first international games in January, and February in the Maldives. We won these first two matches. And every girl was so proud to 
 
 play for their country. 
 
They have over 700 registered players for the national team. So we have 400 coming. And that was -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: They will be taking an inspiration from the men here. I don't want to spend too much time talking about men's soccer, because you know we 
 
 can talk about women's soccer, but they will be taking some inspiration, won't they, from the results? 
 
And they play against -- and they play against Mexico, and they have a chance at getting through to the knockout stages. 
 
What has that meant to the young women in Saudi Arabia that you've been speaking to? 
 
STAAB: Tremendous. Because all of them are coming here, and all of them are supporting the men. 
 
And when I started last year in September, my first visit was in the stadium, men's game qualification. And I saw so many women in the stadium. 
 
 The grandmothers, the grandchild, daughters, everyone was there and cheering for that man. 
 
ANDERSON: So the legendary Pele, has tweeted a while back with the signed Saudi jersey after congratulating the team on its first official victory. 
 
 What does that type of support mean to you? 
 
STAAB: Oh, it meant a lot when we were in the Maldives. We were all delighted that it comes out in the whole world that Saudi Arabia have the 
 
 women's national team. 
 
And they have been playing since 2008. And that, since 2019, they have the women's committee. So the president, the GFS is supporting.
 
We have three lovely women. I call them Amelia, Latvia, and Atsia (ph). And they are full of passion. And they want to go to the World Cup one day. And 
 
 that inspires me to come to Saudi Arabia and support. This 
 
ANDERSON: It is the women's World Cup next year. As I understand it, at present, they haven't qualified so they won't be fully a team. 
 
How soon will they make it to the World Cup? What is your vision? 
 
STAAB: We have now started with three academies in Jeta, in Rhea. The moms, with young girls from age 5 to 17. We do a lot of coach education, so we 
 
 get a lot of female coaches. 
 
And we -- for the AFC championship in 2026. It will be given tomorrow to the AFC. And this is a great opportunity for the home country to host that 
 
 tournament. 
 
ANDERSON: We spoke to Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, who is the kingdom's sports minister, last week. Listen to what he told me about 
 
 Saudi's commitment to funding. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRINCE ABDULAZIZ BIN TURKI AL-FAISAL, SAUDI ARABIAN SPORTS MINISTER: We have invested a lot in sports in the past couple of years. This showcases 
 
 the results. 
 
The Saudi league has also invested a lot. We've invested in the Saudi league and teams and really restructuring sports in the kingdom as an 
 
 ecosystem. 
 
And how do we make it as professional as anywhere else in the world? Because we know that Saudis are passionate about sports. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: I know you will be seeing the benefits of that investment. 
 
We spent earlier on about the all-female referee team at the World Cup tomorrow. You are a huge advocate for furthering the opportunity for women 
 
 in the sport. 
 
Just how powerful an image is that refereeing team going to be here tomorrow? 
 
STAAB: This is unbelievable. In women's football, over 53 years, and to go to World Cup that women can do like the men, I think that is a big sign for 
 
 the whole world. 
 
Like we, in Saudi Arabia, we play football. That has a great impact on every Muslim girl who wants to play and all the women. So I think going the 
 
 next step further, that whatever men can do women can do. 
 
ANDERSON: I have to leave it there. I can't top that. I'm going to leave our viewers with that thought. 
 
Thank you very much, indeed. 
 
STAAB: You're welcome.
 
ANDERSON: Very best of luck --
 
STAAB: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: -- for the girls and women of Saudi Arabia. 
 
All, right when we come back
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let it bounce on the floor, and then trying to catch. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: Hey, how about that? All right. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, they call it the beautiful game for a reason. I learned a trick or two from a freestyler here in Doha. Stay tuned.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:49:27]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my goodness, gracious. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Right, some crunch games happening some crunch games happening right now at the World Cup. Both in the final minutes. 
 
At this, point Denmark is playing Australia for a place in the knockouts. Australia will leave that game, one-nil. 
 
In the other game, Tunisian as one up against France. Tunisia fighting for a spot in the group stages. France, of course, have already qualified. As 
 
 things stay as they, it will actually be France-Australia, one-two, through to the knockout stages. 
 
But we are still playing. In that France Tunisian game, there are eight minutes of extra time. So five minutes to. 
 
The big reason for the French results, i.e., them getting through before this game, is the goals scored by Kylian Mbappe, from the start of the 
 
 match tonight. He's on the pitch now. 
 
He's got his team through, with a game to spare, of course. He has been electric in these opening games. This isn't a surprise. 
 
I spoke with the superstar in Dubai this time last year and we talked about his ambition for this World Cup. It was very clear at the time. Have a 
 
 listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KILIAN MBAPPE, FRENCH SOCCER PLAYER: Very exciting. I feel this atmosphere in the group. It is really exciting. 
 
We are ready to do something great. We can make history. And we have to try to do back-to-back. 
 
Of course, there's so many themes and it is hard to win the World Cup because it is just one game. If you lose, you go home. But we are ready to 
 
 try. Because we have the team. 
 
We are a big country with us. Everybody with us. All the people are behind the team. So that is the most important thing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Mbappe not quite having the impact he'd like off the bench. In a couple of hours, his PSG teammate, Argentine football icon, Messi, set to 
 
 take to the pitch in what could be his last World Cup match. That is if his side don't get a decisive interview against Poland right now. 
 
The prospect of that is devastating for many Argentine fans who are some of the most passionate fans of this beautiful game. 
 
To get their mind off tonight's match, and to help me get ready for my potential debut in next year's women's World Cup, I caught up with Charlie, 
 
 who is an Argentine freestyle champion. That was earlier today. 
 
Have a look at this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, if you are a regular viewer, you would've seen some of my interviews of the world's greatest footballers. 
 
You are here with us at the World Cup. What you have never seen is my touch. 
 
OK, not great, but I know a man who can teach me. 
 
(MUSIC)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let it bounce on the floor, and then trying to catch. 
 
Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: Hey, how about that? All right. 
 
(MUSIC)
 
ANDERSON: So what does the hardest move that you have? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One, two, three. 
 
ANDERSON: Oh, my goodness gracious. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ANDERSON: He is the two-time world champion freestyle footballing great. 
 
When did you start playing football? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I started playing football at the age when I was very young. Then at the age of 15, I was really a fan of Ronaldo.
 <br>[11:55:04]
 
So I started copying him that he was doing not only kicking the ball, but also doing tricks. So I started with those tricks, and after, I discovered 
 
 freestyle. 
 
ANDERSON: How big is this World Cup for you as an Argentinian? This is, of course, likely to be Messi's last big tournament. Just give me a sense of 
 
 what it feels back home? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he scored the last match, I think every Argentinian was crying. We were crying because we want -- we also have too much 
 
 patience, yes in Argentina. I really feel that I can cry when I start speaking about our players. 
 
ANDERSON: Do you think they can win? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I hope. 
 
ANDERSON: How big would that be? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really big. Really big. 
 
ANDERSON: Amazing. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you.
 
Good luck.

ANDERSON: That is it from our sports tonight. Stay with CNN.
