ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks for joining me here for the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Erica Hill in New York in today for my colleague, 
 
 Becky Anderson. One week and one day until Election Day here in the United States. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris now making their final pitches to 
 
 voters in those critical battleground states.
 
In Gaza, meantime, the United Nations warning everyone in the north of the Enclave is at risk of dying.
 
And Iran vowing to respond to Israel's weekend attack, but says it does not seek war.
 
Two candidates, two very different closing messages as we enter this final week of the U.S. presidential campaign. Kamala Harris telling voters she 
 
 wants to find common ground and build coalitions as she canvases the key battleground states. Donald Trump upping the ante on his anti-immigrant 
 
 message at a rally here in New York on Sunday night, going all in, featuring a number of speakers who echoed that dark, fear-filled rhetoric.
 
Before taking the stage, a host of Trump loyalists unleashed demeaning, vulgar, racist rants, including this one from comedian and podcast host 
 
 Tony Hinchcliffe where he went after the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TONY HINCHCLIFFE, COMEDIAN: I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right 
 
 now. Yes. I think it's called Puerto Rico.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Democrats and a number of Republicans voicing outrage immediately after those comments and others were made at the rally. House Democrat 
 
 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is Puerto Rican as well, weighing in on CNN just a short time ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): There's really nothing that's an accident about what was said last night. It is an authentic depiction of 
 
 how Donald Trump believes and what he thinks about Puerto Rico. He even talked about selling Puerto Rico and brought up the idea of selling Puerto 
 
 Rico when he was president of United States. This is what these people believe, and it's not a joke.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Harris's running mate Tim Walz calling Tony Hinchcliffe "A Jackwad." Hinchcliffe then responded to the criticism on X with this. These people 
 
 have no sense of humor. Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his busy schedule to analyze a joke taken out of context to 
 
 make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone. Watched the whole set. I'm a comedian, Tim. Might be time to 
 
 change your tampon.
 
Steven Contorno is back with us this hour from St. Petersburg, Florida. The classy retorts just keep on coming, Steve. So in terms of this, what I 
 
 found most fascinating, I have to say, perhaps not the extent to some of the comments, but the fact that the Trump campaign was actually looking to 
 
 distance itself specifically from those comments about Puerto Rico.
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes. The campaign putting out a statement Erica saying, "this joke does not reflect the views of 
 
 President Trump or the campaign Republican members of Congress also responding negatively." One person calling it racist, another not funny and 
 
 not true and a third-class list. All those came from Republicans who represent the state of Florida in Congress, and that is noteworthy because 
 
 it has the largest diaspora of Puerto Ricans in the United States.
 
But a large number of them are also in Pennsylvania. So, the fallout from those remarks, at least the Democratic side, is the belief that potentially 
 
 this could help them there. I will point out though Erica I have covered Florida politics for quite some time, and when Trump disparaged Puerto Rico 
 
 in the past, when he threw paper towels at the crowds in response to Hurricane Maria, when he suggested that the death toll from Maria was being 
 
 inflated to make him look bad.
 
The conventional wisdom suggested that that would have a negative reaction and the Puerto Rican community at the polls. And that wasn't the case In 
 
 Florida. We saw some of the most heavily Puerto Rican counties actually vote more for Trump in 2020 than they did in 2016. So that all that is to 
 
 say that while the message from last night and the dark rhetoric that we saw from the former president has the potential to offend many Americans.
 
The Trump campaign has long operated under the assumption that Donald Trump, for whatever reason, can say certain things or have people close to 
 
 him say certain things, and that doesn't have the political ramifications with a lot of people. It's very much true of his closing message to 
 
 Americans as well. Take a listen to what he has to say about immigration and a topic that you would expect certain people to take offense to remarks 
 
 like this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion of our country ends and the restoration of our country 
 
 begins. We will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail. I'm going to kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible.
 <br>[10:05:04]
 
I'm here by calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or law enforcement officer.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CONTORNO: So, the distance between that comment from the former president and the joke that was made earlier in the night by that comedian really 
 
 isn't -- there isn't that much distance between them. And the Trump campaign at this point has saying that, look, if you were offended by Trump 
 
 in his first presidency, and you chose not to vote for him in 2020 there's little we're going to do at this point to convince you to come back.
 
So, our goal is to drive out our base and to find people who are disengaged from the political process and try to get them involved in these closing 
 
 weeks. That has been their focus, trying to turn out people who they believe would be supportive, have tendencies that suggest they are 
 
 conservative, or at least are Trump supporters and get them to show up to the polls. More so than trying to convince some sort of mushy middle where 
 
 that that is somehow the belief that they might go for Trump in a second to go around here.
 
HILL: Well, and we've seen, right? That this is -- I mean, look, a lot of it is baked in. The outrage is baked in when it comes to comments from the 
 
 former president and his supporters. And that's something that, frankly, Democrats have not figured out how to message around as much as they may 
 
 want to hammer home an argument of how dangerous they see Donald Trump as being in a second term in office. For the people who they're trying to 
 
 bring over, it's not having a lot of success.
 
CONTORNO: That's exactly right. And actually, we saw a Super PAC supporting vice president Harris over the weekend, warning about just this in a memo 
 
 they put out from future forward, they said that the cons -- the over amplification of John Kelly's remarks about Donald Trump being fascist and 
 
 leaning too heavily into that argument had -- could have a negative effect and was not nearly as persuasive as talking about the economy or talking 
 
 about what she would do if she is elected president.
 
And that reverberates this week, where we are now seeing a 24-hour news cycle where we are still talking about Donald Trump's rally and potentially 
 
 overshadowing her own closing message and what she would like to focus on, rather than what Donald Trump is saying and what his supporters are saying.
 
HILL: Yes. Buckle up. It's going to be a busy eight days. Steve, appreciate it. Thank you.
 
A shocking, sobering warning today from the U.N. The entire population of Northern Gaza is at risk of dying. That assessment coming from the U.N.'s 
 
 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
 
Israel, meantime, says it's nearly one-month long assault in and around the Jabari refugee camp, aimed at it says rooting out Hamas will continue for 
 
 at least a few more weeks. Meantime, there is growing concern that Palestinians could soon lose a main lifeline for food, medicine and other 
 
 aid. The Israeli Knesset this hour taking up legislation that would severely limit operations by the U.N. agency known as UNRWA in Gaza and the 
 
 West Bank.
 
Jeremy Diamond joining us now from Jerusalem with more. Jeremy, first on that ominous warning from this -- from this U.N. agency about Northern 
 
 Gaza. The fact that the entire population is at risk of dying is the -- perhaps the most stark we've heard yet.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It is a very stark warning and it comes after weeks of U.N. and other humanitarian officials 
 
 warning that the situation in northern Gaza is indeed growing untenable. And it is all very much coming to a head between the combination of the 
 
 intense bombardment by the Israeli military, the ground operations happening there, the fighting with Hamas forces.
 
But also, of course, the fact that very little aid is still making its way -- has yet to make its way into northern Gaza, despite efforts by the 
 
 United States and others to tell Israel to ramp up the flow of aid. We know that over the weekend, late last week, I should say, we saw Israeli forces 
 
 raid the Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of the few remaining functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. 
 
And that, of course, is having a direct impact on the patients who were being treated there, but also on the thousands of people who were 
 
 sheltering in and around that hospital. Dozens of health care workers were arrested in that Israeli military raid. The military itself claims that 
 
 about 100 Hamas fighters were arrested there. They said that these were confirmed terrorists, although it's not clear if that includes the dozens 
 
 of health care workers who were also arrested.
 
One Israeli military official telling me that there were at least a few Hamas fighters who they said were disguised as medical workers, although we 
 
 don't have any evidence to prove out that claim. What is clear, though, is that the hospital was damaged in this military operation. Not only the 
 
 outer wall that was breached as Israeli forces came in with heavy military vehicles, but also the oxygen center at the hospital that was severely 
 
 damaged intentionally, according to this Israeli military official because there were concerns that those oxygen tanks could be dual use or perhaps 
 
 even booby trapped.
 
We know, of course, that that hospital is now facing severe shortage of basic medical equipment to be able to treat the hundreds of people who have 
 
 been wounded in this Israeli military assault in recent weeks. 
 <br>[10:10:09]
 
And indeed, this military operation is now expected to continue for at least several more weeks. This as there are now ongoing negotiations that 
 
 began yesterday, once again, in Doha, Qatar, to see if there can be a ceasefire and hostage release deal that can be hammered out.
 
Egyptian officials now putting forward this proposal of a two-day truce to see if they can try and advance at least some kind of framework for hostage 
 
 and ceasefire negotiations. For now, though, it's not clear that any of these talks are gaining any real traction at this stage, but at least 
 
 negotiations have begun. The question is whether or not we could actually see real progress before the U.S. presidential election next week. That, 
 
 right now seems unlikely. Erica?
 
HILL: Yes, it does. Jeremy, appreciate it. Thank you. Still ahead this hour. Georgia's disputed parliamentary election, why the president is 
 
 refusing to recognize the results that's just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Donald Trump, excuse me, set to campaign in Georgia today. Kamala Harris to ease in Michigan, where she's expected to focus on American 
 
 manufacturing. We're told she's set to spell out how her policies would create large numbers of new manufacturing jobs. Priscilla Alvarez joining 
 
 me now with more. So, there is a real push as part of these efforts in the final week to speak to union workers.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right. And in Michigan, where she is trying to garner that vote, in hopes of trying to essentially 
 
 lock down the coalition. Of course, the union workers helped buoy President Joe Biden in 2020, so she is trying to replicate that by talking about 
 
 manufacturing and trying to draw the stark contrast with what the former president has promised and what the Vice President said he never executed 
 
 on and what the Biden-Harris administration has done on this.
 
But as she is blitzing to these battleground states, she's also having to outline her own proposals and policies if she were elected in November. And 
 
 in an interview with CBS, she talked a little bit more about what her first 100 days would look like.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS (D) UNITED STATES DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Well, it's going to be lowering cost and a package of legislation that is about 
 
 lowering cost, again, on the issue of housing, small businesses, Child Tax Credit, basically putting more money in the hands of American working 
 
 people, but also cutting middle class taxes. A priority in equal form is going to be what we need to do to deal with reproductive health care and 
 
 reinstate the freedoms and the rights that all people should have and women should have over their own body.
 
And then dealing with Immigration, and particular border security, and bringing back up that bipartisan bill that Donald Trump killed so we can 
 
 get more resources down to the border.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Sarah cut three agenda items there that have featured prominently over the course of this election, the economy, immigration and reproductive 
 
 freedom, all of which the Vice President has been talking about on the campaign trail, especially reproductive freedom. That is an area where 
 
 campaign officials and democratic officials believe that they can gain momentum and an edge on former President Donald Trump.
 <br>[10:15:09]
 
So, expect that to be campaign trail, especially reproductive freedom, that is an area where campaign officials and democratic officials believe that 
 
 they can gain momentum and an edge on former President Donald Trump. So, expect that to be featured quite prominently over the next several days. 
 
 But again, the economy still an important issue for many voters, and one where the Vice President has been trying to fine tune her message and 
 
 target her core constituency to make sure that she's locking in that support in these final days.
 
HILL: Absolutely. There's also been a lot of fallout from comments that were made at Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden here in New York 
 
 last night. The campaign leaning into this a little bit. What more do you expect that we'll hear? We've certainly seen a lot of support online for 
 
 the Vice President in the wake of these comments, specifically from the Puerto Rican community.
 
ALVAREZ: Well, this was a split screen that the campaign did not anticipate yesterday. Of course, earlier in the day, on Sunday, the Vice President 
 
 going to a Puerto Rican restaurant in Phil -- in the Philadelphia area where she outlined her vision for Puerto Rico. It was a clip that was also 
 
 shared by the campaign on social media that Bad Bunny to his 45 million followers, also shared.
 
Now behind the scenes, the Harris campaign had been hoping and working with Bad Bunny's team in hopes that he would lend support to the Vice President 
 
 and this was the first indication of that. It's important because the Vice President has been trying to shore up Latino votes, but especially among 
 
 young Hispanic men. So certainly, the campaign seizing on these comments and the split screen, even though it was one they didn't necessarily 
 
 anticipate what unfold yesterday.
 
But it all speaks to the Vice President and her team again, trying to shore up support in those core areas to make sure that they can try to notch a 
 
 win in, for example, battleground Pennsylvania which has a sizable number of Latinos and Puerto Ricans specifically. So, certainly, an opportunity 
 
 that they're seizing in hopes that it can help them gain an edge in states where, of course, is expected to be very close.
 
HILL: Absolutely. Priscilla, appreciate it. Thank you. Well, when former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley ended her campaign, she 
 
 waited months before endorsing Donald Trump, urging the former president that he really needed to earn the votes of her supporters. Well, now that 
 
 she is all in, she's urging her supporters to follow suit. But in the key state of Pennsylvania, not everyone is on board. Here's CNN John King.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Michael Pacey is methodical, a stickler for detail and preparation. Pennsylvania's archery 
 
 deer season is now open. This range, a place to shoot targets and adjust your gear. 
 
MICHAEL PESCE, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: There we go.
 
KING (voice-over): Rifle season is a month away. And at this stop, Pesce is no nonsense. Just a few shots to help him adjust the sight. Two more to let 
 
 a visitor get a feel for the 30-06 deer (ph) rifle.
 
Conservative in every way. No wasted shots or time. Everything by the book. Not a fan of surprises. Yet, Pesce is voting for Kamala Harris because he 
 
 is even less of a fan of Donald Trump.
 
KING (on camera): You're going to vote for her, but do you know what you're getting?
 
PESCE: No, I don't. And that's the scary part is, you know, I'm not voting for a candidate. I'm not voting for a policy. I'm voting against a 
 
 candidate and policies. And not even all the policies, just, you know, the unstableness of some of the things he says are truly scary.
 
KING (voice-over): Pesce is a Reagan Republican, supported Nikki Haley in this year's GOP primaries. A Never Trumper in a place where that really 
 
 matters. Bucks County, one of the suburban Philadelphia counties crucial to the math in battleground Pennsylvania. He wants his party back and sees a 
 
 second Trump loss as essential.
 
PESCE: Then I think that the Republicans will start coming back to what they were, because they don't have that radical right side. They don't have 
 
 the craziness and the instability.
 
KING (voice-over): Berks County is a bit more away from the city, more rural, and more Republican, yet not as deep and reliably read as just a few 
 
 years ago.
 
JOAN LONDON, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs. This is a primarily Republican leaning borough. 
 
 Always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.
 
KING (voice-over): Attorney Joan London switched her registration to independent after voting for Haley in the GOP primary. London was asked to 
 
 join this local political program not long after our first visit five months ago. Back then, she told us she would write in a conservative 
 
 because she viewed President Biden as too old.
 
And later, she told us she viewed Vice President Harris as too liberal and untested. But then she watched the Harris-Trump debate.
 
LONDON: The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine, where he said that we have to have a negotiated settlement. For someone who claims to be 
 
 a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It's appeasement.
 
KING (voice-over): So, London is now voting Harris, voting Democrat for president for the first time. Because she believes Trump must lose because 
 
 she gets the battleground state math.
 <br>[10:20:05]
 
LONDON: I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again. I don't want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that. 
 
 Sometimes you have to say, American first, conservative second, Republican third.
 
KING (voice-over): Media is in Delaware County, just outside Philly, reliably blue now. But still, a test of whether Harris can match or exceed 
 
 Biden's 2020 math. It's also a big test for Trump. He lost the Philly suburbs in 2016, but narrowly won statewide. But he lost these suburbs by a 
 
 bit more in 2020. And he narrowly lost Pennsylvania.
 
KING (on camera): We're getting to the end here. Have you made up your mind?
 
CYNTHIA SABATINI, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: No.
 
KING (voice-over): Cynthia Sabatini is another Never Trumper, another Haley primary voter, another Republican who won't vote for him, but isn't sure 
 
 about her.
 
KING: Finish the sentence. Madam Vice President, if you want my vote here in the very important Philadelphia suburbs, you need to do --
 
SABATINI: You need to answer questions on point. You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about 
 
 your vision also for this country. I'm, you know, a bottom-line person. I want details.
 
KING (voice-over): Sabatini is mad at local Democrats she sees as tax and spend happy.
 
KING (on camera): Is she going to pay the price for that?
 
SABATINI: She may. She may.
 
KING (voice-over): But she does see an upside for Harris over Trump.
 
SABATINI: I believe she's a person of character. I have no qualms about that. I really do. I think she's an upstanding individual. It's just that I 
 
 really don't know what to expect from her if she is indeed elected.
 
KING (voice-over): Sabatini meditates frequently to clear her mind and reduce stress.
 
SABATINI: Deep inhalations and long exhalations.
 
KING (voice-over): She predicts a final day decision to either vote for Harris or to write in Haley. A vote to help score the suburbs and settle 
 
 the biggest of the battlegrounds.
 
John King, CNN, Media, Pennsylvania.
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
HILL: We are also following, of course, elections around the globe. We're expecting protests to get underway in the transcontinental in Georgia less 
 
 than an hour from now. This, of course, on the heels of the weekend's controversial parliamentary vote there. The country's pro-Western President 
 
 issuing a call to action after announcing she will not recognize the results and also accusing Russia of meddling in the election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SALOME ZOURABICHVILI, PRESIDENT OF GEORGIA (through translator): We were not just witnesses, but also victims of what can only be described as a 
 
 Russian special operation. A new form of hybrid warfare waged against our people and our country. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: The leader of the Georgian dream party, which already had a majority in parliament, claiming victory even before all of the votes were counted. 
 
 And also, amid widespread reports of significant violations of election procedure. Both the U.S. and the European Union are calling for a full 
 
 investigation. CNN Contributor Jill Dougherty is in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, and last hour, I asked her about reports of what observers have 
 
 described as blatant by elections -- of those elections procedures and what she is seeing now on the ground.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, those reports came out. In fact, yesterday was the day after the election, so there were numerous press 
 
 conferences by, excuse me, election monitors. International and Georgian, and almost all of them said that there were, in some cases, egregious 
 
 violations. They categorized those, you know, both pre-election and during the election.
 
So even today, there was another one that came out saying that this election cannot be considered a true reflection of the will of the Georgian 
 
 people. So, I think you'd have to say, you know, the conclusion is this was not a fair election. That said, of course, the government, who thinks it 
 
 was. Now what's happening? So, the opposition have traditionally been quite dispersed and not united, but the president, who is Western leaning 
 
 politician or the president, has brought them together and they are now trying to figure out their strategy.
 
The first part of it is tonight. They're scheduled hold a rally downtown. I was down, Erica, at that location and indeed, they're setting up speakers. 
 
 Looks like, you know, they're preparing for a big crowd. We don't know how many people would turn out then. Also, they are rejecting the results of 
 
 the election and they say that they will also boycott parliament.
 <br>[10:25:02]
 
So, it's odd because I can tell you walking down the hill toward the location of that rally, it seemed quiet. It seemed like kind of a normal 
 
 day. Lots of people on the street, however, politically it's quite tense, and the opposition is trying to figure out exactly what it can do. It 
 
 definitely wants to attract attention of the international community and the support.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: And our thanks again to Jill Dougherty there. We are also following election results out of Japan, which have plunged the country into 
 
 political uncertainty. The ruling coalition losing its majority for the first time in 15 years. The Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba who took over 
 
 less than a month ago, is signaling, however, that he plans to stay on despite masses of voters punishing his Liberal Democratic Party over a 
 
 funding scandal.
 
Here's CNNs Marc Stewart with more.
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: After this monumental defeat, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is bruised but defiant. He says he is not 
 
 stepping down. He has two big tasks. One, tackling a long list of issues, and two, winning the support of people outside his coalition and the 
 
 Japanese public. And as such, he's acknowledging the need for some reflection. Let's listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHIGERU ISHIBA, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN (through translator): I recognize that the biggest reason is because people's doubts, distrust and anger 
 
 regarding politics and money have not gone away.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART: Among his challenges, Japan is reeling from a political scandal involving kickbacks and lawmakers failing to declare their income. There 
 
 are also economic issues, including a weak Yen and high inflation. The Prime Minister also has a strong relationship with the United States, which 
 
 is important for diplomatic, economic and military reasons. And by the way, Japan's stock index in Nikkei is responding favorably. Closing Monday, 
 
 showing some gains. The Yen, however, slumped to a three-month low.
 
Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.
 
HILL: We are also following a developing story at this hour out of China where five people, including three children, have been injured in a 
 
 stabbing. And I do want to warn you, you may find some of this video disturbing. According to police, this happened Monday afternoon near an 
 
 elementary school in an upmarket part of Beijing. Victims were taken to the hospital. Police say none of the injuries is life threatening. And a 50-
 
 year-old man, we're told, was also arrested at the scene.
 
Stay with us. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. Still to come this hour, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris crisscrossing the U.S., highlighting those 
 
 battleground states in this final stretch of the U.S. election. What are those closing arguments? The latest from the trail next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Welcome back to CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Erica Hill in New York. 
 <br>[10:30:02]
 
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in critical swing states today as they look to win over voters in the remaining days of the 2024 campaign and frankly, 
 
 ensure that their supporters will actually get to the polls. Harris is in Michigan today, where she's expected to pitch a plan that she says will 
 
 help create thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
 
She's really leaning in trying to get those union voters in Michigan, and also continuing to lean into her message on reproductive rights and 
 
 abortion as she looks to contrast her character with Donald Trump's. As for the former president, he is leaning into a number of his messages. Today, 
 
 he's set to speak with faith leaders in Georgia before holding a rally in Atlanta, where we're told he'll focus on the economy.
 
His campaign trying to distance itself from comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally on Sunday. Former Trump 
 
 administration official Matt Mowers and democratic strategist Meghan Hayes joining me now to discuss. It's nice to see both of you today. You know 
 
 it's interesting when we see those comments and the fact, Matt, that the Trump campaign is actually distancing both the candidate and the campaign 
 
 itself, saying we don't want to be associated with disparaging comments about Puerto Rico. It's a big deal that they are making that distinction, 
 
 Matt.
 
MATT MOWERS, FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes. I think it's important. I mean, if you talk to anyone on the campaign, they'll say that 
 
 these were not part of the prepared comments. They were not part of the teleprompter. This is a, you know, I'm not even familiar with the guy. I 
 
 think he's a video blogger or he's got a podcast or what have you, but whoever the heck he is, clearly not on the message that the Trump campaign 
 
 wants.
 
And it was important for them to show some distance there. Even before, candidly, Donald Trump even took the stage last night. They were putting 
 
 some distance between Trump and those comments. And I think that's a reflection both of how obviously the president feels -- the former 
 
 president feels but then also the political reality of the fact that Puerto Ricans who are, you know, living in a number of these battleground states, 
 
 not to mention a key voting block and even Florida which matters down ticket have been come increasingly strong Republican voters in the last few 
 
 cycles.
 
And, you know, the Trump campaign recognizes the importance to keep them within the family (INAUDIBLE) 
 
HILL: Yes. And neither campaign wants to alienate anybody at this point. Megan, this though, in some ways -- I mean, how much of a gift is this for 
 
 the Harris campaign that you do, in fact, now have this split screen of what is happening in these moments and also this backlash, including from 
 
 Republicans to those comments and this swell of very public support now for the Vice President from very prominent Puerto Ricans?
 
MEGHAN HAYS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISANT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think this is one of those things where you don't want the momentum 
 
 to -- you want the momentum at your back. And with the Vice President definitely feeling that now going into the last week. It's not just these 
 
 comments made by this -- by this comedian at the event. It's everyone at this event made really horrible comments about people.
 
And it's just showing a stark contrast. It's in a huge contrast to her event with Beyonce on Friday in Texas, highlighting reproductive freedoms. 
 
 You know, she's out there on the trail. She has a number of supporters. She has all of these really great stars and celebrities, singers out there 
 
 supporting her and drawing crowds. And then you have Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden with these really hateful comments by this report -- 
 
 by this comedian and these other people that were there.
 
And so, it's just noticeable their character. And I think going in the last week, this is not what the Trump -- the Trump campaign needs, nor is it 
 
 what down ballots candidates in the Republican Party need at this time.
 
HILL: The reality, though, Matt, is a lot of this -- I mean, the shock value. I keep saying this over and over again, but I think it's important. 
 
 We know the shock value from Donald Trump is baked in, right? He is leaning into not just the weave, but he is leaning into his dark rhetoric moving 
 
 into the final stage of the campaign because it works with his base. And ultimately, there aren't that many voters up for grab.
 
And you want the supporters to turn out. Now my colleague Kristen Holmes who was at that rally last night saying he was incredibly well received in 
 
 the arena. To that point, I'm going to make you both do a little flip flopping here. What do you think Democrats, Matt, need to do better to 
 
 reach any of those potential Trump voters? Because we're seeing the push on fascism, for example, isn't necessarily working.
 
MYERS: Well, you know, I think, in fact, they need to do what Kamala Harris was caught on hot mic talking to Governor Gretchen Whitmer about at a bar 
 
 the other day. I know you saw they were sitting there having a beer. Didn't realize there's hot mics around. And Vice President Harris was bemoaning 
 
 the fact that they need to have movement among men. The truth is that the Democratic Party lately has had trouble talking to male voters.
 
And so, we often talk about this gender gap and often we talk about the gender gap among women, but this is the election, potentially the first 
 
 election in quite some time where you may have a larger gender gap even among men. And it's clearly something the Harris campaign, as well as Vice 
 
 President Harris personally recognizes as a challenge. I got to be honest. You know, you watch Michelle Obama, the former First Lady's comments the 
 
 other night, talking about how women need to, you know, make the men in their lives angry and be OK with it, because they're a vote.
 
It just like it felt like it missed the mark. If you're trying to persuade men to support your candidacy. It's not to go and lecture any group, 
 
 including men.
 <br>[10:35:03]
 
I think they've got to find a way to actually talk to men in particularly young men right now who look like they're going to support a Republican 
 
 nominee for president for the first time, and just about a generation.
 
HILL: Meghan, do you see movement within the campaign to better address men?
 
HAYS: Yes. I think so. I think that they are out there. I think that Governor Walz is out there, and they have surrogates out there doing this. 
 
 And I think that they are -- they are trying to meet people where they are. They're doing different podcasts, they are doing different media 
 
 interviews, and they're doing different style of events to try to meet people where they are, right? Like they did the ad on the -- during the 
 
 Phillies game yesterday.
 
And so, they are doing that. But to your earlier question about what the Trump campaign could be doing is, I think just the opposite of what the 
 
 Harris campaign needs to do. In Matt's opinion, I think that Trump needs to go after women. He needs to stop insulting women. I think if you look at 
 
 the demographics of who are going to win in these battleground states and who's going to make the difference. It is women.
 
And so, the more you're insulting the Vice President and the more you're insulting women, the stronger the margin gets for the vice president. So, 
 
 if I were the Trump campaign, I would lay off all the insults and start targeting women.
 
HILL: Both candidates, obviously, in swing states today. We're going to be saying that pretty much every day for the next eight days. Kamala Harris is 
 
 in Michigan. There's a really important -- we've talked so much about the state of Michigan, but also certainly different voting blocks there. The 
 
 Arab-American vote, which we know for the last year plus has been an issue for Democrats.
 
And I found it really interesting over the weekend to sort of a split screen, if you will. So, let's take a look first at what happened at a 
 
 rally for Donald Trump.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BELAL ALZUHAIRI, MICHIGAN IMAM: We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: So, you have the support there from a Muslim-American group for Donald Trump. At a rally for Vice President Harris on that same day, we see 
 
 this reaction.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: Fighting for America's future and we understand the opportunity we have before us to turn the page on the fear -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Meghan, do you think the campaign has done enough to figure out the messaging here, to reach out to Arab-American voters? I
 
HAYS: I think that the campaign is an extremely challenging spot. The Vice President is the vice president. She doesn't set foreign policy for the -- 
 
 for the country, and she has to sort of do what the president is asking her to do. I think she's been extremely clear on her support for Israel and 
 
 then also saying that there needs to be a cease fire bring hostages home. She's been extremely clear on her messaging.
 
But the reality is, and unfortunately for her, in this moment in time, she doesn't set the policy for the country. The President does. So, she is -- 
 
 has to walk this fine line, and I'm not exactly sure what more she could do, but I do think she is trying to walk this line with the Arab-American 
 
 community, especially in Michigan.
 
HILL: Meghan Hays, Matt Myers, good to see you both this morning. Thank you. 
 
MYERS: Thanks a lot.
 
HILL: Just ahead here. Iran vowing it will respond to Israelis -- to Israel's retaliatory air strikes. So, is the Middle East at this point just 
 
 stuck in a spiral of escalating violence? We'll take you live to Jerusalem after The break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:25]
 
HILL: Iran's leaders are vowing they will make an appropriate response to strikes by Israel on Friday, but say they do not seek a war with Israel. 
 
 The latest Israeli air strikes over the weekend that killed at least five people. Israel has said its forces hit military targets in response to 
 
 Iranian attacks on Israel. Of course, earlier in the month.
 
CNN's Jim Sciutto joining me now from Jerusalem. Jim, good to see you. So, when we look at this, right, there is some question about what happens now 
 
 in this period of escalation? Is this, in fact, putting a pin in this chapter?
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: The short answer is, we don't know, right? Israel's strikes overnight on Friday did not go to the extreme 
 
 end, right? In terms of attacking oil facilities or nuclear facilities which the U.S. had been pressuring Israel not to do, because the U.S. as -- 
 
 or others was concerned about expanding the war. So, Israel stuck to military targets, though still quite a significant strike.
 
And while Iran is vowing retaliation, they've also publicly downplayed the effectiveness of these strikes to their own public, right? In terms of 
 
 state media coverage, et cetera. So, it may be that in the near term we've gotten through the worst period. But big picture, we should keep in mind 
 
 that now it is open season, in effect, between Israel and Iran, that these two countries that had been attacking each other via proxies, or, for 
 
 instance, when Israel carried out strikes in Iran, certainly didn't publicly advertise them.
 
Now they are taking shots at each other with some regularity, right? Two major Iranian missile strikes on Israel in the last year. Now, this strike, 
 
 as well as the killing of the Hamas leader Haniyeh inside Tehran by Israeli intelligence, it is presumed. So, it certainly allows for the possibility 
 
 of further strikes down the line. And there are some here in Israel who talk about this strike on Friday as being one wave that might proceed other 
 
 waves of attacks, really, it just remains to be seen.
 
So short term, probably the answer is yes, the worst has passed but, you know, medium to longer term, we're in a new period in this region.
 
HILL: Yes, we certainly are. Jim, good to see you. Thank you.
 
Joining me now for more on the situation in the Middle East is Trita Parsi, who's the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible 
 
 statecraft. It's good to see you. You know, just picking up on where Jim left off. That in the short term, right? This may, in many ways, be closing 
 
 this particular chapter, but that longer term, it's now to use Jim's words, sort of open season here between Israel and Iran. Would you agree with that 
 
 assessment?
 
TRITA PARSI, AUTHOR, LOSING AN ENEMY: I think Jim is absolutely right about this. This is just a chapter. I think that the trajectory of this is still 
 
 very negative in the sense that it is escalatory. The fact that it's open season also means now that former red lines have completely been washed 
 
 away and there is a struggle now to establish new ones. From the Iranian perspective, part of the reason why you're seeing a bit of a shift in the 
 
 public discourse there, which early on, as Jim correctly pointed out, try to downplay this.
 
You're seeing some indications that they're now shifting away from that. Part of the reason for that is because if in this new open season, so to 
 
 say, it is becoming normalized for Israel to strike Tehran without any significant consequences, then that's a very negative development for the 
 
 Iranians. That would put Iran in the same situation as Beirut and Damascus, which the Israelis regularly strike without causing any headlines anywhere, 
 
 at least not in the West.
 
That's not something I think Iranians will accept. And as a result, you're starting to see an impetus for some form of a response. The challenge they 
 
 have, of course, is, how can they respond without risking a war that they don't want but that they think the Israelis want?
 
HILL: So, to that point, what would you envision as a potential response?
 
PARSI: I think first of all, they are likely going to wait till after the U.S. election. That's going to be a critical factor for their calculations, 
 
 as well as Israel's calculation. The position government that came into power just months ago really came in and hope that they would be able to 
 
 reopen negotiations with the United States. And they had some hopes of potentially making a deal with Biden in the interim period between November 
 
 and January, particularly if Kamala Harris wins the elections.
 
So, it's a calculation that will also come into play there is if they respond, what would that do to the prospect of potentially managing to 
 
 restore some level of diplomacy between the United States and Iraq, which is a Pezeshkian priority.
 <br>[10:45:07]
 
HILL: When we look at how all of this is playing out as well, Israel, of course, still fighting in Gaza and in Lebanon. You know, we heard from 
 
 Israeli officials today that they actually expect those efforts in and around the Jabalia Refugee Camp to continue for perhaps a number of weeks 
 
 to come. All of that impacting, ceasefire talks, which were restarted over the weekend, and you have the looming election as you point out, where and 
 
 what are you watching in this moment, especially in the next eight days ahead of the election here in the U.S.?
 
PARSI: I suspect that there's not much that's going to happen in the next eight days in terms of a ceasefire talk, similar to what we've seen in the 
 
 last year, until you actually have a shift in the U.S. position in which it is willing to put pressure on the Israelis, not just on everyone else, to 
 
 go along with a ceasefire and a hostage exchange and stop the escalation. We're not likely going to see a change.
 
I don't expect that before the election. The question is, will the Kamala Harris presidency, even though she's not President yet, do something to 
 
 change Biden's position? And what will Biden do if the next person coming into the White House will be Donald Trump?
 
HILL: Trita Parsi, really appreciate your insight, your expertise. Thank you. And we'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Imagine being called a Timothee CHalamet and then finding yourself face to face with the real deal. Well, that happened on Sunday here in New 
 
 York, where the Walk on Dune actor crashed his own lookalike contest fails went nuts when Chalamet showed up. According to variety, more than 2500 
 
 people that actually RSVP for the event. The winner was awarded a whopping 50 bucks in the form of a giant check made out to best Tim.
 
The Catholic church just wrapping up a global meeting focused on the church's future. For Catholic women though they say there will be no future 
 
 if their voices are not heard. As Christopher Lamb reports, women are really pressuring the pope for equality in an institution that still will 
 
 not allow them to serve in leadership roles.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Many women impatient for reform, calling on the Pope to take action.
 
KATE MCELWEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WOMEN'S ORDINATION CONFERENCE: The time is now to open all ordained ministries to women.
 
LAMB (voice-over): Finding a greater role for women in the Catholic church has become an urgent issue.
 
The all-male clergy continue to dominate decision making roles in the church, even more so in the Vatican. Women are barred from ordination as 
 
 priests, and like previous popes, Francis has upheld that ruling. But this pope has opened a door to reform, appointing women to senior positions in 
 
 the Vatican. Recognizing the role women are already playing in the church, seeking to give them greater visibility.
 
And for the first time, giving women the right to vote at the Vatican Synod assembly, which concluded on Sunday.
 
One of those voter participants is a 23-year-old studying theology and physics in Philadelphia. The youngest woman to take part in such an event.
 
JULIA OSEKA, STUDENT, ST. JOSEPH'S UNIVERSITY, PHILADELPHIA: There is definitely an urgent need to not only realize and accept that women have an 
 
 equal baptismal dignity to men in the Catholic church, but also to take action.
 <br>[10:50:03]
 
And our senate is discussing issues on how to better make women visible, give them leadership roles, give them the same platform of action as men in 
 
 the Catholic Church.
 
LAMB (voice-over): Nevertheless, Francis has faced criticism for expressing conservative views on women's roles. The pope also knocking back a proposal 
 
 for women to become deacons, an ordained church position, but the Vatican assembly insisting this topic must continue to be looked at and for women 
 
 to be given leadership roles.
 
France is accepting their proposals, recognizing the need for more reform.
 
HELENA JEPPESEN-SPUHLER, SYNOD DELEGATE: If we don't take a strong stand, we are it's contradicting our own message inside our own institution, we 
 
 also have to do more steps.
 
LAMB (voice-over): In the face of a male-dominated Vatican culture and centuries of inequality, change won't come overnight.
 
AUSTEN IVEREIGH, PAPAL BIOGRAPHER: I think the Pope has opened a window for women. Yes. There's no question. Under his pontificate, we've seen women 
 
 occupy really important senior roles. Here in Rome, in the Vatican, but also increasingly across the church, and we've got women voting in a Synod 
 
 of Bishops for the first time.
 
LAMB (voice-over): What may seem like small steps to those on the outside are in fact, leaps for many within the church.
 
Christopher lamb, CNN, Rome.

HILL: Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar this Monday. Thick toxic smog is choking Northern India and 
 
 Eastern Pakistan, just days before the start of a major Hindu festival. Diwali, the Festival of Lights set to begin on Thursday. It's typically 
 
 celebrated with fireworks, which inevitably worsen air pollution. Air quality across the region is set to deteriorate as that winter smog season 
 
 approaches.
 
In the U.S. the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani is expected to play in game three of the World Series. Monday despite a shoulder injury 
 
 which he suffered during game two. Saturday night, Ohtani was hurt while trying to steal second base in the bottom of the seventh inning. Team 
 
 manager Dave Roberts says he doesn't see a reason, though, to bench Ohtani if he can play through the pain. Here's a little more of what he had to 
 
 say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVE ROBERTS, MANAGER, LOS ANGELES DODGERS: He's got to still go through the workout and swing the bat, but again, today feels better than yesterday 
 
 and our assumption is tomorrow is going to feel better than today. And so, with that, you know, that's what I'm banking on.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: The Dodgers currently have a two nothing lead over the New York Yankees in that best of seven series.
 
Mexico City's Formula One Grand Prix ending with a surprise victory. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz winning on Sunday. This coming after Red Bulls 
 
 leader Max Verstappen was penalized twice for aggressive driving. The Dutch driver forcing rival land on Norris off the track. Norris, who, of course, 
 
 drives for McLaren, came in second. This was Ferraris first win in Mexico since 1990. It's a fourth time that Sainz has won there.
 
 Three-time world champ Verstappen finishing sixth because of the two 10- second penalties.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my God. Oh my God.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Did you hear the chants of oh my god? Adele is in the final weeks of her Las Vegas residency at Caesars Palace. That venue, of course, was built 
 
 -- specially built more than two decades ago for Celine Dion's own residency.
 
And check this out, hundreds of kayakers in Belgium taking part in a rather unusual tradition, paddling in giant carved out pumpkin boats. The annual 
 
 regatta taking place in the town of Kasterlee. Organizers say the event began as a way to put the oversized gourds to good use. 
 
Well, looks like pigs are likely a long way from flying, but thanks to scientists in Europe. They may be a little closer to communicating. Anna 
 
 Stewart has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Does this indicate happiness, discomfort or stress? With the help of A.I. European scientists developed an algorithm 
 
 that may just be capable of decoding pigs' noises, as well as keeping farmers updated on their pigs' well-being. To develop the A.I. algorithm, 
 
 scientists collected thousands of recordings of pigs' sounds in various scenarios, including play, isolation and competition for food. Once 
 
 collected, they were placed in a database.
 
ELODIE MANDEL-BRIEFER, BIOLOGIST, UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN: We had this huge database of calls that are producing specific emotions, specific 
 
 context, by many different peaks and kinds of pigs.
 
STEWART (voice-over): Scientists found short grunts typically signal positive emotions. Long grunts often indicate discomfort. Screams or 
 
 squeals could show stress.
 
MANDEL-BRIEFER: We developed A.I. so artificial intelligence that could tell us be trained to tell us if the calls that we recorded were 
 
 emotionally positive or negative.
 <br>[10:55:02]
 
STEWART (voice-over): The study of animal emotions is a relatively new field. It highlights the importance of livestock mental health to their own 
 
 overall wellbeing. Most welfare strategies today focus only on the animal's physical health.
 
MANDEL-BRIEFER: And now, with the explosions of A.I. methods, it actually becomes more and more easy to do these things.
 
STEWART (voice-over): Scientists hope this tool will be developed into an app for farmers phones helping to translate what pigs are saying in terms 
 
 of their emotions.
