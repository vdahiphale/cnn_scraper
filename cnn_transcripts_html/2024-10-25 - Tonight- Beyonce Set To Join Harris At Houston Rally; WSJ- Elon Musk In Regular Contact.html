ERICA HILL, CNN HOST:  It is 8:00 p.m. in London, 7:00 in Reykjavik, 3:00 here in New York City. I'm Erica Hill. Thanks so much for joining me today on CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Let's get right to the headlines. 
 
Well, there's really only a queen who could outrank the boss. That queen, of course, being Beyonce, who set to appear alongside Vice President Kamala Harris tonight in Texas. This coming just a day after Bruce Springsteen's live performance at a rally for Harris in Georgia. 
 
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
 
HILL:  That's same that same event, also marking the first time former President Barack Obama and Harris have stood side-by-side on the campaign trail as this race moves into its final days, both Harris and Donald Trump are looking at a, a tough road ahead. 
 
You can see right here in the latest CNN polling released just this afternoon, there is no clear leader there. We are still in a dead heat and even if you factor in those third party and independent candidates, we still know who's going to win this thing. 
 
CNN's Rosa Flores joining me live from Houston now ahead of the rally there, later today.
 
Rosa, good to see you. So a big deal, right? That this actually worked out, that Beyonce is going to be part of this event. There are also some questions about being in Texas, given that this is probably a tough one for the vice president to win.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You know, it definitely is. But I want to show you around before I target that specific question because it's a great one, Erica, because I want you to feel the energy here in Texas. You can see that this line snakes through this parking lot. I can tell you that energy stadium here in Houston seats about 21,000 people. Now, we don't know exactly how many the people are going to show up, but people have driven for hours already. Justice stand in line here to see, of course, Kamala Harris. But Queen Bey, she is from H-Town here in Houston. 
 
So a lot of support there for her but you can see they just announced this event yesterday. Erica, and you can see that a lot of people are here waiting in line. But to your question, why Texas, why now? Because Texas is not one of the seven battleground states and its not like the campaign is thinking that they're going to be able to grab those 40 electoral votes and then they've got this election sealed. 
 
Not at all. As a matter of fact, Vice President Kamala Harris, just at a gaggle with reporters and she said that why Texas? Because Texas is ground-zero when it comes to abortion rights. And that's what were expecting her to focus here in Texas as she continues to make that contrast with Donald Trump.
 
And why Texas you might ask? Well, Texas is one of the strictest abortion laws in this country and so Kamala Harris will be joined by not just the star power of Beyonce and Willie Nelson, but you will also have very powerful stories of real women who have been impacted by abortion laws.
 
There's a Texas woman who will be joining her. Her name is Amanda Zurawski. This woman almost died because she didn't have access to an abortion. She will also be joined by Shanette Williams. This is a mother from Georgia her daughter actually died because she didn't have access to an abortion.
 
And so, what Kamala Harris and the Harris campaign are trying to do this late in the game is to set a very clear message, Erica, that the consequences since are real when it comes to abortion policy. And her contrast is that if America would like to see more states like Texas, then that's a Donald Trump presidency. But if you want a complete contrast where women have a right to decide what happens to their bodies, and then that's a Kamala Harris administration. 
 
That's when voters would vote for her. And so that's what they're trying to do and send this message late in the game is to mobilize voters with that very stark contrast to go to the polls to cast her ballot -- Erica. 
 <br>[15:05:05]
 
HILL:  To your point, and in many ways, as you were talking about eating into the fact that she is in Texas, she's there because she wants to highlight what the vice president and the campaign sees the real effects of these very strict laws in Texas when it comes to not just reproductive rights and health care, but frankly, women's rights and their survival in terms of their own health care. 
 
It's also interesting, as I've been hearing today that yes, this is happening in Texas, but the hope from the campaign is actually that this is a message that will be heard far beyond Texas.
 
FLORES:  Absolutely. I actually spoke to a political science expert about this, Erica, and that's the exact point that he made. He said, look Texas is the biggest stage for Kamala Harris to make this point because Texas does have the strictest abortion laws, there is no exception for rape and incest. There's a very narrow, narrow exception for life of the mother and any private citizen can file a lawsuit against someone who, quote, aid and abets and abortion. And so this political expert told me, look, it's very clear, Kamala Harris will be in Texas tonight, but really the message that she sending to all of the seven battleground states is that if she doesn't win, then the country could look more like Texas when it comes to abortion rights. And that, that would be the realities for many more women around this country, and not just here in Texas. 
 
And so that's a really important point, Erica, because Kamala Harris is, again, not, not trying to say here that the 40 electoral votes from the state of Texas are going to go to Kamala Harris. But this is just the biggest stage where she can make this argument and really draw contrast with Donald Trump. 
 
HILL:  Rosa Flores, good to see you, my friend. Thank you.
 
Well, as we follow what is happening, it's not just Kamala Harris campaigning in Texas on this Friday. Donald Trump just wrapping up remarks in Austin a short time ago. The Republican nominee continuing to hammer home a fairly dark vision of the country which he's also tying to immigration as part of his closing argument. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're like a garbage can for the rest of the world to dump the people that they don't want. Do you know what they save on that? Their mental institutions are being emptied out, their jails and prisons are being emptied out, and their gangs and their drug dealers and everybody's being taken off the streets.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Important fact check there, there is not evidence to support that entire throngs are being emptied out to various places and sent to the United States. Donald Trump set today to tape an interview as well with podcaster Joe Rogan.
 
Joining me this hour, Shermichael Singleton, CNN political commentator, and Republican strategist, and also CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona. 
 
Good to see you both on this Friday afternoon. 
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Good to see you.
 
HILL:  As we are moving into this final stretch here, right. You have both candidates in Texas. I thought it was interesting a short time ago, the former president saying, hey, I don't know why Kamala Harris would be in Texas. Texas is not in play for her. It's not a swing state, doesn't she know where she is.
 
It's interesting, Shermichael, because that's been some of the criticism when it comes to the president's choice in terms of places that he is going, that he is maybe not in some of these states where he needs to make a little headway. Is that what you say? That's accurate on either side? SINGLETON:  I would say it's accurate for Vice President Harris to pay in Texas because she's going to particularly give a boost to Colin Allred. I mean, Allred and Senator Ted Cruz are in a statistical tie. 
 
And so sometimes, when you're looking at some of these potential gettable seats, particularly at the Senate level, and you recognize that having your candidate there can gin up enthusiasm to particularly help a Democratic candidate get across the finish line, then there absolutely is a strategic case to make for the vice president to be there. She's going to be in Houston with Beyonce, strong African- American population there, a strong Latino population there, a strong younger population in Texas, in fact, because of a lot of families moving into the state. 
 
So even as a Republican, I'm looking at the numbers and I don't think the vice president will win. But I got to tell you something, Erica, I'm looking at Cruz and I'm saying do not underestimate the potential of Vice President Harris increase in turnout among key constituencies within the Democratic Party in the state of Texas.
 
HILL:  Which will be interesting to see come Election Day. 
 
Maria, as we look at this, look, a lot of big names here, right? Where the former president last night, Bruce Springsteen, you've got Beyonce today, the former First Lady Michelle Obama coming up this weekend. Bottom line, how much do these big names actually translate to votes, Maria? 
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I, think that they are very strategic. I think that these big names can absolutely translate to votes, Erica, because they continue to remind people and not just the base because these are stars and leaders that transcend politics, that transcend culture. 
 <br>[15:10:07]
 
And they speak to massive audiences that have nothing to do with political affiliation. That's why it's so smart, strategically. And when you have these leaders and these stars celebrities pointing out the reasons why Americans should take a look at this election and really take a look at the contrast, it also goes beyond politics. And I think part of what were seeing he has so many Republicans coming to endorse the vice president.
 
And so people like President Obama, Michelle Obama, even Beyonce, The Boss can remind people that this is not about politics, that this is bigger than politics. This is bigger than party, this is bigger than partisanship. 
 
When you have somebody like Kamala Harris, who is going to wake up every day thinking about what she can do to make the lives of Americans better, checking off her to do list for American voters versus somebody like Donald Trump, who his own four-start decorated veteran military generals who worked with him while he was in the Oval Office have said that he is a danger to the future of this country, that he is a fascist. That contrast for all of these celebrities across that spectrum to be making, I think will be very compelling not just to Democrats and not just to our base, but to the very critical, independent voters, moderate Republicans and others who now understand that they should put country before party. 
 
HILL:  There are -- there are not that many of those folks are up for grabs in terms of those who haven't decided. So, I just want to bring us some more numbers.
 
CARDONA:  We don't know.
 
HILL:  According to CNN -- well, according to our latest CNN polling, right, 9 percent say it could still change their mind. What struck me too is some of the -- some of the updated polls willing again, from this from our own poll that was released just a short time ago today, who do you trust more to handle some of the top issues here. 
 
So, when it comes to abortion rights and democracy, you see an edge for Kamala Harris. When it comes to foreign policy, the economy and immigration, that edge goes to the former president. 
 
So when that as your base, I'm going to ask you both but the same question, actually as strategist, Shermichael, as you look at this race today, we see where he's doing well.
 
When it comes to the Trump campaign, where do you think his bigness weaknesses at this point in the race? 
 
SINGLETON:  Well, I would say the biggest weakness is with persuadable voters on the issue of the democracy. The abortion thing, I don't think there's enough time for Republicans to try to clean that up, but I do think that there is some concern among voters who might actually agree with Donald Trump on a lot of policies, who just may have some concerns to say they're going to vote for the vice president, or they're going to stay home.
 
Now, Vice President Harris is apparently making a speech or giving a speech, I should say, Tuesday at the ellipse. If I were advising the former president, the next day or the day after, I would give a similar speech. And I will give a speech talking about democracy but from an economic and immigration perspective, to try to lower some of those concerns, some persuadable voters. 
 
HILL:  As we look at this, Maria, turning it -- turning it to you, what do you see as Kamala Harris biggest weakness at this point in the race? 
 
CARDONA:  I actually would look at it as what is her biggest challenge and her biggest challenge is time, Erica, because I look at all of those issues and what we have seen from the day that she became the nominee is that she is closing the gap on a lot of those issues. You look at other polls and she is even on the economy, she is even on immigration, closing the gap on inflation, even.
 
And so, I would say that what she is doing now reflects the very constricted timeline that she has had from the moment she became the nominee, she is still doing persuasion, but she's also doing get out the vote, which goes to all of the celebrities across board, which are coming now to help her do exactly that. 
 
And I do think there's a big opening. You k now, you say there aren't that many persuadables. I agree I don't think there are that many undecided. But what there are voters who absolutely don't want Donald Trump, but who might not yet be convinced that Kamala Harris is the one for them. 
 
She has in the days that are left, she has the opportunity to convince them that their vote is too important to leave off of the table for them to get off the couch to join if they're Republicans to join the massive number of Republicans who are coming to support her because look at what is at stake. 
 
It is time to put country before party when you have conservative Republicans like Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney all of the national security people who have come to support her, saying Donald Trump is too much of a danger for us to take a chance. Kamala Harris will actually be a president for everyone, not just the people who voted for her. She has pledged to put a Republican on her cabinet. 
 
I think that is the kind of messaging that absolutely resonates with the people who aren't -- are not necessarily undecided, but perhaps need that last push to go out and vote for Vice President Harris.
 <br>[15:15:10]
 
HILL:  Maria, Shermichael, good to see you both. Thank you.
 
SINGLETON:  Quickly.
 
CARDONA:  Thanks so much, Erica. 
 
HILL:  I'll give you a quickly, Shermichael. 
 
SINGLETON:  Let me say quickly, I understand Maria's points, but if I were advising the vice president, I would try to persuade those voters on the economy and immigration, those persuadable voters are saying they're interested in learning more about her on those issues, which tells me even as a Republican, there's an opening there. 
 
They know where she stands as it pertains to Trump. They have their concerns about Trump. Persuade them that you're going to improve their lot of life. That's what they're waiting to hear. 
 
CARDONA:  Rest assured she's doing that as well.
 
HILL:  We will see what the messages are over the weekend. Thank you again.
 
SINGLETON:  Thank you, Erica.
 
HILL:  Still to come this hour, the U.S. beefing up its military strength in the Middle East as it braces for Israel's threatened retaliation and strike on Iran. Details on the arrival of U.S. fighter jets, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL:  Elon Musk in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the last two years. That reporting from "The Wall Street Journal" raising a lot of eyebrows. It also notes that several current and former U.S., European, and Russian officials confirmed it. The claim was disputed by Putin's press secretary. As for the pentagon, it says it doesn't comment on, quote, any individual security clearance review or status or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual's actions.
 
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, though, is calling for an investigation into that report. 
 
My colleague Nathan Hodge joins me now. 
 
So when we look at this and NASA administrator saying, hey, I need to know more here, what do we know about this reporting and just how much contact there has been between the two? 
 
NATHAN HODGE, CNN FORMER MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF:  Right. Well, NASA administrator Bill Nelson did say, of course, he doesn't know if these reports are true, but it does bear investigation. 
 <br>[15:20:02]
 
So what we know, so far -- I mean, a lot of the report also leans heavily on things that Musk has said publicly, you know, about what he thinks about the war in Ukraine. He's confirmed once publicly again that he's had contact with Putin, but that was before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022. And what "The Wall Street Journal" is saying is that beginning around in the fall of 2022, that these regular contacts with Putin began.
 
However, as you said the Kremlin has pooh-poohed this. This press spokesperson for the Kremlin is basically said that the report is untrue, but did confirm that there was what he said was a phone conversation again, between Musk and Putin talking about space technology and the future of technology. But I think one of the things that the Wall Street Journal report does flag is that initially right after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Musk, like many, many others was a very strong and vocal supporter of Ukraine. 
 
Also, he helped provide the Starlink terminals, which were a key sort of form of providing communication in war torn Ukraine. But then sort of his, lets say his public rhetoric shifted somewhat to, in some ways kind of mirror what many saw as kind of Kremlin talking points basically saying I think it was an October of 2022, having a survey of his followers saying, you know, should there be peace in Ukraine with the path forward, be neutrality for Ukraine, giving up -- Ukraine giving up Crimea, water supply to Crimea. All of these things were sort of key talking points, key things that the Kremlin would like to see happen.
 
So this is, of course, something that I think people are viewing with concern because were talking about the founder of SpaceX, a company that has government contracts. So, you know, government contracts, and Musk, of course, has a security clearance. And those come with strings attached. 
 
It sounds great to have a security clearance. You get sealed secret stuff. That's not really the way that it works. It comes with a lot of conditions.
 
HILL:  Yeah, absolutely. Nathan Hodge, really appreciate it. Thank you.
 
North Korea says any troop deployment to Russia to aid the war on Ukraine would conform with international law. This comes as Russia's President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow was, quote, in contact with Pyongyang. Audio, meantime, intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence appears to have Russian soldiers actually raising concerns about North Korean troops in the country 
 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
 
RUSSIAN SOLDIER:  He's standing there talking to this mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED) about the "K Battalion".
 
RUSSIAN SOLDIER:   He was just talking about the "K Battalion". I asked, "Who gets the weapons, the ammo for them? We did get (EXPLETIVE DELETED) rations. And from what I hear, the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) brigade gets it. And he's like, "why the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) brigade? You receive everything."
 
(END AUDIO CLIP)
 
HILL:  And so that audio also revealing plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean soldiers.
 
The United States bolstering its military power in the Middle East as that region braces, of course, for potential Israeli strike on Iran, U.S. Central Command says F-16 fighter jets have now arrived from Germany, but did not say where they are now based ahead of expected Gaza ceasefire talks this coming weekend.
 
Jordan's foreign minister is sounding the alarm, saying that, quote, ethnic cleansing is taking place in Northern Gaza and also warning of a hospital under siege. 
 
These concerns being raised when he met with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in London. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AYMAN SAFADI, JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  But I think most important right now as we speak is to address the situation in northern Gaza where we see the siege of Kamal Adwan Hospital. Again, not interested why is that. It's getting worse, unfortunately, every time we meet, not for lack of us trying, but because we do have an Israeli government that is not listening to anybody, and that has got to stop.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  My colleague, Jennifer Hansler, joining me now from the State Department. 
 
So, Jennifer, Secretary Blinken is trying to push her renewed ceasefire talks. It seems unlikely there would be much progress before the U.S. election. Interesting to denote those comments from the Jordanian minister there that Israel isn't listening anyone. Do we have a sense of where these talks even stand?
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORTER:  Well, Erica, that's exactly right us officials are clear-eyed here that there is not likely to be any sort of final decision or any sort of real movement in these talks ahead of the U.S. election, just a week and a half away, but they are saying they are still going to try to push the ball forward so that they our in a good place whenever the winner is decided in that presidential contest. 
 
As you noted, the negotiators from the U.S. Israel and Qatar are going to be convening this weekend in Doha to try to renew those stalled talks. They've been stalled for two months now to push the ball forward and capitalize on the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. 
 
But Blinken is coming back from his 11th trip in the region with very little in hand here beyond the star of those talks.
 <br>[15:25:05]
 
We know that he brought up the humanitarian situation in Gaza to Israeli officials. It is unclear if they are prepared to do any more to alleviate that widespread suffering that is happening exclusively it or -- sorry, rather, in northern Gaza and across the entire region. But we know that this is something the U.S. is pushing for progress on as well at the same time, the region is on edge. The U.S. has confirmed that they sent more F-16 fighter jets to the region. We don't know where exactly they are, but this is coming ahead of potential response from Israel to that ballistic missile attack from Iran earlier this month. 
 
So there is a lot riding on what happens in the region, even as the world and Netanyahu are waiting to see who wins the U.S. presidential election here, Erica.
 
HILL:  And yet it's so interesting to see that there is, there is still this push, right? It's -- we will see over the weekend in terms of those talks. But as you point out, 11 trips to the region in with each one, it seems that any hope of an agreement actually gets more and more dim. 
 
HANSLER:  Exactly, right. Yeah. There has been very little movement and U.S. officials are saying that this is a time for Israel to take advantage of this opportunity as they call it, that was created by Sinwar's dead. They are calling for Hamas to come back to the table, but they don't know at this point whether the group is going to engage. Blinken said earlier this week that they hope to get a sense of that in the coming days. But again, it really is unlikely that we will see much of any movement
 
 in the next week and a half until the world knows who is going to be in charge of the U.S. come the next administration -- Erica.
 
HILL:  Jennifer Hansler, appreciate it. Thank you.
 
Well, as those world leaders meet to work toward a potential cease- fire agreement, Jennifer just noted the civilian suffering in Gaza continues to grow. Basic needs remain unmet. The few functioning hospitals there are in desperate need of medical supplies.
 
Here's more now from CNN's Matthew Chance, but I do want to warn you, a number of these images are graphic.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just a glimpse of the bloodshed this week in northern Gaza is a horrified Palestinian nurse struggles to help in the aftermath of an Israeli strike.
 
Auntie, auntie, I don't have anything to stop the bleeding. She screams. One woman sits delirious on the ground.
 
She runs to fetch her bag and makes her way back up the bloodstains steps where dead and injured history, though she has her a few bandages and basic medical supplies amid the carnage.
 
Back in the steps, she turns a corner and calls out as she sees someone she recognizes.
 
Abu Mohammed, she screams. The old man is dead.
 
From above, an Israeli drone looks down on the Jabalia refugee camp, now the focus of what Israel's military says is an operation to stamp out resurgent Hamas activity. These images show thousands of Palestinian residents already displaced multiple times on the move again, trudging past Israeli tanks in search of safety.
 
But where they are heading, the humanitarian crisis is also dire. These chaotic scenes at a bakery in central Gaza, where he made acute food shortages hundreds are jostling for bread, grasping desperately for survival. 
 
For three days, I've been searching for bread to take home, says this man, I am literally begging, he says. 
 
All I want is bread for my children, says this woman, every night. They go to bed hungry.
 
The U.N. says, without more aid urgently starvation here will get worse, saying Israel is preventing humanitarian missions from accessing Gaza, Israel blames Hamas for disrupting the distribution of essential supplies.
 
Meanwhile, in southern Gaza, Palestinians pick through the rubble of a residential building leveled in a recent Israeli strike. Here and further south where the Hamas leader was killed last week, Israel says combat operations are continuing, with a heavy civilian toll continues to climb.
 
Matthew Chance, CNN, Jerusalem.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:33:08]
 
HILL:  Eleven days now until Election Day, we have some fresh new numbers from a CNN poll just out this afternoon, which show once again, this is a dead heat, no clear leader. However, you want to slice it, no one is running away with this race. You see them, they're tied at 47 percent each.
 
When voters were asked who they trust more to handle the top issues, you can see the breakdown there. Kamala Harris polling higher when it comes to abortion and reproductive rights, as well as protecting democracy, foreign policy the economy and immigration though those are all seeing better numbers for the former president. 
 
Larry Sabato joining me now for a deep dive into this and a whole lot more. He, of course, is the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, and also an editor of the book, "A Return to Normalcy: The 2020 Election That Almost Broke America". 
 
Love to see how the 2024 election does, my friend.
 
When we look at these new numbers, so CNN's polling very consistent in terms of the national race, right? Although we know it's really the states, of course, in the way that this is set up in the U.S. that are going to matter. 
 
The fact though, that we are seeing this consistent deadlock, only 9 percent according to our polling of those who responded said, that they could still sort of changed their mind. There's very little wiggle room at this point.
 
Are the candidates doing what they need to capitalize on those voters? 
 
LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: Well, they're trying. They're getting big crowds. You know, Trump is going to Madison Square Garden. It will be interesting to see whether he can really fill it. 
 
Kamala Harris has got Beyonce and a lot of other Hollywood stars in celebrities appearing at her events, including the one she's doing in Texas and so they're getting big crowds there reaching as many people as they can. The networks are covering them extensively. That's what they can do. But, you know, Erica, when you look at these two candidates and particularly Trump, who has been on the national stage every single day or nine years, how much more can you learn about him? 
 <br>[15:35:09]
 
How much more would influence your decision if you were supposedly undecided that 9 percent, I'll bet you right now that the vast majority of them do not change their mind, whatever -- whatever way they're leaning, and the ones who are in the other category they're not voting. 
 
They say they're voting. They're not voting. There likely voters, but some of them don't turn up.
 
HILL:  Yeah, and that's going to be the big hurdle, right, for both campaigns, which is maybe why we're hearing them sort of preaching to the converted in many ways is they want to make sure that those who do support them actually show up at the polls. 
 
SABATO:  Yes and both of them have expensive get out the vote operations. I would have to say, and this is the judgment of professionals in both parties. The Democrats have a real advantage there. They have actually put together a truly first rate get out the vote voter contact operation. It's not that there is none of that on the Trump side. It's that he subcontracted a lot of it out, including to super PACs. I think one of them run by Elon Musk. 
 
Well, you know, when you subcontract out, you don't have daily supervision of what they're doing. You want to get it off your plate. That's why you've subcontracted. 
 
But when you when you don't subcontract and it's something, you know, is very important. It's on your plate and you are supervising daily. So I'd say that's one of the hidden advantages that Kamala Harris has.
 
HILL:  In terms of supervising daily, you're getting that feedback then, right? You know how those door-knocking operations, for example, are going. What's fascinating to me is it seems to me as I look at both campaigns today on the side, on the Democratic side, there is clear anxiety, right? Part of that maybe they believe that messaging will be helpful to say, hey, were the underdogs, although really they are the underdog. 
 
But there is such a palpable anxiety. And then on the side of Republicans, it is more of the anger coming through from Donald Trump, which has been -- which is consistent, right? I mean, this is who we have seen. We know this is a campaign of grievances but when you look at both approaches, the anger and the anxiety, is there one that fuels people more? 
 
SABATO:  Oh, I think they're both equally effective emotions. And actually it fits both parties. I've seen this for so many years and that characterizes Democrats the anxiety and Republicans the anger. So they'll -- they'll produce a lot of votes.
 
What I think is also significant though, is that Democrats are looking at those type figures like in the CNN poll, you know, 40 -- 47 to 47, 48 to 48, "New York Times" had a very similar poll out this morning. And they say, oh, my God, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by two points and she's still lost. That's true. But every election is different. It all depends on how
 
 the vote is distributed among the key swing states and the other states. So you're concluding too much based on two little that would be my message to Democrats, and Republicans are also concluding too much on too little.
 
One race in 2016 does not a trend make.
 
HILL:  It is an excellent point. I want to ask you about one of the numbers that struck me the most in this most recent CNN poll. Respondents were asked whether Donald Trumps pledge to go after his enemies, if elected, was a reason to vote for against him or it didn't have any impact. A quarter, 24 percent of respondents said, saying he'll go after his enemies is a reason to vote for him.
 
Are you surprised by that number? 
 
SABATO:  Well, I was taken aback when I saw it because I didn't realize a quarter of the population was quite so into revenge. But I guess maybe that's part of human nature, but it is disturbing.
 
Now, you know, half of people approximately said it bothered them and they're concerned about that I've got news for people. They're not looking ahead. If Donald Trump does get elected, he's going to make Richard Nixon look like a choir boy. 
 
Remember, Nixon had an enemies list. It was a real list of people that they were going after with the Internal Revenue Service and other means and methods, I suspect that Trumps is a lot longer, and that he's going to spend more of each day focusing on that list.
 
HILL:  Longer, and I would I would also argue broader.
 
I also want to ask you about this. So we saw just this week, "The L.A. Times" will not endorse. "The Washington Post" is not going to endorse either, although CNN has learned there was a draft after ready to go for the paper to endorse Kamala Harris. 
 
I was struck by these comments from Marty Baron, former executive editor at "The Post, who wrote: This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty. Donald Trump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner Jeff Bezos and others. This is disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage. 
 
I mean, I remember the days of the slogan at "The Washington Post". Democracy dies in darkness.
 <br>[15:40:01]
 
What do you make of Marty Baron's comments? And do you agree? 
 
SABATO:  I made the mistake of touching that tweet and I have a third- degree burn, but I can tell you, Erica, good for Marty Baron. 
 
You know, of course, he had his problems with "The Post" though he had a very distinguished career there. But I think he is absolutely right. This is pure cowardice. And it's also financial interests at work among the owners of both "The Washington Post" and "The L.A. Times". 
 
So if they -- if they were trying to avoid controversy, I think they misfired. I think they've got a lot more controversy and it's going to last for many, many years. People aren't going to forget how they duck one of the most important election decisions in American history. That's nothing to admire. 
 
HILL:  It's interesting because there is a debate. There's always a debate every year over whether newspapers, news organizations should ever endorse a candidate. But fascinating when it comes out and is put squarely in financial terms like that. 
 
Larry, always good to talk to you. Thank you. 
 
SABATO:  Thank you so much, Erica. Thanks.
 
HILL:  I want to get you to some news just in here to CNN. We have learned the Chinese government, Chinese government-linked hackers rather have target the phone communications of former President Donald Trump and Senator J.D. Vance, who, of course, is Trump's running mate. This is according to two sources and apparently as part of a much broader cyber espionage effort aimed at high level U.S. targets. 
 
The hackers also targeting senior Biden administration officials according to a source. The FBI and the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency say the U.S. government is investigating
 
Sean Lyngaas joining me now with more.
 
So in terms of -- so Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, as well as Biden administration officials. This is a pretty big deal, especially as were learning it just 11 days out from the election.
 
SEAN LYNGAAS, CNN CYBERSECURITY REPORTER:  Erica, it is a big deal. I mean, (INAUDIBLE) intelligence agency anywhere in the world. And you get access to some of the more sensitive networks of a telecommunication firm that can really cause problems in terms of what? For a defender in terms of what you're trying to protect against they have access to potentially phone data and other in a very sensitive data. And now were learning that former president Donald Trump and his vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, were the targets this. It's a -- it's a very broad campaign because once --  
 
HILL:  So, it's a broad campaign which is interesting too, because as were going to see, people respond to it, it'll be interesting to see how this is a span for lack of a better word or address, I should say, by some of those who may have been targets.
 
LYNGAAS:  Right. That's right, Erica, I mean, this is -- I mean, it's classic cyber espionage, so you're trying to get access to these call records. And piece together who might be talking to who and potentially what they're communicating. So it -- it is, it is bipartisan, if you will, the Chinese government, it is interested in the call records of both the Biden administration and the Trump campaign. So they are not discriminating and we haven't seen the last of this in
 
 terms of what were going to learn in terms of the severity and potential national security consequences of this hack, Erica.
 
HILL:  Yeah, absolutely. Sean, really appreciate it. Thank you.
 
Still ahead here. Would you be more productive with a shorter workweek? Richard Quest joining me now with the results of yet another recent trial, and it's looking good. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:46:48]
 
HILL:  Welcome back on this Friday, which for most people is yet another workday. Imagine though if your workday was only four days a week, maybe were Monday through Thursday, Tuesday through Friday. Either one would be grand. 
 
Iceland introducing a nationwide four-day workweek, and now, the results are in and they're fairly promising, joining me now to break it down the host of "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS", Richard Quest.
 
Richard, I have to say and I've done -- full disclosure. I've done some reporting on this as well.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST, QUEST MEAN BUSINESS:  Yeah.
 
HILL:  Spent some time at a police department in Colorado, that's been doing it for a year, and it works. The data is there. Our bosses and many others should really sit up and pay attention to this segment. 
 
QUEST:  You've just stolen my lines. 
 
HILL:  Sorry.
 
QUEST:  Yes, that is exactly the point. 
 
The Iceland's study has shown it works. People like it, people are as productive, if not more productive. And therefore it's been rolled out and its made permanent across the country. It backs up a massive study that was done in London in 2022, same thing, more than 80 percent of those companies that took part in that study have by and large kept four-day weeks in position because it works. 
 
Now, look its not just the case of me saying I'm off. Excuse me. I got to go four days. I'm going to take next Thursday off. What they've also discovered, as you know, is that it requires planning who's going to cover the work, how's the work going to be covered, how is it divided? But once it's in place, it just feeds itself and is more productive.
 
HILL:  That is what stands out to me every time, the fact that it's not just their maintaining productivity, but that in most cases, it's actually gotten better when people have this. QUEST:  Completely because people plan the work that has to be done, they plan how to do it. They know what's going to happen on the day when they're not there and who will be looking after it, you have to have flexibility, so you're well-prepared to work the fifth day, if necessary. 
 
What you can't do is tinker around. I'm going to work four days, but I'll do a bit at home on a Friday. No, there has to be a proper arrangement in place. I think -- and this is where I'm going to go out on a limb here, I think the U.S. has a greater problem with it because of this rather firm work ethic in this country, which is you work hard, you earn your money, you get your holidays only after you've worked for six months and then you only get two weeks because Lord forbid, you have more than that.
 
And I think that is a psychological problem that the United States has that may be other parts of the world don't suffer from. 
 
HILL:  I would agree that the U.S. seems to be stuck in this mentality, right, of the 40-hour workweek, which came out of union negotiations 100 years ago. But the reality is most businesses don't operate that way anymore, and even those that sort of do or operate on a 24/7 cycle. Hello, the news business, police departments. It's been shown with a little bit of planning as you point out, it can work it.
 
QUEST:  It does work, and I think what's going to happen, of course, is unions are going to realize this and say, hang on, the next improvement in living standards for workers is a four-day properly organized four day working week. 
 <br>[15:50:04]
 
But you're going to have a lot of people who are going to think that this is just somehow getting one over easy life.
 
My grandfather worked hundred hours the fact he died as soon as he retired, God knows. But that's how the mentality works.
 
HILL:  Yeah. We're in a need to change that. Listen, I'm firmly on board. So if you want to call a meeting together with our bosses, I'm with you.
 
QUEST:  I'm sorry --  
 
HILL:  You've done -- you've done enough already this week. Richard, go, go. He actually can't go that far, and neither can you, because "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS" is coming your way right at the top of the hour. 
 
But before we get there, well, baseball talk for you. The World Series now, just hours away here in the U.S. and we've got a little preview for you from Los Angeles as the Dodgers prepared to take on the New York Yankees in game one .
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HILL:  The countdown is on just a few hours from now, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees will meet up for game one of the World Series. 
 
Here's Natasha Chen with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  East versus west. Shohei Ohtani versus Aaron Judge, its the dream matchup 43 years in the making.
 
MIGUEL JIMENEZ, KADI PROMOTIONS:  Because it's Yankees versus Dodgers, you know, nobody wanted to miss this game.
 
CHEN:  Miguel Jimenez is a ticket reseller in Los Angeles with high rolling clients hoping to score seats.
 
JIMENEZ:  What kind of ticket you're looking for?
 
CLIENT:  In this case, I'm just looking for the best deal, whatever the best deal is.
 
JIMENEZ:  OK, you know the cheapest ticket is 1,100.
 
CHEN:  Seats closer to the action are going for thousands, the most expensive tickets to a World Series ever. Jimenez says that's partly because prices in general have jumped since the pandemic, but also because of who's playing.
 
The interest in this epic World Series matchup between an east and west coast team from the two largest metro areas in the U.S. really extends beyond our borders, to countries where fans may have historically rooted for the Yankees. 
 
JIMENEZ:  You have to let you know, in Mexico, 80 percent of the population go for Yankees.  A lot of people, the north side of Mexico, they go for Dodgers. 
 
CHEN:  Gary Lee, founder of the Dodgers Nation fan sites says similarly in Japan after World War II, there had been a tradition of rooting for the Yankees, but now Shohei Ohtani is there nation's superstar.
 
GARY LEE, FOUNDER,  DODGERS NATION:  Shohei Ohtani is a Dodger, right now, and then having to face the Yankees. This is going to be, there's going to be some discussions between grandpa and his grandkids at the dinner table.
 <br>[15:55:03]
 
CHEN:  Fans from Japan poured into L.A. during the regular season to see Ohtani play, staying in L.A.'s Little Tokyo where businesses have seen way more customers this season.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We thought we ordered enough, but then people got, you know, the word got out and all of a sudden they're here all the time. When he hit the like 50-50, when he broke the record, tons of people just swarmed downtown just to celebrate.
 
CHEN:  Very different dynamic than the last Dodgers World Series appearance in 2020, when the pandemic prevented most fans from attending any of the games played in Texas rather than at the team's home stadiums..
 
LEE:  That feeling, we didn't get a parade, nothing you know, it was more of like a yay, we won, you know, stay home. You know, you keep your mask on.
 
CHEN:  This time the series starts in Los Angeles and people are seizing the moment. Even if many can't afford a seat.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's the classic clown face, you know, a little bit of pin striping bring car culture into it. 
 
CHEN:  They're buying merchandise and treats with cultural touches the way only a melting pot of a city can do that.
 
DEANNA DUCTOC, OWNER, LOS ANGELES BAKER:  Even more meaningful, because were bringing our culture and what we love and part of our city together. 
 
CHEN:  Natasha Chen, CNN, Los Angeles.
