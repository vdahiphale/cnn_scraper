ROSESMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world, and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead, Israel withdraws some troops from southern Gaza as the military prepares for an incursion into Rafah, one of Gaza's last refuges.
 
Eclipse mania hits a fever pitch with just hours to go before a total solar eclipse makes its way across North America. 
 
And CNN sits down with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ahead of his visit to Washington this week. 
 
Good to have you with us. First this hour, a significant development in Israel's war against Hamas as it passes the six-month mark. The Israeli military says it has withdrawn ground forces from the southern city of Khan Younis so they can recuperate and prepare for future operations. The IDF says it is quote, "far from stopping operations in Gaza and that a significant force remains in the enclave." 
 
Video from Khan Younis shows the widespread destruction left behind. The Israeli military says the withdrawal from the city effectively marks the end of its ground operation in Gaza in its current form. But Israel's defense minister is making it clear troops leaving Gaza will be back for follow-up missions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER:  The troops pulled out to prepare for their future missions. We saw examples of such missions in the operations at Shifa Hospital and also for their future mission in the Rafah region.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH:  Israel has faced strong international opposition to a possible ground operation in Rafah, where more than one million people have sought shelter. Egyptian state media is now reporting significant progress in talks over a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. Delegations from Israel and Hamas headed to Cairo for negotiations that are said to be quote, "bringing points of view closer together." 
 
That came on the same day demonstrators took to the streets in Jerusalem to demand the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAL NACHSHON, TEL AVIV RESIDENT:  These are our people and we can't stand another day without them coming home. And its above politics, its above religion, it's a humanitarian issue and that's what we're here to shout today. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  CNN's Ben Wedeman filed this report before the latest word on progress from Cairo. 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The stage is set for a new round of talks in Cairo aimed at reaching some kind of ceasefire in Gaza, given an additional sense of urgency by the U.S. following President Biden's Thursday phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden urged Netanyahu to try and reach a deal. 
 
The prime minister already facing growing domestic demands to bring the hostage's home. President Biden also urged Qatar and Egypt, the principal mediators in these talks, to pressure Hamas as well. The basic outlines of a deal have been on the table for months. That at first, a ceasefire, Hamas wants a permanent one. Israel clearly looking for a temporary halt in hostilities. 
 
Second, an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails. What needs to be worked out is the ratio of Palestinians for every hostage. And finally, the return of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to their homes in northern Gaza, if that is they have homes to return to. CIA Director William Burns is in Cairo along with the Qatari foreign minister. The Hamas delegation is led by senior leader Khalil al- Hayya. 
 <br>[02:04:53]
 
Israeli officials tell CNN their delegation to Cairo will have an expanded remit to negotiate the details, though the final decision still rests with the cabinet. Failure once more to reach an agreement will have deadly consequences. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Beirut. 
 
CHURCH:  Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former U.S. State Department Middle East negotiator. He joins me now from Washington. Good to have you with us. 
 
AARON DAVID MILLER, SENIOR FELLOW, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE:  Thanks for having me, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  So, six months into the Gaza war that was triggered by the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. Is this conflict at a turning point as a result of last week's deadly Israeli strikes on those seven World Central Kitchen aid workers that angered President Joe Biden and intensified the strained relations between him and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu? 
 
MILLER:  A turning point toward a better outcome or a worse one. I mean, I think six months into this war, what I think I can say with real certainty is that Israelis and Palestinians are in what I would call a strategic cul-de-sac. And right now, I see no way out. 
 
There is the possibility, negotiations are ongoing in Cairo now, of a limited hostage exchange, 45 Israelis, women, the elderly and the infirm, from a symmetrical number of Palestinian prisoners, a hundred of which were either convicted of or accused of killing Israelis, and a 45-day ceasefire. That will not end the war. 
 
So, I'm not sure I would use the word turning point or inflection point. I think it is safe to say that the Israeli ground campaign has taken a sort of a downshift. The Israelis started with 100,000 forces in their beginning of the ground operation. They've withdrawn most of those from northern Gaza, central Gaza. 
 
And I think only one brigade remains, anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 Israeli forces controlling the east-west highway road that cuts Gaza in two. So, in that sense, I think it is a turning point, but it is by no means are we closer to the end of the war.
 
CHURCH:  Right. And you mentioned Israel withdrawing those troops from southern Gaza. It's also set to reopen the Erez crossing into northern Gaza temporarily to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave in response to President Biden's call to do more to help civilians. But again, will this be deemed enough? 
 
MILLER:  Well, it really depends. I think that the Prime Minister is on probation. I think the President made it very clear. But I also think that Joe Biden does not want to sustain confrontation. He does not want to exercise the leverage that he has. Certainly, the key leverage, which is to restrict or condition U.S. military assistance. 
 
So, he's given the Prime Minister a test, frankly, that the Israelis should have passed two months ago. The Port of Ashdod is only, what, 20 miles from northern Gaza? It's replete with screening facilities. They could have handled an enormous amount of international humanitarian assistance.
 
And then the U.N. could have trucked it into northern Gaza instead of having to go all the way to Kerem Shalom or Rafah. So, I think the Israelis can do a lot to satisfy the administration's demands. I think that's not too strong a term, that they do more on humanitarian aid. But none of that is going to bring the war any closer together to an end. 
 
What you need is an Israeli-Hamas agreement to begin to hope that you could build on that to de-escalate military activity on the Israeli side and clearly Hamas as well and free the remaining hostages. But that's going to be a very tough lift and it is not going to happen anytime soon. We're looking at months more of what we've seen before. 
 
CHURCH:  And in the meantime, Israelis have been out on the streets calling for the resignation of their Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, while ultra-Orthodox Jews have also been demonstrating against efforts to have them included in conscription requirements. How shaky is Netanyahu's hold on power right now? 
 
MILLER:  I mean, the polls suggest that the vast majority of Israelis want elections and they don't want Benjamin Netanyahu as their next Prime Minister. The problem is there's really no mechanism to remove him. 
 <br>[02:09:50]
 
The only way to do it is if in fact his coalition, 65 seats, somehow fractures, which would then require Knesset majority to schedule new elections roughly three months from when that legislation passed. But right now, Gadi Eisenkot and Benny Gantz sit in the War Cabinet. The Israeli public is demonstrating. But as you pointed out, Rosemary, there are any number of reasons for the demonstrations. 
 
And you need a united, literally what you had in the judicial reform period, when for 40 weeks you had hundreds of thousands of Israelis out in the streets.  You don't have that yet, and you need that and you need Benny Gantz, I think, to leave the War Cabinet and address the nation as to why he's leaving. And even that might not shake the most right-wing extremist government, the coalition, in Israel's history. 
 
CHURCH:  Aaron David Miller, appreciate your analysis and perspective on this. Thanks for being with us. 
 
MILLER:  Thanks for having me, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  An Israeli official says the reopening of the Erez crossing for humanitarian aid has been delayed. It was set to open on Sunday, but officials say they're still making what they call logistical preparations to ensure the checkpoint can accommodate truckloads of aid. Despite the urgent need and U.S. pressure, the Israeli military agency in charge of aid deliveries says it will announce the crossing's opening, quote, "once a date is set." 
 
The World Food Program's executive director, Cindy McCain, says a massive amount of much-needed food is just waiting to get into Gaza. But she says it's important that the right kind of foods are getting in, especially for children who are in desperate need of nutrients. Here's what McCain told CNN on Sunday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CINDY MCCAIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME:  WFP stands ready. We have right now amassed outside on the border food for 1.1 million people for three months. We just need to get it in. That's why these crossings are so important and more crossings are needed, as you know.

It is the final countdown to solar eclipse Monday when millions of people in the U.S., Mexico and Canada will watch the moon block out the rays of the sun. The forecast for parts of the eclipse path of totality could ruin the view of this once-in-a-lifetime experience for many. But regardless of what the weather may bring, it likely won't dampen the enthusiasm of millions of people who die hard eclipse chasers. 
 
Scientists in Mexico have been planning and preparing for this rare celestial event, and so have cities in the path of totality as they expect an influx of tourists. Well, the solar eclipse's path of totality will begin in Mexico where we find Gustavo Valdes. 
 
GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Scientists say it is very fortunate that the eclipse is going over Torreon, Mexico, right in the center of the country, because they have not one but two telescopes. One of them is always looking at the sun. They study the star every day. The other one, they used to see the stars at night, but this time they have modified it so it can look directly into the eclipse, not looking at what we're seeing, the round circle of fire. 
 
They're going to be looking closer in. They're going to be focusing on specifics on the moon and the sun as much as it is possible. Here in the planetarium, they installed this graphic in which they are showing the path of the sun and the moon, and on April 8th, just around 1:00 p.m. local time, it's when the eclipse is going to happen. 
 
NASA is here. They're going to be doing experiments, but there are also a number of scientists from other cities, from other countries, some amateurs, some professionals. They are going to be looking at the star like everybody else, but a little bit closer with their telescopes. 
 
The locals are lining up to buy their glasses. That is very important, but they are also expecting about 750,000 people here in Torreon. Mexico is going to be the first country in North America to enjoy this event, and people are ready. They are excited. There's going to be a party here. They're going to have a fair. They're going to have music. And they're going to have experts to talk about what's happening in the skies. Gustavo Valdes, CNN, Torreon, Mexico. 
 
CHURCH:  And large crowds are flocking to the Niagara Falls to watch the solar eclipse against the backdrop of the waterfalls. CNN's Harry Enten reports. [02:15:00]
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  The solar eclipse is edging closer and closer to western New York. I'm here at the beautiful Niagara Falls, where soon enough the sun will be covered up by the moon as we experience a once-in-a-generation event here in western New York. The crowds have been building throughout the weekend, a much larger crowd now than there was when I arrived on Friday. 
 
The big question, of course, is going to be the weather here. The forecasts have been swinging back and forth. It was sunny the last two days, but on Monday the question is whether or not it'll be mostly cloudy, partly sunny, or mostly sunny. I've been looking at the latest forecast, and the truth of the matter is we don't know. But if there's one thing that is for certain, we'll be having a ton of people here in western New York. 
 
We're looking at upwards of a million folks. You add in the folks on the Canadian side of the border, we can be looking at a million plus. They're in for quite the show, pretty much no matter what. Harry Enten, CNN. 
 
CHURCH:  And earlier I spoke with NASA program executive Julie Crooke on the significance of the total solar eclipse. She explained the phenomenon that sets this one apart.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JULIE CROOKE, PROGRAM EXECUTIVE, NASA'S HABITABLE WORLDS OBSERVATORY: The very first time I saw it in 2017, it was life changing. I mean, it's a one in a time, I mean, in a given location, it happens once every more than 300 years. And so, it is quite amazing to see not just it become dark all so quickly, but also how nature reacts. 
 
I mean, last time I saw it in 2017, I was in western North Carolina, and all of the birds just became quiet, the crickets became quiet. I mean, it was just -- it was very astonishing. And just as quickly as it comes, it goes, because the shadow is traveling so fast across the earth.
 
CHURCH:  So, seize that moment, right? And I do have to ask, will the solar eclipse live up to all the hype because there has been a lot of hype. 
 
CROOKE:  I mean, it's not -- it's very rare when the celestial bodies align, just to be able to see this total solar eclipse. And this one is going to be even more special, because it's a supermoon. The orbit of the moon around Earth, it's not perfectly circular. And so, at some points, it's a little closer to Earth, which is when you have your total solar eclipse, versus back in October of 2023. It was a little further away, which gave you the annular eclipse. And so, I think, you know, with the supermoon, this is going to be a really special event.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  NASA's Julie Crooke speaking to me earlier. Well, join us later today for the total solar eclipse as it travels from Mexico across America and into Canada. Experience the total eclipse from numerous locations, along with plenty of science and excitement along the way. Our special coverage starts at 12:00 p.m. Eastern. 
 
And still to come, ahead of a key meeting this week with Joe Biden, Japan's Prime Minister told CNN the world is at an historic turning point. We'll explain why. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:20:00]
 
CHURCH:  Ukraine's president is giving his strongest, starkest warning yet about the state of the war against Russia without military aid from the United States. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  If Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war. And we need to find a public format for this. If Ukraine loses the war, other states will be attacked.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Volodymyr Zelenskyy also says Russia will soon be, quote, "more and more insistent" on dragging nuclear weapons into his debate. 
 
Meanwhile, the head of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee says Russian propaganda has absolutely spread through Congress, particularly among some of his Republican colleagues. A number of hardline House conservatives have refused to back a $95 billion aid package, which includes $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine. 
 
The war in Ukraine, as well as rising tensions in the Middle East and parts of Asia, are key concerns for Japan's Prime Minister. Ahead of a trip to Washington this week, Fumio Kishida will meet with President Joe Biden as Japan moves away from decades of pacifism and bolsters its defense posture amid the various spiraling global conflicts. 
 
The Prime Minister spoke with our correspondent in Tokyo, Hanako Montgomery, who joins me now. So, Hanako, good to see you. What more can you tell us about your conversation with the Prime Minister and his key concerns?
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Good to see you too, Rosemary. During our interview with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, he warned that the world was at a historic turning point. He pointed to the Israel-Hamas war, Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the situation much closer to home. 
 
Despite international sanctions, North Korea is continuing to ramp up its nuclear capabilities, and China is increasing its aggression in the South China Sea. All the more reason why, Kishida says, it's very important for Japan and the U.S. to strengthen and upgrade their alliance during the state visit. Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  The world at a historic turning point, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida tells me, ahead of a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden this week. The longtime partners will upgrade their defense relationship to the next level, in the backdrop of mounting international security challenges. 
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
FUMIO KISHIDA, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN (through translation):  In our neighborhood, there are countries that are developing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, and others that are building up their defense capabilities in an opaque way. Also, there is a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in both the East China Sea and South China Sea. 
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Kishida says soaring geopolitical tensions forced Japan, long a pacifist country, to change its defense posture, moves not seen since World War II. Under his leadership, Japan plans to boost its defense spending to 2 percent of its GDP by 2027 and purchase weapons, including U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, acquiring counter-strike capabilities for the first time in decades.
 
(On camera):  So, if Japan has a security pact with the United States, why does it need counter-strike capabilities? 
 
KISHIDA (through translation):  Missile-related technology is evolving year by year. As missiles become more sophisticated, Japan must constantly consider what kind of technology is needed to protect the lives and livelihood of its citizens. 
 
MONTGOMERY:  You've asked for a summit with Kim Jong-un, but there seems to be some mixed messages coming from North Korea about its engagement with Japan. What is your current level of communication between your administration and North Korea? 
 
KISHIDA (through translation):  We believe that resolving various concerns between Japan and North Korea and stabilizing relations is important, not only for the interests of our two countries, but also for peace and stability in the region. For this reason, we believe that it is important to hold a summit meeting, and under my supervision, I've been conducting high-level outreach to the DPRK. 
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Following the U.S.-Japan summit, the two nations will convene with the Philippines, the first trilateral meeting of its kind, to address rising security threats from North Korea weapons testing and aggression in the South China Sea.
 
KISHIDA (through translation):  We are not targeting China specifically, or a specific country. As Japan, we've been working to strengthen the Philippines' maritime enforcement capabilities. We're also providing them with defense-related equipment. 
 
MONTGOMERY (on camera):  You mentioned that it's not directed towards any one country, but wouldn't you say that the Philippines is gravely concerned about China's actions in the South China Sea? 
 
KISHIDA (through translation):  It's true that there are some developments, as you pointed out. I think it's important for the Philippines to defend its sovereignty, to protect its own territory, territorial waters, and airspace. I believe that these things are very important in maintaining and strengthening a free and open Indo- Pacific based on the rule of law.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  The U.S. and Japan, an enduring bond, confronts its pivotal moment as a volatile world seeks to unravel their global sway. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
(On camera):  Now, of course, having counter-strike capabilities are key to deterrence for Japan, according to Kishida. But also, it's this steadfast relationship with the United States that is able to maintain safety and stability in the region, according to the Japanese Prime Minister. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  Hanako Montgomery, in Tokyo, thank you for your report. And of course, your interview. Appreciate it.
 
Still to come, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has her last meetings in China on the final day of her diplomatic trip. We're live in Beijing with the very latest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:32:43]
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome back, everyone. 
 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to hold a news conference soon on her last day in China. Yellen has spent the weekend meeting with both local and national leaders discussing the U.S. and Chinese economies and areas of concern for both parties. She says, it's a continuation of the dialogue between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping started in November at the G20 summit. 
 
And CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang, has the latest for us. He joins us now live.
 
Good to see you, Steven. 
 
So on this final day of her diplomatic trip what, can we expect to hear from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as she wraps up these last meetings in China. 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF:  Yeah, Rosemary, as you mentioned, that press conference is about to kick off at the U.S. ambassador's residence, which is only a stones throw away from where I am. My colleagues Marc and Justin there asking her -- they will be asking her about her own assessment of this trip. But, of course, she is expected to sound a positive note as already reflected in the government from a readout, a highlighting the new initiatives launched by both sides to deepen their conversations and dialogues on topics ranging from anti money-laundering to work on and calm more balanced growth in the domestic and global economies. That's a platform presumably they can discuss the issue of Chinese industrial overcapacity, a key item on Secretary Yellen's agenda. 
 
That, of course, is Washington's concerned about China dumping cheaply produced the goods and products, especially green type products on the global markets, depressing prices and negatively impacting the U.S. economy. And the Chinese, of course, had been pushing back on this very strongly as saying this is a purely pull it accusation. Aim and smearing China instead, they are getting angry about the U.S.'s increasingly stringent export controls of key technologies including semiconductors, targeting China with Chinese leader Xi Jinping actually raising this with President Biden doing their most recent conversation.
 
But also echoing President Biden, Secretary Yellen has raised the issue of warning China not to provide any material support for Russia's defense industrial complex, at Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. 
 <br>[02:35:07]
 
But as we speak though, the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has arrived in Beijing for more talks with it his Chinese counterparts presumably to strengthen their so-called no limit partnership and paving the way for another Putin visits. 
 
So it seems strategically the Chinese have made it their choice in terms of aligning more closely with Moscow because of their shared grievances against this American dominated world order and trying to reshape it. 
 
So even though its all well and good that Janet Yellen's here during her second trip to China to have these dialogues resuming after years of deep freeze and the Chinese may indeed make some tactical adjustments because of their own domestic economic headwinds. But at the end of day, it seems its very unlikely either site will change their strategic assessment of their selves, of themselves and the others intention and that is not going to really change the overall relations, especially in a U.S. election year -- Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH:  All right. We know you'll be monitoring that news conference. Steven Jiang joining us live from Beijing, many thanks.

It is sweet revenge for South Carolina. The Gamecocks now have their third NCAA women's basketball national championship. They dashed Caitlin Clark's titled dreams with an 87-75 victory over Iowa. The Hawkeyes knocked South Carolina out of the tournament last year.
 
Donning her Iowa jersey for the last time, Caitlin Clark said despite the loss, she doesn't have time to in her words sulk and called her team's season special. 
 <br>[02:40:03]
 
CNN's Brynn Gingras has more on this much-anticipated showdown.
 
(BGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We're on the court at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, where South Carolina still celebrating that national championship win Dawn Staley, their coach, cutting down that net as she led her Gamecocks to an undefeated season. That has not happened since 2015 by UConn Huskies. It was an credible game.
 
Both teams going back and forth, Gamecocks leading at the half and really, Hawkeyes could have come back from that. Of course, Iowa Hawkeyes led by 22, Caitlin Clark. Anytime that girl scored, everyone was up their seats. That is though last time Caitlin Clark will be putting on our jersey for the Iowa team, not able to clinch a national championship.
 
You know, she said that winning would be the cherry on the top of what she really hopes for, is that she has made people feel and love the game of basketball that she has inspired younger generations. And there is no doubt that that is the case. Even Dawn Staley's saying that she has elevated this game.
 
But what a win for South Carolina, undefeated in the national championship.

Egyptian state media is reporting significant progress in talks over a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. Delegations from Israel and Hamas headed to Cairo for negotiations that are said to be quote, bringing points of view closer together. Meantime, in Gaza, the Israeli military says it has withdrawn ground forces from the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel says a significant force still remains in Gaza and the departing troops leaving to recuperate and prepare for future operations. 
 
A video from Khan Younis shows the destruction left behind. The Israeli military says the withdrawal from the city effectively marks the end of its ground operation in Gaza in its current form. But Israel's defense minister is making it clear, troops leaving Gaza will be back for follow-up missions, including in the Rafah region.
 
And U.S. President Joe Biden is taking a tougher stand, warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he needs to do more to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, or face consequences. That warning came last week during a phone call. 
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has more about what was said between the two leaders.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  CNN is learning new details about appointed call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week. That call coming at a pivotal moment only days after World Central Kitchen employees were killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza. Now according to sources, President Biden place additional pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change his policies in his war against Hamas, that included primarily getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza by opening a land crossing, a port and also ramping up supplies. 
 
Now, according to a source, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to that, saying that there would be more done. But the president went a step further, saying that it needed to be done soon. And indeed, hours after the call, these really security cabinet approved of the measures. 
 
And the White House has so far welcome the moves and the changes that they've seen thus far, acknowledging that there has been frustration and that more needs to be done. But what is clear is that the us is steadfastly supporting Israel in its right to defend itself. The difference now is that they are more willing to change their policy if Israel doesn't change what it's doing. Of course, what that would be still remains an open question, as well as what metrics the us is using to determine if Israel is making the necessary changes.

CHURCH:  Meantime, and Israeli official tells CNN plans to reopen the Erez Crossing between Israel and Northern Gaza have been delayed. They say they're still making logistical preparations to ensure the checkpoint can accommodate truckloads of aid.
 
Under threat of being ousted, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing more pressure to decide whether to move forward on more aid for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Johnson is getting pushback from Republican colleague Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is firmly against any further Ukraine aid. This comes as the head of the House Intelligence Committee has warned that Russian propaganda has seeped into Congress. And that some of his Republican colleagues are repeating that misinformation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH), U.S. HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIR:  It is absolutely a true. We see directly coming from Russia attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro Russia messages, some of which we even here being uttered on the House floor. I mean, there are members of Congress to day who still incorrectly say that this conflict between Russia and Ukraine is over NATO, which of course, it is not. Vladimir Putin having made it very clear, both publicly into his own population that his, his view is that this is a conflict of a much broader claim of Russia to Eastern Europe.

CHURCH:  More now on the dilemma facing the House Speaker from CNN's Manu Raju.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, is facing a daunting road ahead as he tries to navigate competing politics in his own conference, as well as demands for action on aid to Ukraine. Remember, aid package that passed the Senate earlier this year has been stalled in the House because of Republican opposition to that bipartisan $95 billion package. It includes money for Israel, for Ukraine, for Taiwan. 
 <br>[02:50:01]
 
Mike Johnson in the time said he wanted that to include border security measures. Then the Senate cut a bipartisan border security deal, Mike Johnson, along with Donald Trump, opposed it. Essentially, it was killed in the U.S. Senate. 
 
So where do they go from here? Because there is still this demand for Ukraine aid? Mike Johnson is trying to move behind the scenes, to try to cobble together a plan that could win over significant amount of Republicans support and tried to woo Democrats as well. 
 
It is uncertain whether he can do that. He wants a border provisions in there. He wants to narrow that Ukraine package, all which still could be too much for the Ukraine critiques within his conference, namely Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is running to oust him from the speakership. She already filed a resolution over call for his vote, seeking his ouster. 
 
Remember this happened last fall to Kevin McCarthy. He was the first speaker ever ousted by his own colleagues on a vote on the House floor. Greene is trending to do that. Again, she told me last week that Johnson should absolutely not move forward of any Ukraine aid package, saying they would mo move the needle with her, suggesting that that could actually force that vote. 
 
The question will be, would Democrats come to Johnson defense and would they do that if the even if Johnson move forward with a Ukraine aid package, that was not something that they ultimately could get behind -- all major questions for the speaker going forward. 
 
Now the speaker has been busy himself, trying to raise money for Republican candidates as a tried to scrambled to keep their razor thin Republican majority. On the Democratic side, I've learned of new details about the push by the Democrats to take back the House in the fall. The Democratic super PAC House Majority PAC plans to invest more money than it ever has to win back the House. They are announcing today $186 million is put between $140 million or so for TV ads, the rest for digital ads in some key swing districts going after Republicans in Biden districts trying to defend Democrats and Trump districts all going to lead to a furious battle, or as the leader of the group told, trench warfare with Republicans district by district, to try to keep the Republican -- the Demo -- the win over with -- take the Democrats back to the majority.
 
But there are so few districts truly at play here. So, enormous sums will be spent, but will have huge implications. As we can see right now, the majority decides the agenda and the Democrats are the majority, their agenda would be much different than the Republicans.

CHURCH:  On a brighter note, eclipse day is finally upon us. In the coming hours, the moon will obscure the face of the sun with the path of totality moving from Mexico across the U.S. to Canada. Areas near the Great Lakes and in New England are positioned to have the best seats to watch the celestial event with sunny skies in the forecast. But severe weather in some areas could dampen the excitement of eclipse-watchers. The U.S. National Weather Service says a multi-day flood threat is expected to stretch from Dallas, Texas, to Little Rock, Arkansas, which could impact eclipse viewing and travel for tourists. 
 
CNN's Miguel Marquez is in Cleveland, Ohio, with a closer look at what die-hard eclipse chasers are hoping to see.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Sun, sun, sun, clear skies, that's what we've been hoping for. The weather reports are getting better and better as it goes on. This is the Great Lakes Science Center, some 30,000 plus people well be pouring into this area. It's also home to NASA's Glenn Research Center, Cleveland is. It's the only NASA facility in the country that's in the path of totality. So NASA is here in force. 3:17 p.m. or 3:13 p.m. when the eclipse starts, it'll be right up there the totality for three or but for almost four minutes here.
 
The last time that Cleveland had an eclipse, a total eclipse, 1806. The next time after this, you will have to wait until 2444, that's 420 years. So people here in Cleveland are ready for it.
 
Back to you

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, since last year. 
 
ELAM:  As the eclipse charts the Americans sky from Texas through the Midwest and on into the Northeast, it will trail with it and economic impact of up to one-and-a-half billion dollars. A big chunk of that boosting the Lone Star State, which will experience the eclipse for a fraction of an hour.

BULENT TEMEL, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO: I call this the most profitable 22 minutes in Texas history. 
 
ELAM:  At the intersection of the 2017 and 2024 events, Carbondale, Illinois, is dubbed the crossroads of the eclipse. That's where a southern Illinois university will cancel classes and fill its 15,000 seats stadium with sky gazers. 
 
A local cafe is serving up eclipse cookies, lots of them. 
 
LEAH MACIELL, OWNER, CRISTAUDO'S CAFE &amp; BAKERY:  We'll probably end up doing a round 60,000 a day.

UNIENTIFIED MALE:  I just remember how awestruck everybody was at the time. 
 
ELAM:  Roger Sarkis and his wife, Alyssa (ph), so were inspired to start Eclipse Glasses USA after the 2017 eclipse. Their sales of protective spectacles to view the upcoming celestial spectacle exploded on Monday, Sarkis says. He now expects they will sell out again. 
 
ROGER SARKIS, FOUNDER, ECLIPSE GLASSES USA:  We actually sold out of our original inventory in February. So I bought more inventory and I think we're on track to sell 500,000 pairs. ELAM:  So this is beyond what you ever thought was possible.
 
SARKIS:  Yes.
 
ELAM:  But all kinds of businesses are getting in on the skyrocketing excitement with eclipse specials, from Krispy Kreme's eclipse donut featuring an Oreo cookie in the middle, to Sun Chips solar eclipse chips that will only be available for four minutes and 27 seconds, the length of totality -- perhaps a once in a lifetime experience with stellar money-making opportunities.
