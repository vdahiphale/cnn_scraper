UNKNOWN: Cheers to America!
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
UNKNOWN: God bless America.
 
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR AND SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I think --
 
UNKNOWN: And the linemen.
 
UNKNOWN: There you go.
 
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR AND SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Everyone, thank you very much. Thank you for watching "NewsNight: State of the Race." "Laura Coates Live" starts right now.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): This is CNN Breaking News.
 
LAURA COATES, CNN HOST AND SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Good evening. I'm Laura Coates with our breaking news tonight. Hurricane Milton, right now an extremely powerful Category 5 storm, set to make landfall in Florida roughly 24 hours from now.
 
We've just gotten a new advisory this very hour. Milton is currently moving towards Florida's Gulf Coast, tracking towards the Sarasota area and potentially inching even further south. And it's going to get a lot bigger before it gets there. That means a life-threatening storm surge potentially reaching up to 15 feet.
 
But this hurricane is going to impact the entire state. Everyone on edge because any wobble in its trajectory could actually impact which part gets hit the hardest. And to make matters worse, the area, as you know, is still recovering from Hurricane Helene.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
Just to show you how strong this storm is, take a look at this. Video showing NOAA Hurricane Hunters that are flying inside of Milton. The turbulence is so severe, their belongings are actually being tossed all across the airplane. And here's the view from even higher up in space. In space itself, a NASA astronaut sharing this time lapse that captures the growing size of this monster storm.
 
Meanwhile back on the ground, people are scrambling to try to get out of harm's way. Lines and lines of cars are stuffing the highways.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
But there are some people who are choosing to ride it out. See, for them, the dire warnings, well, they could not be more dire. One emergency official saying -- quote -- "This is the ocean coming into your living room." A local police chief is urging people who stay to write their names on their leg. And Tampa's mayor is giving the starkest warning to those who do say, saying -- quote -- "You're going to die."
 
I want to start with CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Chad, what does this new forecast show?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST AND SEVERE WEATHER EXPERT: We are still Category 5. I mean, I watched this storm all day waiting for the decay, waiting for the eye to kind of fall apart. It simply hasn't. We're still at 160, and we know that because Hurricane Hunter aircraft are still flying through it. This isn't just some made-up number. This is a real number. You saw the plane bouncing around earlier today. Another one is actually in it.
 
But where do we go from here? We're still watching the cone, because the cone is still pretty wide, north of Tampa all the way almost down to Naples, because at the middle of that cone and slightly to the right side of that cone is where we're all talking about this over- wash of the barrier island. The barrier islands are going to have water all the way from the ocean into the back bay, washing away basically anything that's in the way, including those houses.
 
Why don't we know where it's going? Well, let me show you this for a second. There is a lightning here with one storm, not a hurricane, but certainly a precursor event here that will make heavy rain for South Florida. And also, even lightning around the eye at this point.
 
But look what happened earlier today. How can you predict a hurricane that started here earlier, went to the north, turned right, turned left, went north, and now it's -- that's the problem. This has been wobbling around, so we don't have that trajectory of a straight line of where it's going from here.
 
If you are in this red zone, you are in a hurricane warning. If you are in the cone, you have to be very, very careful. To the right of where this makes landfall, that's where your 15, maybe 18-foot storm surge will be. To the left, a lot less. But you're still going to have wind of 125 miles per hour.
 
So, what are you really looking for here? People have been asking me all day, where's it going to hit? And my answer is yes, because it's going to be all the way with these winds, all the way north of Tampa, all the way down to Fort Myers, and then across the entire state with hurricane force winds.
 
There'll be millions without power, but I just hope we don't have people that stick around. And let's see if it's okay, because for some people, it won't be okay.
 
COATES: Chad Myers, thank you so much for giving us the very latest. Please stay with us as well. Look, as Milton is nearing Florida, communities in the Tampa Bay area, they are still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. I mean, this is a video that was sent to us by the mayor of Belleair Beach, Florida.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
That's a barrier island just south of Clearwater.
 <br>[23:05:01]
 
Take a look at all of the trash, all of the debris that is literally lining the streets there. Now, local officials have been urging everyone to get out, warning that all of these, all that you're seeing there, that could become deadly projectiles as the powerful wind from Milton sweeps through the area.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
Joining me now, Mayor Dave Gattis, the man who took that video that you just saw. Mayor, thank you for joining us. I just want to show our viewers where your city is. It's right on the water. It's very vulnerable to a storm like Milton that is coming. How concerned are you, mayor, about all of that debris from Helene as your city is bracing now from Milton?
 
MAYOR DAVE GATTIS, BELLEAIR BEACH, FLORIDA: Hello, Laura, and thank you for inviting me to speak. Very concerned. At the end of the event, I rode the streets and realized that we had major damage. Within days, the community began emptying their homes out, trying to mitigate, and I realized that we had a big problem because all the trash was on the street, and we had another storm approaching. I had concerns, but now, I have major concerns.
 
Fortunately, the city and the county and the state have all worked together and they've removed much of what you're seeing in this video now, but I would say there's still a quarter of it left on the streets that they've not been able to pick up.
 
So, if we have this storm surge, we have these high winds, which I suspect we will at least have the wind, if not the surge to go along with it, we're going to have trash, just projectiles flying all over the city. So, it's definitely a dangerous area to be in. Most of the city has left. I still think there are a few holdouts that will take their chances, and I really wish they wouldn't.
 
COATES: I mean, just the way you described it, mayor, and thinking about the debris, the projectiles, the dire warnings that are there, you've, obviously, listened to the evacuation warnings. You yourself, I believe, are in Orlando tonight. But what do you say to anyone who has decided to stay in Belleair Beach? Can they get out now?
 
GATTIS: They can leave, but they can't come back. And there are many people that have decided they have nowhere to go. Maybe it's because they have pets. Well, I'm here to tell them that they can go to Largo High School, they can go to Palm Harbor High School, they can go to many of the high schools in Pinellas County, and they are pet-friendly shelters.
 
So, it's not too late. Get in your car, drive across that bridge, and seek shelter. The last thing that we want to do is find out that something bad happened to you because you refused to leave.
 
COATES: Mayor Dave Gattis, thank you for issuing that warning and also being sensitive to the why some people opt to stay as well. Thank you.
 
GATTIS: You're very welcome.
 
COATES: You know, it's bad enough that people have to worry about a catastrophic storm. But now, this year, 2024, they also have to worry about the misinformation that will follow that storm. Less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene hit, conspiracy theories, they are running rampant. It is so bad, the Republican congressman, Chuck Edwards, of hard-hit North Carolina, had to post this letter today, imploring his constituents not to believe some of the lies that are clearly out there, including ones that have been pushed by Donald Trump.
 
He fact checks in the letter -- quote -- "FEMA has not diverted disaster response funding to the border or foreign aid." Also, this: "FEMA is not only providing $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery." Harris today also weighing in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's profound and it is the height of irresponsibility and, frankly, callousness. And the idea that somebody would be playing political games for the sake of himself, but this is so consistent about Donald Trump. He puts himself before the needs of others. I fear that he really lacks empathy on a very basic level.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Well, joining me now, former Homeland Security and COVID Task Force advisor to Vice President Pence, Olivia Troye. She has endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Olivia, thank you so much for being here. I mean, here we are, two hurricanes in as many weeks, frankly, and people are panicking about the prospect of what this could mean in terms of destruction.
 <br>[23:10:00]
 
And yet that's not the focus for some people. Trump has been insisting on pushing blatantly false claims. Why?
 
OLIVIA TROYE, FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY AND COVID TASK FORCE ADVISER TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: You know, it's his selfishness. He can't help himself. It's really always all about him. And he can't connect to the fact that people right now, Americans, are in need, right? There is a crisis here happening in the southeast. These people, like, they've just lost their homes, they've lost loved ones, they've lost people in their community. And now, they're preparing to weather another storm.
 
And so, I just think like it's so just un-American to see someone who once served as president of the United States and who is seeking the Oval Office again behaving in such a manner because right now really should be a moment of unity, non-partisanship, being like we are going to help Americans regardless of your politics, regardless of -- you know, red state, blue state, whatever is going on here.
 
But Donald Trump doesn't see it that way. And, look, he behaved this way during his presidency. I saw it firsthand when it came to disasters, when it came to blue states. He'd sit on disaster declarations, right? I mean, he was always like, you know, you -- as you've seen, I just did an ad for Kamala Harris on the wildfires because of that.
 
COATES: In fact, I want to play a clip of that, because that was really, really intriguing. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TROYE: I remember one time, after a wildfire in California, he wouldn't send relief because it was a democratic state. So, we went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas to show him, these are people who voted for you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Now, the Trump campaign is calling that a fabricated story. But what does that moment reveal to you?
 
TROYE: Well, you know, they can call it a fabricated story, but there were a lot of people who witnessed that and a lot of people involved on trying to figure out how we were going to get that relief out to California. I believe during one conversation, the words to the head of FEMA were basically, don't give them any money. I mean, that is so just completely -- just unpresidential to do that when Americans are in need.
 
And look, I recorded that ad because I just felt so strongly watching Donald Trump again spread disinformation, kind of lead people down this path. Quite frankly, it's dangerous and it's counterproductive to the people that are doing their emergency response right now. It's hurting the leaders locally, it's hurting the governors. I mean, all they're trying to do is navigate this natural disaster.
 
Now, you have Donald Trump spreading misinformation, lies that are just creating more hatred, division in the communities, and doubt. He's undermining federal agencies. He's undermining the responders on the ground, right? And that makes their jobs harder. It's making their jobs twice as hard. COATES: It certainly does. And every moment spent trying to address this is a moment they cannot spend on the people who need it most. And there's a second hurricane coming, the largest on the planet, they're saying, at this point in time. President Biden today, speaking of that, said that Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, obviously, is doing a great job.
 
We, of course, know there has been some back and forth between himself and the vice president, Kamala Harris, who didn't dispute that he's doing a good job. But she talked about that she has taken issue with the fact that DeSantis has not returned her particular calls. And she addressed it today on "The View." Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: This one is going to be different. And that's why I called the governor about what Florida has received in terms of impact. We have to have an agreement that at some point, we all need to work together. And I think it's a shame that that hasn't happened.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: The governor of Florida says that the vice president has no role in the coordination of these sorts of storms and beyond. In your experience working with Vice President Mike Pence, was that the case? Does the vice president have no role in storm coordination?
 
TROYE: Well, actually, that's pretty ridiculous, coming from Ron DeSantis, since he used to call Mike Pence's office all the time, especially during times of crisis, during natural disasters, hurricanes, especially during COVID. So, that's pretty rich coming from him. I was on those calls sometimes. So, you know, it's kind of ridiculous for him to say that to Kamala Harris.
 
And it's -- you know, it's her being in her V.P. role reaching out, also managing, sort of dividing the task up with the president, also checking in and saying what can we do to support you in the, you know, advance of this, we're watching this, we're tracking it. It's that kind of spirit of we're united and we're being supportive of you because we are in these offices and our responsibility is to provide for you and be the backbone to you, right?
 
We're one team, we're one team right now because, really, the goal is Americans. That's what we're focused on. We're focused on the American people and the residents in your communities. That's what matters. Politics should enter that conversation.
 
But clearly, Ron DeSantis is taking cues from what we're seeing. He's adding to the sort of politicization that I would say in this scenario and following in Donald Trump's footsteps.
 
COATES: I mean, let me know when politics stops the storm surge or keeps people safe. It is not happening. Olivia, stand by, please. I've got to ask you, frankly, about this new reporting that Donald Trump has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving the White House, up to seven times no less. [23:15:01]
 
And journalist Bob Woodward says that Trump actually sent Putin COVID tests during the worst days of the pandemic. We'll be back in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COATES: There's stunning new reporting tonight. Former President Trump secretly stayed in touch with Russian President Vladimir Putin after leaving the White House. Since 2021, there have been as many as seven phone calls between the two. On one of those calls, Trump asked an aide to leave the room so he could have a private phone call with Vladimir Putin.
 <br>[23:19:58]
 
These new details all come from legendary journalist Bob Woodward's new book, "War." But that's not all. At the height of the pandemic, Trump reportedly sent Putin COVID tests for his personal use, even as they were desperately needed right here in the United States. Woodward writes Putin told Trump to keep it secret, saying -- quote -- "'Please don't tell anybody you sent these to me.' 'I don't care,' Trump replied. 'Fine.' 'No, no,' Putin said. 'I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me.'"
 
The Trump campaign is responding to the reporting. They say -- quote -- "None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome" -- unquote.
 
But Vice President Kamala Harris is seizing on the reporting, saying this to Howard Stern just today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: Everybody was scrambling to get these kits, the tests, the COVID test kits.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Couldn't get them.
 
HARRIS: Couldn't get them.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Right.
 
HARRIS: Couldn't get them anywhere.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Right.
 
HARRIS: And this guy who is president of the United States is sending them to Russia, to a murderous dictator for his personal use?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Olivia Troye is back with me who, of course, worked on the COVID Task Force. What was your reaction to that reporting?
 
TROYE: I was appalled. Actually, I had these memories of bringing cabinet members into the White House to get them tested, trying to get these testing systems at the very beginning so that people would be safe and trying to figure out because we're trying to plan for continuity of the country, planning for this crisis, how we're responding to it.
 
And the president of the United States is sending it off to a foreign adversary? I mean, that is just so unbelievably shocking to me knowing everything that we went through, especially at the onset of the pandemic, when he was doing these types of things. And so, it's just unbelievable, right?
 
And then it's also just kind of like the wannabe dictator connecting with the dictator and getting his talking points and getting his propaganda guidance from Putin. I mean, if that's not indicative of the fact that Donald Trump takes his instructions from people like Putin, I don't know what else is. Right? The fact that they're coordinating behind the scenes.
 
And then to continue these conversations, still today, when you're not even in the Oval Office, honestly, the first thing I thought about was like those classified documents sitting down in Mar-a-Lago. And when he kicks the eight out, I'm thinking, so what's he sharing in that moment? Is he sharing intelligence information with Putin? I mean, obviously, you know.
 
So, to me, from Putin's perspective, I'm thinking like he's got an asset right there, right? He's KGB, he's manipulating him, he's getting him -- he's getting information from him. And Donald Trump is falling for it because it's just lauding his ego, because that's who Donald Trump is.
 
COATES: Well, we'll see what the reaction would be from all of this. Obviously, there's special counsel who'd be intrigued if what you're saying is even remotely true about information sharing on these very points. But Senator J.D. Vance who, of course, is the running mate, as you know, of Trump, he says those phone calls between Trump can be summed up with one word, diplomacy. Does that make any sense?
 
TROYE: No. He's not the current president of the United States. What kind of diplomacy is he doing behind the scenes? Because actually, I think that's illegal.
 
COATES: But we do have non-presidents who engage in diplomatic relationships, to be fair.
 
TROYE: That is fair, yes. But what I'm saying is like, what diplomacy with Putin when he's actually invading Ukraine right now and hurting the Ukrainian people? So, I don't see Donald Trump advocating for Ukraine. I don't see him doing that publicly. I mean -- so, I'm just, you know, what goes through my mind is like, what was going on behind the scenes here? Was there coordination?
 
I mean, we've watched what Donald Trump has done in leading people in Congress, Republicans in Congress, standing against Ukraine. Sometimes, you know, we've seen Marjorie Taylor Greene in Congress before Congress delivering Russian propaganda, talking points at times, right?
 
So, like, what was really going on in these conversations? Was that the diplomacy he's talking about then? Is that the kind of conversations he's having? I mean, it's really just disturbing and alarming reporting, to be honest. It's just -- it's so upsetting.
 
COATES: And, of course, you wonder why did Trump believe he could solve what he says the invasion to Ukraine in a day. Is there some reason to believe that he has an inside voice or a receptive ear? I have to question for a lot of reasons.
 
But there's also another anecdote in Woodward's book that is getting a lot of attention. And that is Biden blaming Obama for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. And he says he didn't do enough to stop Putin in terms of his invasion of Crimea. Is that a fair criticism by Biden towards Obama?
 
TROYE: You know, I think hindsight is 2020, right? The moment of how you behave in these national security and foreign diplomacy events. I think we've learned a lot since then. And I think -- you know, I think he's looking back on it and thinking, what should we have done differently? Would that have led, you know, to the situation and these dynamics down a different path? I mean, that's fair. It's fair to kind of assess that.
 <br>[23:25:00]
 
COATES: Well, we'll have to see how that is received and what the reaction will be, particularly 28 days before an election. This book, obviously, called "War," looking forward to reading the whole thing. Olivia Troye, always great to have you on. Thank you.
 
TROYE: Thanks for having me.
 
COATES: Well, still ahead tonight, it's a question she has been asked before. But this time, Kamala Harris gave an answer that the Trump campaign thinks may cost her big time. We'll debate that, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN: Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
 
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of -- and I've been a part of -- of -- of most of the decisions that have had impact.
 <br>[23:30:04]
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) COATES: Well, that split-second answer on "The View" dredged up one of the concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris, that she represents four more years potentially of the same. The vice president then clarifying, though, a few minutes later.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: Listen, I plan on having a Republican in my cabinet. You want to have a list?
 
UNKNOWN: Yes.
 
UNKNOWN: Right.
 
HARRIS: You asked me, what's the difference between Joe Biden and me? Well, that will be one of the differences. I'm going to have a Republican in my cabinet because I don't -- I don't feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Clean up on aisle four, right? To try to walk a pretty delicate tightrope, embracing her boss while campaigning, of course, as a fresh start. And a new poll from "The New York Times" finds that she's having some success on that very notion. For the first time, she is seen as more likely to represent change than Trump. And it comes as Biden's approval ratings remain underwater.
 
Trump, of course, seizing on this comment, saying that Harris told -- quote -- "the degenerates on 'The View' that she would have done nothing different than Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of the United States" -- unquote.
 
With me now, Meredith McGraw, national political correspondent for Politico, Lance Trover, former presidential campaign spokesperson for North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, and Maria Cardona, CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist, who I'll begin with here.
 
Maria, she says nothing comes to mind about what she would change. Some are pointing that as a head-scratcher, that perhaps she should have given a more polished view, but there was a tension at play, right?
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I actually think this is too much ado about nothing. I mean, did we really expect her to sort of claim a huge difference from her current boss on national television? I don't think so.
 
The fact that she is running a Black woman of Asian descent, daughter of immigrants, her historic nature represents change. We're seeing, you pointed it out in "The New York Times" poll, people are seeing it. In addition to that, the policies that she's talking about are also change, but they are change in a way that says to people, I am listening to you about what the last four years were not able to accomplish for you. And guess what? I am going to now delve into the issues that you really need for somebody to fight for you on. And that is a huge contrast with Donald Trump, who is only in it for himself, and the only person he wakes up every day concerned about is himself and staying out of prison.
 
COATES: Meredith, on this point, she has tried to separate herself from Biden without being perceived as disloyal, to Maria's larger point. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: It's important to remind the former president, you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me. Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: So, she's aware of, obviously, the optics and the reality. But there's also this idea, if she were to say what she would have done differently. She, on the one hand, could suggest that she didn't like the policies and doesn't agree with him and that there was fault there. And also, that maybe, if they did them anyway, she was not as powerful as she wants to present. How does she thread this needle?
 
MEREDITH MCGRAW, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, POLITICO: Well, this is a challenge that the vice president faces. How do you present yourself as the change candidate when you are the vice president and when you did work on all of those administration's policies and you are at the same time presenting yourself as a fresh face and the way forward?
 
You know, for any candidate, they want to present themselves as the change candidate. You know, going back for decades, Americans have said that the country is not moving in the right direction, and they want to see change in their leadership. And so, I think that poll that we saw tonight from "The New York Times" showing that Harris has an edge over Trump by two points, still within the margin of error, but that's a change from the past two weeks where Donald Trump has actually been ahead in those marks.
 
But I think for Harris, trying to communicate what her policies are going forward, articulate them, how they would be different, and also not disrespect the person that she served with is a challenge and something that it seems like the Harris campaign is really working to try to present to these undecided voters.
 
COATES: I was struck by the comment she made about one way she thought she was going to be different was to have a Republican in her cabinet. And she made the phrase and, of course, you heard her say it, because I wouldn't let my pride get in the way of a good idea. Of course, I thought to myself, is she referring to Biden? Was this a prospective discussion or was just a statement that she was making?
 
In any event, do you think that having a Republican on her cabinet, Lance, is something that's going to persuade a lot of voters? Because right now, "The New York Times" poll suggests that she is polling at 9% with Republicans.
 <br>[23:35:00]
 
That's more than Biden 2020, by the way. But is that enough?
 
LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: No, I'm not -- know of any Republican that's going to go out there and say, oh, yeah, well, she's going to throw Adam Kinzinger into her cabinet so, therefore, I'm going to go vote for her.
 
Look, in every campaign, not every campaign, I've done a lot of campaigns in my life, occasionally, there arises a point where the candidate goes out and says something that they should not have said. That was today with the Harris campaign. Her whole campaign is based around turning the page and looking forward.
 
The Trump campaign's theory of the case is she is just a continuation of the Joe Biden administration. And her statement today on "The View" basically says that she is a continuation of Joe Biden. She could have come up with anything. How did she not have the answer down? I mean, this was pretty easy. She could have said Afghanistan. That wasn't exactly a bright point for the administration. But she didn't. You're going to see this in T.V. ads, swing states, everywhere.
 
CARTWRIGHT: Go ahead.
 
MCGRAW: I was going to say, the Trump campaign has already cut that clip from "The View" and it seemed like it was a missed opportunity for her that she did, obviously, try to clean up.
 
CARTWRIGHT: This is where I disagree and this is why I don't think that what she said is really going to be relevant. Because if you look at the individual policies that this administration has put forward on the economy, they're spectacularly popular.
 
The $35 insulin, the student debt forgiveness, the expansion of healthcare and Medicaid and Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the historic climate change issues that were inside that act, the PACT Act, the CHIPS Act, the fact that he -- Biden was able to have these pieces of legislation on a bipartisan basis.
 
So, I think that this whole issue is clouded by the fact that the American people actually support those individual policies, which is why the vice president said, I don't disagree with the major things that I worked on with him that had massive impact. Those were the words that she said on "The View."
 
And so, I think the way she couches it gives her the ability. And she did it today, too. She talked about a policy that is hers. She talked about helping the sandwich generation. I'm a sandwich generation. I have to take care of my children. I have to take care of my elderly mom. That's a huge policy that speaks to millions of Americans. So, I think that is what Americans are going to focus on.
 
COATES: I do want to focus well on what Senator Mitt Romney had to say because, frankly, he may cast a ballot for Harris. Listen to what he had to say today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): I've made it very clear that I don't want Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States, and you're going to have to do the very difficult calculation of what that would mean. All right? And my own view is that I want to continue to have a voice in the Republican Party following this election because I think there's a good shot that the Republican Party is going to need to be rebuilt and reoriented.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: It's not a full-throated endorsement of any such imagination. It is almost like that you have to do the math of what I'm really saying to you. But he also warned the point we are talking about, which is widely popular, some of the issues. He also warned, Lance, about Democrats being in danger of losing because of cultural issues like, he says, defund the police, for example.
 
Are those topics still resonating with voters when you look at the cost benefit analysis of the overall landscape and, of course, the way people have said they have misconstrued entirely what that would mean to reallocate resources to police?
 
TROVER: Yeah, absolutely. Look, I consult for several congressional races around the country. Crime and defund the police still ranks as one of the top concerns in the congressional races that I'm seeing out there.
 
CARTWRIGHT: But nobody is running on that. Nobody. Absolutely nobody is running on defund the police.
 
TROVER: That's actually not true in some of the congressional races I'm working on. It is a big issue. But I'm going to go back to something you said a while ago. I think the problem here is that the wrong track in this country, 65 to 70, this is why this comment today was so bad for her, is that the country believes that we are on the wrong track by like 70% right now.
 
And just on the polling, back on the polling, the other issue that she has is if even in "The New York Times" poll while she may be winning on the change agent, the big issue that she is losing on by double digits is the economy and cost of living, which all voters say is their number one issue out there, and the other one is with the blue collar voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. That is where she's struggling. That's why she's out doing interviews right now because she's not closed the deal with those voters.
 
CARTWRIGHT: So, a couple of things on that. The right track, wrong track is not going to be the same kind of arbiter that it has been in years past because massive amounts of Democrats believe that this country is going in the wrong direction because of the stranglehold of MAGA in so many states and the massive abortion bans that are putting women's lives in danger. So, that indication is not what you think it is. [23:39:58]
 
And then on the other issues, in terms of her being one that actually represents what people care about, that people are saying she's the one who understands people like me, I think is also a huge arbiter. And she's getting 9% of Republicans. Donald Trump is getting 80% only. He's underperforming with his own base. That's a big, big danger sign.
 
TROVER: So, why isn't she closing the deal yet?
 
CARTWRIGHT: She's ahead.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
COATES: Well, we got -- we do have 28 -- we do have 28 days to go before these deals are closed. We'll see what happens. Thank you so much to everyone here. Don't worry, the clock is ticking.

Kamala Harris's media blitz though is heading to Las Vegas for Univision town hall as poll shows more Latino voters turning towards Trump. Why is that? And can Harris do anything to turn them back? Actor and activist John Leguizamo has some thoughts on this, and he joins me next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COATES: Well, on Thursday, the Kamala Harris media blitz, it's going to roll into Las Vegas to take part in a Univision town hall right there. Harris leads Trump by 14% among Latino voters in one of the latest polls. But that poll only tells part of the story.
 
Republicans and Trump in particular, they're making inroads in the critical voting bloc. In fact, the margin of support the Democrats enjoyed among Latino voters, it has dwindled from a 50-point lead -- a 50-point lead in 2016 to the 14-point lead that Harris holds over Trump today.
 
Now, it's pretty clear the Democrats have some work to do to shore up support among this growing constituency. With more than 36.2 million eligible voters in 2024, according to the Pew Research Center, it's the second fastest growing ethnic or racial group in the entire country.
 
With me now, actor and comedian John Leguizamo. He's also the creator, host, executive producer behind the new PBS series, "Voices American Historia: The Untold History of Latinos." So glad to have you here, John, and we could have gone on for a while in terms of your resume. But I'm so intrigued by the work you've been recently doing especially. Why do you think that Trump and Republicans are gaining so much ground on Democrats? JOHN LEGUIZAMO, AWARD-WINNING ACTOR, COMEDIAN, ACTIVIST: Well, I mean, because Latinos, we're, economically, kind of at the bottom of the food chain. So, what are we concerned with? Food prices, gasoline, housing. All that really matters to us. Right now, you know, the prices are a little high. And so, who gets to blame? Whosever in government. And Trump, you know, lies, makes big promises that he can't keep. But Latinos buy it. They believe it, you know. So, that's the problem right there.
 
COATES: You know, I often wonder, as a Black woman, I'm often told how I feel as a voter, as a member electorate, and we have to always respond, there's not a monolith. Are you experiencing that same frustration at times about trying to suggest, well, I know you're trying to capture a vote, but there's not a monolith? Is there something in particular that you think Harris should express during the town hall and have a message that can be more universalized even though there's not a monolith? Right.
 
LEGUIZAMO: I mean, Latinos are not a monolith. Some of us are very conservative, religiously conservative. Uh, some of us are self- hating.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
There's that group who are --
 
COATES: Not pulling punches, huh? Okay.
 
LUGUIZAMO: -- attacked by the Latinos. Yeah, there's -- there's -- there's a small portion of that. But the majority of us, we -- we all do respond to the economy. So, that's what she needs to talk about, the specifics. How is she going to help boost small businesses? How -- what -- what is the plan? What are the numbers? What are the stats? That -- that's going to make a big difference. With the housing that she's promising, what are the numbers? How does that break down?
 
I think, you know, Latino women are the lowest paid worker in America, but the number one in small business creation, which is one of the biggest driving -- drivers of the American economy. Talk to them. Talk to these women. Boost them. You'll -- talk to their husbands and get them -- and get them all to vote.
 
COATES: That's an important point, thinking about their focus on small businesses particularly. And there was a new poll out, John, that shows that Trump is holding a pretty significant lead over Harris on the issue of immigration among Latino voters. What do voters want to hear from both candidates on this specific issue?
 
LEGUIZAMO: You know, I didn't realize how immigration was such a complex issue in the Latin community, but it is.
 
COATES: How so?
 
LEGUIZAMO: I always thought we were all for like -- because I always thought like -- when we say immigrants, we're really talking about Latinos, and Haitians are Latino as well. So, we're talking about Latinos. So, you would think we would all be supportive and empathic and sympathetic to the plight of immigrants. But a lot of immigrant Latinos feel competitive towards other immigrants coming in. They feel like I paid the dues, I paid the price, why are they getting asylum? So, there's some bitterness there. So, that's a problem there. We are not trying to figure out how to deal with that.
 
You know, I also want to say something, that America caused a lot of this Venezuelan immigration problem. The sanctions that we put in Venezuela are so killing up an economy and destroying their economy.
 <br>[23:49:59]
 
And that's why there's the runaway immigration from Venezuela, because they can't eat, they can't survive. And that's all America has done in England, because it's sitting on the biggest oil reserves in the world. So, that's another issue that needs to be addressed, then you won't have as much immigration coming to the U.S.
 
COATES: John, I really appreciate you coming on and having this conversation and the work that you're doing. Thanks for stopping by.
 
LEGUIZAMO: Thank you for having me. What a pleasure. Much love.
 
COATES: Well, he is the Florida man who rode out Hurricane Helene in a purple kayak. Now, he's getting ready for Hurricane Milton. Matt Heller joins me next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COATES: All right, you remember this guy, right? He's our very own Florida man, Matt Heller of Tampa, and he went viral on his purple kayak as the water rose in his home when Hurricane Helene hit. Thankfully, he is safe. His house got pretty nasty afterwards, but Matt found some way to stay cheerful and, frankly, optimistic through all of it.
 
Well now, unfortunately, Matt is getting ready to deal with another hurricane, this time, Hurricane Milton, and has again decided to ride out the storm from his Tampa Bay home.
 
Matt is back with me tonight. Matt, I have to tell you, so many people are specifically concerned and worried about you, so I'm glad to see you and glad to see that you continue to do well. But this storm is coming and the Tampa mayor is saying that you really should evacuate. Why are you risking by staying?
 
MATT HELLER, TAMPA BAY RESIDENT: Thank you, Ms. Coates. We have to stop meeting this way.
 
COATES: Me, too.
 
(LAUGHTER) HELLER: I -- you know, I've been watching the weather really close. Like I said, I've been, you know, going through this for 42 years as a Native Floridian. I take it real seriously. I've just been watching the weather as it shifts. It's such a slow-moving system. You know, better safe than sorry, but this is where I plan to be
 
I have a life jacket. I got some lights, more battery packs. I'm a lot more prepared. I'm hoping for the best. So, we're just kind od hunkering down in place for the time being.
 
COATES: Who is the "we?" I mean, is your girlfriend going to ride out with you again? And I wonder what your family thinks about you staying.
 
HELLER: My mom was definitely a little alarmed. She was suggesting maybe I wear some sort of helmet as well to protect myself. I'm hoping that the home doesn't collapse or anything, you know, blow away or anything like that. My girlfriend is here. She spent the day with her family, but then we're missing each other, so I went and picked her up. I told her if it gets too sticky tomorrow, I'm going to send her home and we'll kind of go on as it is.
 
We don't even have rain here in Tampa yet, so I'm thinking we have at least another 20, 21 hours to try to watch this thing and see how it develops. I feel terrible for the folks in Sarasota, but at the same time, I feel we may have dodged a bullet here in Tampa. It's just too early to tell with these things.
 
COATES: I mean, you're right to think about any wobble of that trajectory might impact which area gets hit the hardest. But the entire state really has been on alert. And you told me last time, the kayak was your escape plan. You have it again? Is it ready?
 
HELLER: I have the kayak, I have a life jacket, and I even inflated -- I have an inflatable unicorn that I aired up yesterday. So --
 
COATES: What?
 
HELLER: -- I have a couple more escape options. It's -- I don't know. It's safety first. You know, I'm trying to make my mom happy here. So, if anything, I could do rescue on the unicorn, maybe save some stranded neighbors. We'll see. But again, I'm hoping it doesn't flood like it did last time. And, you know, we are just taking it minute by minute, day by day, and just watching the weather.
 
COATES: My goodness, I'm thinking about somebody thinking they need a superhero rather than the bat in Gotham City being projected. It's some unicorn and you are coming instead, and I hope everyone is safe.
 
But your neighborhood, it still has tons of debris left over from Helene. I mean, a lot of it. And frankly, Milton could bring wind speeds near it. We're hearing 130 miles per hour. That debris could become projectiles. Aren't you concerned about that?
 
HELLER: Absolutely. You know, it has been 11 days. We followed all the instructions from the city, which was to leave our construction debris un-bagged out on the curb. It felt like littering to me. I never would have thought it would kind of still be out there 11 days later. I know it's a huge monumental task, but I just -- I was kind of surprised they didn't have some more support and, you know, get some more boots on the ground to help with the cleanup, especially for areas like mine that are so close to these waterways.
 
I just worry about those construction grease clogging any kind of drainage systems or impeding any other type of rescue -- rescue attempts of anyone that needs it. I don't know. It is what it is. There's no playbook for this. Two historic storms so close back to back like this. I just -- I applaud everyone that has been putting in the long hours and it's just a tricky situation.
 
COATES: There are so many people who are desperately trying to make sure everyone can stay safe. Where are your cars? What are you going to do with your cars? What about your business?
 
HELLER: Yeah, I worked. Today was a normal workday. We have paid time off tomorrow, so we will be closed. I was hoping that the roof and everything maintains and holds strong. We're moving some product around in our warehouse at Horn Blasters. I'm just kind of hoping for the best. They don't really have insurance there either. It is time for a new roof. But, again, we'll see. As long as there's no loss of life. That's the main thing. Any of the other stuff will be fine.
 
COATES: Matt Heller, I got to tell you that you are a walking emoji, smiling and optimistic.
 <br>[00:00:00]
 
Thank you so much. We hope you sincerely stay safe. We'll see you tomorrow night. Please stay safe. Okay?
 
HELLER: Thank you, Laura. Thank you.
 
COATES: Thank you so much. And hey, thank all of you for watching out there. "Anderson Cooper 360" is next.</pre>
