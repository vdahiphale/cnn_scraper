BRUNHUBER: England fans are hoping for a win but they'll have to get past a tough Spain team to do it. We're live from Sydney with a preview of the World Cup final match. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber. 
 
BRUNHUBER: And we begin in California where southern parts of the state are under a state of emergency and bracing for the impact of Hurricane Hilary. The historic storm is now at category one strength with maximum winds of around 85 miles an hour. It's expected to make landfall in the coming hours on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula and later slammed into Southern California as a tropical storm. 
 
Residents rushed to stock up as Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for areas in Hilary's path. Thousands of personnel have also been deployed ahead of the storms arrival. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GAVIN NEWSOM, CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR: We have 7500 now personnel dedicated in Southern California. Please, please listen to emergency personnel. Local officials, take seriously debris flows and floods, flash floods, lightning, possibility of tornadoes.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: San Diego's Mayor met with the governor to discuss emergency operations and government support. The mayor also urged people to be prepared. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TODD GLORIA, SAN DIEGO MAYOR: Please take precautions right now. A couple of minutes of effort today could reduce our impacts tomorrow. And that can make the difference between a prolonged power outage, other service disruptions. And obviously you could also make the difference between life and death. So I hope that people will make good choices.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Meanwhile, evacuation orders have been issued for parts of San Bernardino County, beaches, parks and other public areas are also closed in two counties. Disneyland's theme parks will close early today and striking writers and actors say they've canceled their scheduled picketing in Los Angeles Monday. 
 
For more now let's go over to CNN Meteorologist Karen Maginnis. And Karen, we're just getting the 5 a.m. update. So what is the latest?
 
KAREN MAGINNIS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah, so a couple of takeaways from the latest information when still associated with Hilary at 85 miles an hour. So it's the same as our last intermediate update, that hasn't changed. But Hurricane Hunters did see a little tick upward of the central pressure. Essentially what that means is it's going to weaken. We knew that that would be the situation.
 
I want to point out one other thing, something I've noticed over the last six hours or so is really this eastern edge and northern edge of the hurricane really has the deepest convection where it's a little more ragged along that western edge. But don't be fooled, this is going to make its way into northern sections of the North Baja region. Also affect Arizona and into Southern California where we're seeing all kinds of advisories, flood alerts, tropical storm warnings out. And as I mentioned that this is now still a Category 1. It looks like
 
 as it makes its way towards that Southern California border or the border with Mexico, we're looking at it perhaps at Tropical Storm strength. But this is going to be a multi-day event with heavy downpours. Essentially, we may break it down like this some of the coastal areas, one to three inches of rainfall. Some of those inland valleys may be upwards of five inches, possibly some locally heavier amounts, but it's going to be the mountains is orthographic lift. That's going to be really the danger spot as it rings out that moisture are saying that maybe Mount Laguna could see as much as 10 inches of rainfall. 
 
All right, so that's one spot but that water's got to go someplace. And it's going to come careening down off of the mountains but all the way from Los Angeles to Palm Springs, Coachella to San Diego but we're not finished with it. As I mentioned, this is going to be multi-day. 
 <br>[05:05:14]
 
So what will be a much weaker system but still powerful supporting a lot of moisture with it is going to drag across the intercontinental mountain region and for the Great Basin and spread that moisture all the way up into Idaho and Washington State. So it's got some legs to it. And we could see power outages could see the possibility of an isolated tornado. We could see some debris flows. We could see some infrastructure. We could see some trees downed power lines. Those winds are going to be gusting perhaps between 50 and possibly 70 miles an hour. So we'll continue to monitor that. Allison Chinchar, my meteorologist friend is going to be here at the next hour and continue to bring you updates throughout the day. Back to you, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, we appreciate it. Karen Maginnis, thanks so much. 
 
So as Hurricane Hilary approaches Southern California, residents are preparing for the storm. We'll see here local stocked up on essential supplies and filled sandbags to protect their homes, but many are unsure of what to expect since they haven't seen a storm like this in their lifetime. CNN's Natasha Chen has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is a weather event that's created a lot of questions for people in Southern California because they have never seen a tropical storm warning. And the last time a tropical storm made landfall in California was more than 80 years ago. So a lot of people are wondering what exactly they should do. 
 
Officials have said a lot of the preparations that folks would have made for winter storms and flooding months ago apply here asking people to please take advantage of the sandbags that are being given out to bring materials indoors, to not go outside or drive in the weather on Sunday and Monday if they don't have to. Officials have also been very proactive and going to outdoor areas where there are encampments of unhoused people trying to convince them to take shelter inside before the storm really comes through the most intense of which is supposed to be Sunday afternoon at least through the San Diego area with very strong rains and winds. 
 
We are seeing a lot of events being canceled or postponed. In fact Major League Baseball move their Sunday games to Saturday. There are concerts like ones at the Hollywood Bowl being canceled. The U.S. Navy has even temporarily moved their ships and submarines away from San Diego just during the storm at least until it passes through. 
 
Catalina Island in Los Angeles County has been warned for people to -- they're strongly encouraged to leave that island that they're likely to get hit. A lot of high-water rescue vehicles pre-positioned. A lot of personnel out there ready to act as soon as this weather comes through. It has been more than 80 years again since Southern California has seen a tropical storm make landfall. So a lot of people nervous here but officials telling them to just be prepared. Natasha Chen, CNN Los Angeles.

BRUNHUBER: Extreme heat is driving wildfires across North America. More than 1000 of them are burning across Canada right now in the nation's worst fire season on record. The raging in the western province of British Columbia with some 35,000 people under evacuation orders. The premier says some 30,000 more may have to clear out as well. Fire officials say they know firsthand how scary this is for residents.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JASON BROLUND, WEST KELOWNA FIRE CHIEF: We are working hard to get these fires out and to make it safe for the public so that you can go home as quickly as possible. I know it's difficult to be out. And I know that because the majority of my staff including me and my family are also evacuated. So we're all in this together.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Meanwhile, two fires are raging in Spokane County Washington, burning more than 17,000 acres and more than 185 buildings between them. One person has died in the state. 
 
The search for survivors in Maui goes on nearly two weeks after wildfires devastated the community of Lahaina. Officials have now searched 78% of the burn zone. The death toll stands at 114 with authorities estimate more than 1000 people are still missing. Bill Weir brings us the latest from Maui.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: It is now day 11 since the catastrophic fire that tore through parts of Maui and absolutely decimated the town of Lahaina. And while the search area has grown with a lot more personnel, a lot more cadaver dogs coming into West Maui, the number of the missing remains stubbornly stuck and just push up, hit in your stomach when you think about all the families waiting for some confirmation fearing the worst but holding on to some bit of hope.
 <br>[05:10:07]
 
President Biden and the First Lady are coming to Maui on Monday. Whether or not they actually will walk through Lahaina, the burn zone or just fly over the scene. Deanne Criswell, the FEMA Administrator could not say, but promises the President will stand with the people of Maui and lend an ear to local leaders who are very concerned that the reopening plans, the rebuilding plans, anything going forward won't include them, as has been the case here for generations. 
 
The number of people in shelters, though, is going down as more have moved to hotels around the island and off Island as well. And there's a lot more personnel. We're hearing they're now over 1000 personnel here, both state and federal. That has been a big cry early on, mostly citizen led response, now seeing more of the official response, and they're trying to fool those folks in but meeting some resistance from the locals who have pretty much said, look, we set this up ourselves. You're a little too late. So a lot of raw motions as you can imagine in a place with so many displaced, so many still missing. This many days after the fire. Bill Weir, CNN Maui.

Donald Trump's formal arrest in Georgia now just a few days away. Coming up, we'll explain what sort of treatment the former president might expect when he reports to the jail. 
 
Plus, they overcame tough opponents and personal challenges but now England and Spain are one win away from the World Cup title. You can see the fans getting ready for the big game. We'll have previews of the final, next. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:15:47]
 
BRUNHUBER: We are about 40 minutes away from the championship match of the Women's World Cup. After two incredible runs England and Spain will compete for their first title in team history. England are trying to become the second country to claim the trophy as reigning European champions and Spain are hoping to win despite never advancing past the round of 16 before. 
 
CNN's Amanda Davies joins us now from Sydney where the final will be played. So I'm Amanda less than an hour away seeing some of the pictures from outside the stadium where your excitement must be building to a fever pitch right now.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, very much Kim. The fans are now pouring through the turnstiles kickoff, still 45 minutes away. But there is as it's become traditional, something of a closing ceremony, which gets underway in about 15 minutes time. But we just had a big cheer from the fans who are already inside both sides out on the pitch, going through from some final warm up. So a bit of like training ahead of the big kickoff of. The match, which is of course being billed as the most important of their lives so far.
 
In terms of team news, interestingly, Sarina Wiegman has opted to stick with Ella Toone. Of course Ella who scored that brilliant first goal for England's against the Matildas on Wednesday night. She is starting it in place of Lauren James who starts on the bench despite the end of her suspension. For Spain 19-year-old Salma Paralluelo who has been such a superstar. She's written so many of the headlines, hasn't she, particularly over the last couple of matches, scoring those two goals in two matches. She is starting interestingly for Spain ahead of her Barcelona teammate Alexia Putellas so despite the fears yesterday there was some concern that she might have some slight injury but she does start.
 
And this one is all set up to be the most fantastic encounter. Two sides neither of whom have had the earth easiest journey to this final England. Of course with the injuries even before the tournament started then to Keira Walsh, then to the suspension for Lauren James. 
 
Spain, well, it was only a couple of weeks ago they suffered that what was billed as the humiliating 4-nil defeat to Japan. There's all the talk of the unrest in their camp. But their coach Jorge Vilda despite what other people are reading into the body language and the speculation swirling around the team, he says this is a unified team. He's very aware that they are in the biggest match of their lives, of their careers up to this point before this tournament. Spain had never actually won a major tournament or knockout game. So uncharted territory for them. And so to England, their first World Cup final for them although they do have that European Championship trophy success in their back pocket and they are very much drawing on that. But their captain Millie Bright is well aware of what this moment means.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MILLIE BRIGHT, ENGLAND CAPTIAN: I think everyone knows how big this is. I think it's been players dreams for years. So I think everyone already knows that. And when are passionate. Our nation is back home and how much they'd want us to win. But for us it's a process. We have a game plan to execute and like Sweeney said we need to play the game of our lives.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVIES: A game of their lives. With history at stake for both Spain and England, the crowds pouring in eyes of the world watching as well. The stage is set promises to be pretty spectacular, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, let's hope the match lives up to the billing. Amanda Davies, thanks so much. 
 
When Donald Trump and 18 co-defendants surrender later this week in Fulton County, Georgia, it's hard to know how exactly it'll play out. Negotiations are ongoing and likely to continue. CNN's Isabel Rosales explains how the jailhouse process they're usually works and how Trump's booking could be modified.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sources tell CNN that Trump's team has already been in contact with DA Fani Willis' team, and that those conversations are expected to go into early next week. Conversation specifically about the conditions of Trump's appearance and the logistics about his surrender. 
 <br>[05:20:09]
 
We've also heard from the Secret Service, a spokesman telling us that the agency has been on site here at the jail for over the last couple of weeks in contact with the Sheriff's Office here in Fulton County and also with the City of Atlanta ahead of Trump's surrender. And also planning for his first court appearance. 
 
Now, we've heard from officials here, including the Sheriff Patrick Labat of Fulton County, that Trump and his co-defendants are going to be treated the same as everybody else. So let me walk you through what the normal booking process would look like here at the jail for a newly charged defendant. And that process would involve hours of waiting, simply waiting for their turn to get fingerprinted, and get their mug shots taken. Also, there is typically a body search that is conducted by a jail deputy. 
 
Although in the past high-profile defendants who have voluntarily surrendered have been able to forego that body search. A medical screening also typically happens and a pre-trial consultation to determine whether it's appropriate for someone to be released without bond. Here's what the sheriff had to say about the nature of this case.
 
PATRICK LABAT, FULTON COUNTY SHERIFF: Our goal is to treat everybody equally. And so if you're indicted, then we're going to treat you as though you indicted here locally. And so we will continue to do fingerprints, smoke shots, et cetera, in the safest possible fashion.
 
ROSALES: And it is much more likely that this process will still be conducted much more swiftly for these co-defendants just due to the high-profile nature of some of them, including Mark Meadows, a former Chief of Staff. And then also due to all the safety precautions that are involved with transporting somebody that is a former president of the United States. 
 
It's also possible that Trump and his co-defendants might not even have to show up in court for that first appearance for arraignment and that is because the judge could choose to conduct that arraignment virtually or choose to allow them to waive that right to an arraignment. If that happens, it's unclear when the public will be able to see Trump in a Georgia courthouse for the first time. 
 
Clearly though the clock is ticking. Trump and his fellow 18 co- defendants have until Friday to turn themselves in. Reporting outside the Fulton County Jail, Isabel Rosales, CNN Atlanta.

BRUNHUBER: Republican hopeful Ron DeSantis took his campaign to New Hampshire on Saturday, a state that looms large in next year's election cycle. DeSantis is a distant second to Trump in recent polls and his campaign has undergone several shakeups to try to gain more traction with voters. At Saturday's Town Hall in New Hampshire, he touted his record as Florida's governor. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Most people that run for office over promise and under deliver. We made bold commitments across a series of issues. And not only did we meet those commitments we exceeded, we over delivered on our promise is that's the type of leadership that we need.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: DeSantis and the other Republican candidates also attended a conservative event Friday here in Atlanta call the gathering. Trump, however, wasn't invited. CNN's Eva McKend reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: Conservative activists from across the region have the opportunity to hear from a number of 2024 Republican hopefuls. On this final day, they heard from Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, true to form Ramaswamy focusing his remarks on railing against corporate diversity efforts as well as talking about the importance of restoring patriotism in this country. For his part, Christie talking about school choice, public safety and really strengthening America's foreign policy. 
 
Trump not a focus of this event, Erick Erickson who put this on did not invite Trump and was very deliberate in not asking the candidates in these 45-minute-wide ranging interviews for the most part about Trump. Still after Christie left the stage, he addressed reporters, and he attacked Trump for skipping out on next week's first Republican debate.
 
CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's no other conclusion to come to that he's both afraid of me. And he's afraid of defending his record. And if I had his record, I'd be nervous about showing up to it. Let's face it, guys, by Wednesday, he's going to be out on bail in four different jurisdictions. That really -- when are we going to stop thinking that's normal? What are we going to allow our country to understand again that nominating someone who's out on a bill in four jurisdictions is not a winning formula.
 
MCKEND: Though Trump remains dominant in the polls, there is still an appetite from some Republican primary voters to move on from Trump, spoke to some people seriously considering supporting Governor DeSantis. Eva McKend, CNN, Atlanta.

BRUNHUBER: In the investigation into Hunter Biden, The New York Times reported on Saturday that prosecutor David Weiss appeared willing to end his probe earlier this year without any charges against the president's son. But that changed around the time two IRS whistleblowers accused the Justice Department of giving Hunter Biden special treatment. 
 <br>[05:25:13]
 
Now, it's not clear if Weiss actually changed course because of the whistleblowers. A plea deal on back taxes and a weapons violation eventually fell apart. Weiss is now a special prosecutor and his office has indicated it may pursue additional charges against Hunter Biden neither California or Washington D.C. investigation is ongoing. 
 
We're learning more about former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's health from his grandson, he says "it's clear we're in the final chapter."

Josh Carter says, "There's always somebody at the house to keep his grandparents company." Adding the two of them are still holding hands. The Carters have been married 77 years. Now CNN has reached out to the Carter Center for comment but hasn't received a response at this time.

Now on our top story, Hurricane Hilary is barreling toward the southwestern United States and western Mexico. The historic storm is expected to make landfall in the coming hours on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula. It's now a Category 1 storm but could still pack a punch with fierce winds and flooding. It's expected to slam into Southern California as a tropical storm. State officials say they are prepared. Listen to this.
 <br>[05:30:22]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRIAN FERGUSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE: We have Swiftwater rescue teams, high water vehicles, positioned all over Southern California. We've also moved millions of pieces of commodities into the region. So cots, blankets, food, water in case we need to set up shelters. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: California's National Guard has pre-positioned supplies and thousands of other workers have been deployed to help respond to the storm.
 
Russia is reporting two new drone strikes from across the border in Ukraine. The mayor of Moscow says one drone was shot down south of the Capitol overnight while another alleged drone wounded five people in the city of Kursk, according to a local governor. He says the attack damaged a railway station but train service is still up and running. 
 
Meanwhile, Ukraine now says 15 Children are among the wounded following the Russian missile strike on the city of Chernihiv, at least seven people were killed and close to 150 others injured after a missile hit the city center on Saturday. 
 
Ukraine wants to add F-16 fighter jets to its fleet of aircraft but it's looking at other options too. One of them seems to be the Swedish gripping fighter similar to these, President Zelenskyy says he spoke about them with Sweden's Prime Minister during a visit to that country on Saturday. Zelenskyy also says the two nations will follow up on those talks in the coming weeks. Nada Bashir is monitoring developments in Ukraine. She joins us now from London. So Nada let's start with the latest on the attack on Chernihiv?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: We've had those troubling updates from the Ukrainian authorities. As you mentioned there came at least 148 people reportedly injured following that attack on Saturday and among them 15 children wounded and seven confirmed dead and of course this has left a huge amount of infrastructural damage. According to the Ukrainian authorities, this missile attack took place at around 11:30 a.m. local time yesterday. It actually took place on a day which marks a major orthodox holiday in Ukraine. And we've heard from the country's minister for internal affairs saying that people were leaving church as they were struck by these missiles which targeted a key square in the city. Take a listen to one eyewitness account yesterday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): There were screams, a lot of dead and wounded, ambulances. It's horrible. I am helping now to clean up. It's a real tragedy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I was in a shop right next to the square near a bus stop. I entered the shop, went up to a window and that whole window fell on me. I fell, I was in shock. Then I gained my consciousness back, I was knocked down by the explosion force.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: And in addition to striking that town square also struck more than 60 residential buildings according to Ukrainian authorities, as well as a university building and a theater. And in fact, it is in this theater that according to the authorities, a drone demonstration meeting, closed meeting had been set to take place with members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as well as drone manufacturers in Ukraine present and there have been calls from the Minister for Internal Affairs for an investigation into this, what they believe to be a targeted strike on this theater. 
 
And of course, this comes as the Ukrainian authorities and in particular President Zelenskyy continue to push from further military support from their international partners that leads of course, from their counterparts in Sweden. Still President Zelenskyy meeting with his Swedish counterparts. They discussed a boost in military support, a new military aid package and also mentioned that Ukrainian pilots are already carrying out test flights on those Swedish-made Gripen jets that will be a significant boost to Ukraine's counter offensive. 
 
Of course, they've also now begun looking into further support on the terms of artillery, further artillery support, as well as training Ukrainian troops to operate Swedish made armored vehicles which are set to be sent to Ukraine. They have signed now, a statement of intent on that agreement that is going to be a huge boost for their counter offensive.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely. All right. Thank you so much Nada Bashir, appreciate it. 
 
A manhunt is underway in the occupied West Bank right now after a 60- year-old Israeli father and his 29-year-old son were fatally shot. It happened to the carwash in the town of Huwara, which has seen previous violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Security forces are only citing one shooter so far and Israeli security forces are on the hunt. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calling the shooting cruel and criminal. The militant movement Hamas praised the shooting calling it a response to the Israeli occupation. 
 <br>[05:35:10]
 
CNN's Hadas Gold is tracking developments for us from Jerusalem. So Hadas what more are we learning about this?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this massive manhunt now underway. Residents in and around Huwara reporting a major Israeli military presence that includes things like checkpoints and restrictions on movements as the authorities continue to try to search for this shooter in this attack. 
 
Now, this father and son were in a Huwara to run errands and they were actually at a car wash and when they were shot and killed. Now, some context on Huwara, it is a Palestinian village that sits on a major roadway that connects many of the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank with Palestinian villages. And it's actually a place where many people both Israelis and Palestinians go to get things like cars fixed or cars wash because it's often cheaper there than elsewhere. 
 
And this father and son duo were not reportedly settlers, they were actually from the city of Ashdod in Israel that's been confirmed by the city there and they had come to Huwara just to run some errands and get their carwash. Now CCTV video that Israeli media has been reporting on appears to show the alleged incident. You see a man wiping down a car then you see a figure approaching people behind the car, shooting them at essentially point-blank range before leaving the scene. 
 
Now, Israeli medics say that they tried to resuscitate the two victims, but they were not able to do so. And as we noted the Israeli military now having a very heavy presence there. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have both praised the attack but neither of them have claimed direct responsibility. 
 
The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sending his condolences, and saying that security forces are working diligently in order to find the murderer, he said, and to bring him to account. 
 
Now, Huwara has also been the scene of some significant violence between Israeli settlers and Palestinian villagers, especially in the wake of such attacks. There was a deadly event what they're called Revenge attacks from Israeli settlers towards Palestinians last winter. And there was some concern that this attack would see the same sort of behavior but the Israeli military has stepped up in their enforcement while there are some reports of Israeli settlers throwing things like stones at cars and damaging some cars. 
 
There were no reports of major injuries or damages as previously has been in the past. The Israeli military reporting that they actually shot and injured a masked suspect that turned out to be an Israeli who was allegedly throwing something at Palestine, or at Palestinian vehicles. That person is reported to be moderately injured came, this has already been one of the deadliest years for both Israelis and Palestinians across Israel and the occupied West Bank and we're not even close to the end of the year yet. This could be a record setting year for this violence, the cycle of violence between Palestinians and Israelis. Kim? 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, sad to hear. All right, CNN's Hadas Gold in Jerusalem. 
 
Nearly 100,000 security forces are being deployed across Ecuador ahead of today's national elections. Polls are set to open in just a few hours. The country is on edge following a sharp rise in political violence, including the assassination of a presidential candidate.

BRUNHUBER: And some news just coming into CNN and what sounds like a setback for Russia's space program. Russia's space agency Roscosmos reports that its Luna-25 spacecraft has collided with the surface of the moon. And its comes a day after the spacecraft reported an emergency situation as it was trying to enter a pre-landing orbit. This was meant to be Russia's first lunar lander in 47 years and comes as India attempts the same thing. Now that craft is expected to land on the moon on August 23. 
 
Days after a young activists scored a landmark climate victory in a Montana Court, 14 children in Hawaii are hoping for similar success in their lawsuit against their state. The young plaintiffs allege that the Hawaii Department of Transportation is violating state laws by promoting and funding transportation projects that escalate the use of fossil fuels. They're seeking a declaration that department is violating their state constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. 
 
Now, just this Monday, a district judge in Montana sided with young activists in a similar ruling. She also determined that Montana's development of fossil fuels violates those same rights in that state. 
 
And for more on this, I'm joined now by Isaac Moriwake. He's the Managing Attorney for the Environmental Legal Non-profit Earthjustice and the lead attorney in the trial against the Hawaii Department of Transport. Thanks so much for being here with us. So before we talk about your legal action, I just want to get your reaction about what signal this week's Montana decision sense?
 
ISAAC MORIWAKE, MANAGING ATTORNEY, EARTHJUSTICE: Well, it's a historic decision. No doubt. The first time a court in the U.S. has ruled in favor of these us plaintiffs and recognize their constitutional right to a livable environment and climate.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, and we're seeing this sort of this trend of lawsuits on behalf of children or youth complainants. Your son is among those but this will be the first indigenous youth led climate trial in U.S. history. Give me a sense of how these children, how these plaintiffs are being harmed here?
 
MORIWAKE: Right, many of our youth plaintiffs and there's 14 of them all living across the islands in Hawaii. Many of them are Native Hawaiian indigenous, not all of them. But yes, they've taken up the cause and taking their government to court, particularly the transportation officials for violating their constitutional rights under Hawaii law to a clean, safe, healthy, livable climate. BRUNHUBER: So explain that for me, why is it targeting the Hawaii's transportation system? What specifically are you asking for here? What would a wind look like? I assume you don't want to ban all cars in the state?
 
MORIWAKE: No, a win looks like the transformation of the transportation system like we need from a fossil fuel centric, a fossil fuel-based system to a clean energy based on electricity that's clean, based on other modes of transportation like bikes and multimodal options, and not just fossil fuel driven cars.
 <br>[05:45:15]
 
BRUNHUBER: And the argument is that the state isn't doing enough on this and they have to meet certain -- certain goals, is that it?
 
MORIWAKE: Yes, Hawaii has been a leader in a lot of respects and clean energy. We've been the first state in the nation to pass 100% Clean Energy Law. We're the first state in the nation to commit to decarbonizing our entire state by 2045. One place we're badly lagging is the transportation system. Now, transportation, greenhouse gas pollution is the largest share of our greenhouse gas pollution. And it's going up steadily rather than decreasing to zero rapidly like we need.
 
BRUNHUBER: So then circling back to the Montana decision does that set any kind of precedent that could be useful to your cause?
 
MORIWAKE: Oh, certainly, and really causes across the nation in the world. Again, it's this common principle that these use, the next generation have a fundamental right to a livable climate. And that was recognized in Montana. It's certainly recognized in Hawaii. And I want to be clear that our Hawaii Supreme Court has already recognized a constitutional right, to a life sustaining climate system. That's the -- that's our courts words. And our legislature, our Supreme Court, as well has -- has recognized, has declared a climate emergency. And yet it's in this transportation sector, that we really need to turn it around and get serious and move beyond just talking, talking change and get to the kind of transformative change that we really need to, you know, to get to our climate and decarbonization goals.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. And the importance of this, I think can't be understated right now. We're seeing more and more extreme weather. The tragic fires in Maui. I mean, you can't link it directly to climate change, but declining rainfall, rising temperatures, invasive species, all these things certainly contributed. 
 
MORIWAKE: Well, it's no doubt in my mind that this was climate. This -- this latest unprecedented disaster, the largest in Hawaii's history, was directly linked to -- to climate change. And, you know, two of our 14 plaintiffs in this particular lawsuit live right in that impact zone. One of them Kaliko was recently covered in the New York Times. Already in her short 13-year life, she suffered to climate fueled disasters. Just five years ago, her entire house was washed out in a historic storm. And then in this latest unprecedented wildfire, her dad's house burned down and he barely escaped with his life. And so yes, the crisis is now is happening already and it's only going to get worse and that's why these youths are taking these actions and taking the government to court.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, it's just unbelievable. Listen, the country will be watching all the best of luck. I really appreciate you talking to us about this. 
 
All right in the next few minutes, the Women's World Cup final gets underway in Sydney, Australia and as you can see there, the fans in London are ready for it. Up next, we'll a have look which team England or Spain will come out on top. Please, stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: Well, final countdown is on in just about 10 minutes from now. England and Spain will take the pitch in Sydney Australia for the right to be named Women's World Cup champions. CNN's World Sports Coy Wire joins me on the set. So have a place in history at stake here. 
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, no more time for talking or strategizing -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BRUNHUBER: This is it, comes down now.
 
WIRE: -- trying to reach a fever pitch on the pitch and this one, you know, whoever wins this they're going to be remembered forever for being the team that hoisted the Women's World Cup trophy for the first time in our nation's history. 
 
Check out this scene, live in London it is on and popping, countless watch parties all over England for the Lionesses. 
 
Meanwhile, let Aroha have the world's number one men's tennis player on their side. Last night Carlos Alcaraz scribbling out, let's go ladies, let's go for the World Cup Viva Espana, this after a comeback when in the finals of the western and southern open here in the States, can't wait.
 
Men's soccer now less than a month Lionel Messi has taken Inter Miami from the worst side in Major League Soccer to a title leagues Cup Final 23rd minute Nashville SC gets Messi, Leo letting loose the candidates. Tense goal is seven matches. Look at this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 defenders around them and the goalie doesn't matter. My goodness that tied the game at one. The games goes to penalties Messi leaving it off for Miami. So casual with it. It took 11 rounds before final league. Drake Callender stuffing the shot from the opposing keeper Messi and Inter Miami are your inaugural leagues cup champs doing it in dramatic fashion. And you love to see this the team's swarming manager Marino (ph) and the Martino in the postgame press conference. That's champagne, Kim. That's some good stuff they're wasting.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yeah. Well, listen this just in, Messi. Pretty good. WIRE:  It's good. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Right? All right. Let's turn to the other football, NFL football. You know changing emotional gears here a very scary moment on the field. 
 
WIRE: Yes, an injury occurred but thankfully the New England Patriots have said that rookie Isaiah Bolden, is -- has feeling in all of his extremities and -- but this is another reminder that despite the NFL taking all these precautions and the teams and players to make the game safer, this is still a very dangerous game. The fourth quarter, Bolden was trying to make a tackle, took a hit from his teammate, remained on the field for several minutes. Players from both teams gathering to pray. It was a scary scene. This just seven months after Damar Hamlin for the Buffalo Bills was immobilized, placed on a stretcher, carted off the field, rushed to the hospital while Bolden was as well. And just like the unprecedented move to cancel the Damar Hamlin game due to an injury so as this one. The team says Bolden remains in the hospital for observation. Here's one of his teammates and team leader, Matthew Slater.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTHEW SLATER, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS CAPTAIN: Clearly our team was shaken by what happened. I just think a lot of times, all of us, regardless of the profession, we think that we're supposed to go about our day and things are just supposed to happen the way they're supposed to happen. And we're supposed to come back home, and go do it again the next day. And I think we all need to realize how blessed we are. And we need to live our lives with a lot of gratitude.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Kim, we are witnessing a change in the culture of football in regards to injuries. You know, I was on the field during my NFL playing days, seeing two players paralyzed, one later passed away. And both of those instances the game went on. And now we're seeing that player health and safety and their mental health is much more important.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, we were talking off camera about that. I mean, it's just such a huge development in the game that people aren't just these athletes, as he said it right that they're not just seen as pieces of meat, they are people and we have to take their mental health into our thoughts as well. 
 
WIRE: Yeah.
 
BRUNHUBER: Appreciate that.
 
WIRE: Thanks, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, thank you. Coy Wire there, and that wraps up this hour of CNN Newsroom for me. I'm Kim Brunhuber. For viewers in North America, CNN This Morning is next, for Westworld, it's Going Green.
