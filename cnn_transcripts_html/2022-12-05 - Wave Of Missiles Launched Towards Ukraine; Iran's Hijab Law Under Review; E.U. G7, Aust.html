WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In Ukraine, winter is coming in the capital Kyiv. The foreign minister warns 
 
 snow won't be the only thing falling from the skies.
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice over): Russia launches a fresh wave of missiles at Ukraine in the last few hours. We'll go live to 
 
 the capital. The details about casualties and damage.
 
And could change becoming to Iran as the country reportedly reviews its job law? We'll have a live report on what it could mean for Iranian women.
 
And the state of Georgia's crucial U.S. senate runoff, a runoff just a day away. CNN following the candidates and their final push to persuade voters.
 
Hello, I'm Linda Kincaid at the CNN Center. Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. Good to have you with us. Well, stay in shelters, that warning coming from 
 
 the head of the Kyiv region's military administration as Ukraine faces a new barrage of Russian missiles.
 
Air-raid sirens blared across the capital. Ukraine saying its air defense systems intercepted most of those incoming missiles. Residents and soldiers 
 
 in Kyiv heated warnings to take cover. Missile strikes are reported in multiple regions of Ukraine. At least two deaths reported in the 
 
 Zaporizhzhia region. The cities of Kryvyi Rih and Odessa both report no electricity and no running water.
 
Ukraine's president is offering words of encouragement as Ukrainians digging for what will be a long, cold winter.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): I know how difficult it is in Bakhmut, in Donbas. Guys, hold on. I am with you, as 
 
 people are with you. In order to carry out this task, I'm going to carry it out successfully. We must always support each other precisely for this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Well, it's all happening as the European Union's ban on Russian oil imports shipped by sea along with a G7 price cap. It takes effect. 
 
 We'll have more on that shortly. First, I want to bring in our Will Ripley who's in Kyiv with the latest on this new round of attacks. Good to have 
 
 you with us. Will, you like many people in the capital have been in a bomb shelter over the last few hours as these air sirens have continued. I -- 
 
 just give us a sense of what you are learning about these missile strikes.
 
RIPLEY: Hi, Lynda. We received the all clear less than 30 minutes ago and so we came back up to this outdoor location. I have to say it's a relief to 
 
 breathe some fresh air after spending almost four hours underground in that bunker like so many other thousands of people here in Kyiv, who took 
 
 shelter when the air raid alerts went off. But it's only temporary.
 
You never know when the sirens are going to return again. And when you're going to be told you have to go back underground because we've been told 
 
 that there's a possibility of more waves of Russian missile attacks in the coming hours. Now the Ukrainians have been anticipating this they've been 
 
 expecting a large-scale attack aimed at shutting down the nationwide power grid here with the intent of demoralizing people and crippling this battle-
 
 scarred country.
 
But I can tell you, as we've been on the ground talking to folks living with this reality, they are soldiering through it as best they can.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIPLEY (voice over): In Ukraine, winter is coming in the capital Kyiv. The foreign minister warns snow won't be the only thing falling from the skies.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are anticipating another massive missile attack by Russia. And the goal of this attack is to bring total destruction to our 
 
 energy system.
 
RIPLEY: Crews are racing to restore power. These tents set up by the government. A badly needed break from the bitter cold. At this fastfood 
 
 place, braving below zero temperatures at the outdoor grill keeps the doors open when the lights are off.
 
Some customers said they only want to come when there's no power because the food tastes so much better. We're just Ukrainians, she says. That's our 
 
 secret ingredient. Another secret for surviving dark times. Candles, a good cry and prayer.
 
When you come here, what do you pray for?
 
We pray for peace, for the war to be over, she says.
 <br>[10:05:02]
 
Describing the hardship of life of life without electricity. But then I come here and remember how much time we spent hiding in basements. Hiding 
 
 from Russian soldiers who occupied and terrorized their town, Bucha, the site of what Ukraine calls unspeakable war crimes.
 
If you didn't know what happened here, this could be any church in any quiet keep suburb until you look closer. And notice the bullet holes. And 
 
 this cross marking a mass grave for more than 100 men, women and two children.
 
Like five of Vira Goychuck's neighbors.
 
What did it sound ---
 
VIRA GOYCHUCK, BUCHA DISTRICT RESIDENT: It was a cluster bomb.
 
RIPLEY: A cluster bomb.
 
GOYCHUCK: A cluster bomb.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): Bullet holes in her children's bedroom windows. After living through the hell of the Russian occupation, she can handle living 
 
 without power.
 
GOYCHUCK: And what is the real problem is where there's no electricity. We don't have any connection. So, I have kids and if something wrong, I cannot 
 
 even call to the hospital and call emergency.
 
RIPLEY: She tells me when the power goes out she loses his cell phone service and internet. But then --
 
GOYCHUCK: Oh my god, it's miracle.
 
RIPLEY: Is that the lights coming on now?
 
GOYCHUCK: Yes. Yes.
 
RIPLEY: First place she goes, the kitchen.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): Coffee. That's your number one priority.
 
GOYCHUCK: Yes. It's my number one.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): She's grateful for the little things in life.
 
GOYCHUCK: It's a moment of happiness.
 
RIPLEY: Grateful just to be alive.
 
GOYCHUCK: That's it.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIPLEY: A feeling shared by so many people across Ukraine and we know at least two cities at this hour, Lynda with temperatures plummeting. Now once 
 
 again, no power, no running water. It is a dire situation in some ways. But for those who live through such horrific sites, like watching their 
 
 neighbor's bodies lying in the street for a month or wondering if Russian soldiers were going to come barging through their door, they said they 
 
 would gladly endure this as long as they remain protected by their military here. The Ukrainian military and not occupied by the Russians.
 
KINKADE: Yes. It's good to see that you are out of that bomb shelter now, Will, but obviously it's -- we are going to continue to hear this air 
 
 sirens. Just give us an update, if you can on what's happening on the frontlines, particularly the battle for Bakhmut.
 
RIPLEY: Yes, it's great that you mentioned Bakhmut, Lynda, because this is probably at a time that the United States and the head of U.S. Intelligence 
 
 Avril Haines is saying that the fighting is slowing down. It's really been heating up in the Donetsk region, with Bakhmut being Russia's target number 
 
 one. According to the spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern group of armed forces. Basically, Russian units have been trying to push west, trying to 
 
 demonstrate some battlefield success after a series of humiliating defeats.
 
And they're coming up against a very, very sturdy Ukrainian force. That is -- that is with great difficulty holding their own at the moment. They say 
 
 this situation does appear to be under control at this hour. We know that support inside Russia according to public opinion polls for this war 
 
 continues to erode with at least two new polls talking about more than half of the Russian population calling for peace talks.
 
Whether that means that the Russians will slow down fighting as the United States put it both sides possibly wanting to regroup, retool and prepare 
 
 for a spring offensive or counter offensive remains yet to be seen. Of course, the Eastern Front is just one frontline, Lynda, down south. People 
 
 have been in during Russian shelling and civilian apartment buildings and homes were hit over the weekend with at least one person killed there.
 
So, you have civilians who are dying almost on a daily basis in addition to the Ukrainian troops and Russian soldiers waging this unprovoked brutal war 
 
 now, more than nine months old.
 
KINKADE: Will Ripley in Kyiv, Ukraine. Good to have you on the story for us. Thanks so much to you in Ukraine and stay safe.
 
Well, as I just mentioned, the west is trying to put new limits on the Kremlin's ability to fund its war in Ukraine. And to that end, a price cap 
 
 of $60.00 a barrel on Russian oil agreed to buy the E.U., the G7 and Australia has just taken effect. And the E.U.'s ban on Russian oil input 
 
 shipped by sea also now in effect. And be its part, the Kremlin says it won't recognize that price cap. 
 
Market watchers say the West's tighter sanctions could spark more uncertainty over energy supply. And right now, oil prices are higher. CNN's 
 
 Clare Sebastian is looking at all of this and joins us now live from London. Clare, good to have you with us. So, Russia says it's going to 
 
 refuse to sell oil at this $60.00 a barrel price cap. It's already been getting around at selling to China, to India, to other Asian countries, 
 
 right?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. The Kremlin saying that it will not be selling oil to any countries who comply with the price 
 
 gap. They say they are preparing a response.
 <br>[10:10:07]
 
Russia has been saying this all along over the months that the E.U. and other Western allies have been preparing this. So, this is not new. But it 
 
 is the wild card here because of course, we've seen Russia essentially shoot itself in the foot when it comes to gas supplies, cutting off gas 
 
 supplies to European countries, that kind of thing. So, it's not out of the question, that they could do something even though oil is their most 
 
 important, most lucrative export.
 
And now even more important because they've got a drop in those gas exports and because of what sanctions has done to the rest of the economy. So, oil 
 
 is more important to Russia than ever. And that is why you have this calculation by the E.U. and the G7 and Australia that it's $60.00 a barrel 
 
 which is above what most estimates believe the breakeven for Russia is when it comes to oil.
 
And pretty close to the market rate for euros which is the main grade of a Russian crude oil at the moment. Slightly above it actually that Russia 
 
 will still be incentivized to keep pumping oil, to keep selling their oil. And that will look accomplish the other goal of this sanction which is to 
 
 stabilize oil markets keep inflation in check and keep Russian oil flowing. But as I said, the reason why partly you see those oil prices higher today 
 
 is because of that uncertainty over Moscow's next move.
 
KINKADE: And talk to us a little bit about this price, this price cap because there was a suggestion that it should have been much lower. Some 
 
 court for $30.00 a barrel. And as you pointed out, Clare, that $60.00 price tag is similar to what Russia is already selling the oil for. But it can be 
 
 tightened in the future. Right?
 
SEBASTIAN: That is absolutely critical to understanding this. Because according to most experts that I've been speaking to today, this is really 
 
 just the beginning, this is not a finished product, the sanction. This is a mechanism that can be reviewed and tightened. It's said to be reviewed 
 
 every two months, starting from January where the E.U. and the GG7 and Australia will sort of assess the market conditions and make sure that the 
 
 cap is still effective.
 
And that really is designed to sort of gradually up the pressure on Moscow. First, they want to make sure that the sanction actually works and then 
 
 they can increase the pressure. So, I think that is another reason why it's critically important to see how Moscow responds to this because of course, 
 
 there are other loopholes here, there's a report that Russia has been amassing, for example, a fleet of sort of a shadow fleet of old tankers to 
 
 try to get around this band, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: And that is a concern. Clare Sebastian staying across it all from London. Thanks so much.
 
Well, after months of protests in Iran, Iran's attorney general says the nation's mandatory law that requires women to wear hijabs in public is now 
 
 under review. And while fusion surrounds reports that the country's morality police are being abolished. These potential moves come amid 
 
 protests that have engulfed Iran since mid-September. They were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.
 
She was detained allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly. I want to get some clarification on this developing stream. Bring in CNN's Nic 
 
 Robertson who joins us from London. Good to have you with us on this story, Nic. So, is the hijab laws seriously under review and should this be seen 
 
 as some kind of concession from the Iranian regime? And if it is, does it even go far enough?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: With the attorney general who's in part responsible for the hijab law and the review of it, 
 
 so there is a review. And the result of that review will be out in a couple of weeks. 15th of December is one date that's being floated. And it's easy 
 
 to see because this was a big point of the protesters, initially three months ago that the hijab law was too constraining.
 
And this wasn't something that was wanted by the majority of people. This could be seen as the government responding in a way to that, but we don't 
 
 know the substance of what this review will lead to. We don't know if he said this, just to create the illusion that this is being considered and 
 
 they will just settle back down in the same old position. Further confusion, obviously, when he was asked a question about the fact that 
 
 people are not seeing as many morality police on the streets, he was asked that on Saturday and saying that the morality police would be abolished.
 
That's been walked along way back by state leader in Iran. But was that connected at all to this review that he was talking about? None of that is 
 
 clear. So, in the context of Iranian politics, and the way that it's run domestically and for international consumption, there's a lot of smoke and 
 
 mirrors and we don't have a clear view yet.
 
KINKADE: It is interesting given that the attorney general doesn't have a clear authority or oversee the morality police or the guidance patrol as 
 
 they are known. So, I mean, how much do you think we can read into that?
 
ROBERTSON: I think it's -- we can read into it.
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
The possibility that there are different voices inside, you know, the leadership in Iran and inside Parliament as well that want different 
 
 things. One M.P. today was speaking about the importance of the hijab that, you know, it's a -- it's a national symbol -- essentially a national 
 
 symbol. And if you take that down and remove that, then that's the same as ending the, you know, the Islamic Republic.
 
So, a totem and a key part of Iran. Others are saying with view to the morality police, but they will have -- other M.P.s have said that they will 
 
 have no place going forward. So, there are mixed messages. There are mixed views. But we know that the dominant views in Iran come from the religious 
 
 leadership and they hold the hijab to be hugely important. That would be a monumental concession.
 
And it's something it appears they will be very unlikely to concede. The morality police and the role they play another issue again, smoke and 
 
 mirrors maybe.
 
KINKADE: Yes. We will stay on this story. Nic Robertson for us joining us from London. Thanks so much.

Well, still to come. A new week at the World Cup and a new appearance by one of Brazil's favorites. Neymar is set to return to action after injury.
 
And the U.S. midterm elections aren't quite over yet. A senate seat up for grabs here in Georgia. And everyone is watching the skies to see if the 
 
 weather will determine the winner.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm going to go to Katana on the start of what's promising to be a thrilling new week for World Football. Right now, a David 
 
 and Goliath style battle as Japan takes on the 2018 World Cup runners up Croatia. Winning could be a tall order for the samurai blue but then again, 
 
 they've already seen of Germany and Spain.
 
Well later, we expect a big comeback on the pitch with Brazil's Neymar set to return from an ankle injury. The five-time world champions will be 
 
 hoping the iconic forward can seal the deal in a match against South Korea.
 
And well off the pitch, Brazil's assistant coach is asking everyone to send a prayer for Pele. The daughters of the 82-year-old football legend say he 
 
 was taken to hospital last week with a lung infection after contracting COVID-19. He's also been undergoing cancer treatment. Amanda Davies is in 
 
 Doha covering all the line for us. Good to see you, Amanda. So, obviously Croatia and Japan playing right now.
 <br>[10:20:04]
 
But I also want to ask about Raheem Sterling, England's players heading home from Qatar to deal with a home breaking.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Yes. Raheem Sterling, Lynda. One of the most experienced members of the England squad. This his third World Cup 
 
 very much seen as a senior member of the team and it was announced just a couple of hours before kickoff of their game last night, Sunday night 
 
 against Senegal that he had returned home for family reasons. It's now emerged that he'd returned home because it had been reported when his 
 
 family members returned home from a trip out that they had been burgled with watches and jewelry taken.
 
Now the local police force have said that there is no sign of any threats of violence involved that had initially been reported. But the police at 
 
 the moment very much playing that down. But the feeling from Raheem Sterling was that he wanted to return home because of concerns over the 
 
 safety and well-being of his children, very young children he has with a new baby born just a few weeks ago.
 
The word coming out of the England camp it is that they have left the door open for him to return. They hope all being well at home or ahead of 
 
 England's next game which is set to take place against France the quarterfinal on Saturday, but he hasn't by any means been a start -- a 
 
 guaranteed starter for this England squad at the tournament so far. He didn't start it against Wales and of course missed out on the game against 
 
 Senegal and England still took the victory three-nil.
 
KINKADE: And Amanda, obviously tonight, Brazil takes on South Korea. Nemar, making a return after injury but also many people thinking about Pele right 
 
 now in hospital. What more can you tell us about his condition?
 
DAVIES: Yes. As if Brazil needed any extra motivation as they were trying to claim a record sick World Cup. So many well, wishes have been sent to 
 
 82-year-old Pele who as it was reported over the weekend has returned to hospital. I have to say that an interview conducted by his daughters over 
 
 the weekends has very much tried to play down reports that had initially emerged about -- talking about him being an end-of-life palliative care.
 
The interview from his daughters has disputed that saying he is not in intensive care. Please do not use those phrases. He is simply recovering 
 
 from a lung infection brought on by COVID-19 which of course does have an added impact on somebody who has been fighting a long-term cancer battle. 
 
 So, you could say actually, a boost, a real boost for this Brazilian squads as they prepare to take to the pitch to take on South Korea and they hope 
 
 book their place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
 
KINKADE: Yes. We wish Pele and his family all the very best. Amanda Davies, good to have you there for us in Qatar. Thanks so much.
 
The U.S. midterm elections aren't quite over yet. Senator Raphael Warnock and his challenger Herschel Walker are in the final hours of campaigning. 
 
 Ahead of their runoff election in the state of Georgia here on Tuesday. Polls show that Warnock with a small lead but everyone says turnout will be 
 
 the key to this race. Warnock, the democrat made a big push to get voters to the polls early and we have seen more than 1.8 million early votes cast.
 
Republicans tend to be more likely to vote on Election Day. The rain is forecast for Georgia Tuesday which could affect turnout. Our Dianne 
 
 Gallagher is in Atlanta, Georgia as the race enters its final hours. Good to have you with us, Dianne. So, final day of campaigning, run off 
 
 tomorrow. But already huge numbers of people have come out to vote.
 
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Lynda. And that's key here this. This four-week run off period, they have a small 
 
 amount of time to do this early voting. More than 1.8 5 million ballots already cast and something that's giving the Warnock campaign confidence 
 
 going into tomorrow. Nearly a third of those ballots come from black voters. CNN polling shows us that black likely voters prefer Warnock to 
 
 Walker at 96 to three percent. So, the democratic campaign feeling very good going into tomorrow.
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): Are you ready to win this election?
 
GALLAGHER (voice over): Democratic senator Raphael Warnock and his republican challenger Herschel Walker spending the closing days of their 
 
 runoff campaign getting out what's left of the vote.
 <br>[10:25:01]
 
If you don't have a friend, go make a friend get him out to vote.
 
GALLAGHER: With more than 1.8 5 million ballots already cast the incumbent democrat warning supporters not to leave anything on the field.
 
WARNOCK: We are on the verge of victory. But I don't want us to do the victory dance before we actually get into the endzone.
 
GALLAGHER: Warnock leaning on his senate record and sharpening his criticism of Walker's fitness for office and personal background.
 
WARNOCK: He was an amazing running back. And he will need those skills because come Tuesday we're going to send him running back to Texas where he 
 
 actually lives.
 
GALLAGHER: Walker, a Georgia football legend taking advantage of the Bulldogs playing the SEC championship game in Atlanta, meeting fans at a 
 
 tailgate on Saturday but playing the role of underdog on Sunday. Calling out his opponents fundraising advantage as fueled by out of state money.
 
HERSCHEL WALKER, U.S. REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE: Most of that money comes from California or New York, don't even come from Georgia.
 
GALLAGHER: Walker has (INAUDIBLE) Warnock to President Biden central to his closing argument.
 
WALKER: Our president was in Massachusetts, even campaigning for Senator Warnock who lives in Georgia because of the way Senator Warnock votes, he 
 
 thought he was a Massachusetts senator.
 
GALLAGHER: As the remaining days turned into just hours in an election fatigue state where they're asking for votes once again.
 
WARNOCK: The whole world is watching Georgia one more time.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GALLAGHER: And one more time is the key there. There have been a lot of elections. This is a runoff election after that general election. We 
 
 mentioned just the final hours here. Both campaigns out on the trail today. They've employed very different strategies. The Warnock campaign has kept 
 
 an aggressive schedule throughout the duration of the run off. He's around the Atlanta area today at several events.
 
But Herschel Walker's campaign has had a really light schedule. He even took five days off of public events. Again, just a four-week run off period 
 
 here. Today, though, an extremely ambitious schedule with five different stops in the North Georgia area. What is key about that is that some of 
 
 those locations are places where Herschel Walker actually underperformed the Republican Governor Brian Kemp in the general election when he was 
 
 reelected.
 
So, they are looking to make sure they can get out Republican voters on Election Day. There's an old political adage in the United States, Lynda 
 
 that says the key may come down to turnout, it all may come down to turnout. That is how both campaigns believe this is going to end up. 
 
 Whoever turns out tomorrow is likely the winner.
 
KINKADE: Yes. We'll see how that plays out. Especially with that forecast rain which we can see behind me right now. Dianne Gallagher, thanks so 
 
 much.
 
Let's get you up to speed on some other stories on our radar right now. Almost 2000 people have been evacuated from their homes after a volcanic 
 
 eruption in Indonesia. People are taking shelter everywhere from schools to village halls after Mount Semeru in East Java. You're looking at people 
 
 there fleeing with whatever they can carry, taking riding off on motorbikes to try to get to safety.
 
Well, meantime, lava from the world's largest active volcano is now just over three kilometers from a major highway in Hawaii. In the weakest since 
 
 Mauna Loa erupted, a stream of lava has been causing northeast on the Big Island. Though no communities are at risk.
 
Scientists are trying to figure out what caused the deaths of about 2500 seals in the Caspian Sea. There's no sign of violence or fishing nets. Now 
 
 samples from the animals are being analyzed. Caspian seals are endangered. Only about 300,000 are believed to be left in the wild. 
 
China is responding to public frustration over its strict COVID rules, but the government is now doing to loosen up restrictions.
 
And one activist who fled to Hong Kong -- from Hong Kong to the U.K. says he's been threatened by Chinese agents on British soil. His compelling 
 
 story when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:31:44]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade at the scene and since you're watching CONNECT THE WORLD, good to have you with us.
 
Well, China is relaxing some of its tough COVID policies following those widespread protests against them. Now over the weekend, several cities 
 
 eased testing requirements. People in Beijing and Shanghai no longer need a negative COVID test to ride public transportation. Well, those living in 
 
 Shanghai can now enter some public indoor places and outdoor venues, including parks and scenic attractions without testing.
 
But in Beijing restrictions are still in place at office buildings and malls. Well, CNN's International Correspondent Ivan Watson is in Hong Kong 
 
 with more. And Ivan, we've been discussing for weeks, these widespread protests right across the country. And now as some local authorities in 
 
 about 20 cities are starting to reduce some of those COVID rules.
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. The way one senior Chinese official put it last week was that they're tweaking the 
 
 COVID restrictions. But it is notable because -- I think because of the chronology that you had a little bit more than a week ago, these protests 
 
 erupt first in Shanghai and then spreading to Beijing and more than 20 Other cities over the course of several days after that.
 
And within days, the Chinese government started signaling that it was not going to revamp its zero COVID strategy which has left people -- millions 
 
 of people trapped in their apartments for months at a time, you know, rationing food unable to get quick access to emergency health care in some 
 
 cases. But instead, is incrementally lifting some of the restrictions. As you pointed out, more than 20 cities now don't require you to get a 
 
 negative PCR test for COVID to ride public transport.
 
That is a fairly big deal. Take a listen to what several Beijing residents had to say about the changes they're seeing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Public transport is no longer restricted. That is more convenient. This might be the first step towards 
 
 the reopening of this pandemic.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): For me, my company requires a 24- hour COVID test, because it is a public place. There are still high requirements on us. So, we have to continue to do COVID tests every day. I 
 
 have yet to feel a very noticeable change.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WATSON: And I think that's important, is that it is still part of the fabric of everyday life in Shanghai, for example, you have to get a COVID 
 
 test every 48 hours to be able to go into a mall or into an office building. But we're seeing kind of piecemeal relaxation of some of these 
 
 measures. And even that, though, is welcomed to people who've been living under this immense pressure for so long. Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Yes. Finally, a small victory for these protesters as we approach the fourth year of this pandemic. Ivan Watson for us in Hong Kong. Thanks 
 
 so much.
 
Well, back in 2019, activists in Hong Kong stage massive protests against efforts to curtail freedoms that were promised to residents prior to the 
 
 city's transfer to Chinese rule. Hundreds of 1000s fled even before the official transfer.
 <br>[10:35:01]
 
Well, now some exiles in the U.K. say the communist government is secretly trying to intimidate them into returning home. CNN's Nina dos Santos has 
 
 this exclusive report from London.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For three years Simon Cheng has called London home. After fleeing a brutal clamp down on democracy in his native 
 
 Hong Kong, he sought sanctuary in the U.K. But even here, he says Beijing's tentacles are never far
 
 away.
 
SIMON CHENG, HONG KONG DISSIDENT: Sometimes I received some frightening letters.
 
DOS SANTOS: He shows us an email he received last year with a warning.
 
CHENG: Said the Chinese agent would come for you and take you back. It's just a matter of time.
 
DOS SANTOS: And then pictures of people he says have been following him. Like this man in Westminster, and this car he spotted in multiple 
 
 locations. Last year, Cheng says someone offered around $12,000 on WeChat to get hold of his address.
 
DOS SANTOS (on camera): Do you feel safe in the U.K. at the moment?
 
CHENG: I don't think safe in the U.K. It's actually happening, the persecution happening on the British soil. And if you don't protect it, it 
 
 only shows to the British public that even the government in here don't try to protect their judicial sovereignty and dignity.
 
DOS SANTOS: Last year, the UK opened up a pathway for more and more Hong Kongers to gain citizenship on U.K. soil. And as more people continue to 
 
 arrive here seeking shelter, the pressure is on for authorities to make sure that Hong Kong's rights are protected. That issue came to a head last 
 
 month after a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was assaulted on the grounds of the Chinese Consulate in Manchester. After that, this warning to 
 
 Great Britain.
 
YANG XIAOGUANG, CHINESE EMBASSY SPOKESPERSON: Protecting shelter to the Hong Kong independent elements were only in the end bring disaster to 
 
 Britain.
 
DOS SANTOS: Now, this NGO report says the Chinese police have been operating covertly from three addresses across the U.K. and elsewhere 
 
 around the world, in part to pressure people to return home.
 
China says these centers help nationals with admin, like renewing driver's licenses, and are staffed by volunteers. They say to suggest otherwise 
 
 would be "a smear." Either way, lawmakers are demanding urgent action.
 
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE M.P.: People have fled to the UK because we believe in human rights the rule of law and democracy so that 
 
 they can have free speech. Hong Kongers, many students came over the BNO scheme. What do they find when they come here? Chinese unofficial police 
 
 stations. That is shocking and under anybody's rulebook should have been sorted out by now.
 
DOS SANTOS: CNN wasn't able to independently verify Simon Cheng's allegations. But we have heard multiple similar stories from other Hong 
 
 Kongers in the U.K.
 
DOS SANTOS (on camera): What do you think the objective of Chinese authorities is?
 
CHENG: They try to silence us with fear. If we succumb to fear, the Chinese Communist Party will win.

KINKADE: Well, NASA is hoping to return astronauts to the moon but for that to happen Orion needs to pull off a final lunar flyby just to show well. 
 
 We'll explain how.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:48]
 
KINKADE: Well, Ian about an hour, NASA's Orion will make its second and final close approach to the moon and make its last major maneuver on its 
 
 way back to Earth. Now the Orion spacecraft is part of the Artemis 1 mission that kicked off its historic journey last month. Engineers will 
 
 want to see how the Orion performs here. And if all goes well, that will mean it's ready to bring astronauts onboard for admission to the lunar 
 
 orbits scheduled for 2024.
 
I want to bring in our space and defense correspondent Kristen Fisher who joins us now live. Good to have you with us. So next hour about, an hour 
 
 from now is when the Orion is meant to fly pretty close to the moon. What does it all mean?
 
KRISTEN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, Lynda, it's going to get just about 80 miles above the surface of the moon. This is the 
 
 second close approach to the moon for the Orion spacecraft. The first one happened on the way to the moon. Now Orion is heading back to Earth. And 
 
 so, we're hoping to perhaps get some live images of when this happens. But it's kind of hit or miss.
 
You don't know until the actual moment if it's going to be live or if NASA is going to have to send these images back after the fact because hey, this 
 
 is very far away. In order to beam these images back to Earth, you have to rely upon a network called the Deep Space Network, which is a series of 
 
 telescopes and satellites out in space to relay those signals back to Earth. So, we'll see. But you can see, it has been beaming back some images 
 
 of this close approach.
 
Some spectacular images that we've seen of the Moon and the Earth throughout this, what in total will be a 26-day mission. And so, now Lynda 
 
 at the big critical test, there's two left. One is this burn, which is essentially the engines or the thrusters firing to move the spacecraft back 
 
 to Earth a bit more. And then the other big test is going to be on Sunday, the test of the Orion heat shield which is what protects the astronauts 
 
 which are not on board now, only mannequins.
 
But in a future mission it would -- it would protect those astronauts from the very high temperatures that the spacecraft would endure on reentry. And 
 
 then of course, splashdown in the Pacific Ocean sometime on Sunday. So, those are the two big tests ahead but Lynda, we are hoping to get some 
 
 pretty cool images of this very close approach to the moon a little bit later today.
 
KINKADE: Excellent. So, splashdown Sunday and then this obviously is just the first of three Artemis missions that will ultimately take humans to the 
 
 moon, right?
 
FISHER: Yes. Three and NASA hopes many more after that. I mean, if Artemis 1 is a success and by all accounts it has been so far, this paves the way 
 
 for Artemis 2 which will be the first crewed mission these astronauts that are selected for this flight will just go around the moon and then Artemis 
 
 3 when the first woman and the first person of color are expected to finally put American boots back on the moon hopefully by 2025, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Excellent. Kristen Fisher, always good to have you with us. Thanks so much.

WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In Ukraine, winter is coming in the capital Kyiv. The foreign minister warns 
 
 snow won't be the only thing falling from the skies.
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice over): Russia launches a fresh wave of missiles at Ukraine in the last few hours. We'll go live to 
 
 the capital. The details about casualties and damage.
 
And could change becoming to Iran as the country reportedly reviews its job law? We'll have a live report on what it could mean for Iranian women.
 
And the state of Georgia's crucial U.S. senate runoff, a runoff just a day away. CNN following the candidates and their final push to persuade voters.
 
Hello, I'm Linda Kincaid at the CNN Center. Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. Good to have you with us. Well, stay in shelters, that warning coming from 
 
 the head of the Kyiv region's military administration as Ukraine faces a new barrage of Russian missiles.
 
Air-raid sirens blared across the capital. Ukraine saying its air defense systems intercepted most of those incoming missiles. Residents and soldiers 
 
 in Kyiv heated warnings to take cover. Missile strikes are reported in multiple regions of Ukraine. At least two deaths reported in the 
 
 Zaporizhzhia region. The cities of Kryvyi Rih and Odessa both report no electricity and no running water.
 
Ukraine's president is offering words of encouragement as Ukrainians digging for what will be a long, cold winter.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): I know how difficult it is in Bakhmut, in Donbas. Guys, hold on. I am with you, as 
 
 people are with you. In order to carry out this task, I'm going to carry it out successfully. We must always support each other precisely for this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Well, it's all happening as the European Union's ban on Russian oil imports shipped by sea along with a G7 price cap. It takes effect. 
 
 We'll have more on that shortly. First, I want to bring in our Will Ripley who's in Kyiv with the latest on this new round of attacks. Good to have 
 
 you with us. Will, you like many people in the capital have been in a bomb shelter over the last few hours as these air sirens have continued. I -- 
 
 just give us a sense of what you are learning about these missile strikes.
 
RIPLEY: Hi, Lynda. We received the all clear less than 30 minutes ago and so we came back up to this outdoor location. I have to say it's a relief to 
 
 breathe some fresh air after spending almost four hours underground in that bunker like so many other thousands of people here in Kyiv, who took 
 
 shelter when the air raid alerts went off. But it's only temporary.
 
You never know when the sirens are going to return again. And when you're going to be told you have to go back underground because we've been told 
 
 that there's a possibility of more waves of Russian missile attacks in the coming hours. Now the Ukrainians have been anticipating this they've been 
 
 expecting a large-scale attack aimed at shutting down the nationwide power grid here with the intent of demoralizing people and crippling this battle-
 
 scarred country.
 
But I can tell you, as we've been on the ground talking to folks living with this reality, they are soldiering through it as best they can.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIPLEY (voice over): In Ukraine, winter is coming in the capital Kyiv. The foreign minister warns snow won't be the only thing falling from the skies.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are anticipating another massive missile attack by Russia. And the goal of this attack is to bring total destruction to our 
 
 energy system.
 
RIPLEY: Crews are racing to restore power. These tents set up by the government. A badly needed break from the bitter cold. At this fastfood 
 
 place, braving below zero temperatures at the outdoor grill keeps the doors open when the lights are off.
 
Some customers said they only want to come when there's no power because the food tastes so much better. We're just Ukrainians, she says. That's our 
 
 secret ingredient. Another secret for surviving dark times. Candles, a good cry and prayer.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): When you come here, what do you pray for?
 
RIPLEY (voice over): We pray for peace, for the war to be over, she says.
 <br>[10:05:02]
 
Describing the hardship of life of life without electricity. But then I come here and remember how much time we spent hiding in basements. Hiding 
 
 from Russian soldiers who occupied and terrorized their town, Bucha, the site of what Ukraine calls unspeakable war crimes.
 
RIPLEY (on camera):  If you didn't know what happened here, this could be any church in any quiet keep suburb until you look closer. And notice the 
 
 bullet holes. And this cross marking a mass grave for more than 100 men, women and two children.
 
RIPLEY (voice over):  Like five of Vira Goychuck's neighbors.
 
RIPLEY (on camera):  What did it sound ---
 
VIRA GOYCHUCK, BUCHA DISTRICT RESIDENT: It was a cluster bomb.
 
RIPLEY: A cluster bomb.
 
GOYCHUCK: A cluster bomb.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): Bullet holes in her children's bedroom windows. After living through the hell of the Russian occupation, she can handle living 
 
 without power.
 
GOYCHUCK: And what is the real problem is where there's no electricity. We don't have any connection. So, I have kids and if something wrong, I cannot 
 
 even call to the hospital and call emergency.
 
RIPLEY: She tells me when the power goes out she loses his cell phone service and internet. But then --
 
GOYCHUCK: Oh my god, it's miracle.
 
RIPLEY: Is that the lights coming on now?
 
GOYCHUCK: Yes. Yes.
 
RIPLEY: First place she goes, the kitchen.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): Coffee. That's your number one priority.
 
GOYCHUCK: Yes. It's my number one.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): She's grateful for the little things in life.
 
GOYCHUCK: It's a moment of happiness.
 
RIPLEY: Grateful just to be alive.
 
GOYCHUCK: That's it.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIPLEY: A feeling shared by so many people across Ukraine and we know at least two cities at this hour, Lynda with temperatures plummeting. Now once 
 
 again, no power, no running water. It is a dire situation in some ways. But for those who live through such horrific sites, like watching their 
 
 neighbor's bodies lying in the street for a month or wondering if Russian soldiers were going to come barging through their door, they said they 
 
 would gladly endure this as long as they remain protected by their military here. The Ukrainian military and not occupied by the Russians.
 
KINKADE: Yes. It's good to see that you are out of that bomb shelter now, Will, but obviously it's -- we are going to continue to hear this air 
 
 sirens. Just give us an update, if you can on what's happening on the frontlines, particularly the battle for Bakhmut.
 
RIPLEY: Yes, it's great that you mentioned Bakhmut, Lynda, because this is probably at a time that the United States and the head of U.S. Intelligence 
 
 Avril Haines is saying that the fighting is slowing down. It's really been heating up in the Donetsk region, with Bakhmut being Russia's target number 
 
 one. According to the spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern group of armed forces. Basically, Russian units have been trying to push west, trying to 
 
 demonstrate some battlefield success after a series of humiliating defeats.
 
And they're coming up against a very, very sturdy Ukrainian force. That is -- that is with great difficulty holding their own at the moment. They say 
 
 this situation does appear to be under control at this hour. We know that support inside Russia according to public opinion polls for this war 
 
 continues to erode with at least two new polls talking about more than half of the Russian population calling for peace talks.
 
Whether that means that the Russians will slow down fighting as the United States put it both sides possibly wanting to regroup, retool and prepare 
 
 for a spring offensive or counter offensive remains yet to be seen. Of course, the Eastern Front is just one frontline, Lynda, down south. People 
 
 have been in during Russian shelling and civilian apartment buildings and homes were hit over the weekend with at least one person killed there.
 
So, you have civilians who are dying almost on a daily basis in addition to the Ukrainian troops and Russian soldiers waging this unprovoked brutal war 
 
 now, more than nine months old.
 
KINKADE: Will Ripley in Kyiv, Ukraine. Good to have you on the story for us. Thanks so much to you in Ukraine and stay safe.
 
Well, as I just mentioned, the west is trying to put new limits on the Kremlin's ability to fund its war in Ukraine. And to that end, a price cap 
 
 of $60.00 a barrel on Russian oil agreed to buy the E.U., the G7 and Australia has just taken effect. And the E.U.'s ban on Russian oil input 
 
 shipped by sea also now in effect. And be its part, the Kremlin says it won't recognize that price cap. 
 
Market watchers say the West's tighter sanctions could spark more uncertainty over energy supply. And right now, oil prices are higher. CNN's 
 
 Clare Sebastian is looking at all of this and joins us now live from London. Clare, good to have you with us. So, Russia says it's going to 
 
 refuse to sell oil at this $60.00 a barrel price cap. It's already been getting around at selling to China, to India, to other Asian countries, 
 
 right?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. The Kremlin saying that it will not be selling oil to any countries who comply with the price 
 
 gap. They say they are preparing a response.
 <br>[10:10:07]
 
Russia has been saying this all along over the months that the E.U. and other Western allies have been preparing this. So, this is not new. But it 
 
 is the wild card here because of course, we've seen Russia essentially shoot itself in the foot when it comes to gas supplies, cutting off gas 
 
 supplies to European countries, that kind of thing. So, it's not out of the question, that they could do something even though oil is their most 
 
 important, most lucrative export.
 
And now even more important because they've got a drop in those gas exports and because of what sanctions has done to the rest of the economy. So, oil 
 
 is more important to Russia than ever. And that is why you have this calculation by the E.U. and the G7 and Australia that it's $60.00 a barrel 
 
 which is above what most estimates believe the breakeven for Russia is when it comes to oil.
 
And pretty close to the market rate for euros which is the main grade of a Russian crude oil at the moment. Slightly above it actually that Russia 
 
 will still be incentivized to keep pumping oil, to keep selling their oil. And that will look accomplish the other goal of this sanction which is to 
 
 stabilize oil markets keep inflation in check and keep Russian oil flowing. But as I said, the reason why partly you see those oil prices higher today 
 
 is because of that uncertainty over Moscow's next move.
 
KINKADE: And talk to us a little bit about this price, this price cap because there was a suggestion that it should have been much lower. Some 
 
 court for $30.00 a barrel. And as you pointed out, Clare, that $60.00 price tag is similar to what Russia is already selling the oil for. But it can be 
 
 tightened in the future. Right?
 
SEBASTIAN: That is absolutely critical to understanding this. Because according to most experts that I've been speaking to today, this is really 
 
 just the beginning, this is not a finished product, the sanction. This is a mechanism that can be reviewed and tightened. It's said to be reviewed 
 
 every two months, starting from January where the E.U. and the GG7 and Australia will sort of assess the market conditions and make sure that the 
 
 cap is still effective.
 
And that really is designed to sort of gradually up the pressure on Moscow. First, they want to make sure that the sanction actually works and then 
 
 they can increase the pressure. So, I think that is another reason why it's critically important to see how Moscow responds to this because of course, 
 
 there are other loopholes here, there's a report that Russia has been amassing, for example, a fleet of sort of a shadow fleet of old tankers to 
 
 try to get around this band, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: And that is a concern. Clare Sebastian staying across it all from London. Thanks so much.
 
Well, after months of protests in Iran, Iran's attorney general says the nation's mandatory law that requires women to wear hijabs in public is now 
 
 under review. And while fusion surrounds reports that the country's morality police are being abolished. These potential moves come amid 
 
 protests that have engulfed Iran since mid-September. They were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.
 
She was detained allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly. I want to get some clarification on this developing stream. Bring in CNN's Nic 
 
 Robertson who joins us from London. Good to have you with us on this story, Nic. So, is the hijab laws seriously under review and should this be seen 
 
 as some kind of concession from the Iranian regime? And if it is, does it even go far enough?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: With the attorney general who's in part responsible for the hijab law and the review of it, 
 
 so there is a review. And the result of that review will be out in a couple of weeks. 15th of December is one date that's being floated. And it's easy 
 
 to see because this was a big point of the protesters, initially three months ago that the hijab law was too constraining.
 
And this wasn't something that was wanted by the majority of people. This could be seen as the government responding in a way to that, but we don't 
 
 know the substance of what this review will lead to. We don't know if he said this, just to create the illusion that this is being considered and 
 
 they will just settle back down in the same old position. Further confusion, obviously, when he was asked a question about the fact that 
 
 people are not seeing as many morality police on the streets, he was asked that on Saturday and saying that the morality police would be abolished.
 
That's been walked along way back by state leader in Iran. But was that connected at all to this review that he was talking about? None of that is 
 
 clear. So, in the context of Iranian politics, and the way that it's run domestically and for international consumption, there's a lot of smoke and 
 
 mirrors and we don't have a clear view yet.
 
KINKADE: It is interesting given that the attorney general doesn't have a clear authority or oversee the morality police or the guidance patrol as 
 
 they are known. So, I mean, how much do you think we can read into that?
 
ROBERTSON: I think it's -- we can read into it.
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
The possibility that there are different voices inside, you know, the leadership in Iran and inside Parliament as well that want different 
 
 things. One M.P. today was speaking about the importance of the hijab that, you know, it's a -- it's a national symbol -- essentially a national 
 
 symbol. And if you take that down and remove that, then that's the same as ending the, you know, the Islamic Republic.
 
So, a totem and a key part of Iran. Others are saying with view to the morality police, but they will have -- other M.P.s have said that they will 
 
 have no place going forward. So, there are mixed messages. There are mixed views. But we know that the dominant views in Iran come from the religious 
 
 leadership and they hold the hijab to be hugely important. That would be a monumental concession.
 
And it's something it appears they will be very unlikely to concede. The morality police and the role they play another issue again, smoke and 
 
 mirrors maybe.
 
KINKADE: Yes. We will stay on this story. Nic Robertson for us joining us from London. Thanks so much.

Well, still to come. A new week at the World Cup and a new appearance by one of Brazil's favorites. Neymar is set to return to action after injury.
 
And the U.S. midterm elections aren't quite over yet. A senate seat up for grabs here in Georgia. And everyone is watching the skies to see if the 
 
 weather will determine the winner.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm going to go to Katana on the start of what's promising to be a thrilling new week for World Football. Right now, a David 
 
 and Goliath style battle as Japan takes on the 2018 World Cup runners up Croatia. Winning could be a tall order for the samurai blue but then again, 
 
 they've already seen of Germany and Spain.
 
Well later, we expect a big comeback on the pitch with Brazil's Neymar set to return from an ankle injury. The five-time world champions will be 
 
 hoping the iconic forward can seal the deal in a match against South Korea.
 
And well off the pitch, Brazil's assistant coach is asking everyone to send a prayer for Pele. The daughters of the 82-year-old football legend say he 
 
 was taken to hospital last week with a lung infection after contracting COVID-19. He's also been undergoing cancer treatment. Amanda Davies is in 
 
 Doha covering all the line for us. Good to see you, Amanda. So, obviously Croatia and Japan playing right now.
 <br>[10:20:04]
 
But I also want to ask about Raheem Sterling, England's players heading home from Qatar to deal with a home breaking.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Yes. Raheem Sterling, Lynda. One of the most experienced members of the England squad. This his third World Cup 
 
 very much seen as a senior member of the team and it was announced just a couple of hours before kickoff of their game last night, Sunday night 
 
 against Senegal that he had returned home for family reasons. It's now emerged that he'd returned home because it had been reported when his 
 
 family members returned home from a trip out that they had been burgled with watches and jewelry taken.
 
Now the local police force have said that there is no sign of any threats of violence involved that had initially been reported. But the police at 
 
 the moment very much playing that down. But the feeling from Raheem Sterling was that he wanted to return home because of concerns over the 
 
 safety and well-being of his children, very young children he has with a new baby born just a few weeks ago.
 
The word coming out of the England camp it is that they have left the door open for him to return. They hope all being well at home or ahead of 
 
 England's next game which is set to take place against France the quarterfinal on Saturday, but he hasn't by any means been a start -- a 
 
 guaranteed starter for this England squad at the tournament so far. He didn't start it against Wales and of course missed out on the game against 
 
 Senegal and England still took the victory three-nil.
 
KINKADE: And Amanda, obviously tonight, Brazil takes on South Korea. Nemar, making a return after injury but also many people thinking about Pele right 
 
 now in hospital. What more can you tell us about his condition?
 
DAVIES: Yes. As if Brazil needed any extra motivation as they were trying to claim a record sick World Cup. So many well, wishes have been sent to 
 
 82-year-old Pele who as it was reported over the weekend has returned to hospital. I have to say that an interview conducted by his daughters over 
 
 the weekends has very much tried to play down reports that had initially emerged about -- talking about him being an end-of-life palliative care.
 
The interview from his daughters has disputed that saying he is not in intensive care. Please do not use those phrases. He is simply recovering 
 
 from a lung infection brought on by COVID-19 which of course does have an added impact on somebody who has been fighting a long-term cancer battle. 
 
 So, you could say actually, a boost, a real boost for this Brazilian squads as they prepare to take to the pitch to take on South Korea and they hope 
 
 book their place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
 
KINKADE: Yes. We wish Pele and his family all the very best. Amanda Davies, good to have you there for us in Qatar. Thanks so much.
 
The U.S. midterm elections aren't quite over yet. Senator Raphael Warnock and his challenger Herschel Walker are in the final hours of campaigning. 
 
 Ahead of their runoff election in the state of Georgia here on Tuesday. Polls show that Warnock with a small lead but everyone says turnout will be 
 
 the key to this race. Warnock, the democrat made a big push to get voters to the polls early and we have seen more than 1.8 million early votes cast.
 
Republicans tend to be more likely to vote on Election Day. The rain is forecast for Georgia Tuesday which could affect turnout. Our Dianne 
 
 Gallagher is in Atlanta, Georgia as the race enters its final hours. Good to have you with us, Dianne. So, final day of campaigning, run off 
 
 tomorrow. But already huge numbers of people have come out to vote.
 
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Lynda. And that's key here this. This four-week run off period, they have a small 
 
 amount of time to do this early voting. More than 1.8 5 million ballots already cast and something that's giving the Warnock campaign confidence 
 
 going into tomorrow. Nearly a third of those ballots come from black voters. CNN polling shows us that black likely voters prefer Warnock to 
 
 Walker at 96 to three percent. So, the democratic campaign feeling very good going into tomorrow.
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): Are you ready to win this election?
 
GALLAGHER (voice over): Democratic senator Raphael Warnock and his republican challenger Herschel Walker spending the closing days of their 
 
 runoff campaign getting out what's left of the vote.
 <br>[10:25:01]
 
If you don't have a friend, go make a friend get him out to vote.
 
GALLAGHER: With more than 1.8 5 million ballots already cast the incumbent democrat warning supporters not to leave anything on the field.
 
WARNOCK: We are on the verge of victory. But I don't want us to do the victory dance before we actually get into the endzone.
 
GALLAGHER: Warnock leaning on his senate record and sharpening his criticism of Walker's fitness for office and personal background.
 
WARNOCK: He was an amazing running back. And he will need those skills because come Tuesday we're going to send him running back to Texas where he 
 
 actually lives.
 
GALLAGHER: Walker, a Georgia football legend taking advantage of the Bulldogs playing the SEC championship game in Atlanta, meeting fans at a 
 
 tailgate on Saturday but playing the role of underdog on Sunday. Calling out his opponents fundraising advantage as fueled by out of state money.
 
HERSCHEL WALKER, U.S. REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE: Most of that money comes from California or New York, don't even come from Georgia.
 
GALLAGHER: Walker has (INAUDIBLE) Warnock to President Biden central to his closing argument.
 
WALKER: Our president was in Massachusetts, even campaigning for Senator Warnock who lives in Georgia because of the way Senator Warnock votes, he 
 
 thought he was a Massachusetts senator.
 
GALLAGHER: As the remaining days turned into just hours in an election fatigue state where they're asking for votes once again.
 
WARNOCK: The whole world is watching Georgia one more time.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GALLAGHER: And one more time is the key there. There have been a lot of elections. This is a runoff election after that general election. We 
 
 mentioned just the final hours here. Both campaigns out on the trail today. They've employed very different strategies. The Warnock campaign has kept 
 
 an aggressive schedule throughout the duration of the run off. He's around the Atlanta area today at several events.
 
But Herschel Walker's campaign has had a really light schedule. He even took five days off of public events. Again, just a four-week run off period 
 
 here. Today, though, an extremely ambitious schedule with five different stops in the North Georgia area. What is key about that is that some of 
 
 those locations are places where Herschel Walker actually underperformed the Republican Governor Brian Kemp in the general election when he was 
 
 reelected.
 
So, they are looking to make sure they can get out Republican voters on Election Day. There's an old political adage in the United States, Lynda 
 
 that says the key may come down to turnout, it all may come down to turnout. That is how both campaigns believe this is going to end up. 
 
 Whoever turns out tomorrow is likely the winner.
 
KINKADE: Yes. We'll see how that plays out. Especially with that forecast rain which we can see behind me right now. Dianne Gallagher, thanks so 
 
 much.
 
Let's get you up to speed on some other stories on our radar right now. Almost 2000 people have been evacuated from their homes after a volcanic 
 
 eruption in Indonesia. People are taking shelter everywhere from schools to village halls after Mount Semeru in East Java. You're looking at people 
 
 there fleeing with whatever they can carry, taking riding off on motorbikes to try to get to safety.
 
Well, meantime, lava from the world's largest active volcano is now just over three kilometers from a major highway in Hawaii. In the weakest since 
 
 Mauna Loa erupted, a stream of lava has been causing northeast on the Big Island. Though no communities are at risk.
 
Scientists are trying to figure out what caused the deaths of about 2500 seals in the Caspian Sea. There's no sign of violence or fishing nets. Now 
 
 samples from the animals are being analyzed. Caspian seals are endangered. Only about 300,000 are believed to be left in the wild. 
 
China is responding to public frustration over its strict COVID rules, but the government is now doing to loosen up restrictions.
 
And one activist who fled to Hong Kong -- from Hong Kong to the U.K. says he's been threatened by Chinese agents on British soil. His compelling 
 
 story when we come back.

KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade at the scene and since you're watching CONNECT THE WORLD, good to have you with us.
 
Well, China is relaxing some of its tough COVID policies following those widespread protests against them. Now over the weekend, several cities 
 
 eased testing requirements. People in Beijing and Shanghai no longer need a negative COVID test to ride public transportation. Well, those living in 
 
 Shanghai can now enter some public indoor places and outdoor venues, including parks and scenic attractions without testing.
 
But in Beijing restrictions are still in place at office buildings and malls. Well, CNN's International Correspondent Ivan Watson is in Hong Kong 
 
 with more. And Ivan, we've been discussing for weeks, these widespread protests right across the country. And now as some local authorities in 
 
 about 20 cities are starting to reduce some of those COVID rules.
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. The way one senior Chinese official put it last week was that they're tweaking the 
 
 COVID restrictions. But it is notable because -- I think because of the chronology that you had a little bit more than a week ago, these protests 
 
 erupt first in Shanghai and then spreading to Beijing and more than 20 Other cities over the course of several days after that.
 
And within days, the Chinese government started signaling that it was not going to revamp its zero COVID strategy which has left people -- millions 
 
 of people trapped in their apartments for months at a time, you know, rationing food unable to get quick access to emergency health care in some 
 
 cases. But instead, is incrementally lifting some of the restrictions. As you pointed out, more than 20 cities now don't require you to get a 
 
 negative PCR test for COVID to ride public transport.
 
That is a fairly big deal. Take a listen to what several Beijing residents had to say about the changes they're seeing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Public transport is no longer restricted. That is more convenient. This might be the first step towards 
 
 the reopening of this pandemic.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): For me, my company requires a 24- hour COVID test, because it is a public place. There are still high requirements on us. So, we have to continue to do COVID tests every day. I 
 
 have yet to feel a very noticeable change.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WATSON: And I think that's important, is that it is still part of the fabric of everyday life in Shanghai, for example, you have to get a COVID 
 
 test every 48 hours to be able to go into a mall or into an office building. But we're seeing kind of piecemeal relaxation of some of these 
 
 measures. And even that, though, is welcomed to people who've been living under this immense pressure for so long. Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Yes. Finally, a small victory for these protesters as we approach the fourth year of this pandemic. Ivan Watson for us in Hong Kong. Thanks 
 
 so much.
 
Well, back in 2019, activists in Hong Kong stage massive protests against efforts to curtail freedoms that were promised to residents prior to the 
 
 city's transfer to Chinese rule. Hundreds of 1000s fled even before the official transfer.
 <br>[10:35:01]
 
Well, now some exiles in the U.K. say the communist government is secretly trying to intimidate them into returning home. CNN's Nina dos Santos has 
 
 this exclusive report from London.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For three years Simon Cheng has called London home. After fleeing a brutal clamp down on democracy in his native 
 
 Hong Kong, he sought sanctuary in the U.K. But even here, he says Beijing's tentacles are never far
 
 away.
 
SIMON CHENG, HONG KONG DISSIDENT: Sometimes I received some frightening letters.
 
DOS SANTOS: He shows us an email he received last year with a warning.
 
CHENG: Said the Chinese agent would come for you and take you back. It's just a matter of time.
 
DOS SANTOS: And then pictures of people he says have been following him. Like this man in Westminster, and this car he spotted in multiple 
 
 locations. Last year, Cheng says someone offered around $12,000 on WeChat to get hold of his address.
 
DOS SANTOS (on camera): Do you feel safe in the U.K. at the moment?
 
CHENG: I don't think safe in the U.K. It's actually happening, the persecution happening on the British soil. And if you don't protect it, it 
 
 only shows to the British public that even the government in here don't try to protect their judicial sovereignty and dignity.
 
DOS SANTOS: Last year, the UK opened up a pathway for more and more Hong Kongers to gain citizenship on U.K. soil. And as more people continue to 
 
 arrive here seeking shelter, the pressure is on for authorities to make sure that Hong Kong's rights are protected. That issue came to a head last 
 
 month after a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was assaulted on the grounds of the Chinese Consulate in Manchester. After that, this warning to 
 
 Great Britain.
 
YANG XIAOGUANG, CHINESE EMBASSY SPOKESPERSON: Protecting shelter to the Hong Kong independent elements were only in the end bring disaster to 
 
 Britain.
 
DOS SANTOS: Now, this NGO report says the Chinese police have been operating covertly from three addresses across the U.K. and elsewhere 
 
 around the world, in part to pressure people to return home.
 
China says these centers help nationals with admin, like renewing driver's licenses, and are staffed by volunteers. They say to suggest otherwise 
 
 would be "a smear." Either way, lawmakers are demanding urgent action.
 
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE M.P.: People have fled to the UK because we believe in human rights the rule of law and democracy so that 
 
 they can have free speech. Hong Kongers, many students came over the BNO scheme. What do they find when they come here? Chinese unofficial police 
 
 stations. That is shocking and under anybody's rulebook should have been sorted out by now.
 
DOS SANTOS: CNN wasn't able to independently verify Simon Cheng's allegations. But we have heard multiple similar stories from other Hong 
 
 Kongers in the U.K.
 
DOS SANTOS (on camera): What do you think the objective of Chinese authorities is?
 
CHENG: They try to silence us with fear. If we succumb to fear, the Chinese Communist Party will win.

KINKADE: Well, NASA is hoping to return astronauts to the moon but for that to happen Orion needs to pull off a final lunar flyby just to show well. 
 
 We'll explain how.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:48]
 
KINKADE: Well, Ian about an hour, NASA's Orion will make its second and final close approach to the moon and make its last major maneuver on its 
 
 way back to Earth. Now the Orion spacecraft is part of the Artemis 1 mission that kicked off its historic journey last month. Engineers will 
 
 want to see how the Orion performs here. And if all goes well, that will mean it's ready to bring astronauts onboard for admission to the lunar 
 
 orbits scheduled for 2024.
 
I want to bring in our space and defense correspondent Kristen Fisher who joins us now live. Good to have you with us. So next hour about, an hour 
 
 from now is when the Orion is meant to fly pretty close to the moon. What does it all mean?
 
KRISTEN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, Lynda, it's going to get just about 80 miles above the surface of the moon. This is the 
 
 second close approach to the moon for the Orion spacecraft. The first one happened on the way to the moon. Now Orion is heading back to Earth. And 
 
 so, we're hoping to perhaps get some live images of when this happens. But it's kind of hit or miss.
 
You don't know until the actual moment if it's going to be live or if NASA is going to have to send these images back after the fact because hey, this 
 
 is very far away. In order to beam these images back to Earth, you have to rely upon a network called the Deep Space Network, which is a series of 
 
 telescopes and satellites out in space to relay those signals back to Earth. So, we'll see. But you can see, it has been beaming back some images 
 
 of this close approach.
 
Some spectacular images that we've seen of the Moon and the Earth throughout this, what in total will be a 26-day mission. And so, now Lynda 
 
 at the big critical test, there's two left. One is this burn, which is essentially the engines or the thrusters firing to move the spacecraft back 
 
 to Earth a bit more. And then the other big test is going to be on Sunday, the test of the Orion heat shield which is what protects the astronauts 
 
 which are not on board now, only mannequins.
 
But in a future mission it would -- it would protect those astronauts from the very high temperatures that the spacecraft would endure on reentry. And 
 
 then of course, splashdown in the Pacific Ocean sometime on Sunday. So, those are the two big tests ahead but Lynda, we are hoping to get some 
 
 pretty cool images of this very close approach to the moon a little bit later today.
 
KINKADE: Excellent. So, splashdown Sunday and then this obviously is just the first of three Artemis missions that will ultimately take humans to the 
 
 moon, right?
 
FISHER: Yes. Three and NASA hopes many more after that. I mean, if Artemis 1 is a success and by all accounts it has been so far, this paves the way 
 
 for Artemis 2 which will be the first crewed mission these astronauts that are selected for this flight will just go around the moon and then Artemis 
 
 3 when the first woman and the first person of color are expected to finally put American boots back on the moon hopefully by 2025, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Excellent. Kristen Fisher, always good to have you with us. Thanks so much.
