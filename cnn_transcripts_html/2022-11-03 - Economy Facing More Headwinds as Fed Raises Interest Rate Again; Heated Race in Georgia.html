DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Wow.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  What a game.
 
LEMON:  Back when I was a wee boy in 1956 --
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  I did not look at you when I said 1956.
 
HARLOW:  Side eyed.
 
LEMON:  I was not here in 1956.
 
COLLINS:  That game was awesome, though, not if you're a Phillies fan, sorry to my Phillies fans out there, but it was a really good game.
 
LEMON:  It was really good. And yesterday, when I said the Astros were feeling positive, you guys laughed at me. But I have to say that was the first time since 1956 there was a no hitter at the World Series, and it was true in the (INAUDIBLE).
 
COLLINS:  And Christian, one of the pitchers, his parents told him before that they felt like it was going to be a no hitter.
 
HARLOW:  Really?
 
COLLINS:  I think it's so cool.
 
HARLOW:  I'm going to say nothing because you know that I didn't watch it and I know nothing. But congrats -- who won, Astros.
 
LEMON:  The Astros.
 
COLLINS:  They haven't won a World Series.
 
LEMON:  They haven't won a World Series, but still a big to go here.
 
But good morning, everybody. I'm Don Lemon. Poppy Harlow here is with me Kaitlan Collins.
 
COLLINS:  We'll keep you updated, Poppy.
 
LEMON:  I appreciate that and we have a lot to get to here. More volatility expected this morning on Wall Street as the Fed again makes things more expensive for Americans trying to cool the economy.
 
HARLOW:  That I know about. I can talk to you about that any day.
 
All right, also a secretly recorded meeting revealed in the Oath Keeper's trial. The leader of that right-wing group was trying to send a message to then-President Trump in the aftermath of January 6th.
 
COLLINS:  And the Washington Commanders football team might be up for sale soon as the scandals against the team owner keep piling up.
 
Plus, Actress Sharon Stone is speaking out this morning with what she says is a really important message. Doctors say they found a large tumor after a misdiagnosis.
 
LEMON:  Yes. And it's a very busy morning here straight ahead on CNN This Morning. The former secretary of state is going to be here. Hillary Clinton joins us in just a little bit. She's going to talk about the midterms and the crisis around the world, Congressman Tim Ryan also joins us on his tough Senate race, plus, all of our CNN reporters around the world. You see Anderson Cooper there as well. He will join us a little bit later on.
 
We're going to begin with the economy facing even more headwinds as the issue remains at the top of the minds of voters headed into the midterms. The Fed raising the key interest rate again, that makes buying a home and a car way more expensive.
 
And in terms of the trouble companies are facing, Bloomberg is reporting that Elon Musk plans to cut 37,000 jobs, half of the company's workforce.
 
Our Chief Business Correspondent joins us right now, Christine Romans. Good morning to you.
 
First, let's start with the Feds. Good morning. What does this mean for the average Americans?
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is something that matters to absolutely everyone, okay? I mean, it might sound it's like obscure monetary policy but this is higher borrowing costs for everyone if you buy a home, if you buy a car on your credit cards.
 
I'm going to say, big warning out there. If you're carrying high interest credit card debt, it's really going to be a lot more expensive. If you're buying a home, this is sort of the way we break down the numbers, this is a $400,000 mortgage a year ago, that would have been $1,700 a month. That same mortgage today, if you have good credit, would be $2,600. So, it's $900 more in interest. So, you can't afford the same house probably that you could have bought last year.
 
COLLINS:  Which is the point. ROMANS:  Which is exactly the point, to try to cool down inflation, cool down the economy.
 
We haven't seen it cooling off the job market just yet but that could be coming around the pike. But if you're trying to buy a car, if you're holding high interest credit card debt, this hurts. It hurts.
 
COLLINS:  It absolutely hurts.
 
LEMON:  And then there's a Twitter shakeup. It doesn't just affect Twitter. I mean, there are bigger ramifications for the job market.
 
ROMANS:  Yes. So, we're all watching Twitter here for what will Elon Musk's Twitter look like. What it will probably look like is a lot of fewer employees. Bloomberg reporting is reporting that he's going to lay off half the staff. They already lost all of their top executives, either removed or had left. And it's probably he's talking, musing, riffing on Twitter about charging $8 a month for your verified blue check, saying that he wants to get away from the land of lords and peasants and lower the -- would you say $8 a month?
 
COLLINS:  This is actually a huge conversation of whether or not you would pay.
 
ROMANS:  I've been asking everyone.
 
COLLINS:  It's like cringe worthy if you pay it. It's like embarrassing if you pay.
 
HARLOW:  No. But on principle, I wouldn't pay.
 
ROMANS:  Because of like if it's free speech, and I think AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said this yesterday, laughing that free speech is $8 a month, but he wants to -- I don't know if he's trying to shake up what he thinks is the blue check elite. Is that what they call it?
 
LEMON:  Why pay for the Twitter when you can get the check for free?
 
COLLINS:  Christine Romans.
 
ROMANS:  I'm going to think about that.
 
LEMON:  Thank you, Christine Romans. We really appreciate it.
 
COLLINS:  And then we'll wrapped in a riddle (ph).
 
Also this morning, the Georgia Senate race is one being watched incredibly closely across the nation just five days left until the midterms. I was in Georgia last week speaking with Governor Brian Kemp about this. The Republican candidate on the ticket, Herschel Walker, has been shrouded in scandal but he is still virtually tied, based on the latest polls, with incumbent Democrat Reverend Raphael Warnock, he is the senator right now, in this consequential race, the Democratic candidate.
 <br>[07:05:08]
 
Eva McKend is live for CNN on the ground in Atlanta. Eva, what is the latest that you're seeing there as we have just got days to go even though about a million-and-a-half Georgians have already cast their ballots?
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER:  Well, Kaitlan, as we have been traveling around the state the last several weeks, what's become clear is that Senator Warnock, Herschel Walker can't be any more different, both in terms of style but also substance, dramatic policy differences, giving Georgians a clear choice, a choice that has national implications.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKEND (voice over):  In Georgia this year, a fierce matchup between a long-time pastor and a former football great, vying for a seat that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, won a special election in January 2021 that helped deliver the Senate majority to Democrats.
 
As he seeks a full six year term, Warnock is touting his bipartisan credentials.
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA):  I'll work with anyone if it means helping Georgia.
 
MCKEND:  A Heisman trophy winner and political newcomer, Republican Herschel Walker is leaning on his biography. For the first time in the state's history, two black men are facing off as major party nominees for the Senate. With less than a week until the votes are counted, the polls show a tight race. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next week, the race will head to a December runoff.
 
WARNOCK:  The people of Georgia deserve to see that choice, because in this case it's stark and deeply consequential.
 
MCKEND:  Walker, who is running with the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, has sought to tie Warnock to the current president, Joe Biden, who narrowly won in 2020 in Georgia. Two years later, his standing in the state has sunk amid concerns about the economy and high inflation.
 
SENATE CANDIDATE HERSCHEL WALKER (R-GA):  The thing they're doing to this economy is not right.
 
MCKEND:  Instead of bringing in Biden, Warnock leaning on a former Democratic president, Barack Obama, to help energize voters and make the case against Walker.
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It seems to me he's a celebrity who wants to be a politician.
 
MCKEND:  In the closing week of the campaign, the contest was rocked by reports walker, who is stanchly opposed to abortion rights, pressured two women to have abortions. CNN has not independently confirmed those allegations.
 
WALKER:  I've already told people this is a lie, and I'm not going to entertain and continue to carry a lie alone.
 
MCKEND:  For his part, Warnock has largely avoided directly attacking Walker over the reports, instead raising questions about his GOP rival's character.
 
WARNOCK:  We will see time and time that my opponent has a problem with the truth.
 
MCKEND:  With the Senate potentially at stake, Republican leaders and voters have rallied behind Walker.
 
Are you concerned about the abortion allegations at all?
 
LYNN SMITH, REPUBLICAN GEORGIA VOTER:  No. No. Because, you know, everyone makes a mistake.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKEND (on camera):  According to Georgia's secretary of state, Georgia has reached the 2 million mark for total turnout. Kaitlan?
 
COLLINS:  It's absolutely amazing to see those early voting numbers, almost at the level of a presidential election. Eva McKend, thank you for that report.
 
Another closely watched Senate race is also under way in Ohio. The Democratic candidate there, Congressman Tim Ryan, is going to be joining CNN This Morning live. You can also join CNN for special election coverage, that starts next Tuesday at 4:00 P.M. Eastern. We will be watching that Georgia Senate race, the Ohio Senate race and all the other ones across the nation.
 
HARLOW:  So, in just a few minutes, we'll get to Tim Ryan. But this now, members of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's family have now seen police body camera footage. They've actually seen what happened to her husband, Paul Pelosi. They have also heard that terrifying 911 call that Mr. Pelosi made. The San Francisco district attorney confirms the attack was, quote, politically motivated and that Pelosi's assailant is a, quote, extremely dangerous individual. She also tells Wolf Blitzer she will not be releasing any of the video or the audio to the public.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROOKE JENKINS, SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  My job, Wolf, is to make sure that we protect the state of this investigation and the successful future of this prosecution. And for us, revealing that evidence through the media is just not what we think is appropriate. We want to make sure that this individual is held accountable for these egregious acts. And so, for us, we're going to make sure that we limit the (INAUDIBLE) of the evidence as much as possible in order to get that done.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  That's the San Francisco district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, saying that Paul Pelosi's attacker presents a significant risk to the public, public safety, not only to Speaker Pelosi and her family but to other people mentioned in that list of targets that he had as well as to the general public.
 
LEMON:  Now to that violent attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband at their home is raising questions about what Capitol police are doing to improve security for members of Congress and their families.
 <br>[07:10:04]
 
We're now learning House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, in the wake of January 6th, was skeptical about the need for more officers to protect lawmakers.
 
Let's get straight to CNN's Manu Raju live for us this morning on Capitol Hill. Good morning to you. So, there were some skeptics. Are there still, considering what has happened to Nancy Pelosi's husband and other threats on members of Congress?
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Don, there's been just a lot of uncertainty around the Capitol police in the aftermath of the January 6th attack, and that is in part because there have been a number of police officers who have left the force and they've had a difficult time hiring up, staffing up, even though we have seen escalating threats and, of course, violence that we saw last week at the Pelosi home.
 
Now, Nancy Pelosi in the aftermath of January 6th hired -- commissioned retired Army Lieutenant General Russel Honore to do a security review of the U.S. Capitol to determine what improvements were needed.
 
Now, Honore revealed for the first time to our colleagues that he briefed Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, and told him about the need for new hires. And Honore tells us that after he briefed him, quote, his opinion was a, just need better management, they don't need more officers.
 
Now, Honore wanted 854 new hires to the U.S. Capitol police. We've reached out to Kevin McCarthy's office to see what they had to say about Honore's claims. But this comes as we saw yesterday Zoe Lofgren, who is the head of the House Administration Committee, someone who oversees the U.S. Capitol police, sent out a letter to the Capitol police chief, asking what security protocols are under way at the department, particularly for people who are in line for presidential succession, like Nancy Pelosi, is, how to deal with family members and those individuals' homes.
 
What was significant, what we have learned in this past week, was that for ten whole minutes, the U.S. Capitol police was not monitoring a live police camera feed outside the Pelosi San Francisco home as the attack at their home was under way last week. And it was because they don't actively monitor those feeds when the person, the leadership -- member of leadership is not at that home, Pelosi was in Washington at the time, not San Francisco, all leading to questions about what more resources are needed at this critical time of escalating violence and threats against politicians and their families.
 
LEMON:  Manu Raju on Capitol Hill this morning. Thank you, Manu, I appreciate that.
 
RAJU:  Thank you.
 
COLLINS:  Also this morning, Japan says it strongly condemns North Korea's latest barrage of weapons test that you've seen overnight. North Korea fired at least three missiles into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, including a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile, which we believe appears to have failed, according to the South Korean government.
 
Barbara Starr is live for CNN This Morning at the Pentagon. Barbara, what are you seeing and what are officials in the Pentagon saying about these tests from North Korea?
 
BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Well, good morning, Kaitlan. This entire topic actually is going to be front and center at the Pentagon this morning. In just a short while, the defense minister of South Korea expected to walk up those Pentagon steps for a pre- scheduled meeting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. But it comes after the spade of launches. So, expect the two ministers to sit down and talk about what the next steps may be.
 
A lot of attention on that suspected intercontinental ballistic missile launched and failed, it is believed, but, nonetheless, this is a missile that, if it works some day, would have the capability, of course, to reach all the way to the United States. So, there's a lot of concern, even though it failed.
 
The U.S. position is that North Korea continues to learn with every failed launch. They are struggling, it is believed, with their precision guidance on these new missiles. But every time they launch, they learn something.
 
And we know now that some ongoing air exercises between the U.S. and South Korea are now going to be extended, some 240 aircraft from both nations involved. They're going to be extended for a few days on those exercises at least trying to, again, send a signal to Kim Jong-un. No indication he's listening.
 
COLLINS:  Yes. No contact between North Koreans and the Biden administration so far.
 
Barbara, what about what this accusation that we saw from the United States yesterday that North Korea is shipping artillery shells to Russia that they could potentially use in Ukraine?
 
STARR:  Well, the administration, the White House only going so far, saying they believe North Korea is doing it not saying that anybody has taken delivery on the Russian end. But, nonetheless, it perhaps goes to Kim Jong-un's motivation. A lot of experts here at the Pentagon believe that he wants to get attention on the world stage. He needs money and he wants attention. So, that may be part of the thinking about why North Korea is doing all of this. But, nonetheless, again, it comes to the point he is pursuing this weapons program.
 <br>[07:15:02]
 
And, critically, I think the next thing everyone really is watching for is the possibility that Kim will undertake another, a seventh underground nuclear test. All the intelligence, we are told, indicates they are ready at any time to do that kind of underground nuclear test and that will be very destabilizing. Kaitlan?
 
COLLINS:  Yes, incredibly so. Barbara Starr, thank you, as always.
 
STARR:  Sure.
 
HARLOW:  Meantime, the owner of the Washington Commanders, the owners, Daniel and Tanya Snyder, they are finally looking at a sale of the team. This is months after the House Oversight Committee found that Snyder fostered a toxic work environment.
 
Our Tom Foreman joins CNN This Morning from FedEx Field where the Commanders play. This has been long coming and, Tom, this comes after some other NFL owners have said it's time to sell this team.
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. You could call them the Commanders of chaos. This team has been through this tumultuous name change, controversial headlines, and now the guy at the middle of it all, who has indicated for so long he would not sell, is suggesting maybe he will.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOREMAN (voice over):  A potential billion dollar sale in the NFL, Washington Commanders Owner Dan Snyder signaling he is open to sell the NFL team Forbes estimates to be worth $5.6 billion. Snyder bought the team in 1999 for $750 million, according to Forbes. It's unclear if Snyder is exploring selling the entire franchise or just a share. And any transaction would require the approval of three quarters of the NFL team owners, according to The Washington Post.
 
It's been a turbulent two years for Snyder. The embattled owner has faced accusations. He hired private investigators to look into his NFL counterparts and Commissioner Roger Goodell. Snyder denies these allegations. The NFL and House Oversight Committee investigated Snyder for fostering a toxic workplace environment after multiple accusations of workplace improprieties.
 
REP. RAJA KRISHNMOORTHI (D-IL):  You're aware that, in 2009, Dan Snyder was accused of sexually assaulting an employee on a private airplane, correct?
 
ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Am I aware about it? Yes, I'm aware of that allegation. FOREMAN:  That employee was fired. But Snyder and the team settled with the accuser for $1.6 million. Initially, Snyder refused to appear, but later did sit for a deposition. The committee concluded Snyder conducted a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others and influence the NFL's own internal review. Snyder has denied those accusations too.
 
REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D-NY):  It shows the lengths Mr. Snyder went to, to harass, intimidate and silence his accusers.
 
FOREMAN:  The NFL, for its part, did find fault with Snyder at the conclusion of its own internal review, which resulted in Snyder handing daily control over to his wife.
 
GOODELL:  We impose unprecedented discipline on the club, monetary penalties of well over $10 million.
 
FOREMAN:  In a statement, the team said the Washington Commanders have fully cooperated with federal and state investigators.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOREMAN (on camera):  So, right now, there's a lot of speculation about who a new buyer might be, somebody with very deep pockets, to be sure. As for the coach, the team and most certainly the fans, they would just like to get all of this behind them and perhaps start having some winning seasons again. Poppy?
 
HARLOW:  There you go. Tom foreman live for us there, thank you, Tom. We appreciate it.
 
LEMON:  Legendary Actress Sharon Stone has revealed that she was misdiagnosed and mistreated for a tumor. Stone tweeted that after an incorrect procedure, she got a second opinion revealing a large fibroid tumor.
 
With us now is CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Elizabeth, good morning to you. The question is, I mean, it's awful for Sharon Stone, but how common are these missed diagnoses?
 
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Don, they're actually much more common than you might think. A recent study from Johns Hopkins found that when you look at big things, like cancer or heart attacks or infections or stroke, that the diagnosis rate might be as high as one in ten people get misdiagnosed. And the authors of this study, they said misdiagnoses is a serious threat to patient's safety.
 
HARLOW:  How is she doing? I mean, Don makes a good point. It's about everyone. I think all our viewers want to know how is Sharon Stone doing after this too.
 
COHEN:  She didn't really talk about that much, Poppy. It's such a great question. I think the thing about this, it's so true, with so many misdiagnoses, once you get the right diagnosis, in her case, she said fibroids, I'm assuming she means uterine fibroids, there are great treatments for that. And you can talk to your doctor and there are difference choices. Once you get the right diagnosis, it opens the door to recovery. So, we're hoping, and it seems like she would be doing fine now that she has the right diagnosis.
 <br>[07:20:02]
 
COLLINS:  And, Elizabeth, she's singled out women in particular in her warning, saying, ladies, don't get blown off, talking about getting a second opinion. Can you speak to the level of concern that women should have about being misdiagnosed, that they aren't often having their pain, their actual issues treated correctly or even diagnosed correctly?
 
COHEN:  Kaitlan, that is so true. There have been studies that show that women are more likely misdiagnosed. There's a lot of reasons for that, but one of them usually honed in on it, which is that women are -- it's more often that doctors will tell women you're just complaining. I mean, they may not put it that way but that's basically what they're saying. Women are going to be written off as complainers or told just told that it's all in their head. Men don't get told that as much. The same is true for people of color. The misdiagnoses rates for people of color are higher than white people. And one of the reasons is their complaints aren't taken as seriously.
 
COLLINS:  And they should be.
 
LEMON:  Thank you very much. We appreciate that.
 
HARLOW:  Next on CNN This Morning, we're joined by Congressman Tim Ryan, who is trying to win the Senate seat in Ohio. It's a tighter and tighter race as the days go by.
 
COLLINS:  Yes, a lot of questions for him.
 
We're also learning more about the troubling message that the leader of the group known as the Oath Keepers sent trying to keep and trying to relay it to former President Trump.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:25:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This year, I hope you'll make the future of our democracy an important part of your decision to vote and how you vote.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How many here think inflation and the economy is the number one issue in this race? And you're one of them?
 
REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH):  I'm one of them. I've been screaming at Democrats too for a year-and-a-half to pass a tax cut.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW:  All right. President Biden leading those Democrats, sounding the alarm and urging Americans to cast a vote in favor of democracy on Election Day. That's what he made his closing argument last night. Well, many Republicans and a handful of Democrats spend the last days of their campaign catering to what voters actually care about most, which is the economy, stupid, right? That's what they say it is in this election too. This is according to CNN's latest polling.
 
Joining us now, Ohio Senate Candidate Congressman Tim Ryan.
 
Look --
 
RYAN:  Good morning.
 
HARLOW:  Good morning. We have a lot to get to with you. We thank you for your time. You heard the president last night, right? He didn't make an argument on the economy. His argument was about this election is all about defending democracy. Was that the wrong argument for this election for Democrats to win?
 
RYAN:  Well, you know, we have to be able to address both of these issues. I'm very focused on the economy, as you played, the tax cut, people are crushed. I mean, this inflation is killing people. You can be a home health care worker in Cleveland or you can be a construction worker in Southern Ohio, where you have to drive a lot, the gas prices are killing you. So, we need to put money in people's pockets. We need a tax cut. We need it now.
 
But then you see the level of extremism going on with candidates, like J.D. Vance, who I'm running again. You see what Donald Trump Jr. posted after the Paul Pelosi incident, the derogatory remarks against him, like that is a level of political violence happening in the country that absolutely needs to be confronted, a bunch election deniers from 2020, which is the quickest way to undermine the democracy, and then the extremism that's coming on, a national abortion ban or banning books in schools and all of that stuff. So, we have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time in the United States. It's a complicated country, which means you need good leaders who can focus both on the economy and preserving our democracy.
 
HARLOW:  All right. So, just sticking with the economy for a minute, because you've made pretty clear it's like issue number one, and the voters think. So, to Maria Milligan (ph), she is a voter from Perrysburg, Ohio. She said she's been forced to drain her savings because inflation is out of control. And she said she's only voting for Republicans because she thinks they understand money better. You told me three years ago in your CNN presidential town hall, you said, we need to save capitalism from itself. What would you do right now? What does that mean today in this economy?
 
RYAN:  Well, one, I think it's part of the Democratic problem. The national Democrat's problem is that a woman who's having economic problems just outside of Toledo, Ohio, is looking to the Republican Party for some help and the Republican Party is doing nothing but defending extremists who want to overthrow the government and undermine our democracy. That's a problem that the National Democratic Party has.
 
I would say to her we have to cut their taxes. Most of the Republicans weren't for the infrastructure bill, didn't support the Inflation Reduction Act, where we were able to make huge investments that are going to land in Northwest Ohio to invest in the solar industry, which is going to create jobs.
 
But, again, tax cut, put money in people's pockets. We have got all the smart economists who told us inflation wasn't going to be a problem, now it's a problem. And now we need to make sure that the average worker has more money in their pockets. The supply chains are starting to loosen up. This is going to go away in several months as the global economy opens back up, but you have got to put money in people's pockets. They didn't do anything wrong. Give them a tax cut.
 
COLLINS:  And, Congressman Ryan, polling is polling but you and your opponent, J.D. Vance, are pretty close. Why do you think your party is not doing more to help you in this race?
 
RYAN:  You know, the National Democratic Party has never been really good at strategic political decisions, so it's not a surprise here. Thank God that I have enough experience that I built this campaign not needing them and we really don't want them at this point. We're going to do this thing with all the grassroots people we have here. Organized labor has been huge. We have 415,000 donors across the country.
