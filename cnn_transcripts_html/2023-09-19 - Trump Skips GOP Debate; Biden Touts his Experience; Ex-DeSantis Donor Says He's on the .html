THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[06:30:00] 
 
MARIO PARKER, WHITE HOUSE AND POLITICS EDITOR, "BLOOMBERG": He won Michigan in 2016. Democrats have done a lot over the last four years or so to try to shore that up, secure it. Whitmer, for example, Governor Whitmer, had a resounding re-election as well. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: The legislature.
 
PARKER: And it's one of -- Michigan is arguably the crown jewel of those five to seven battleground states that Trump will need to win if he's able to again, you know, upset Biden. 
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Michigan would be a key path -- key to President Biden's path to 270. That kind of blue wall that he reimplemented back in 2020. 
 
I was struck last night because apparently I can't break away from the White House. I was reading that the pool reports from my colleague Kevin -- 
 
HARLOW: You should see the emails we get. 
 
MATTINGLY: From our colleague Kevin -- Mario can identify with this -- from our colleague Kevin Liptak from the fundraisers. And fundraisers is, we have learned, where the president is kind of looser, more willing to speak freely. But it also seems like he was road testing to some degree an argument that I've heard from advisers, but has been less forthcoming publicly. And I want to ask you about this because you had this great story over the weekend about the difference between where Democratic national party leadership is and where actual voters in their party are. 
 
The president said in part, and this is behind the scenes, quote, "a lot of people seem focused on my age. Believe me, I know better than anyone. When this nation was flat on its back, I knew what to do. When democracy was at stake, I knew what to do." Also had very sharp criticism and pointed criticism of the former president. Almost head out -- taking on the age issue head on. 
 
LISA LERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "THE NEW YORK TIMES": Exactly. And that's a fascinating little twist in this whole ongoing question about the president's age. We know from surveys, from focus groups, from interviews with voters that this is a top concern for rank and file Democratic voters that I think there was -- sort of Biden made this implicit promise in the first run to Democratic primary voters where he said, look, elect me and I'll stabilize things for you. They saw Trump as this existential threat. I'll beat him. I'm your best shot at beating him. 
 
And I think a lot of those voters didn't really think about a second term or the possibility of an 86-year-old second term president, and now they are. And they're concerned. And the problem - the reason the issue is so salient is it's something everybody knows. Everybody has an elderly parent or a grandparent or they're ageing themselves. Everybody knows about age. And so the decision by the president to start to move towards taking this issue on -- head on, as you point out, is really of a - a kind of acknowledgment of how damaging this is with his base in some ways. 
 
HARLOW: I want to talk about Ron DeSantis and some of his biggest supporters. I was so struck by this recent interview that Ken Griffin, who, you know, big money guy, CEO of Citadel Capital, and was a big money supporter of DeSantis, he's holding back right now. And here's how he explained it on CNBC. 
 
Let's play it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEN GRIFFIN, CEO, CITADEL: The ongoing battle with Disney I think is pointless. In fact, it doesn't reflect well on the ethos of Florida. You know, the mayor of Miami-Dade is a - is a Democrat. She's really exceptional. And you know what she talks about with me, how can we make this a great state to do business in. Ron needs to stay on that talking point. 
 
I don't know his strategy. I - I -- I'm in the same camp you are. It's not clear to me what voter base he's intending to appeal to. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Uh, uh-oh, if you're in DeSantis' camp and you're listening to that, and you think other high, big donors are listening to that, what do you do? 
 
PARKER: No, I mean, it's a - it's a code red at this point. And what's key that Ken Griffin said was that he doesn't know his strategy. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
PARKER: Well, DeSantis' strategy was to try to aggressive outflank former President Donald Trump to his right. But what that does is essentially undermine his general election argument, right? He's drawn headlines for fighting with Disney, for critical race theory, for a six week abortion ban. And if - if - if big - deep pocked donors like Ken Griffin and others, what they do is analyze data, right? The latest data point that they have is the 2022 midterm election, right? So, these issues that DeSantis is outflanking Trump to the right on are the same issues that alienate independent voters. Hence, for Wall Street, do you put your money on someone who's trending downward. 
 
MATTINGLY: I mean how many behind the scenes conversations before he went public like that, because that's -
 
HARLOW: How many phone calls? 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. That's the big question. To say I don't know the strategy, whoa. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
Thanks, guys.
 
MATTINGLY: Lisa, Mario, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. 
 
HARLOW: So, this story. We talked about it yesterday. We do have a big development. That F-35 fighter jet that vanished for more than 24 hours, it has been found in South Carolina. 
 
MATTINGLY: That's good.
 
HARLOW: That's good news. But, I mean, still the question this morning, how does a multimillion-dollar military jet go missing. We'll talk with a retired F-35 fighter pilot about that. 
 
MATTINGLY: And the leader of the Wagner mercenary group may be dead, but it's business as usual for his troops in Africa. In a CNN exclusive, Clarissa Ward reports on the ground from the Central African Republic. You don't want to miss this. 
 
Stay with us.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:38:12]
 
HARLOW: Welcome back. 
 
New this morning, India has expelled a senior Canadian diplomat in retaliation after Canada did the same just yesterday. This follows allegations from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that, quote, "credible intelligence" links New Delhi to the murder of a Sikh leader. Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot to death outside of a Sikh temple in British Columbia back in June in Canada. He was a citizen in India, a wanted terrorist.
 
Paula Newton here with us in studio to explain what has happened. 
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is astounding, honestly. This is the kind of reaction that you might have if you were Canada to a rogue state. No, this is an ally of not just Canada but obviously the United States as well. 
 
Canada decided enough was enough. They decided to go public with their allegations with the Indian government. When they didn't get the reaction they were looking for, they went public. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON (voice over): In a startling accusation, Canadian officials say the killing of a prominent Canadian Sikh leader in the province of British Columbia in June may have been an assassination carried out on the orders of the Indian government. 
 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar. 
 
NEWTON: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he confronted India's prime minister with the allegations in a face-to-face meeting just last week as Narendra Modi hosted the G-20 Summit. 
 
TRUDEAU: Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty. It is contrary to the fundamental rules by which free, open and democratic societies conduct themselves. 
 <br>[06:40:05]
 
NEWTON: The killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar remains unsolved. Royal Canadian Mounted Police say Nijjar suffered multiple gunshot wounds while sitting in a vehicle outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. Homicide investigators say two mass suspects, described as heavier set males, fled on foot and then possibly in this 2008 silver Toyota Camry. 
 
In the earliest days after the homicide, protesters demanded justice, saying the killing was politically motivated and chilling retribution for Nijjar's activism and support for Sikh independence in India. At the time RCNP would not comment on a possible motive for the killing. But now Canadian officials are taking swift actions based on their suspicions. The head of India's spy agency in Canada, one of India's top diplomats there, has been expelled. 
 
In a statement, the Indian government responded saying the allegations are "unsubstantiated" and accused Canada of sheltering terrorists. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: This is, obviously, also an issue for the United States. Trudeau said he briefed Joe Biden at the G-20 Summit about the allegations and the credible evidence that they believe they have. And this is going to be a continuing story, Poppy. 
 
HARLOW: What a development. Paula, thank you for the reporting. 
 
Phil.
 
MATTINGLY: I want to bring Jim Sciutto back in now. 
 
This is remarkable on its face. 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: What's your take on how this could possibly happen? 
 
SCIUTTO: Listen, we talked top of this hour about hostage diplomacy, countries like Iran, North Korea, Russia, China taking hostages in effect as a tool of influence around the world. 
 
This is extra territorial assassination. Who -- that's the allegation. By the way, I don't think the Canadian prime minister goes to the floor of parliament unless they have very good intelligence establishing that and sending their head of intelligence to India to make a formal complaint about this. 
 
Who else does this kind of thing? Russia does this kind of thing. In London, Skripal, Litvinenko. China does this, seeking out its nationals around the world. 
 
This, if true, is an alarming step up. And India, by the way, a country that U.S. tried to establish closer relations with, the world's largest democracy, you hear that all the time. This is not democratic behavior, right, to have done this, particularly on the soil of an ally, Canada. 
 
MATTINGLY: And just announced a few weeks after hosting the G-20 Summit as well. 
 
SCIUTTO: Exactly.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
Jim, thank you very much. 
 
MATTINGLY: Well, California Governor Gavin Newsom calling out former President Trump's claims that some Democrats support abortion rights up to and after birth. Our Dana Bash sat down with Newsom for an exclusive one-on-one interview. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR: So, is it the government's role then? I know you said - you said it's up to women.
 
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): It's not our role to make that decision. 
 
BASH: So, there should be nothing on the books? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:45:57]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR: Can you just be clear about what limits on abortion should be? GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): It's a political thing. People are not
 
 seeking abortion at the end of the cycle. 
 
BASH: But what is - what is the policy? What should it be? 
 
NEWSOM: The policy, it's not up to Donald Trump or me. It's up to you, to women, that have to bear that responsibility uniquely and distinctly. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: That was California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom in an exclusive sit-down interview with our colleague Dana Bash. In that interview he also criticized former President Trump's recent claim that some Democrats support abortion rights up to and after birth. 
 
Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): And the reality is, it's a canard. It's a political frame. It's total BS. And it's exactly where they need to go because they know they've gone too far on the other side.
 
DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR: But there has to be some kind - well, let me just talk about your state of California. 
 
NEWSOM: Yes. 
 
BASH: As you well know, there is a law on the books that preceded you that says that you can have an abortion up until viability, which is about 24 weeks. 
 
NEWSOM: That's right. 
 
BASH: Is that something that you support personally? 
 
NEWSOM: That's - that's the statute in the state of California. That said, there was a constitutional amendment that we placed on the ballot that has some nuance in it. And so that's an area that's being adjudicated in public opinion and likely will ultimately be adjudicated in the courts. 
 
BASH: So, it the government's role then - I know you said - you said it's up to women.
 
NEWSOM: It's not our role to make that decision. 
 
BASH: So there should be nothing on the books? 
 
NEWSOM: (INAUDIBLE). This is - this is a canard. This is a false flag. This is where they need to go in order to get out of the mess they've created because they don't believe in fundamental choice and freedom for women. They don't. Period, full stop. 
 
BASH: I just want to be clear because people are going to be listening very carefully to what you're saying. 
 
NEWSOM: Yes. 
 
BASH: You do not believe it is the role of government nationally or state government -
 
NEWSOM: No, that's why -
 
BASH: To have -- to have any limits on the books legally? 
 
NEWSOM: The state of California has long believed in viability. I've long believed in viability. We went forward with a constitutional amendment that's created some questions as it relates to this. My - my point is, no one wants to see late, late-term abortions. No one's out there promoting that. That's not what the Democratic Party's position is. It's not where my personal position is. 
 
In those rare and extremely rare and personal circumstances, one thing I absolutely believe, Donald Trump shouldn't be making that decision. I sure as hell should not be making that decision.

MATTINGLY: Joining us now is CNN chief political correspondent and anchor of "INSIDE POLITICS," Dana Bash. 
 
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. 
 
HARLOW: Good morning.
 
MATTINGLY: Also anchor of "STATE OF THE UNION."
 
Welcome. It's great to see you. 
 
BASH: Nice to see you.
 
MATTINGLY: It was a great interview. It was a fascinating interview with a critical player on the Democratic side of the aisle. That back and forth, that exchange, what was your take on that answer? 
 
BASH: I honestly wasn't sure what he was going to say because I've talked to some Democrats who say that we, the Democratic Party, the Democratic leaders, need to be more clear just to get the - get it off the table, to be more clear about the outside limits. 
 
OK, obviously, most Democrats support abortion rights. But because Republicans are coming at them and they're trying to make it an issue, we saw that with the former president over the weekend, but he was just adding on to a lot of Republicans saying, oh, Democrats want to have abortion on demand and abortion until after birth and all of those thing, which, let's be clear, almost all Democrats do not support that. 
 
So, I thought maybe he would say, my state of California, the law of viability. That's where I stand. He did say it is his personal opinion, and that's generally where it should be. But when it comes to the law of the land, when it comes to what the government should and should not do, you saw there, he didn't want to go there. He wants to -- he wanted to make it clear that this is a medical issue and not a legal issue. 
 
And I honestly wasn't sure which way he was going to go on that. But he did lean into that. And, look, when you look at the polls and, more importantly, you look at what happened in 2022, there is an energy among Democrats and even some independents to say, stay out of my doctor's office. 
 <br>[06:50:13]
 
And so that's likely why he was going -- you were surprised? 
 
MATTINGLY: I just thought it was very cautious. And I thought it was a great back and forth. And I think that was illuminating both because of where he personally stands but also it gets at why, when people ask Democratic leaders to take a more firm stance on a specific timetable, there's a reason why that they don't. And I think that's interesting given the political energy behind it inside their party.
 
BASH: But he's not wrong that Republicans are trying very hard to turn the tables on Democrats on abortion. 
 
MATTINGLY: Oh, no, not at all. 
 
BASH: Because they got their clocks cleaned politically on this in a way that they didn't expect in 2022. 
 
HARLOW: Which may explain why Trump is talking the way he's talking right now about the issue. 
 
BASH: Exactly.
 
HARLOW: OK, Biden's age. So many people had been looking - had - had -- are, I don't know, looking at Newsom as, will he run, should he throw his hat in the ring? But you talked to him about the biggest -- one of the biggest concerns among Democrats which is age, which is Biden's age. 
 
Let's listen to this exchange. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): I couldn't imagine three years ago that this president could accomplish so much in such a short period of time. I mean that. If this political season is all about a celebrity, with all due respect, we had a celebrity for four years. It didn't go well. And so I want a seasoned pro that knows how to get things done. I'm a little old fashioned. I want a guy who produces results. And the results are in. It's been a master class. There's simply no administration in my lifetime that's been more effective producing more substantive results. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: A master class. 
 
BASH: Uh-huh. This is a big reason - the main -- well, one of the main reasons why Gavin Newsom is out like he is now. We didn't see him out very much on the national level prior to, I don't know, the last couple of months. And we -- I would even say the last few weeks. And there is a view among I think a fair number of Democrats that - that the message, that the Biden/Harris message isn't getting out, isn't penetrating. And he is a unique messenger. He is somebody who now the Biden campaign does see as somebody who can say what he just said, who can make the argument for why the first two and a half years from the point of view of Democrats should have - should be something to celebrate and he deserves -- they both deserve a second term. 
 
And he's trying to fill a messaging vacuum. And, of course, that leads to the obvious question, which is, is it -- does it help him in the long-term? Maybe. I mean as you heard in that interview, he denied any interest in 2024, which he's done in the past. He even said that he hasn't even thought about running for president ever. 
 
HARLOW: Ever? He thought about it?
 
BASH: What do you guys think?
 
HARLOW: What?
 
BASH: What do you think about that? 
 
HARLOW: I have no idea. I cannot get in Gavin Newsom's mind.
 
MATTINGLY: I would never -- 
 
HARLOW: I just think most politicians think about running for president. 
 
MATTINGLY: Politicians - politicians are never calculating in any way, shape or form.
 
BASH: He said - well, you'll appreciate this. He said, no, I'm not a senator. Which is, you know, the joke is every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes.
 
I know we've got to go, but when you - when they announced that you were doing this interview, I heard from a lot of Republicans saying, oh, here we go. Like this is the start. This is the Newsom move. 
 
HARLOW: Right.
 
MATTINGLY: I was like, no, it's the opposite. It's literally the opposite. The Biden campaign wants this. 
 
BASH: Exactly. That's exactly right, for now. 
 
MATTINGLY: For now. 
 
HARLOW: For now.
 
MATTINGLY: It was a great interview. Dana, thank you for coming on. It was great to see.
 
HARLOW: Thanks, Dana.
 
BASH: Thanks. Good to see you guys. 
 
HARLOW: This morning, five Americans are back on U.S. soil after spending years wrongfully detained in Iran. Ahead, we'll be joined by one of those American's family members before they finally reunite. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:57:55]
 
HARLOW: The Cleveland Browns losing to the Steelers last night. But, more importantly, they likely lost their star running back to a season-ending injury. 
 
Andy Scholes joins us with more. 
 
Another - another one? After Aaron Rodgers? 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes, another one, guys. I mean it's just a brutal night for the Cleveland Browns. You know, Nick Chubb, one of the best running backs in the NFL, and he's arguably the Browns' best player. And in the second quarter last night in Pittsburgh, Chubb getting a handoff here. He's going to go about five yards and then he's tackled. His knee completely bends the wrong way. Chubb, he knew it immediately. Same knee that he had to have reconstructive surgery on back in college. Chubb eventually carted off the field after the game. Head Coach Kevin Stefansi, he called it a significant injury and Chubb's teammate, Amari Cooper, said it's just devastating for the team. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMARI COOPER, CLEVELAND BROWNS WIDE RECEIVER: Obviously, you know, it's a huge loss. Nick is like the engine of the team, you know what I mean? The best player on the team, you know what I mean? So, it's just tragic, you know. Very unfortunate. I'm very sad for Nick. I'm sad for this team losing Nick. Not only is it not ideal, this -- this is a tragedy. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: Now, the Browns did have the lead halfway through the first quarter, but the Steelers defense coming through. Alex Highsmith, the strip sack on Deshaun Watson. TJ Watts scoops it up, takes it in for the touchdown. That would win it for the Steelers. Final of that game, 26-22. 
 
Now, we had a doubleheader Monday night football last night. The other matchup, NFC South showdown between the Saints and the Panthers. The score tied at six. Halfway through the third, check out this catch from Chris Olave. Bobbles it before bringing it in. Seven plays later, Tony Jones Jr. is going to run the ball in for a touchdown to give the Saints a 13-6 lead. Jones also adding another score in the fourth quarter to put this game away. New Orleans would win, 20-17 to improve to 2-0 for the first time since 2013. 
 
But, guys, you said it at the beginning, two weeks into the NFL season, Aaron Rodgers going down in week one, now Nick Chubb in week two. It's been rough so far. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, it has. But Chris Olave, as Poppy was just noting, Ohio State Buckeye, right, as you were just saying? 
 <br>[07:00:03]
 
SCHOLES: Poppy was noting that? Good. Good. Good, Poppy. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, she -
 
HARLOW: As I was -- as I was just noting. 
 
MATTINGLY: She was just saying.
