KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: The latest now on our top story.
 
Former President Donald Trump will soon be leaving his Florida home. He's headed to New York and headed for an unprecedented day in court. He'll be arraigned tomorrow on possibly 30 charges stemming from the hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He will surrender at a courthouse in Manhattan where he will be processed and also appear in court, making him the first former American president to face criminal charges. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: The Justice Department has new evidence that former President Donald Trump went digging through documents after he was served a subpoena to collect classified documents from his Mar-a- Lago home. That is according to "The Washington Post." Trump apparently wanted to keep certain things before the files were handed over to investigators. 
 
CNN's Katelyn Polantz is following all of the details.
 
Katelyn, so we were - we're here -- seeing this reporting from "The Post" that he allegedly went through some of these boxes. What more can you tell us about this? 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Sara, the key thing here that "The Washington Post" is reporting is that there is fresh evidence that investigators are nailing down in this grand jury investigation, this criminal investigation, out of Washington, where they are looking to potentially bring charges around the documents kept at Mar-a-Lago. 
 
And the evidence that "The Washington Post" says the investigators have now is Donald Trump looking through the contents of boxes that would have contained classified records, potentially to keep things for himself. 
 
Now, we have known for some time that it's very likely that Trump was looking at documents, or at least came across them in his day to day business after he got that subpoena last May demanding that all classified records in his possession should be turned back over to the Justice Department. We knew about boxes moved out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. We know that the FBI, when they went in to do the search, they found
 
 documents in his office, in his private residential area in the suite. And we also know that there was a folder on his nightstand marked classified that even his lawyers didn't turn over until much later in the year last year.
 
But now the key here is that the prosecutors are putting together their cases. And that is a potential case into obstruction of justice, not just mishandling of records. But what happened after he got that subpoena when the Justice Department said we need it back.
 
SIDNER: Yes, a potential obstruction charge is the big charge. 
 
I do want to ask you how in the world investigators figured this out.
 
POLANTZ: Well, there is a lot of investigative activity going on in the federal court. There are lots of grand jury subpoenas we've been hearing about. We know that Donald Trump's attorney was forced to testify and answer questions about their exchanges, including over some of the surveillance tapes. 
 
And that's one of the things that "The Post" points out may be crucial here as part of this additional evidence that the Justice Department was able to obtain and look at surveillance tapes at Mar-a-Lago. 
 
And also they note, and CNN has confirmed this as well, Kaitlan Collins was able to nail down, that one of Trump's top assistants, Molly Michael, the emails and texts that she had taken, her writing, was showing that Trump, what he was doing, who he was meeting with, and that now is becoming crucial as investigators are piecing together the day to day activities of the former president potentially around these documents themselves. 
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: Katelyn, thank you so much, there from Washington, D.C.
 
You know, as with the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation moving forward, as you heard, the former president is preparing to leave his West Palm Beach home and had to New York in just a few hours. Trump says he will depart Mar-a-Lago at noon today Eastern. He is coming here to New York and will likely spend the night in Trump Tower, all leading up to his surrender tomorrow.
 
CNN's Kristen Holmes is near Mar-a-Lago this morning. 
 
Kristen, what are you seeing so far there?
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sara, we've already started to see a lot of enhanced security. We usually would have been able to go live from the airport, but our camera was actually kicked out of that location. We also sent a crew over in front of Mar-a-Lago, which is just across the bridge behind me. They said that Secret Service had blocked off certain areas where we could have set up there. And it just goes to show you that this is not a typical movement for the former president. They are clearly using enhanced security here.
 
And what we know, as you mentioned, President Trump, the former president, will leave Mar-a-Lago with a small group of advisers, including his campaign heads, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. They will head to the airport at noon. They will take off shortly after that to arrive in New York. And, of course, ahead of that arraignment tomorrow. Former President Trump will be staying at his apartment at Trump Tower. 
 
SIDNER: You know, we know this. It has been reported the president is planning to address supporters after his arraignment. We've already seen some of the things he's said online. What are you hearing? 
 <br>[09:35:03]
 
HOLMES: Well, Sara, I was told by a source that this was really an opportunity for former President Trump to take over the narrative after we see those charges. All of the reaction we have seen so far, the idea that this is a political hoax, that he has said that this is a witch hunt, that has all been before we actually see what he is charged with. So, this will be the first time we hear from him since that public unsealing of that indictment. 
 
And I'm told that he will likely try to capitalize on this politically. You know, Trump and his advisers spent the weekend in between rounds of golf discussing how to make the most of this. He was on the phone with allies and advisers talking about how he actually believes that this is a political positive for him. He talked about recent poll numbers. He talked about his fundraising. So, this is something that he is viewing as a positive, or at least he is selling it as that, but it will be interesting to hear if any of his messaging changes once that indictment is unsealed and we actually see those charges. 
 
SIDNER: He's done this before, and certainly we'll do it again. 
 
Tell us about how he's being able to raise so much money off of his legal woes. 
 
HOLMES: Well, this is something that we have heard from the campaign about. They are very proud of this number in the 48 hours after the indictment. The former president was able to raise $5 million. And this is a significant amount of money. Just to put it into context for you, after he announced his presidential bid in November, 45 days after that, the fourth quarter, he only raised $9.5 million. 
 
So you're talking about raising over half of that in 48 hours. And he has been appealing to his voters, to his base. He has sent out email after email. He even recorded a video asking people to donate, which he sent out in an email and also posted the Truth Social.
 
SIDNER: All right, Kristen Holmes there, live for us from West Palm Beach, Florida.
 
John. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: A suspect has been detained in connection with the explosion that ripped through this cafe in St. Petersburg in Russia. It killed a pro-war blogger there. We have new information on this investigation.
 
Plus, LSU riding high this morning after winning the NCAA women's championship. We have the highlights of the powerhouse performance. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:41:38]
 
BOLDUAN: This morning, CNN has learned that this woman has been detained by Russian authorities in connection with Sunday's deadly bombing at a cafe in St. Petersburg. Here is the moment we want to show you that it injured -- the moment of the blast. You see it right there. It injured more than 30 people, killed a prominent military blogger known to be a major supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
 
The Kremlin has said that Ukraine could be behind the attack. However, no evidence has been presented yet to support that claim. 
 
And then there is this, newly released video which shows this same woman now under arrest outside the cafe that same day carrying a box and Russian media have also put out photographs of that woman standing near the blogger who was killed. This was just inside the cafe right before the explosion. 
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen is following all of this from Berlin. He's joining us now.
 
Fred, what are we learning about this woman who has been -- who has just been detained? 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, her name is Daria Trepova. And right now this is an anti-terror investigation as far as the Russians are concerned. It was quite interesting because just a couple of hours ago the Russians put out a video of her apparently being interrogated by that anti-terror committee. And she was asked, look, do you know why you're here? And she said, yes, because I gave the figurine to Vladlen Tatarsky, who, of course, is that military blogger who was killed. 
 
She was then asked who she got that figurine from. And she said that she didn't want to say at that point in time. So, clearly, they are already confronting her with that, And we did see those photographs also on that video of her apparently going inside that cafe with that box. 
 
We also have an eyewitness testimony of someone who saw her give that to Vladlen Tatarsky. I want to read you with that eyewitness said. She said, quote, when she gifted him the figurine, she went to sit in a different place at the window, so obviously away from the stage where the explosion took place. The host at this stage took the figurine from the box and showcased it. Vladlen held it for a bit. They put it back. And shortly after the explosion happened. Now, that's sort of a rundown what happened then.
 
Her husband, Trepova's husband, he came out earlier today and he said he believes that she was framed, that she didn't know what was inside the figurine that she gifted to that military blogger. Obviously, you were already saying that the Russians are saying that the Ukrainians might be behind it. The Ukrainians are already denying that. They're also saying that they believe that she had contact with Alexei Navalny - with Navalny's organization. Of course, the opposition leader. That organization has also denied that as well, Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: So, then, Fred, what else are you learning about the military blogger who was killed?
 
PLEITGEN: So, I think -- I think one of the things to make clear to our viewers is I think military blogger is probably an understatement. On the face of it, that's what Vladlen Tatarsky was. He was very prominent in that sphere. He had more than 500,000 followers on Telegram. 
 
But these military bloggers essentially are supporters of the war in Ukraine. And one of the things that's interesting about them is that they embed quite frequently with Russian forces there. It's also something that Vladlen Tatarsky did as well. But they are also among the few people who are allowed to criticize the way that the war is being led. 
 
That doesn't mean they're against it. In fact, they are for it. But they want the Russians to be even tougher and be more brutal. That's one of the things that Vladlen Tatarsky also did. And one of the things that he notoriously did is when Russia announced the annexation of four territories in Ukraine, he essentially said that the Russians would kill anyone who stood in their way and would loot anyone that they wanted to as well. 
 <br>[09:45:12]
 
So certainly he was someone who was hated by the Ukrainians, definitely someone who was in favor of the war but also someone who criticized the way that the Russian military is doing it for the way -- for allegedly not being tough enough.
 
BOLDUAN: And knowing all that, I mean this happened in St. Petersburg. Are you hearing anything about how if and how his death is impacting others like him, other supporters of Russia's military operation and the invasion from within Russia? 
 
PLEITGEN: Yes, supporters. And when you mentioned supporters, I think it's important to point out that it's supporters like him, bloggers, but also people who, for instance, support the war in a more ideological way as well. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that this is the second time that a very prominent pro-war supporter has been assassinated. 
 
In August of last year, I was in Moscow when Darya Dugina, who's the daughter of Alexander Dugin, one of the main sort of ideologues who many say delivers the ideological foundation for Russia's war in Ukraine, she was assassinated on a street in Moscow and -- buy a car bomb. And now, for the second time, certainly this is something that will send chills down the spines of many of the prominent people who support Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: It's so interesting. 
 
Fred, thank you very much. 
 
And, John, there are a lot of questions still about what's happened here, but there's also a lot - there's -- this isn't the only news coming out of Russia right now. 
 
No, that's exactly right, Kate, because just in Russian state media is reporting that "Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich has filed an appeal to his arrest. Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison after being arrested there last week. He is the first U.S. journalist to be detained by Moscow on espionage charges since the Cold War. 
 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, to demand his release. Lavrov blamed Washington and the western press for politicizing the arrest and said the fate of Gershkovich would be determined by a Russian court. Secretary of State. Blinken also called for the release of Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16 year sentence for espionage, which, of course, Whelan and the U.S. disputes. Blinken and Lavrov have only spoken three times since Russia invaded Ukraine. Each of those calls focused on trying to free detained Americans.

BERMAN: So it was March that brought the madness, but April will bring a champion. UConn and San Diego state tip off for the NCAA national title in Houston tonight. 
 
CNN's Coy Wire is there.
 
Could you hear the excitement and the drama in my voice there, Coy?
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Let's go, JB. 
 
We have two incredible coaches tonight leading their teams against all odds in the most unlikely championship game in tournament history. Remember, this is the first time there wasn't a one, two, or three seed even in the Final Four. Five seed San Diego State, they're coming off an iconic March Madness moment. 
 
Lamont Butler, the game-winning buzzer beater, sending the Aztecs to their first ever title game. Coach Brian Dutcher building something special in San Diego. In 2020 his Aztecs were 30-2, could have been a one or two seed, but they never got to play, John, because the tournament was shut down due to Covid. But they are back.
 
Now, four seed UConn, they are conquerors. They're led by one of the most fiery leaders that you will meet. Coach Dan Hurley has them winning by an average of 20 points per game this tournament. I caught up, John, with both coaches in the locker room yesterday and found out both are superstitious. Coach Hurley has no shame over his lucky fire breathing dragon underroos (ph) and he told me there's no way he's changing anything now.
 
Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAN HURLEY, UCONN HUSKIES HEAD COACH: I would be a complete idiot if at this point, I mean, and I don't know if you know this, but it's been the same suit, it's been the same dress shirt. My guy Chris Mastrangelo has, you know, has hit the dry cleaner. You know, so it's the same socks. Obviously, the dragons have gotten the most attention. 
 
WIRE: Same shoes. How long you been wearing them?
 
BRIAN DUTCHER, SAN DIEGO STATE AZTECS HEAD COACH: They've been through two Gatorade baths, two cutting down of nets, three cutting down of nets. You know, regular season title. Conference tournament title. South regional title. Same shoes. And they're wet, but I'm still wearing them. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Both coaches are so fun, so motivational, John, it's easy to see why their players love them. March Madness has turned into amazing April. Can't wait to see this place rocking later tonight. 
 
BERMAN: Someone's going to win. Doesn't mean they'll smell nice, but they'll be national champions. 
 
Let me tell you something, Coy, this game is going to have a hard time living up to the women's title yesterday. The entire women's tournament had everything, except at the end, good officiating. 
 
WIRE: Yes, that was definitely a controversial talking point last night. You have LSU, led by Hall of Fame coach and players full of swagger outshined Iowa in historic fashion. Speaking of fashion, John, would you rock this outfit? Coach Kim Mulkey, that trendsetter and Tiger whisperer, leading with a palpable passion, taking Iowa and national player of the year Caitlan Clark. The generational talent was once again lights out, hitting threes from way downtown. They call her the next Steph Curry. Dropping a game high 30 points. She set a new record in this tournament for most points scored in any NCAA tourney. 
 
But LSU's total team effort, John, was too much. How about the buzzer beater three before the half? Unexpected hero Jasmine Carson coming off the bench to score a team high 22 points. She hadn't scored a single point in their three previous games. 
 <br>[09:55:02]
 
LSU scoring a championship game record 102 points. And their star sophomore, Angel Reese, she rallied with a record 34th double-double. Afterwards, though, she was trending on social media. Some did not like that she taunted Caitlin Clark. Reese addressed the social media hate after the game. 
 
Here's what she had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANGEL REESE, LSU TIGERS FORWARD: All year I was critique about who I was. Nobody -- I don't got -- the narrative. I don't fit the narrative. I don't fit in the box that you all want me to be in. I'm too hood. I'm too ghetto. Y'all told me that all year. 
 
But when other people do it, y'all say nothing. So, this was for the girls that look like me that's going - that's going to speak up on what they believe in. It's unapologetically you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Now Clark made the exact same, you can't see me hand gesture, John, during a game earlier in the tournament and many were saying that they loved it when she did it. Reese says there's a double standard. 
 
These women's games, though, John, have been unreal, shattering viewership records. Five and a half million people watched even the semifinal game, making it more watched than any NBA game that has been aired on ESPN this season. 
 
BERMAN: Coy Wire, it was wonderful, and I'm glad that Reese took the subject head on there because it's very important. 
 
All right, Coy, thank you very much. 
 
Kate.
