ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a day of breaking news in the Middle 
 
 East in Lebanon, more than 300 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in Israeli strikes on Hezbollah targets. We'll be live from Lebanon 
 
 and Israel this hour. 
 
Then a make or break moment for Ukraine, President Zelenskyy prepares to lay out his victory plan as Ukraine waits to hear whether it will get 
 
 ammunition and catered needs to face Russia this Winter. And new emojis are coming to your smartphone and it's -- well, it's an eclectic mix, we'll 
 
 take a look at some of our favorites.
 
But first tonight, breaking news. Mass evacuations are underway right now in southern Lebanon. Civilians desperately trying to escape the deadliest 
 
 Israeli airstrikes on Lebanese soil in nearly two decades.

SOARES:  Israel says it hit some 800 Hezbollah targets today alone in a dramatic escalation of the conflict. Lebanon's Health Ministry has just in 
 
 the last 30 seconds also told CNN that at least 320 people were killed including 21 children, more than 1,200 others are injured.    
 
Roads are jammed as people try to flee to safer ground, and Lebanon's Prime Minister is asking the world to intervene. He says Israel plans to destroy 
 
 towns and villages, accusing it of conducting, quote, "a war of extermination". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's 
 
 determined to change the security balance of the region. 
 
His words, he's calling this a war in a direct message to the Lebanese people. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL:  I have a message for the people of Lebanon. Israel's war is not with you, it's with Hezbollah. For 
 
 too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. It place rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage. Those rockets and 
 
 missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens. To defend our people against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out those 
 
 weapons. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  Hezbollah launched rockets into northern Israel in retaliation today, including the Haifa area. The Israeli cabinet has declared what it 
 
 calls a special situation nationwide, giving itself temporary and extraordinary powers. Well, as the situation threatens to spiral further.
 
The Pentagon says it will send a small number of U.S. military personnel to the Middle East to augment forces already in the region. Our Jeremy Diamond 
 
 has more on the fast-moving developments that are threatening to escalate into an even wider war.

JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Israeli airstrikes battering southern and eastern Lebanon.    
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
DIAMOND:  It is the most intense Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since the 2006 war, and the deadliest. Hundreds were killed and many more injured as 
 
 the Israeli military said, it targeted Hezbollah weapons depots and rocket launchers. Meanwhile, Hezbollah firing more than 200 rockets and drones 
 
 into northern Israel, aiming further south than usual.    
 
Israeli air defenses springing into action. As Israeli fighter jets carried out some 800 airstrikes today, the country's leaders say they are 
 
 deliberately escalating, hoping to change the equation. 
 
NETANYAHU (through translator):  I promised to change the security balance, the balance of power in this. This is exactly what we're doing. We're 
 
 dismantling thousands of rockets and missiles aimed at Israeli cities and citizens. 
 
DIAMOND:  Lebanese officials say this is simply Israeli aggression.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The continued Israeli aggression on Lebanon is a war of extermination in every sense of the word, and a 
 
 destructive plan aimed at destroying Lebanese villages and towns and eliminating green areas.
 <br>[14:05:00]
 
DIAMOND:  In Lebanon, Israel's new escalatory strategy is pushing thousands to flee their homes, as the Israeli military sent mass text messages, 
 
 including to some residents of the Lebanese capital and interrupted radio broadcasts, urging residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate. 
 
 In Lebanon's Beqaa Valley -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  This warning is focused on the villages in the Beqaa Valley.    
 
DIAMOND:  Residents were given just two hours notice before Israeli jets began hitting targets, including homes where the Israeli military says 
 
 Hezbollah is storing rockets and weapons as smoke engulfed swaths of Lebanon, many now fear this is just the beginning, as the prospect of all-
 
 out war now looms larger than ever. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, northern Israel. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SOARES:  Well, let's bring in our Nic Robertson in Jerusalem and Ben Wedeman is in Beirut this hour. And Ben, as we just played there for our 
 
 viewers, we heard Netanyahu -- Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel is at war with Hezbollah, not   the people of Lebanon. But in the last few 
 
 minutes, we've heard from Minister of Health in Lebanon saying 320 people killed, 1,200 injured in what has been the deadliest day for Lebanon so 
 
 far. Give us a sense of the very latest. 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, in fact, I spoke to the Minister of Health. He was in the operations room of the Health 
 
 Ministry. He said more than 320 dead and they are expecting the numbers to continue to rise with children and women among them. And certainly, this is 
 
 perhaps the most intense day of strikes going back many years in terms of death toll. 
 
I don't think we can reach one that high until unless you go back to June of 1982 for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. What we've seen is a series of 
 
 intense strikes starting just before dawn in south Lebanon, then moving to the Beqaa Valley to the east of here, and also they're hitting an area that 
 
 have never been struck before.  
 
And as a result of this, and as a result of the warnings broadcast by the Israelis by breaking into Lebanese radio stations and text messages, we've 
 
 seen this massive exodus. It's not an evacuation because that would suggest some sort of organization. This is a chaotic exodus of tens of thousands, 
 
 if not more people fleeing to the north. 
 
The roads are packed, apparently people have just pulled over to the side and given up, trying to reach any further north, because there are so many 
 
 people driving on both sides of the highway headed to Beirut. There are even reports of a woman giving birth in her car because she -- they could 
 
 not move any further. 
 
So, definitely, I think, you know, is this the brink of war or is this war itself? I think if you take the entirety of today's events in terms of the 
 
 number of Israeli airstrikes, Hezbollah strikes into Israel, the death toll, it certainly does amount to what I would say is the opening day of 
 
 what could be yet another war between Israel and Lebanon.
 
And I say Lebanon because this is not just with Hezbollah, many people here feel that Israelis in the process of the Gaza-fication of Lebanon. We are 
 
 seeing the same process they played out in Gaza, whereby intense airstrikes with huge death tolls, warnings for people to leave, basically to cleanse 
 
 the south of its population -- look, much like what we saw and are seeing now in Gaza itself.
 
That certainly, the fear is that this is a prelude to some sort of ground operation by Israeli forces. We've heard Israeli officials say time and 
 
 time again, they want to move Hezbollah's fighters north of the Litani River, which is about 25 kilometers north of   the border. How that's going 
 
 to be accomplished without massive destruction and a huge death toll is hard to imagine, Isa.    
 
SOARES:  Yes, indeed, stay with us, Ben. Let me go to Nic. And Nic, the Israeli cabinet I saw in the last hour or so and declared a special 
 
 situation nationwide. Just tell us what that means, what powers that gives the government and what you're hearing in terms of what Ben was talking 
 
 about. Is this the prelude to a ground operation potentially here?    
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Well, we heard from the IDF Chief of Staff, General Herzi Halevi, and he said that what's 
 
 happening right now -- and I read his words here, "we are striking targets, preparing for the next phase." Now, he's not saying what the next phase is. 
 
 But as Ben says, having Hezbollah retreat, pulled back to the north of the Litani River, 25 kilometers or even some people along the northern border 
 
 say 10 kilometers would be enough.
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
The IDF knows well that, that is not going to happen by airstrikes alone. Airstrikes are safe because they keep pilots safe. They're safe for the 
 
 forces. You put forces on the ground, and they're going to come up against Hezbollah fighters with anti-tank missiles. They're going to come up 
 
 against IEDs in the road, and the IDF knows this well, because it is in a permanent state of wrangle over the past year along the border, along that 
 
 border fence with Hezbollah fighters. 
 
So, the threat is there. Now, will the IDF put its troops in harm's way? I think at the moment, as Ben says, we are on a threshold, if not already in 
 
 a war, and that's something that Israel has shown it is willing to do in the past in terms of their sweeping potential security measures.
 
This gives the government the ability to add a moment's notice, tell the population not to gather in groups bigger than ten, not to -- outside, not 
 
 to gather in groups larger than 100, let's say inside, to stay close to their shelters, to stay in their shelters for long periods of time. It's 
 
 not done that at the moment. 
 
But what it -- the decision it has taken this evening gives it the power and authority to do that at a moment's notice. You don't have to recall the 
 
 cabinet, you don't have to go through any of those sorts of wrangling. It's done. So, if tonight, the threat level escalates over any city in the 
 
 country, the government can quite simply say, these are the new rules, no schools open, stay close to your shelters. 
 
This is what we advise for you. So, the government is really by virtue of doing this, putting the country on a footing to expect   more from 
 
 Hezbollah so far today. The IDF said there were a 210 missiles from Hezbollah into Lebanon -- into Israel today. That's a threat that they 
 
 clearly suspect will continue and could very well escalate.
 
SOARES:  Nic Robertson and our Ben Wedeman there, thank you very much. Indeed, a very dangerous situation that we're all seeing in the Middle East 
 
 right now. Appreciate it. I want to bring in now someone who has been dealing firsthand with the aftermath from the catastrophic explosions. 
 
MedGlobal is Lebanon's Country Director, Dr. Tania Baban. Doctor, welcome to the show. It has been as you heard our correspondents Ben Wedeman saying 
 
 there, a pretty deadly day, staggering numbers in the last few minutes. The Health Ministry has been telling our correspondent, 320 killed, 1,200 
 
 injured. 
 
We know includes women, we know includes children, we know includes medics. Can you just give us a sense of what you and your team have been seeing on 
 
 the ground, doctor?
 
TANIA BABAN, LEBANON COUNTRY DIRECTOR, MEDGLOBAL:  To be honest, Isa, this is not the deadliest only today, this has been going on for the past -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
BABAN:  Week with the beeper incidents that were happening in the -- in the civilian areas and what was happening the day after. And today, obviously, 
 
 with all the bombing that was happening in residential areas. We know that there's been a lot of civilian deaths. We know that there are thousands of 
 
 civilians that are fleeing the south. 
 
We know that the Minister of Education has opened multiple schools for shelters, so, we're expecting to do field visits tomorrow, but we're in the 
 
 process of planning an emergency response to distribute whatever basic needs the displaced population will need, including food kits, hygiene 
 
 kits, winterization kits with Winter on the doorstep. 
 
We're also obviously planning a massive distribution and procurement for medications and medical equipment to support the Ministry of Health, 
 
 distribute all of this to the frontline hospitals to be able to cater for the mass casualties that they are receiving, and that they probably will be 
 
 receiving in the next few days as well.    
 
SOARES:  Yes, and as we heard -- you know, the doctor, the Health Ministry called the numbers earlier today unprecedented, we're now 320. Just speak 
 
 to the kind of pressure this puts on the healthcare system.
 
BABAN:  This puts an immense pressure on the healthcare system that has already been slowly collapsing over the last few years -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
BABAN:  Since 2019. Let me remind you that Lebanon has been going through a series of crisis since then, and that this war did not start yesterday, did 
 
 not start last week. It has been ongoing for 11 months now. So, even though the Ministry of Health has been doing an amazing job gearing up and 
 
 preparing the hospitals, training staff, training designated hospitals for mass casualties. 
 
We do have maybe the skills of doctors, but we do lack the resources due to the fact that there's been an inflation, their local currency -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
BABAN:  Has lost its power, and we are trying to get as many resources as possible to be able to cater to the needs. 
 <br>[14:15:00]
 
And that was Dr. Firass(ph) call out to the international stakeholders including all our NGOs and local NGOs to be able to stockpile and provide 
 
 whatever they can to support the healthcare system. 
 
SOARES:  Yes, expand on that, doctor, because I know that MedGlobal works - - and you can correct me, I believe it works  with the Health Ministry of Health in Lebanon, right? So, where are you seeing the biggest challenges 
 
 and the needs right now?  
 
BABAN:  Well, the number one challenge, first of all, is organization and synchronized dispatching. We saw this chaotic kind of displaying into that 
 
 2020 with the Beirut port blast when we had no kind of organized dispatching of ambulances where hospitals were being flooded with patients 
 
 and patients had to drive more than three or four hours out of the capital to seek medical attention. 
 
So, what we did this year, because of anticipating the possibility of this happening, MedGlobal partnered with the Ministry of Health and we set up 
 
 and purchased the -- what we're calling the command and control center where they were able to  dispatch 2,800 ambulances on Tuesday alone when 
 
 the beeper explosions happened. 
 
So, this is kind of aligning the work to help the Ministry of Health organize its dispatches and patient referrals. Now, the second most 
 
 important thing is to provide these hospitals with the trauma kits, the medications, antibiotic, whatever medications needed for operations 
 
 including anesthesia for them to be able to keep going, and to sustain themselves while these mass casualties are flooding in.
 
SOARES:  And very quickly -- you, I'm not sure whether you heard doctor, our correspondent Ben Wedeman, not talking about displacement. He talked 
 
 about an exodus. And as you were talking, we saw those -- that video of people leaving southern parts of the country. Just speak to those, a sense 
 
 of where they go and where is the support for them? 
 
BABAN:  So, we know that some people have family and friends who are hosting them, but we also know like I mentioned that a lot of schools have 
 
 been closed down to be open as shelters. I mean, I saw videos of people being trapped on the highway between shelling and traffic, and not being 
 
 able to get anywhere. 
 
So, we have already communicated with schools to have a field visit tomorrow because we already know they're still coming in and they're 
 
 trapped in traffic. So, we're waiting for all of them to come in to start an immediate response as of tomorrow and support with the basic needs. 
 
 These are patients who probably have chronic medications -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
BABAN:  Like the Minister said, some of them are on dialysis, some of them are in chemotherapy, they've left their homes, they've left everything, so 
 
 we need to move as quickly as possible to improve quality of life and to prevent any morbidity or mortality.     
 
SOARES:  Yes, Dr. Tania Baban, really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us, doctor, I know how busy you must be. Thank you very much, 
 
 appreciate it. And later in the show, I'll bring you an interview with European Union's Foreign Affairs chief Josep Borrell, who joined me from 
 
 the United Nations General Assembly. Have a listen to what he said. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOSEP BORRELL, HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR EUROPEAN UNION FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS &amp; SECURITY POLICY:  We have to reach peace in the Middle East, otherwise, the 
 
 whole region will be in a permanent instability that will be sending shockwaves that will affect all of us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  We'll have more of that interview and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the U.S. for a key visit. Right now, we'll tell 
 
 you about the comment he made about a critical period for the war effort against Russia. That is next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
SOARES:  Everyone. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the United States right now where he's expected to present his plan to defeat Russia 
 
 to President Joe Biden. On Sunday, in a social media post before arriving, President Zelenskyy said he believes this Fall will determine the future of 
 
 the war. 
 
Once he landed, the Ukrainian President visited an ammunition factory in Pennsylvania, you can see there, which produces ammunitions Ukraine is 
 
 using against Russia. And on Wednesday, he's scheduled to be in New York where he will speak at the U.N. General Assembly.
 
Joining us now from New York is the Foreign Minister of Estonia, Margus Tsahkna. Minister, great to see you again. Welcome back. Let me just give 
 
 our viewers and yourself a heads-up. We are expecting to hear from the IDF spokesperson. So, if I have to interrupt, apologies in advance. 
 
But let's focus on the war in Ukraine and leave the Middle East to one side for the time being. We are expecting to hear from President Zelenskyy where 
 
 he's going to outline this plan, this victory plan. Do you have a sense, Foreign Minister, what that would look like?  
 
MARGUS TSAHKNA, FOREIGN MINISTER, ESTONIA:  Indeed, President Zelenskyy will introduce this plan to President Biden, and later on, we will hear as 
 
 well, but I think there cannot be anything like extraordinary. You know, Ukraine needs the military support from allies, needs to take down all the 
 
 restrictions of using the weapons, long-range.
 
And I have been very clear as an Estonian Foreign Minister that Ukraine has all the rights to use the weapons, what we give them, also in territory of 
 
 Russia, to date, down the threats and also the targets from there. But also, the international support for the peace plan. Though the peace plan -
 
 - 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
TSAHKNA:  Can be made only following the President Zelenskyy ten points peace plan. And for Estonia, it's important for the territorial integrity. 
 
 So, military support, and also investments do their defense industry, I think it's more important.
 
SOARES:  And I suspect, Foreign Minister, that much of the discussion that will probably be had in New York will center around -- and you hinted at 
 
 that just now, those long-range western supplied missiles like the ATACMS, and whether they can be fired in -- deep into Russian territory. 
 
Why do you think -- and I know Estonia's position, you have made it very clear on this, on the show, but why do you think the U.S. has been so 
 
 hesitant, Foreign Minister to allow Ukraine to fire these into Russia because it's almost a year now since President Biden made a decision to 
 
 supply those ATACMS in the first place?     
 
TSAHKNA:  Yes, I'm sure that I do hope that President Biden will make a decision to take down all these restrictions. But the main reason for that, 
 
 not only for U.S., but some other countries as well, is appear about escalation. But we have been living there in the neighboring country of 
 
 Russia, and we've been witnessing as well more than two years that Putin is using this fear of escalation, he's threatening us, but actually nothing 
 
 more awful will happen. 
 
So, I think that is a reason is that the fear of escalation is keeping back this decisions, but I can assure that I don't believe that  there will be 
 
 more escalation that is already -- these are escalation. It's a full-scale war. And Ukraine is not able to fight without this permission to target 
 
 this major object in Russia.
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
SOARES:  So, I wonder, Foreign Minister, whether -- why you think this new plan, this victory plan would work where others have failed, and where 
 
 though we're likely to see more incursions like the ones we saw in Kursk. Do you think that was effective?     
 
TSAHKNA:  Yes, I think that this military operation in Kursk was effective as well, Ukraine has the right to bring the war to Russian territory to 
 
 protect yourself. And also it gave us in Ukraine, but also as a community internationally, the hope and belief that Ukraine can fight because half 
 
 year ago, it was already the feeling that maybe, you know, we are having a situation as during the first World War, but nothing will happen, but there 
 
 can be a change.     
 
But the only thing, what Ukraine needs is our support, no limitations and our commitment on military level. But also today, we discussed with the G7 
 
 and other countries, how can we support Ukraine preparing for the Winter as energy system investment? So, we need to support Ukraine on all different 
 
 levels. But the first most important thing is to let them fight because they're fighting for us as well.     
 
SOARES:  Yes, and I remember President Zelenskyy is saying it feels like he's currently fighting, has been fighting with a one arm held behind his 
 
 back. Let me leave the Ukraine war for just a second, and focus what the developments, the escalating developments I think it's fair to say in the 
 
 Middle East.
 
It's incredibly dangerous timing. Israel has been pounding targets deep into northern Lebanon, Hezbollah is firing back into northern Israel. Just 
 
 your assessment of where we are right now, how worried you are at this juncture, Foreign Minister. 
 
TSAHKNA:  We are worried and we are concerned, and all these different conflicts, they are connected, which are taking place globally as well. The 
 
 aggression -- the Russian aggression in Ukraine and also Gaza, though we have called both sides to ceasefire. And we have witnessed already the real 
 
 humanitarian catastrophe, the innocent people are dying. 
 
Of course, Israel has a right to protect itself against the terrorist organization as Hamas is, but the case is that we support a two-state 
 
 solution, but it needs as well to create this procedure and the process that two parts, two states that will sit down and start to negotiate. But 
 
 we don't see unfortunately that. Though, the escalation, even more escalation in the region is really dangerous.     
 
SOARES:  It is indeed. Foreign Minister, as always, wonderful to have you on the show, thank you very much, sir. And you make sure -- you're very 
 
 welcome. Do make sure you join us for the show all this week in fact, we've got top names, diplomatic names, I should say, joining us all week from the 
 
 United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
 
On the show tomorrow, Roberta Metsola; the President of the European Parliament, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius  Landsbergis, as you 
 
 won't want to miss that lineup. Still to come, and the newly-elected Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is expected to speak at the United 
 
 Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. 
 
An American citizen who spent eight years wrongfully detained in Iran, sat down with our Christiane Amanpour, and it's a world exclusive in his first 
 
 TV interview since his release. Siamak Namazi described the physical as well as psychological torture he suffered while prisoner in Tehran's 
 
 notoriously brutal Evin Prison. Here's an extract of that interview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SIAMAK NAMAZI, RELEASED AFTER 8 YEARS IN IRANIAN PRISON:  I assumed that because I'm a hostage and I have values, they will not harm me. 
 
 Unfortunately, that assumption was proven wrong. 
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  What did they do?
 
NAMAZI:  You know, I've got to tell you that the physical part of what they do isn't -- you know, it sounds like they're pulling your nail, but you're 
 
 blindfolded and unfortunately, the thugs are as bad as the job as everyone else in that lockman(ph) system. 
 
I believe they don't mean to harm you as much as they do, but they don't understand simple things like when you toss a person who's blindfolded, I 
 
 don't know that's a wall in front of me and I'm going to go face first into it, or I don't know there's a staircase and I'm going to go rolling down. 
 
 So I -- 
 
AMANPOUR:  Did that happen?     
 
NAMAZI:  I did, yes, both of those things happened. There were -- that part still you could endure, but not day after day after day, non-stop. There 
 
 was a lot of humiliation that I'm not comfortable talking about. And I mean, adorable, because it   had a profound effect on me. It's just -- I 
 
 still haven't even gotten to talking about it fully in therapy.
 
It's just -- they'll humiliate you, and they always do this while you're blindfolded. You know, they -- it's that -- they're that cowardly, the guy 
 
 beating you up won't even -- I saw my interrogators, but the thugs were of a different -- of a different nature. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  And you can watch that interview in full at 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time here on CNN. I'm going to take a short break, we'll see you on the other 
 
 side.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  With just over six weeks to go before the election, the U.S. presidential race, well, is staying tight. National 
 
 polls have gone up a bit for Kamala Harris since her debate with Donald Trump, but there is still no clear leader. The results in a few states will 
 
 likely be the deciding factor for who makes it to the White House.
 
The latest New York Times/Siena College poll shows numbers from three key swing states, as you can see there, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. 
 
 It's got Trump ahead in Arizona, as you can see, and no clear leader in North Carolina and Georgia. The Harris campaign hopes to win in the upper 
 
 Midwest battleground states, but sees winning in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina as a backup plan.
 
For more on the latest on the polls, the upcoming election, as well as the final weeks of the race, I want to bring in CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who joins us 
 
 from Washington, D.C. Jeff, great to see you. So, it looks like no clear lead in the race, though President Trump is leading in those three states, 
 
 in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Just talk us through those numbers. And what is resonating with voters, you think?
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Look, it certainly is true that there is no clear leader in this race overall. I 
 
 mean, I think three truer words have not been spoken about this presidential campaign. And it looks like it will be that way for the next 
 
 six weeks, unless something dramatically changes.
 
Six weeks from tomorrow is election day. Early voting is already underway in some states. It will be increasingly underway week by week. But when you 
 
 look at those polls combined with some others, it shows strengths and weaknesses for these candidates. But one overall takeaway here, on the plus 
 
 side, if you will, for Vice President Kamala Harris, her favorability ratings have increased dramatically over the summer, since she has become 
 
 the party's nominee. That is something that's really propelling her.
 
So, she is doing better in some of those northern states here in the U.S., if you will. Wisconsin, Michigan, in Pennsylvania, she is neck and neck 
 
 with the former president, but is, you know, certainly improved her standing.
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
But in those Sun Belt states, if you were, as we're seeing right there, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, that, you know, very, very close, but she 
 
 is struggling a bit. So, what do we make of all these? What is driving this campaign? The economy is still a central issue and voters have said they 
 
 want to learn more about her economic plans.
 
When you talk to long time analysts and strategists on both sides, Vice President Harris still has more room for growth because people are still 
 
 sort of assessing her and seeing if they view her as a change. Donald Trump, people largely know, of course, he's been on the scene for so long, 
 
 been inside the -- you know, the -- at the forefront of politics for about a decade, he may not have as much room to grow. But this is going to be a 
 
 race on the inches in about six or seven battleground states.
 
SOARES:  Yes, and in terms of room to grow that you're mentioning there, Jeff. I mean, Vice President Kamala Harris, I believe, has said has agreed 
 
 to debate Donald Trump on CNN. It seems that President Trump is refusing, right? But we're only 43 days now to go into the election. So, what can 
 
 move the needle? What events from now until Election Day may influence those undecided voters?
 
ZELENY:  Look, it's always a possibility that some external event could happen that impacts the race that we're not thinking about. I mean, 
 
 certainly a tragedy in some respects. But we -- as of now, assuming there is not any large external event, this is going to be decided by the sliver 
 
 of people who are not either undecided or can be persuaded. That's how I sort of like to think about these voters.
 
When I spent a lot of time out in the country talking to voters, it's not undecided as much, but they can still be persuaded. Some are persuaded on 
 
 the issue of abortion rights. Some are persuaded on the issue of change overall. So, you are going to see these two candidates continue to drive 
 
 their respective messages.
 
But one thing that is different from any previous campaign is the fact that abortion rights is different than four years ago. When the Supreme Court 
 
 overturned Roe vs. Wade, this is the first presidential election where that is an issue. We've seen the impact in the midterm elections. So, that is 
 
 something the Harris campaign believes will play to its benefit here.
 
But for all of the millions and millions spent in advertising, it's remarkable that it is as close as it is. So, the ground game, organization 
 
 efforts that all makes a difference as well. So, buckle up for a very close six weeks.
 
SOARES:  My goodness.
 
ZELENY:  And then after that, we should also say, we don't know how long it will take to count the votes, but we can, of course, get into that at 
 
 another time.
 
SOARES:  Edge of your seat stuff. Fascinating. Thanks very much, Jeff. Always great to see you. Jeff Zeleny there.
 
ZELENY:  You bet.
 
SOARES:  Now, a Florida federal judge has ordered Ryan Routh to remain in jail after prosecutors presented new evidence. Routh is the suspect in this 
 
 month's assassination attempt of Donald Trump at his Florida golf course.
 
Prosecutors say he wrote a letter detailing his plans. In one passage, Routh said, quote, "This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but 
 
 I failed you." Well, the evidence was collected from a box that the suspect apparently delivered to a witness, and a fingerprint on tape used to attach 
 
 a rifle scope collected from the scene.
 
Our Randi Kaye is in West Palm Beach, Florida, and joins us. So, Randi, prosecutors revealing a lot of pretty chilling, I think it's fair to say, 
 
 details. Give us a sense of what has been happening in this hearing.
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this was a three-hour hearing. So, certainly, longer than expected, as the prosecutors made their case as to 
 
 why they believe Ryan Routh is a danger to society and why he's also a flight risk. So, one of the things they mentioned was this letter that you 
 
 just touched on saying that this was an assassination attempt right there, saying that he also said in that letter, I tried my best. I gave it all the 
 
 gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job.
 
And then he went on to offer $150,000 to anyone who can complete that job. So, they entered that as part of their evidence. They also said that the 
 
 agent who actually encountered Routh allegedly at the scene said that the defendant was in a position that provided a, quote, "clear line of fire to 
 
 the sixth hole putting green."
 
Now, remember, the former president, Donald Trump was on the fifth hole putting green at the time. They say that was just about 12 or 15 minutes 
 
 away from that six-hole putting green. They also offered new information found at the scene, the scope of the gun. There was that scope that had 
 
 been attached to the rifle that was found in this case. And on that scope was some electrical tape. They say that a preliminary report shows that 
 
 there was a fingerprint that does match Ryan Routh on that electrical tape.
 
And also, the two bags found at the scene, which had these metal or steel plates inside them, they say that they were being used to stop any small 
 
 arms fire. They were tested and that they showed that they could stop small arms fire, which should have -- would have shown that he was prepared.
 
So, all of this evidence, the judge took into account and said that, yes, Ryan Routh should remain behind bars and detained as this case moves 
 
 forward back to you. Back to you.
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
SOARES:  Yes. And I know that you'll stay across this for us. Thanks very much. Randi Kaye there. Appreciate it. And still to come tonight, the 
 
 European Union's foreign policy chief has a stark warning over the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East. My interview with Josep Borrell, 
 
 that's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOARES:  I'm returning now to our top story this hour in the Middle East, tittering on the brink of all-out war, as long-standing tensions between 
 
 Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah escalate. Lebanon has suffered its deadliest day since the 2006 war, following extensive airstrikes by Israel 
 
 on what it claims are Hezbollah targets. At least 356 people have been killed and more than 1,200 wounded. That is according to Lebanon's health 
 
 ministry.
 
The IDF is urging Lebanese civilians around 30 kilometers east of Beirut in the Beqaa Valley to evacuate, you can see that, as it prepares to hit more 
 
 Hezbollah targets. Scenes like this show really heavy traffic in Southern Lebanon as thousands of people flee their homes and head north. But Israeli 
 
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is at war with Hezbollah, not the people of Lebanon.
 
Well, earlier I spoke with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, and I 
 
 started by asking him about his take on Israel's strategy in targeting Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOSEP BORRELL, EUROPEAN UNION FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF:  We have to repeat that, yes, Hezbollah has been attacking Israel, 100,000 people has had to 
 
 move. But the answer has to be proportionated. A war is a war, but the war has already rules. And it's clear that there is a continuous increase on 
 
 the number of attacks. Some of them using ways which are explicitly condemned and rejected and not authorized by the Geneva Conventions.
 
That, as I said, the number of civilian casualties is very high. I think it's unacceptable. And Hezbollah is also doing his part, continuing 
 
 attacking and responding Israeli territory. Maybe as far as the war in Gaza will continue, the whole region will be in fire. Look what's happening in 
 
 the Red Sea, what's happening in the Lebanese border, and what's happening in the West Bank. We are not talking enough about what's happening in the 
 
 West Bank.
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
For me, it's the greater risk for the situation in Israel, in Palestine. We don't talk about what what's going on in there. We are much -- certainly, 
 
 very much focusing attention on the Lebanon because it was much more evident only in the number of casualties. As I said, it's increasingly 
 
 unacceptable. But the same thing happens in a less spectacular manner in the West Bank.
 
SOARES:  Now, that you brought up the West Bank, let me ask you this, sir. I saw, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, one comment that you made that 
 
 you said you fear that the West Bank could become another Gaza. Could you just explain to our viewers just really your fears here from some of what 
 
 we have seen in the past few weeks in the West Bank in terms of the escalating tensions and the violence?
 
BORRELL:  What I said in Cairo, in the ministerial meeting of the Arab League, is that the West Bank can become a second Gaza and Gaza can become 
 
 a second West Bank. Because the plans for -- by some settlers of re- colonizing Gaza would create there the same problem like in the West Bank. The illegal colonization, the illegal occupation of the land, the illegal 
 
 pushing out the Palestinian people.
 
I'm saying illegal because I'm here at the United Nations General Assembly and there are United Nations resolutions about it and there are rulings of 
 
 the International Court of Justice very clearly stating the illegality of this occupation. And what I'm saying is going to become a second Gaza is 
 
 because a number of casualties, a number of buildings being destroyed increases.
 
It's always because they are fighting against terrorism. And certainly, they have the right to fight against terrorism. But it cannot be an excuse 
 
 for destroying civilians' buildings and killing civilians, and occupying land. And it's clear that this government, which is calling openly Judea 
 
 and Samaria to the West Bank is in a strategy of little by little grasping land, expanding occupation, incorporating land, and with the final purpose 
 
 of fully annexation of this illegally occupied territory, colonized territory.
 
SOARES:  And be it West Bank, be it Lebanon, at the heart of this, Mr. Borrell, of course, is the war in Gaza. And despite all the powers urging 
 
 for -- and calling for a ceasefire, it seems we're further away. You were in the region just last week. Do you believe there's still a path to a 
 
 ceasefire?
 
BORRELL:  I want to believe it, because everything has to start with a ceasefire that allows the release of the hostages, which is still remaining 
 
 in captivity. And to open the border to humanitarian support and letting the support to be distributed. It wasn't a Rafah border. Closed border. And 
 
 one thing is to be told, and another thing is to see 1,500 trucks queuing, trying to enter.
 
A lot of items being rejected by futile reasons, as this is sleeping bag, it's green. No, green doesn't go, doesn't fit. That's an example. And it's 
 
 clear that on the other side of the border there are 2 million people starving. So, we continue asking for ceasefire knowing that both sides seem 
 
 to procrastinate, looking for reasons and excuses, but not to reach an agreement.
 
We have to reach peace in the Middle East. Otherwise, the whole region will be in a permanent instability that will be sending shockwaves that will 
 
 affect all of us.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES:  Josep Borrell speaking to me earlier. We're going to take a short break. We'll see you on the other side.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
SOARES:  Now, to Kazakhstan, where a space capsule has landed safely this morning after docking from the International Space Station earlier Monday. 
 
 The Soyuz spacecraft was carrying a NASA astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts, including Oleg Kononenko, who has the all-time record for days 
 
 spent in space, at a whopping 1,111 of five missions. Fantastic.
 
And at last, an emoji really representing how many of us, including myself, feel at the end of the day or even at the start of the day. This face with 
 
 bags under its eyes is one of eight new emojis coming to our smartphones next year. Unicode Consortium approved the latest emoji lineup, which is 
 
 the nonprofit organization overseeing global emoji standards and new releases.
 
The exhausted emoji face was crowned the most anticipated emoji in the world. Emoji Awards explains really why. Receiving more than 60 percent of 
 
 the vote. The purple splatter, pictured, if we can bring it back, in the top right corner, where -- we can bring it back to you, came second place, 
 
 and third place is the shovel that we showed you earlier.
 
Let's bring in Clare Duffy with more live from New York. I mean, look, the exhausted face, I think, we speak -- bags speaks to so many of us, not just 
 
 at the end of the day, Clare, but at the beginning of the week. Just talk us through these emojis and why those are needed.
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  Yes, I know I will be getting good use out of that exhausted face emoji, Isa. Look, I do think it's kind of 
 
 interesting the back story about where new emojis -- how new emojis are created and end up on our devices. You have this nonprofit, the Unicode 
 
 Consortium, that every year takes in suggestions and new concepts for emojis, and then, once a year, puts out this list of emojis that it 
 
 recommends that they get adopted across our devices.
 
And then, once this list comes out, the operating services, the IOS and Androids of the world, can make some tweaks on these designs before we'll 
 
 ultimately see them show up in our phones. And it is interesting because these emojis do actually have a lot of impact on our communication. One 
 
 sort of interesting nugget from this year's editions is that tree without leaves, the creator of that emoji concept, said it was designed to talk 
 
 about climate change and about drought.
 
So, while a lot of these things seem kind of goofy, there is actually a deeper meaning there and it will influence, potentially, the way that 
 
 people talk about and communicate online about these subjects with these eight new emoji additions.
 
The Unicode Consortium has now approved a total of 3,790 emojis for use across devices. So, sort of an important service, sort of silly story, but 
 
 an important service that this nonprofit is facilitating for everybody.
 
SOARES:  I would love to be around that table and having a discussion of what is considered, what is not considered, and why at this stage. Do we 
 
 know whether -- and I wonder if they've got this data claims in terms of cross generations, from millennials, from Gen Z, baby boomers, how they are 
 
 used?
 
DUFFY:  Well, I think that's sort of an interesting thing. You have the emoji consortium -- the Unicorn Consortium putting out this list, and they 
 
 have an idea maybe of how people are going to use these things or what's going to be important. But as we know, often when these things get in the 
 
 hands of consumers, of users, they end up using these things in different ways.
 
I mean, I think the laughing, crying face emoji is a good example. That was really popular among millennials. And then Gen Z said, this is cringe. We 
 
 don't want to use this one anymore. So, it's always interesting to see, you know, they can have an idea of what these things mean. You know, the tree 
 
 without leaves, will people really use it to talk about climate change? I'm not sure.
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
But it will be interesting to see once consumers get their hands on these new emojis, what they'll actually end up meaning in terms of the internet 
 
 lingo.
 
SOARES:  Yes, I'm looking forward to seeing. I was also reading up, then emoji is almost never literal. But I always use in the literal sense. So, 
 
 I'm confused. Appreciate it. Clare, thank you very much indeed.
 
DUFFY:  Thank you.
 
SOARES:  Now, imagine being a celebrity at nine months old. Imagine that. Meet, well, this guy. Pesto the penguin. He's become somewhat of a 
 
 superstar recently, taking social media by storm. He is already bigger than both of his parents and gets fed over 30 fish a day. That's twice as many 
 
 as the average penguin. Soon, he'll begin swimming lessons with his dad and lose those adorable feathers. He's quite the character.
 
And finally, we want to introduce you to a really tenacious cat who's clearly used up a few of his nine lives. Meet Rayne Beau. He got lost 
 
 during a June trip to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. But somehow, this two-year-old Siamese cat made it back home. And that's a thousand 
 
 miles away in California. An animal rescue group says Rayne Beau's microchip helped get him back to his family. His owners said they prayed 
 
 he'd be found and Rayne Beau's family includes his sister, Star. Some nice stories to end the day for you after what has been a pretty volatile few 
 
 weeks in news.
 
Thanks very much for watching. Do stay right here. Newsroom with Jim Sciutto is up next. I'll see you tomorrow.
