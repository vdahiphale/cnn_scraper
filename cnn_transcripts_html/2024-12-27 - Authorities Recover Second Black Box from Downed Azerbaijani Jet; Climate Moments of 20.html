Good morning, everyone. I'm Danny Freeman, in for Kasie hunt. It is wonderful to have you with us this morning. 
 
And we begin with new details about that passenger jet that crashed in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day, killing at least 38 people. Authorities recovering a second black box, hoping it will provide more answers about exactly what led to that fatal disaster. Earlier this week, a U.S. official telling CNN early indications suggest a Russian anti- aircraft system may have downed the plane, adding that it may have been a case of mistaken identity in which poorly trained Russian units have fired negligently against Ukraine's use of drones. 
 
But officials in the region are urging not to speculate about the crash until investigators have wrapped up. 
 
CNN's Bianna Golodryga has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST (voice-over):  As investigators race to determine the cause of the deadly Azerbaijan airlines plane crash, early indications suggest that a Russian anti- aircraft system may be responsible, a U.S. official told CNN. The aircraft was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian republic of Chechnya when it attempted an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. The crash occurred shortly after Ukraine fired drones nearby at southern Russia, possibly leading Russia's defense systems to inadvertently strike the aircraft, the official said. 
 
Video from on board the flight shows panicked passengers praying and holes visible in the body of the aircraft. The source of the apparent damage has not been confirmed. The airline and Russia's federal air transport agency initially told local media the aircraft crashed after it collided with a flock of birds, an account disputed by Ukrainian counter disinformation official Andriy Kovalenko. 
 
Russian state media also reported that the plane had been rerouted due to heavy fog around Chechnya's capital. Several investigations have been opened, including one by a joint commission involving representatives from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia. 
 
ILHAM ALIYEV, AZERBAIJAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, the causes and all the details of the accident and to inform both me and the people of Azerbaijan. 
 
GOLODRYGA:  The Kremlin expressed condolences for those impacted by the crash and urged against speculation into the cause until the investigations have concluded. 
 
Of the 67 people on board, 29 survived, including two children, authorities said. 
 
In Azerbaijan, a day of mourning was declared for the dead. Some relatives of the survivors remain on edge, waiting for news on loved ones recovery. 
 
FIZULI JALILOV, FATHER OF SURVIVOR NIZAMI JALILOV (through translator):  I don't know what to say, honestly. I spoke with my son today. Thank God his condition is good. If everything goes well today and tomorrow, he will come to Baku. Let's see what happens next. 
 
GOLODRYGA:  For many families of the at least 38 people killed in the crash, answers can't come soon enough.

FREEMAN:  Just incredible. Now, joining me to discuss all of this further, CNN global affairs
 
 analyst Kim Dozier. 
 
Kim, thank you so much for getting up to help us through this, this morning. 
 
Tell me big picture here. What would be the significance if it actually does turn out that Russia had something to do with this plane crash? 
 
KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, the problem is a new Trump administration is about to come in. And this is just when Moscow is trying to make a good impression and portray itself as a victim of NATO aggression, carrying out a war of necessity against Ukraine as opposed to invading Ukraine back in 2022 and originally in 2014. 
 <br>[05:05:11]
 
And it makes it look to the world irresponsible and out of control of its own defense systems. That's one of the reasons that airlines like El Al, the Israeli airline, have decided not to fly flights into Moscow or the Grozny area until they get to the bottom of what caused this crash. 
 
FREEMAN:  Kim, I want you to listen to what Congressman Ryan Zinke had to say about this whole incident. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. RYAN ZINKE (R-MT):  This is not the first commercial aircraft that, if the reports are true, that Russia did down it. If the reports are true, it's not the first one they did. So again, it's a -- it's a sitting molding pie -- a melting pot without an answer unless we have clear -- clearly defined objectives. What's our plan? You know, my position is I don't think Ukraine is ready for NATO. They'd have to do a massive political reform that they're not willing to do. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN:  A couple of things that stand out from there, including not the first one they did potentially. Just what's your reaction to the congressman's statement there? 
 
DOZIER:  Well, Zinke is referring to the shootdown of the Malaysian Flight 17 in 2014 by Russian forces over Ukrainian territory, which Russia still hasn't admitted to. But The Hague has prosecuted, or at least passed sentences against several Russian irregulars for that shootdown. So it looks like it's happening again. 
 
And Congressman Zinke also represents part of the Republican Party shared by incoming national security advisor, Mike Waltz, and also, Marco Rubio, who has been nominated to be secretary of state, who are very hawkish on Russia and think that Russia needs to be reined in, pulled back, taught a lesson, and they're going to point to something like this as showing Russia's out of control, but they'll be fighting other parts of the party who will also be vying for Donald Trump's ear, who believe that Russia has been menaced by NATO and is within its rights to carry out these kind of activities to protect places like Grozny, which was apparently undergoing a Ukrainian drone attack at the time that the Azeri flight was turned away from landing. 
 
FREEMAN:  Kim, can you paint a picture here of what this potentially says? If this is found out to be a product of a Russian mistake, basically, what does this mean about Russia's standing in the world right now? You know, were in a position where it seems like Russia really wants to try and project strength in these hours of the Ukraine war. But like you noted, there's a new Trump administration coming in. But this -- this would be a big embarrassment. No?
 
DOZIER:  Well, I mean, Moscow has a number of different options. It can lay claim to the accident and blame it on Ukrainian aggression over its territory. Or it could simply blame it on Ukrainian actors somehow saying that they somehow caused the shootdown, or it could deny it altogether. 
 
Russia has a seat on one of the main investigation -- investigation bodies into the crash. So, you know, they can put a finger on the scale and raise enough doubt. That's what they did with the Malaysian Flight 17, never claiming responsibility for it, but putting out so many different versions of what could have happened that it simply left the public confused, with no blame to cast anywhere in particular, except for western countries that are already in the anti- Russian camp. 
 
FREEMAN:  All right, all right. That's the standard playbook, it seems, for the Russian pr front on the world stage. 
 
Kim, thank you so much, as always, for breaking it down for us. Really appreciate it this morning. 
 
DOZIER:  Thanks, Danny. 
 
FREEMAN:  And coming up straight ahead on CNN THIS MORNING, from the path of totality to disastrous wildfires and back to back devastating hurricanes, we're going to take a look back at 2020 for biggest climate and weather stories.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:14:25] FREEMAN:  This year was full of climate records, including the most tornadoes occurring in a year and the hottest year on record. 
 
CNN's Bill Weir shares the top ten moments in weather and climate of 2024. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  At number ten, a rare moment of national unity and wonder.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.
 
WEIR:  Thanks to the celestial dance of sun and moon. April's eclipse stretched from Texas to Maine, putting over 30 million Americans in the path of totality. We won't see another one over the U.S. until 2044.
 <br>[05:15:03]
 
At number nine, this year's hajj fell in June, drawing millions of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca just as thermometers hit 125 degrees. And the Saudi kingdom reported over 1,300 heat-related deaths.
 
At number eight, wildfire nationwide. While July's Park Fire was the fifth biggest in California history, Texas saw their biggest ever with the million acre Smokehouse Creek blaze. And in the northeast, the worst drought in decades led to over 500 wildfires just in New Jersey.
 
At number seven, and fueled by record high ocean temps, Hurricane Beryl roared to category five strength in July. The earliest storm to ever hit the top of the scale. While it hit Texas as a weaker cat one, millions lost power around Houston, and it took nearly two sweltering weeks to get the air conditioning back on.
 
At number six, tornadoes, and lots of them, the most in a decade. Of the two dozen billion-dollar disasters this year, over half included twisters. And while Oklahoma saw two monster EF-4s, climate change is shifting tornado alley from the Great Plains to the southeast.
 
At number five, earths overheating atmosphere is like a giant sponge in the sky, soaking up more water, wringing it out with a vengeance, and causing the National Weather Service to issue an unprecedented 91 flash flood emergencies this year.
 
And at number four, the deadliest rain fell in Spain, where in late October a year's worth fell in hours around Valencia. The surge broke riverbanks, turned streets into raging rapids and took over 200 lives.
 
At number three, the devastating duo of Helene and Milton. Back to back hurricanes that began with a 15-foot surge in Florida's big bend, but got worse in the mountains of Appalachia. Up to 30 inches of rain around Asheville, North Carolina, brought horrific flooding, while spun up tornadoes helped make Helene the deadliest since Katrina. And then came Milton, just two weeks later, jumping from a tropical storm to a category five in 24 hours, Milton is just the latest example of rapid intensification in the age of climate change. But at number two, we have the rise of climate denial. 
 
After promising fossil fuel executives deregulation, Donald Trump retakes power with a promise to hamstring the nations clean energy momentum and pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord for a second, and possibly final time. The American election cast a pall over Cop 29 in Azerbaijan, where petrol states that agreed to transition away from fossil fuel at Cop 28 transition back to praising oil.
 
And at number one, the heat driving so much of this destruction.
 
Eight years ago in Paris, the world agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but this year topped it. It was over 100 degrees in Phoenix for 113 consecutive days, shattering the record by 37 days. So, first responders now carry body bags and ice. And the city has embraced a policy of shade, signs that humanity will have to adapt because 2024 could be the coolest year of the rest of our lives.

FREEMAN:  Remarkable. 
 
Coming up on CNN THIS MORNING: The bird flu virus killing almost two dozen big cats at an animal sanctuary. Now, the facility is trying to figure out just how the outbreak started in the first place. 
 
Plus, severe storms in the south threatening to disrupt holiday travel across the United States. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:23:25]
 
FREEMAN:  It is just about 23 minutes past the hour. And here is your morning roundup. 
 
Twenty big cats now dead after a bird flu outbreak at a wildlife sanctuary in Washington state. That's more than half the center's population. The facility says the deaths started around thanksgiving, but it's still unclear just how these cats contracted the disease. So sad there. 
 
And are you feeling lucky? Well, tonight, the mega millions jackpot hits an estimated 1.15 billion with a B dollars. If the price is won tonight, it would be the fifth largest prize in the game's history. The biggest prize was won last year at more than $1.6 billion. 
 
And right now, a line of powerful storms are battering the south with heavy rain and power outages, including in southeastern Texas, where officials say three tornadoes you see right there touched down. This twister was spotted just south of Houston on Thursday. The governor has issued a state of emergency.
 
And the storms are already starting to cause some hiccups at the airport during what's expected to be one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. 
 
Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is tracking it all for us. 
 
Good morning, Elisa. 
 
Yeah, this is pretty gnarly, especially for the end of a holiday week. 
 
ELISA RAFFA, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  In December, right? This is an image that were more used to seeing in the spring. Just incredible picturesque tornadoes yesterday in Texas that did disrupt travel at the Dallas airports. We had some flash flooding there that caused some ground stops, you know, at the time. 
 
I mean, these are look at the reports. You can see the string of tornadoes for parts of east Texas. These are the reports that will need to be sifted through to get confirmation and see how strong they were, another string of them through Louisiana this morning. 
 
We still have that line of storms, not quite as strong as it was yesterday. 
 <br>[05:25:03]
 
We don't have any watches in effect right now, but we could find those storms reigniting as we go through the day today. The risk today is a little bit lower, but we're more concerned about tomorrow. You can see it's a level three out of five enhanced risk of severe weather across the South. 
 
That's where we'll have to worry about not only the risk for damaging winds and large hail, but the possibility of some strong tornadoes, EF-2 or greater across parts of eastern Louisiana and Mississippi. So, something to watch incredibly closely. 
 
Those storms fire up going into tomorrow. And then look at how all that rain spreads east going into Saturday and Sunday. That could cause some problems at the airports along the east coast. So for today, again, probably some problems possible along the Deep South. The Pacific Northwest is still a problem, as well as that atmospheric river just continues -- Danny.
 
FREEMAN:  Elisa Raffa, thank you so much for that. Again, trying to avoid travel. Maybe this Saturday. Thanks. 
 
All right. Coming up after the break from after dark explorations to vintage voyages, we'll take a look at booking.com's 2025 travel predictions. 
 
Plus, make America screech again? One DOGE leader's read on Bayside High School, leading to Republican infighting. Take a look.
